Nick Huber welcome to the show man good to have you Greg thanks for having me we've uh I feel like we've been friends for almost two years now and getting closer by the day and we rarely talk in person it's almost all texting I know I know I don't think have we ever even like chatted I don't think so I think this is the first time I've heard your voice except like listening to your listening to your pod and stuff yeah this is weird this is super weird but I'm happy we can make it happen and you know I really wanted to bring you on the show to talk real estate because I'm more and more interested in real estate uh the stock market is painful and although you know a lot of people are saying real estate is uh a scary place to be uh in 2023 I just wanted to bring you on because I think a lot of people have these questions and you're the real estate guy you're the Self Storage guy so I thought let's hear it from the horse's mouth I won't sit here and tell you that it's easy being a real estate investor right now I was talking to my mentor Chris Powers about a month ago and I was just I got on the phone with him and I was just complaining and I was saying man it's tough out there the bankers are paying the butt the investors are paying the butt the deals aren't any good like our the sellers want too much money you know the Market's not doing great and I was just complaining and complaining and eventually he said Nick stop he's like you don't understand like this is how real estate works like why do you think we make so much money when times are good it's because we'll go three four five seven years when things are really freaking hard and nobody has fun in real estate so he's like Nick so stop complaining nobody's having fun nobody is having fun in real estate right now it is not easy to make money anymore and it's hard and that's part of it and we just gotta keep our businesses going keep our head down focus on operations um and keep working so that when things turn around there'll be half as many competitors as there are right now because Over The Last Five Years everybody who has bought assets no matter how well how good of a job they do managing them has made money and everybody thinks of real estate as a passive investment and it is if you just stroke checks into deals as a GP or as an LP which means a limited partner Silent Partner but if you're a GP like me and you're actually buying real estate and trying to make it more valuable and running it and answering the phones and collecting money from tenants it's a business it is a small business there's people there's management there's hiring there's firing there's problem solving and so the people who are best at business um win and that's something that a lot of people don't understand about real estate so real estate's like I mean it's a multi-trillion dollar asset class it's a it's a really big space it's like saying Tech right there's consumer there's social there's marketplaces there's B2B you focus on self storage um which is a niche how do you recommend to people to think about which Niche to focus on and and why are you excited about self storage in real estate you look around I mean are you sitting in Miami right now Greg yep yeah if you're if you're in Miami within five mile radius of where you are right now there are probably 400 000 businesses real estate businesses operating just one building renting renting space to retail renting space for storage units renting space for multi-family condos all these different asset classes um and if you zoom out across the whole United States there's millions of buildings millions of buildings and all it takes is one building to change your life so when I thought about okay you know here are my goals in life I want to have free time I want to make money I want to have you know have it all right I want to have it all I want to except maybe like people to know who I am which kind of happened through Twitter anyway but if I want to succeed in life for me that meant not having to answer to anybody and having Financial Freedom like what are the odds what is what game can I play where the odds are the best that I can do that and I can accomplish that it's either go start a business and try to raise money or look at this business self storage or real estate in general where a lot of people can win at real estate a lot of people can win so it's all about odds and picking you know who you're competing with and I looked at the Real Estate Investors out there we're not that smart we don't do anything special many of them don't even know how to use email and a lot of them are wealthy all it takes is to be the top 75 percentile of Real Estate Investors to make a lot of money and why Self Storage like how did you get into it and yeah why yeah so I picked self storage because I was running a moving and storage company out of college called storage Squad we did pick up and delivery student storage and I was able to leverage that into about a 1.5 million dollar bank loan on our first Self Storage development so uh the big pull for me into Self Storage was that I looked around at the storage businesses operating and I didn't think they did a great job I thought that I could come in and I know I didn't need to beat them I know I didn't need to take everything and it wasn't a you know two companies battling and the winner is going to take all like a tech you know like a like a race in Tech in one in one area in one Niche it was hey these companies that run self storage facilities they kind of operate like it's 1980. they got somebody sitting in there in an office you know many of them don't take online payments credit cards they take cash they take check um not that efficient not that good of technology to help people rent units and if I can do this I can probably carve out a piece of the pie for myself and so that's what we did and now we've kind of you know innovated as much as possible with hey we're going to come in get rid of that manager that's on the ground in an office renting units and replacing with one manager on the phone who can rent units at several different locations so what we have now is 61 self storage facilities none of them have an office none of them have a full-time staffed manager on site and we have 50 employees spread really all over the world 20 of them in the Philippines 10 of them Colombia and you know several all around the United States that kind of run the business of renting units and operating the Self Storage business so basically we found an opportunity to use a little bit of technology that already existed we didn't build software we didn't try to reinvent the wheel there was some technology that already existed and we realized that we could just come in and carve out a piece of the pie so I feel like that's a little bit of a framework for thinking about which Niche you should go into in in real estate so I think you've said before if there's a fax machine like chances are there's an opportunity yeah I mean you find a business that makes a lot of money and has a fax machine and the odds are competing with them will be a little bit easier than competing with the Stanford grads you know the VC backed firms the smartest people that you know right there must be a lot of other opportunities you know boomers are going to be giving you know hundreds of billions of dollars of wealth to Millennials soon you know the America runs on small business a lot of those are Mom and Pop shops a lot of those probably have fax machines I know you've talked a lot about uh boring businesses before what opportunities do you see in in boring businesses uh right now yeah I think you kind of think about who are the wealthiest people in the world and they're on one level you know those are the Elon musks and the mark zuckerbergs and Steve Jobs if you look at it on who are the wealthiest people in my town who are the people that are at the nice restaurants right now in Miami who are the people that are at the nice restaurants right now in Athens who are the ones that have the nicest houses who are the ones that are in the country clubs who are the ones that have money like who are the people that have money so they can do what they want to do and if you walk to my country club in Athens and I went around and I just asked everybody what they did I think the answers there'd be doctors there'd be lawyers of course and then there would be entrepreneurs there would be people who they didn't go raise money they didn't go raise Venture Capital somebody either them or somebody in their family a lot of old money in country clubs as well but somewhere somewhere along the line at some point somebody started a small business and you'd ask them if they were entrepreneurs and you talk about you know raising money and they'd look at you like what are you even talking about like all I did was hey I had I had a couple resources had an opportunity to start this HVAC company I hired two guys next thing I know 10 years later we wake up we got you know 30 Crews and I got a business worth 30 million dollars Pest Control you know one of my good friends at the club is a pest control guy just he's got seven Crews and he sits around and plays golf all day and makes 800 Grand a year on and on and on and on down the list of businesses that most people would say why would I ever do that it's a race to the bottom those Services you know you're competing with a guy in a truck when in reality they can be really good opportunities to start your wealth snowball and people also forget about the momentum that is involved in entrepreneurship very rarely do you have these people who the Evan Spiegel's who go from zero to billions of dollars in wealth on their first shot when they're 25 years old the more likely story is you know several businesses over 10 or 20 years learning a ton and just more and more opportunities come up as as you get better at business so my story is no different we started hauling boxes with cargo vans and 10 years later we're buying you know millions of dollars worth of Self Storage do you know the uh the story of Roland's like I recently heard about their story do you know no tell me Rollins is a company that was started in the 1800s I think they do about two or three billion dollars a year in Revenue 2.4 billion in Revenue they got 16 000 employees it's the largest conglomerate Pest Control this has happened to me like you have like you know I lived in New York and all of a sudden you come home and there's mice or rats or whatever in your place like you will pay anything to get them out of your house right as fast as possible you call up a mom and pop shop you know maybe nine times out of ten that is a mom Pop shop but maybe one times out of ten it's this role in this company and Roland started off funny enough in the owning car dealerships they own car dealerships and then they bought a couple local radio stations I think they must have seen that pest control companies were advertising on these radio stations so they said to themselves hey let's go start buying up some of these pest control companies yeah you know fast forward to today I had heard about them on CNBC I was watching CNBC and one of the newscaster says like the number one recession stock you know this is in financial advice but the number one recession stock is rolands because people if they've got rats in their house they're not trying to save money what do you think about that business I don't know about you but my parents like my dad back in 80s when he first got married and he bought a house he did everything in his house he didn't call contractors to mow's lawn he didn't call people to fix his sink he didn't call people to remodel his kitchen they just did it like they spent a ton of time they learned how to do it and they did it I don't know anything about anything so when I have a problem in my house I call my dad right so what are my kids gonna do when they have a problem they need to kill a mouse like my dad would have never called a pest control company to kill a mouse but I have a pest control company that comes here to my house every single month and I pay him 30 a month and I'm never gonna not own a house that I don't pay a pest control company to do that stuff it's just like the shift of specialization in the economy people getting more focused on time and people Outsourcing everything else I don't have the initial stat of this but I have the 2018 stat so back in 1990 10 of people paid to have their lawn cut like pay for somebody else to come and cut their lawn in 2018 44 of people paid to have their long cut do you think Greg that that number is going to go up or down in the future it's going up yeah man we're Outsourcing everything we're paying other people to do stuff around our house now these are not sexy businesses they're not fun to tell you go back home to your uh family reunion or you know for Christmas and you tell your grandma hey I'm going to start a I'm starting a new business and she'll be like oh well what did you invent like what's your new idea uh no Mom I'm just gonna kill bugs you know nobody's excited about that nobody's uh thinks you're gonna make really good money um people aren't going after that for the ego stroke that you get of being an entrepreneur and walking around in sweatpants with a backpack on and you know that's not the cool thing to do so the really smart people are not flocking to Pest Control they're not flocking to self storage they're not flocking to building decks or power washing or any of these little things around the house that more and more people are spending really good money to get done I think back in the day you had to like you had your dad fix things because he had to probably like there was no there wasn't Google there wasn't like YouTube there wasn't you know Yelp in a directory of places that he can call and he just had to figure it out himself you know I remember learning how to drive standard standard cards and like I've basically got into this car brought my phone like went on YouTube and like was basically watching how to drive standard while I'm driving standard a ridiculous way to learn how to do something but I just had so much help like when was the last time you stopped you know because you didn't know where you're going you put something in Google Maps yeah and I think that's just made us as like a softer generation yeah I mean the fact that we can get anything in the whole world delivered to our front door in two days on Amazon the fact that we can have you know sit down and stream any video in the world in 10 seconds you know totally I mean last Thursday I went to volunteer at feeding it's called feeding South Florida it's a sort of a food shelter for families that need food basically and I went to a warehouse and I went and inspected a bunch of canned goods to make sure that they weren't expired I you know sorted it put them in boxes I went to my girlfriend and friend after we did it all together and we spent an afternoon doing it it was it was three hours and I was like such a headache like I can barely breathe I don't know why and they were like yeah we have headaches and it's because like none of us at all are used to like you know hard physical labor and that wasn't even hard physical labor it was literally sorting cans of Campbell Soup um but just like being in the warehouse fumes everywhere I think you're you're right when it's like were kind of soft our generation is kind of soft everybody everybody wants to get rich nobody wants to for me it was carrying 70 pound boxes up spiral staircases for 20 hours straight for college students that's how I started everybody wants to be ripped and sit on the beach and have that feeling of having a good ripped body nobody wants to wake up at 5am and when you're not motivated and do the actual workout to get rich or to get ripped it's like everybody thinks you gotta you can just fast forward entrepreneurship and make a ton of money when in reality you got to do a bunch of not fun things and you got to be willing to suffer and you gotta not really make decisions with your emotions you got to think logically about maybe a best opportunity that you can go after and if you talk to a lot of people who you know maybe they didn't have the network they didn't have really wealthy parents they didn't have that Head Start they just got started by doing not fun stuff they're sorting Campbell's Soup bottles in a warehouse for you know it wasn't six hours it was it was weeks and months what would you do if you know you started with under a hundred thousand dollars liquid net assets and you wanted to make seven figures next year what would you do I don't know I think it's it's all about kind of walking around and and like how to scope business ideas for me and everybody that I know as an entrepreneur thinks about this the same way like when we go to restaurants the first thing that we think about is like is this restaurant making money and you're counting heads in the restaurant and you're thinking about how their business might work how much how much rent a month do they pay for this building you know how many employees do they have in here what are the net costs on this dish that I ordered how profitable might this restaurant be then you walk by this little bitty Boutique and antique shop in downtown Athens and nobody's there and you've never seen anybody there and you're like how the heck does this business make money you know what's their rent how do they make money every entrepreneur that I know kind of walks around life just thinking in a a more intricate way about how business Works how does this business work and when you start to walk around your town and you watch the lawn care companies you watch the pest control companies show up you watch the garbage companies show up you watch you see all of a sudden all the you know five or six different power washing companies just in a little small town like Athens and you start to see how they work and you start to Google how would I find this company how do they make money um it becomes pretty evident where an opportunity might be for you in your town if you just kind of think critically about that stuff do you do the same thing Greg do you walk around life and just kind of think about how business might work everywhere you interact I actually do it more like on the internet like my version of walking around is like quote unquote teleporting to different Facebook groups or Reddit subreddits and seeing like what are different niches that are underserved that are growing really really quickly right now and then looking at these Facebook groups or subreddits and being like what are these people asking for and then how do I build products to solve their needs yeah yeah my story was I was in I was at Cornell in Ithaca New York and we were watching this company called Big Red Storage just make an absolute killing during finals week I'm talking we did some basic math and found out that they were doing like 450 000 a year of Revenue and we watched how they did their business and they showed up and they had scales they had they like had physical scale so they were weighing every box and building receipts they spent like 45 minutes with every customer building a receipt of of the weight of everything and billing the customer there was no way to sign up online they weren't taking last second customers so all we did was see that they're like okay here's a company that makes a ton of money and they're not accepting customers last second and they're weighing everything and their operations their Logistics are are terrible so we're like let's just throw up a website and see if we can get some customers and two weeks later after a lot of sweat we had five grand in cash sitting on our bed because we went around and picked up all the stuff and did the work and then you fast forward five years later we had a business that was doing 2.5 million a year in sales and making 500 Grand a year in profit and we had half a million bucks after tax in the bank to go build a self storage facility from the ground up fast forward five years later we have 61 self storage facilities and we've acquired over 75 million dollars for the storage so it's like those little steps of like hey I just I was walking around my life looking at how this one storage company made money in this in my town and there was there was that opportunity there was that little opportunity how important is looking at other businesses and trying to emulate them in some capacity you know I think well the next three weeks involved us studying all 20 companies in the country that did pick up and delivery student storage and there was one company in Bloomington Indiana called guys and dollies and they did it really well they gave away free boxes they had like pick up hubs where you could bring your stuff to a truck that was parked there for certain hours during the day they were really efficient and we basically modeled half of our business off them we found another company in Boston that had a really good way of like handing out those free boxes and like marketing and having their their sign up form was perfect their customer service was way better we modeled half of our business off that again it's not it's not like I have to be the best company in the world to win in this and what we're talking about it's I just have to be good enough to get a piece of the pie and if I can get a piece of the pie then I can improve and I can improve and I can improve and some awesome opportunities will come so yeah we absolutely had very little Innovation we just built a Frankenstein business by taking bits and pieces of other companies putting them together into our business and then before we knew it we were one of the best and the biggest should you start a cash flow business first and then buy real estate or should you get into real estate somehow um because it is expensive right I think most of the gurus that you look at online will say you got to start with real estate you got a wholesale deal so you got to find investors you got to go out and start with real estate buy that one Fix and Flip and fix it and flip it whatever you got to do and my advice is if you don't have a network that you can raise money from meaning like you are a private school kid and your dad is an entrepreneur and your grandpa's an entrepreneur and all the people you know are entrepreneurs that you can go out or even not entrepreneurs but doctors lawyers people you can go raise money from if that person I would say go ahead and get in real estate and go find that deal and raise money and get the help because you're in a great situation no shame in that but if you're just a kid from the Midwest whose mom was a school nurse and dad was a construction manager and you got maybe they have a hundred thousand dollar net worth and you don't have any money absolutely forget about real estate stop getting obsessed with real estate and go start a company or work for a company and find a way to make a ton of money period absolutely and then once you have money then it's like okay what's my real estate thesis what you know how do I think about my portfolio do I get into uh commercial residential real estate is a really good wealth multiplier it is a way to like roll your wealth snowball if you have a wealth snowball rolling down a hill real estate is an amazing way to like make that snowball bigger and keep it rolling but if you're starting with nothing and you're trying to get get somewhere and build wealth I don't personally think that real estate's the best way so I would agree with you like wait till you have some money then think about how to put that money to work because in real estate you have to have cash the person with the cash calls the shots and luckily when I did my very first deal at a half a million bucks on my own cash so I had a little bit of Leverage we didn't have any one investor that just took over and named the terms the bank you know we didn't have to go get a co-signer for our first loan on our first bank we would have owned very very little of the upside if we had zero cash bring into the deal Sweat Equity means almost nothing in real estate in my opinion the people with the cash call the shots what advice do you have to someone like me frankly so I'm a Founder I've got a team of about 40 people you know I'm busy doing that I'm interested in real estate but I also don't wanna I don't want it to hurt my main my main business you know how should someone like me think about real estate it's just like I consider well two parts number one is I would focus on continuing to make money the way that you're best at making money which is your agency let's assume you know you're doing 10 plus million a year in Revenue multiple Millions a year ebitda there's no reason for you to take the eye off the ball because of some sexy opportunity in real estate where you're not the best at that right I have 300 people on my on our investor Capital stack that have invested passively in our deals I'm what's called a syndicator I'm the GP I put 10 of the cash needed for a deal in or a little less or a little more and then I raise money from a bunch of people we put the deal together and that's my business that's how I'm in business all 300 of those people very few of them are full-time real estate professionals actually I don't know any of them that are they're all just getting real estate exposure by investing now the second part of that is to do it you really need to understand real estate it's just like having a CPA you have a CPA that gives you really good advice but unless you know a little bit about the tax code you're probably going to miss some stuff probably not going to pick a good CPA probably not going to figure out what big overwhelm overarching strategies you want to implement so understanding leverage understanding value add understanding that operating income understanding the risk of debt and cash flow and how all that works together it's really critical because there's a lot of folks that are not that went under in 2008 that lost a lot of other people's money and if this keeps up and interest rates stay high for another couple years it'll be no different this time and a lot of people who do what I do and raise money from outside investors will go bankrupt and the people who invested the money will lose the money what do you like better if you know if you can invest in a trailer park or a parking lot which one do you like better the good thing about a parking lot is it's a it's a more operationally intense business and the more operationally intense businesses like the old manual car washes you know some of these businesses that really they're not necessarily you know passive as passive and you can't necessarily find third party management as easily if you buy a self storage facility you can pay CubeSmart 13 of your revenue and they'll do everything they'll just send you checks right parking lot who's going to find a manager parking lot it's a little bit sweatier the returns are probably a little bit better hasn't been institutionalized it hasn't been rolled up by private Equity um but mobile home parks are an asset class where you can roll them up you can scale you can scale management you can manage them at scale and you can build a bigger portfolio and there's appetite right now from private Equity to buy big chunks of mobile home parks I don't know about parking lots so basically my plan is I'm gonna go do the work in Self Storage to buy one-off deals here and there a million dollar deal here a two million dollar deal there will stumble upon a 10 million dollar deal and I'm going to go around and do the work to accumulate a big portfolio and when you have a bigger portfolio you have less risk you have economies of scale and you have appetite from from new buyers new people new money with cheaper cost of capital bigger players come in and by tranches of bigger assets so the values go up when that happens and you know that's our long-term place like build something where we're acquiring assets at small scale but we're combining them and it gets more valuable as you as you do that so one part of your strategy is modernizing basically some of these self storage facilities the other part it seems like is buying these storage facilities in you know secondary tertiary markets right like you're not buying self storage in in Manhattan or Miami Beach or whatever right correct yeah so you know this is not easy you might think oh Nick's just buying self storage facilities I'm competing with 50 other groups just like me 50 other groups are out there trying to find self storage to buy and when you're in investor board rooms and you're trying to raise money and you're trying to get financing for deals the first thing investors are going to ask is you know when can we buy storage in Austin Texas or Atlanta Georgia or Miami because those areas are growing they're growing nuts I want to own property there so there's a lot of people who do exactly what I do trying to buy deals there and obviously that runs the price up demand for those assets is a little bit higher and cash flow year one is almost non-existent or sometimes impossible to find in those markets for guys like me without the cheap cost of capital I'm not raising a giant fund I'm not borrowing it two and a half percent so we found our way to find your one cash flow and going some other areas where other investors aren't necessarily as excited about a lot of people ask me Greg how do you build products that Foster Community well I've got good news that's exactly what late checkout does my company we partner with the largest brands in the world and fast-paced startups to design products that resonate with your community we add a couple interesting clients every single year so if you're interested and that sounds like you email front desk at laycheckout.studio with what you're working on what you need help with and don't forget to mention the where it happens pod thank you [Music] tell me a deal where tell me a deal that went horribly like what is your worst deal and what's your best deal well um you got to talk about why real estate sucks right now we haven't had a deal and and none of the properties that we've acquired so far I'm worried about losing the building so I gotta say I'm lucky and none of our deals have been horrible right we have a deal in Springfield Illinois it's one of the bigger markets that we bought it's about 250 000 people it's right in the middle of town um we're missing performa on that deal um we projected seven and a half eight percent return and we're about five to six percent return year one on that deal when the interest rates went up starting in November of last year the home the the homes that sold started to decrease like people weren't moving people were hiring local movers and people stopped buying homes and this month compared to last December we're like we're like 30 of the amount of you know homes transacting so that's a big driver of how many people rent storage units so not only is our debt getting more expensive our debts getting more expensive our debts getting more expensive asset values are dropping that's exactly what's the what the FED wanted to happen because when you borrow more expensive you can afford to pay less money for the same amount of yield the same amount of profit so our the value of our buildings are dropping or all buildings are dropping and less people are renting storage units so operations are under pressure as well we moved in at one of our big portfolios we moved in 140 tenants last November and this November we've moved in 45 tenants right so occupancy's dropping and luckily um we didn't put a ton of Leverage on many of these deals we're pretty lean we don't have full-time overhead of staff so we're still cash flow positive everywhere but yeah I can very easily see how somebody paid money thinking that because from 2020 to 2021 we were able to drive revenues 25 I'm talking like if I if a storage facility that I was going to buy was doing 20 grand a month in 2020 I knew that if I bought in 2021 I could do almost 30 grand a month like I could literally go almost 50 up on revenue or even 25 25 000 a month that's huge for net operating income and earnings and and thus the value of the property that has now changed like we under right now that we're revenue is going to stay the same year one so if you bought a deal thinking you were gonna drive Revenue by 25 to make your numbers work that's how deals that's how deals Fall Apart and I mean the difference between real estate and you know stock equities like is that you know if the stock market goes down what people say to do is dollar cost average right just put in a little bit every week or every month and you know over the long time a long period of time you'll be okay with real estate if you want to get into real estate you can't really do that like you only have like if you you have to be very smart about when you're purchasing your building your product if it's your first building that you're buying should someone buy it in 2023 or is it too uncertain so there's just so much real estate in the world look there's 50 000 self storage facilities some of them are going to be really good deals it all depends on how how much you pay for one like there's a hundred thousand buildings within five miles of where you are in Miami um some of them will trade at really good deals where the people who bought them are going to make a lot of money we haven't acquired very much storage in the second half of 2022 because overall as a market seller expectations are still too high and I don't think it's wise to deploy a lot of capital into real estate but we just bought a deal and closed it on the 15th of December for 1.65 million and it's a really good deal I think in a couple years it might be worth three million dollars you know so it's really hard to say it's really hard to say it all depends on there's deals what you're saying what you're saying is basically like no matter if it's a bull market or a bear Market bull market will have deals bear Market will have deals you just have to be like a hawk basically and you have to do your research and you have to have a thesis and you have to be probably not afraid to walk away from deals yep yep and you got to do the work you gotta stay in the game you can't get frustrated and all upset like when I was talking to my mentor and I was like we just need to go pencils down and like stop everything and he's like no no no no no that's not how you make money in real estate over the long run you have to keep working you have to keep underwriting you have to keep talking to sellers you have to keep talking to brokers and eventually it'll open back up I love it okay I want to switch gears a little bit and talk about the sweaty startup Empire the ecosystem of sweaty startup you know when I look at you I see you as a a Creator in the space like you've got a few hundred thousand Twitter followers you've gotten you know an amazing podcast you've got an email list you've got a community you've got courses how do you think about yourself as a Creator and do you think of yourself as a creator I do and and I think when I started and I think to be successful I think you would agree with this when when I started all of this I had no plans of making money or you know having a ton of opportunities come from it I literally just recorded myself and broadcasted it into ether tried to find ways that I could grow and eventually started to catch on and the whole thesis as you know is hey you can think about entrepreneurship a different way you can think about entrepreneurship and the fact that you don't need to necessarily go raise money you can just do little simple things over time not sexy things you're going to make decisions with logic you're going to try to choose your competition you're going to use some core fundamental strategies to think about entrepreneurship and even if you're a person who works at a company like think about management think about value out of that company in a similar way the podcast started to grow Twitter I started to grow you started on Reddit basically right like you start you started on the entrepreneurship entrepreneurship subreddit yep I got really lucky in that they allowed links on there for a little while and they put up with me for about a year and a half of promoting uh the sweaty startup and so I would write I would write really good copy I would write something about entrepreneurship all the the techies would hammer down and hate on me and all the small business junkies would engage and love it and it was just a uh you know a time where a lot of folks were pissed off that I was writing on Reddit but it was the only place that I could find a bunch of entrepreneurs that I could know of I Didn't Know entrepreneurs another thing about entrepreneurship it's really lonely I can't just in my town go around and find and see all the entrepreneurs they're busy they're working they're secretive whatever it might be it's pretty lonely business in general so um eventually a guy named Moses Kagan found me on on Reddit and said Nick you know you're getting into real estate you really should go on Twitter that's where the deals happen you got to go on Twitter and I was like ah Moses like social media is a waste of time like I just want people to listen to my podcasts and do my own business whatever he called me back about six months later and this is a guy that has over 200 million dollars worth of real estate he took the time to call me back again say Nick I'm serious get on Twitter you're right I can tell you right really well like you're going to grow there and I got on Twitter and I wrote my first thread and I put the profit and loss statement of a self storage facility just got radically open like it's it's you see more of it now but back in 2020 you didn't see entrepreneurs like opening the books up and telling everybody how much money they made or how much money they lost or exactly how they did business so I got on there posted a real estate deal a thread and Moses quote tweeted he had like five or three to five thousand followers at the time he's like hey Nick's here you got to follow him he's a friend of mine and boom I got my first thousand followers and you fast forward a year later I've had I had that one really big thread where I met you guys but we'll talk about that talk about that because that was like legendary yeah I I have a blessing and that I can I can I'm a prolific content creator not all of it's good as you know you probably disagree with a ton of stuff I write so many people disagree with a lot of it and that's fine it makes me smarter I love it when people challenge me on Twitter but I can write a ton of content especially when I get in a zone so I got in a Zone one Sunday and I wrote for like four hours just business principles life principles things I agreed with things I just disagreed with and it ended up being the first major thread of mine that got you know got me 30 000 followers over the course of a couple days yeah I remember I had a thread once that got 60 000 likes and you sent me a message and you said I was it was just like 20 minutes after I had posted it I had like 2 000 likes and you were like Greg a viral post can change your life your life is going to be changed and I didn't really understand what you meant by it um but you know I got 70 000 followers in 24 hours from that post and it did change my life you think about the opportunity that comes along with 250 000 followers and a unique Niche especially like real estate I've started businesses and advised on them we can touch on re cost like if you want I've raised money from Twitter I've met people like you from Twitter started businesses with people um that I've met on Twitter and it absolutely changed my life so like yeah you can be on Twitter and you can [ __ ] post and you can waste time and you can talk about fantasy football and politics or you can get on Twitter and get pretty serious about a certain niche and it can just be a side effect of that that you can find Opportunities to make a ton of money which has been a blessing for me my takeaways from your story of like how you you know became quote-unquote famous is number one you started in Reddit and if you can make it on Reddit you can make it anywhere it's kind of like Manhattan it's like New York City right if you can make it in New York you can make it anywhere if you can create content that really connects with people on that platform it really really forces you to be an incredible writer because people don't have time for like people go down on you on on Reddit you know stuff right people are meaningful especially to the capitalists and the entrepreneurs right yeah that's definitely one takeaway is like if you want to like sharpen your skills like Reddit is a great place to do that uh the second thing is don't write cookie cutter stuff so figure you know in your Niche right so in your Niche you pick self storage and real estate look at look at what everyone else is doing and don't do that right like push it a little bit have a unique voice and like you did right you you put out your numbers when people weren't putting out their numbers you wrote stories when people weren't writing stories on Twitter I think you're forgetting the most important part and like the number one reason why most people have a ton of followers on Twitter is because they're actually doing something interesting and uncomfortable and hard in their real life everybody wants to be a con an influencer on Twitter everybody wants to have a bunch of followers nobody's willing to actually start a business and raise a bunch of money of other people's capital and go out and buy a bunch of property and like do that scary hard work of building an actual business in real life so I don't know I mean sahil came to Twitter and did something incredible he built a brand off of writing alone I mean he he had a badass private Equity background and we know he's brilliant and we know he's going to build an Empire but he came in not necessarily talking about his own experiences but like breaking down the framework to just be a badass human I think that is so incredibly rare and so incredibly hard and I would never want to compete with sahil to try to make it on Twitter I couldn't I'm not as dedicated I'm not as smart I'm not as good of a copywriter as Sawhill but I was doing something interesting in real life I was buying a bunch of storage I was building real estate private Equity company I had sold the company those things are what really allow you to grow a big following and if you can do it in a way that you know you follow the badass people the movers the Shakers the deal makers the investors the entrepreneurs start following you and and latching on to you because they like the way that you think you can make a ton of money whereas the [ __ ] posters that have three to five hundred thousand followers on Twitter struggle to make five or ten Grand a month sometimes what would your business look like if you never had an audience if I didn't have Twitter we would probably own about 10 self storage facilities right now instead of 61. my net worth would be about 10 of what it is right now I would not have invested and advised on re costig which I think is going to be the one of the biggest businesses that I'll have done you know if we look back 10 years from now and we'd probably still be running our Moving and Storage Company because we would have to keep that cash flow coming in to feed ourselves because the real estate you know we just wouldn't have been able to find investors and we'd be struggling to find deals and yeah man I'd be 10 years behind or 20 years behind my career of where it is now what's what's re Cossack and and why do you think it's going to be big so with real estate comes an army of folks in the background who help real estate transact you have attorneys to buy 75 million dollars worth of real estate over the past 18 months we've had four full-time attorney salaries we've had title companies that we've paid hundreds of thousands of fees we've had closing attorneys we've had property insurance agents we've had all these different people that do services so that we can transact real estate that's another lesson Is that transacting real estate is super super expensive you can sell Apple stock with a click of a button if I wanted to sell a couple properties it would take me six months and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees and expenses one of the things that you do when you buy a piece of property is you got to figure out the depreciation schedule with the IRS and all the real estate costing companies out there were just they were slow they had to actually visit my properties it didn't make any sense so my CPA and the smartest dude I know is Mitchell Baldridge him and his wife on a firm CPA I don't know if you've spoken to them either but he is done he turned out he had done almost a thousand call sex for his clients as a CPA in-house and it was a pretty simple pitch for him to actually start a cost segregation firm the basis behind it is you need a you need an engineer to break down your building and tell you how fast you can depreciate certain aspects of a piece of property anybody who buys a piece of property over a half million bucks is going to get a cost segregation study done so they have a depreciation schedule to show to the IRS and to offset taxes that way our firm simply does remote visits and we do it at a really affordable price and we turn them around really quick and we're 20 employees deep now and you're in 150 Grand a month of cost effect it's crazy I love it because it's number one it's a it's a creator of that business like Mitchell Mitchell writes these awesome tax threads on Twitter which get a lot of love and he's basically along with the help of you kind of getting interest in real estate and tax savings and then you've got this Niche down Services business that you can funnel those people to and it goes back to what you're saying about Twitter which is like it's so valuable if you can be a Creator a mass an audience of really high value people and then you can create a product or products productized service in this case there's there's seven or eight figures or maybe even bigger this is the way to put in perspective imagine if every single day a stadium a football stadium of Real Estate Investors Dallas Stadium full of Real Estate Investors and I got to stand in front of them in a mic for 20 seconds every single day and tell them something how valuable would that be if you knew what Real Estate Investors wanted how to help them what services they needed what parts of the closing process were not great I mean it's just like having a megaphone and being able to scream in the air of your Direct Customer over and over and over again it's insanely valuable yeah and you picked a niche that's like highly highly valuable right like when you're thinking about picking a niche if you do want to create a creator-led business I think you know if you're trying to optimize for Revenue like you want to pick a niche that is highly valuable right that's why you look at YouTubers and you have someone like Graham Stefan who's uh one of the biggest Finance YouTubers that just took off during covet he's got a few you know three or four million YouTube subscribers he's making three four five six million dollars a year where you have someone else who has three million YouTube subscribers and they're making two to four hundred thousand dollars a year and it's just because you know Finance as a category is just way more valuable than let's say comedy so Bigger Pockets many of the people listen to this have not even heard of that podcast it probably gets fifty thousand downloads an episode if you if you're into real estate investing you probably listen to Bigger Pockets they talk about a lot of the same stuff I talk about they're actually much bigger they have bigger influence than I do but you know maybe their platform maybe their blog maybe the ads maybe their podcast maybe all that generates let's say a couple million five million dollars a year of profit right let's just let's say it's pretty big business pretty big Media Company but in the background of that Media Company the guys who started the podcast with Bigger Pockets they are now raising 50 million about 50 million dollars a month they're raising from the Bigger Pockets audience money to buy real estate and then they're syndicating and they're buying tons and tons and tons of real estate off the back of that podcast so small relatively small reach you had never heard of Bigger Pockets and you're in the Creator world huge huge huge mega wealth business in the background running behind it behind the scenes I'm like looking at this website and you would never expect that this business is doing that well but it makes complete sense do you know uh the car dealership guy I've talked to him a couple times yeah he's he's trying to figure out how to monetize his business too and he started doing some of those spreadsheets where like helping people buy and sell cars I love that yeah can you can you talk more about like what he does and why you might why you think it's interesting he writes really good copy I mean it's it's over and over and over again the people who rise up to the top on Twitter are the ones who know how to write clear and concise copy they know how to ignore Nuance they know how to piss people off they know how to write things that make smart people think deeply about something and car dealership guy his family owned a big bunch of car dealerships he knows the business really really well and he talks about the business he talks about when to buy a used car how to buy a used car the inner workings of a car dealership business and I'm sure I don't know how old he is I don't want to share too much about him that he doesn't you know want me want people to know but he is he is going to build if he plays his cards right he's going to build a really big business buying and selling vehicles yeah so he's anonymous which is pretty interesting like if you were him would you like why is he Anonymous I don't have patience for people who are Anonymous like if you if you're not even if you are not willing to put your face behind your ideas on Twitter then I am not going to heavily weight your ideas on Twitter period I mean I love the concept of web3 and I love um balaji's idea of everybody being an anonymous being on the internet but in general in business when it comes to people doing deals with you when it comes to people wanting to get to know you when it comes to Serious opportunity that all comes when people get to know a person that they can trust and they can build rapport with and people invest money with me people bring deals to me people talk about business and opportunities and I can make so much money on Twitter because I'm a real human um the Anon stuff I don't know it's kind of a cop-out in my opinion my best guess is he he has like a full-time job and probably didn't realize like it was going to be this big and then all of a sudden he's got hundreds of thousands of followers he's got his community he's got you know all the stuff he's doing and he's just like all right I guess I'm the car dealership guy now you know I think but I drink well strip mall Trent is another example of just somebody who they write incredible copy in their prolific content creator and he's already been doing real estate for a while so I don't know who is that it's just a guy who tweets about strip malls in real estate on Twitter and it's an anonymous account that writes really well and you can learn a lot about real estate by following them um in my opinion as well if you're going to raise money from people on the internet and you're not going to disclose who you are it's kind of like having your cake and eating it too it's like it reeks of like trouble down the road if people start raising money and building businesses with Anonymous profiles I but that's just my opinion I don't have anything against these folks who are Anonymous I just I have made the decision to put my name out there and I'm reaping a lot of the rewards from the Network that has grown what advice do you have for folks who are interested in sweaty slash boring businesses if they want to get into it yeah I would say it's not easy of course there's a lot of reasons why you shouldn't do it you can name a ton of reasons right now why a small service business in your town might be a crappy thing to do but no business is easy contrary to what you read on Twitter making money is freaking hard but if you're willing to do the work and you don't care about your ego and you're not going to make decisions with your with your heart and what you want and everything that you want out of a job and everything that you want out of life and you're willing to do something that other people want and give customers what they want and get excited about the process of Entrepreneurship maybe what you want is to build a business and to manage people because all businesses when you're it could be a sexy Tech startup or it could be a lawn care company every business if you're doing it right involves hiring people firing people making hard decisions and managing problems that's every freaking business so you might as well do a business where you don't have to be the best to win where you can choose your competition you can study a market that already exists you're not training customers you're not dependent on raising Venture Capital you're not dependent on the debt Market of how your VC backed company might be valued at any given time you can just take steps forward and over the course of five years you can put some money in the bank and then you put some more money in the bank and you can get better and better and better at managing hiring firing doing those decision making doing those things that make an entrepreneurial entrepreneur and your world your whole world will open up if you do it long enough and you have what it takes I love it Nick thanks for thanks for the time where could folks find you uh you can go to sweatystartup.com you can get on my email newslet letter there that's where I send an email to everybody once a week once a week and uh follow me on Twitter if you don't know about me already but Greg I really appreciate it man I have a ton of respect for what you're doing I consider you a mentor of mine and close friend and I appreciate the fact that you want to see me win and you've done a lot to add value to my life man so I really appreciate it of course man it's just it is weird that we've never met though we will we're going to smoke a cigar together within the next 12 months all right man take care

what I love about build one sell twice is it fits into that category of like a mantra it's something that people can say repeatedly keeps them grounded it reminds me of the founder of shopify's arm the rebels or Stuart Butterfield the founder of slack has we don't sell Saddles here I think it's important to when you're coming up with an idea for a product or you want to come up with an idea for a product based on an audience which is what you had is thinking about what are different phrases that could come to mind and what are emerging phrases and how could you own them

I gotta ask about Ai and how you're thinking about how AI changes the media business but I think it does two things one it makes writers way more efficient you can start with ideas you can edit things easier you can have rough drafts easier that's the first thing can make you make more efficient writer right there's nothing more daunting than looking at a plain piece of paper but then the second thing it only makes great copywriting more important it's gonna make the best copywriters worth so much more because when there's more content out there and there's more content that looks like everything how do you stand out how do you resonate with an audience how are you leveraging the AI to make you the best possible copywriter and I think that's gonna be a big transition

all right so let's let's dive into it I wanted to bring you on because I'm fascinated by email which is hilarious and I'm saying this because it's we're entering 2023. I remember 20 times email quote-unquote dying right email is dead email is dead but I'm I'm still fascinated by it and you're the email guy you know CEO of morning Brew um one of my favorite email newsletters and I wanted to kick off by asking you you know it's 2023 let's say you're starting a media company would you start a newsletter business in 2023 [Music] so quickly before I answer that going back to your comment around email is dead I actually just saw a tweet storm and it was there must be some tool where you can go back and so it must have uploaded uh like all these newspapers and you it's searchable and someone searched like the youth youth uh is lazier like young people are lazy and they took a a tweet from they tweeted every year since like 1920 of a newspaper or a recently you know website quoting young people are lazy and I feel the same way to your point about newsletters the number of times I've heard emails dead and then the year later the same publication will write emails alive and I think how it's been leveraged has changed over time and there's opportunity and there's not opportunity uh you know it comes and goes in different places but I mean I I just saw a stat I think 87.5 of people in the US use email as their number one form of communication so uh you know as in general can you start an email business a hundred percent I think the question is what does that actually mean to be an email business and I have I classify email businesses in different ways and I can I can break those down but high level every business every Creator should have an email and why is that like why should every Creator have an email newsletter yeah I think platforms typically come and go Snapchat was really popular and now at least for my friends it's less popular and Facebook was popular it's not and people change algorithms you know algorithms change but newsletters for the most part is a way to build a connection with people and it's a very intimate connection I think people don't really think about this podcast it's a platform we're on now and newsletters are both incredibly intimate right when I'm reading my inbox I'm either except for Junk uh emails which typically now are actually filtered out Gmail does a good job of this your emails are from your friends your family and your co-workers and so if I can get in that inbox you you kind of treat morning Brew like it's a friend like it's a co-worker and takes a level of seriousness and so I think that's the first thing and the second thing is newsletters are really good conversion rates click-through rates so you can over time if you want to sell something else you can sell something else push something else you can but you don't have to it's long forms you can push something to people every day that's long I mean that's what we did at morning Brew right the idea was the whole idea behind morning Brew was we saw these other Publications and they had newsletters but it was a link to their website we said what if we didn't do that and this seems so simple now but what if the whole newsletter was just the goal was to read it in email uh and that worked quite well and so I mean yeah there's a million different ways to go about it but definitely uh everyone should have a newsletter and you know let's say it's you know 20 years from now do you think people are going to be using email more or less the same I I think the same right I mean I probably heard seven years ago at this point maybe five years ago slack was going to take over email I think if anything slack is just incremental and if anything it actually clears your inbox for you right right because it gets it's more of the back and forth shorthand communication but yeah I don't see email going away anytime soon can you talk a little bit about you know the verticalization of email because like I've seen morning Brew expand from you know business sort of oriented email you have marketing Bruno I think you have like a health Brew vertical like how do you think about expanding to different verticals uh can you walk through a little bit of that process yeah I'll talk about morning brew and then we should talk about uh the email ecosystem as a whole but for morning Brew we created a daily email newsletter uh in 2015 and then in 2018 we had almost a million subscribers and we started to think what's next right we could either just you know kind of four hour work week it's so to speak we had a team of seven or eight it was super profitable but we realized we knew we wanted to do more and we also knew that we were very motivated people and we weren't going to keep this team of eight or ten really motivated people and we did the same thing for a decade and so we asked our audience what do you want and we realized two things one our audience really loved our tone our voice the way we wrote but two and I don't think people realize this is there's a certain type of person who just consumes newsletters right and so I'm sure you've seen this the best or one of the best ways to grow a newsletter is to promote yourself in other newsletters we saw that our cross promotion had our highest quality subscribers so we'd run ads and other newsletters no subscribers would click bore they'd read more they'd read for longer and so we basically said what if we instead of promoting other people's newsletters we promoted our own and I kind of fell in love with this this weird Niche world of B2B media which is serving professional audiences right not people who want to learn about personal finance although we do that too and not people who like cars or watches but people who work in a job function and make them better at their job HR retail marketing I.T CFO and the cpms and those newsletters are so high because advertisers have a really high willingness to get in front of those people right if you're selling it software it's really tough to get in front of VPS and cios at businesses and you're not going to really successfully acquire people via Instagram ad to spend a hundred thousand dollars on Enterprise software and so it's a great business model and it increases LTV so you might read the daily and then two hours later you you read marketing Brew because you're a marketing professional or you read CFO bro because you're a CFO professional and so it's allowed us to acquire more subscribers to the daily because we can monetize them more in other ways I mean obviously you know this about me but I'm like obsessed with niches and what I love about you guys is you're kind of like thinking about okay what are the different niches out there in B2B prioritizing which ones make most sense for your audience cross-promoting using that Medium like for example that method Works in email newsletters but it also works in podcasts like if I do if I do an ad for where it happens on the morning Brew Network or whatever like I bet you a bunch of those podcast listeners are going to come here and that's why you know HubSpot with their Network for example like if you listen to my first million most of the ads are not athletic greens none of them are it's all internal it's all internet uh it's all promoting their Network and by the way we're trying to do the same exact thing right we're building a network as well but it's hard because it's hard to convert people from newsletter to podcasts versus to your point it's very easy to to uh move people around from podcast to podcast and where is video in this whole ecosystem like you know everyone's saying video video short form is everything like how do you think about video in your home morning Brew ecosystem for us short form is important but it's hard to monetize and so you have to do short form in a really inexpensive way and so either you need to take long form and make it in short form right so take a podcast clip this up and put it all over Tick Tock there's a bunch of people out there who do that quite successfully I know a few who we've worked with that's option one or option two make it at basically zero costs right and so make it with just a great personality and a camera but it's very challenging to monetize short form via ads at least because how do you integrate an ad partner into a 30 second video yeah I think from what I'm seeing is like you need to come up with like an Innovative show concept so I'm addicted I don't know how I got here but like my Tick Tock feed is like 80 watch talk it's all these like live negotiations in Midtown New York are you on there I'm on the same exact I watch the same videos um by the way another great Niche I love that Niche right people high willingness to pay irrational willingness to face some would say I love that I love that Tick Tock everyone needs to watch this because I think if you watch watch talk and some of these live negotiations I think it's actually like the future video and how to think about using short form uh there's one show I watch it's called buying time it's you know it's the first thing I see when I wake up it's the last thing I see when I go to sleep type thing yeah I know I've seen this I love this it's kind of like an older guy mixed with a younger guy and they go into you know jewelry shops and they're like okay how much for the Rolex Daytona you know gold 1984 and the guy's like it's gonna be 52k and then the the buyer guys are like 52k what are you what are you crazy 52k that that's that's worth 45 tops and then it's this live negotiation and it's just so entertaining to watch that first of all you get connected to the characters and then you realize that there's this whole like underbelly inner like like they're saying words that people don't really understand most people don't understand like at the end of every watch transaction they're like you know shake their hands or like hazak you know like or no or something they were like Mazel and then you know boom did you ever watch uh Pawn Stars I've seen a few episodes I mean it's like Pawn Stars but but on drugs right it's it's Pawn Stars but you know not made for 30 minutes of TV or 23 minutes with commercials it's Pawn Stars but you just get hit with that that dopamine or that Adrenaline Rush every time and you feel like you're in a negotiation I love it yeah exactly like sometimes I I'll watch it before bed and I'm just like too amped up to even go to sleep I'm like yo I need a ticket to you know 52nd Street and to like the Diamond District whatever in New York because I need to like get in there and you know and I don't even have any watches like that's like I'm not a watch guy but it's just I'm gonna watch guy either what's different between Pawn Stars and this is that Pawn Stars is like it feels like a bit more universally understood like there's only a small percentage of people you and I not included that have gone into into a Rolex negotiation for like a very rare Rolex and that's what I think okay so like to break it down like if you're gonna create short form what do you need to create you got to create like an interesting story that's really cheap to your point right cheap to make yeah and then you need to drive them to something yeah I think that's the key with short form as well is if you're doing it as an individual and as a brand right for us brand awareness is important people know me about morning Brew but to your point I think that's the that's the key I'm sure you know Daniel Mack right Daniel Mack does a a car video and I'm he's been clever about incorporating brands in there but that's all still branded content it's all one-off videos and you have to sell individual videos right it's really tough to scale a business right if you're trying to make uh you know nice money it's great to do one-off branded videos but it's tough to scale a custom video versus if I can just slap American Express's logo and say hey they're going to sponsor the next 10 videos and so yeah I think the concept has to have a down funnel verticalized opportunity which I know you love and maybe for this watch guy it's building an online watch Marketplace and trying to compete with uh you know one of these online Brands like a hodinky for example and trying to build build one of those and doing a really inexpensive way they probably get way more views than hodinky does on all their content combined oh 100 percent to challenge you a little bit do you think that people looked at Mr Beast like seven years ago or six years ago and and been like why are you creating YouTube content it's so hard you know the cpms are so low you can't really create you know a business there like does it were you at all that you're like primarily focused on newsletter and not focused on video yeah so we absolutely are focusing on video we we each have to right size our investment with you know with the opportunity with the opportunity for us right and so we have so much direct opportunity in newsletter but we are in the process in q1 we're gonna launch a Daily Show which should be an audio video version of morning Brew which we're really excited about so we totally see the opportunity particularly in YouTube and longer form but short form again this question still exists what are you driving to to your point and I think one of the challenges is you know we see a lot of YouTube channels grow a ton via shorts but what we haven't seen is a lot of those YouTube channels convert those shorts viewers to long-form viewers right and so that's something we're tracking a lot we've grown a lot via YouTube shorts the question is how many of those shorts people people consume shorts right it's more of an international audience how many of those people are watching our long-form content I think that's a big thing to track because if it's a lot then yeah I think we're going to continue to invest more and more I heard recently I think this is true that Mr Beast God offered what was it like a billion or two for his Empire do you know the number yeah yeah how do you think about Mr BEAST's Empire like what do you think it's worth my guess is he can make more than a billion dollars over the course of his lifetime I don't know how someone's gonna make a billion dollars by buying it right I think ultimately you have to spin off companies one by one and the cumulative value of the companies he spent I mean feastables I've heard the numbers are crazy I know he said on on I apologize I think he was doing High six figures per day in Walmart right so that right there is what a hundred million dollars of Revenue right if that's a million dollars a day that's you know so so something something in the hundreds of millions of Revenue so that right there in a year might be a billion dollar brand alone and you know his Equity stake I'm sure is not 100 but he has Beast burger and he's you know I I met him a few months ago and he has plans to build software businesses and other things and so yeah I think the cumulative Enterprise value of what he creates will be well above a billion dollars if you were Mr Beast and you wanted to create an email newsletter how would you go about it that's a tough question I actually spoke to him about this for a little bit I think it depends if he wants to continue the the same brand cross channel right does he want to continue to do because he can do crazy giveaways and he could build the world's biggest email newsletter in like two months right because he gets to give away you know half a million bucks but what's the content right people will watch his long-form content for the payoff of seeing people make money but I mean I would make it in that vein it would be like almost like a gimmick right he would pay you some amount of money or do some amount of raffle for every open and there'd be some way they would get compensation whether it's some Arbitrage or an Advertiser or whether it's you have to buy feastable something like that so I would use email for him as a way again to push content to people and push something in there so I don't know what I know those plans are but again like maybe you have to buy a pack of feastables to get signed up for some some lottery or something like that and I would make it a way where every time you open up the email you have an opportunity to make money and I think that would build a habit right like you want when people open up and newsletter they get something for morning Brew hopefully it's a nugget of information maybe for Mr Beast it's like you get the opportunity to win 10 grand or something like that there's a few things of that why it's really smart I think one is if you're a Creator and you're trying to create an email newsletter around it you have to ask yourself what is unique to my audience and what do I think they're gonna like and at the same time how do I push email newsletters forward just like you did you know when morning Brew came out there really wasn't anything like it key insights get smarter in five minutes like I remember when it came out I was like it was like an aha moment for me and I think yeah if you're a Creator or even if you're not creative if you're an email news you know you're going to create an email newsletter you have to be asking yourself how do I push this format forward do you agree Yeah well yeah so let's break down so I have a framework for how we think about email newsletters right this probably doesn't Encompass all of them but I'm gonna do my best right and so I think there's like kind of and we can go through them all and talk about pros and cons right the way I think about it are is there's basically three different types of newsletters right there is the editorial or narrative email right that's like made what Packy writes or what you know a sub stacker would write so you have a full one piece of content it could easily just as easily be a blog post but newsletter or it being a newsletter kind of just gives a little bit of a unique brand and also gives you a way to deliver that content it could just as easily be a single an email with a link but it's not it's all an email because the format is attractive so that's number one number two is curation of medium and long-form content right the morning Brews the hustles the skims those are more General but then there's also more Niche ones like milk Road right so that's number two and the third is more of what I would call just like curation of links or or more of a short form hey here's a bunch of tidbits I'm gonna Market something to you that's the way I classify it so it's it's the long form packy-like uh you know Barry Weiss or whatever newsletter it's the morning Brew uh you know curation of different stories and this is a short form right each one has pros and cons and each one had their moment and some are kind of leaving the spotlight I think some are coming into the spotlight can you elaborate on the pros and cons of that and also who's having their Spotlight now and why yeah so the first one right editorial or the narrative-based emails to me that is really really hard to write something long form every week twice a week it's incredibly challenging to do and make it compelling over the course of not months but years but if you can do that it's probably the best business because people are getting your full voice right it's all you look at Ben Thompson he's now expanded to other things but for so long he had this amazing newsletter he wrote every day but again the con is it's so hard to keep up that level of intensity it's all based on you there are tricks and things you can do guest writers and things like that but at the end of the day if you're building that it basically is a one-person show really hard but the upside's nice my take on that is like you're basically like fire hosing value to people so much like it's like a book of value in an email that people trust you so much when you're one of those people um yeah but you have to be top of the game you have to tell people to do that yeah I mean our friend Julian Shapiro would say it's impossible to weekly come up with creative insights every single week at high high high quality that's why he only writes an email like once a month or something because he's just being put on the treadmill to do that is just so hard yeah I think mentally and you know psychologically it's challenging I think it's possible right if again if you're Ben's home so you're doing it based off the markets you know you have earnings every week and you can talk about companies are you gonna make this groundbreaking theory that people talk about every week no definitely not but you're on the treadmill and it's really hard to get off but I also think it's probably the fastest way to let's call it a hundred thousand dollars of Revenue I will say Ben Thompson did call me silly once in one of his emails so you know I have a little bit of a grudge but you know I can get past it um I love his emails they're super long super like packed with info and obviously there's the business model there of like you can charge for that right like people are willing to pay for it like people people pay for Lenny orchitzki's newsletter plus community and they're happy to do it because I think a lot of them are super long super in-depth super niche yeah now and I'm not gonna name names name names no I'm okay I have so much respect for people to do this but I would say is I think a lot of people long term are going to struggle right I think a lot of people in this category that even the ones who are saying this is hard to begin with but even the ones who are successful I think they built a brand off their 8 to 10 or 12 first posts they banked like their most insightful stuff right it's really really good and they had the Twitter Community or whatever else promote them because they're connected maybe they know a bunch of VCS or followers maybe they know journalists maybe they were just first to this and so they're the first investigative journalists and I think the growth rates of these things are gonna slow down dramatically and churns can increase over time I think a lot of people are signed up to these because they want to feel like a supporter but how many of these can you support and how many years in a row can I support for 200 bucks a year something I read almost never and I think the answer is going to be more than we think I think it's gonna be a lot of people are going to really struggle uh you're not going to support as many people as you originally wanted to I want sport 25 of these I'll support my favorite three a lot of people ask me Greg how do you build products that Foster Community well I've got good news that's exactly what late checkout does my company we partner with the largest brands in the world and fast-paced startups to design products that resonate with your community we add a couple interesting clients every single year so if you're interested and that sounds like you email front desk at laycheckout.studio with what you're working on what you need help with and don't forget to mention the where it happens pod thank you [Music] we'll go back to the other categories but what do you think of you know these bundle newsletter companies like there's every I think it's called every.to is one like what do you think of those businesses I think bundle economics are quite hard and everything's doing great right and so it's really good for them I think they have an interesting value prop of like Hey we're gonna be this more holistic business experience but I think in general bundling's hard because the person who adds the most value to the bundle is always going to be curious why they're in the bundle to begin with and why the bundle's not adding them value and I think it's very much a game of who adds the value and you know you're not bundling it with distribution and Technology like a Netflix or a Disney right so it makes sense for most people to be a part of the bundle of a Disney plus right as in let me sell my content at Disney because one we're talking about such high numbers such big scale and two they're adding so much value it's hard to you know deliver my 90 minute movie to a lot of people uh in a quick way a tech friendly way a newsletter is a newsletter so I think it's hard to bundle okay cool let's let's let's go back to um the list cool number two curation of medium and long-form content two buckets here General news Niche news right let's talk about General you have the hustle the skim and the morning Brew there's more I'm sure to me that train has left the station and of course I say this and there will be but I don't think there will be many more multi-million person reader General news General business news email newsletters that you know our Standalone companies whether they're bootstrapped or VC backs I just I don't think it's going to happen and it's because the economics have gotten very difficult to scale to this this size Facebook ads were so much cheaper it was so much easier to acquire subscribers so you could grow faster and also churn was less because there was less competition but with more people starting newsletters there's now a morning Brew for X for and we're disrupting ourselves because of that right we're doing it too and there's so many Niche Publications whereas before I said hey maybe I could read the hustle because I'm interested in business you know General Tech news now you say hey maybe I'm a product manager maybe I'll just listen to or read you know listen to Lenny's podcast or read Lenny's newsletter and I don't need to read a general Tech publication and so as we get more niche it's gonna be very hard to scale big newsletters into the multi-millions we have four and a half million subscribers to our daily and I don't think anyone will get there I think you've said before that media businesses and newsletter businesses have it's like the easiest way to get to eight figures and the hardest way to get to 10 figures or something like that is that is that total yeah so I mean so many media companies it's easy to get the 10 20 30 relatively to get a 10 20 30 million to get to 100 million of Revenue is incredibly hard that I think and I think that makes sense I think you're you're completely right by the way I think like there's only so many of these that people are going to subscribe to and so that makes sense what's uh what's the third category but second category is a part two though General business medium and long form content very tough but I think The Sweet Spot the real opportunity and if anyone's starting one of these hit me up I will co-found it with you I will fund it it is morning Brew again but for x a growing Niche so I'll give the example milk Road milk Road hit it perfectly they said hey we realize we can't be the next morning Brewer the hustle it's too competitive it's too General so let's go Niche let's go into a a growing industry which is crypto right we have this huge Tailwind crypto again is an outlier right because of the grift because of the money making opportunities people want to consume anything right so they hit all that but what they did is they had a really distinct and unique tone and I think because of that it was just very Niche but the niche was big and growing and so you can create a newsletter in a big and growing Niche I think there's a huge opportunity to have it you know a whole company but definitely a newsletter right so you're doing it in community right and there's a huge opportunity there Sean did it in crypto so I think someone can do an AI right and create a great AI newsletter and review all the tools and talk about what's happening I think there's opportunity in space right people are uh really interested now in space manufacturing it's what's going on in space and there's an opportunity there and so I think that's where the opportunity is build a verticalized brand I don't think it can only exist in newsletter but I think newsletter can be a huge part the biggest part of your Revenue strategy for a verticalized media business and if I was starting one and said hey I want to get to a million dollars of profit I would make let's call even the milk Road for x and pick a niche and I would just get started there uh and I think that is still the biggest opportunity is to go more Niche and maybe even more Niche than you think right uh but go Niche and and build something unique distinct uh hasn't been done before hasn't been thought of in that way in that tone in that voice again the way everything was very consistent and coherent like Sean did with milk Road how do you know if you're too niche or not Niche enough what kind of questions do you have to ask yourself to get to that conclusion yeah so I'll explain how we make decisions for morning brew and I think it will apply right so for morning Brew we are in the the universe of ad-based businesses so this is all just ad-based businesses and we can talk about subscription in a second but if you're going to have an ad based business you need to make sure there's enough content to talk about right so for example people are like why don't you have a media Brew you're in the media industry the reason we don't have a media Brew is because there'd only be one newsletter a week at most there's not that much content to cover for an ad based public a general ad based publication and so it's amount of content it's advertisers in the space so how many advertisers are in the space you can go look like is there a big conference is there a big trade show in the space how many people are sponsoring that all those people can sponsor your publication uh and then our third criteria which is unique to us is how many people who read morning Brew or in this industry who want to read this newsletter that framework is taken from Sean Griffey over an industry dive and it served us really really well now the last thing I'll say is you can throw all that out the door if you're targeting senior execs and CEOs so for example media is not that big but if you have Bob Iger and you have the CEO of uh you know zazlov over at Warner media and all these other execs it doesn't matter if you have 300 subscribers if you have the right 300 subscribers people will pay to get in front of them but I'm talking about you know the the more you know let's call it 20 late 20s early 30s audience I heard I heard a story about Tim Ferriss that he designed the his blog for billionaires to read it so when asked about hey should we include a pop-up to get email subscribers on the website you know how you're like scrolling and it's like oh hey like I mean you know this like put your email address in to get subscribed to yeah yeah five bytes by Tim Ferriss or Friday fives he said I think about designing my website as if Bill Gates is reading my website and because if you think about it like Tim probably has a bunch of billionaires who read totally yeah read his stuff so I think it's an interesting framework for thinking about like creating a startup which is especially if you're in the B2B space how do you think about crafting and experience for that type of audience perspective a hundred percent and to be honest you should be creating content for billionaires or at least very rich people right it's very hard to build a media company if you're not building B2B or you're not building for high income earners and that's why some of these Niche Publications I've spoken a lot about B2B AI uh but there's other ones right I know people who have three four thousand subscribers but it's a Ferrari Enthusiast newsletter and you charge a thousand bucks a year a Rolex Enthusiast right so if I was starting a newsletter a newsletter today it'd be super high income or it'd be B2B and going after one of those niches that's growing in a growing industry and and you know ride the wave have you seen Ben tassels AI newsletter I've heard he has an AI newsletter but I haven't read it yet so I think you'd like it it's it's milk Road for ax AI uh it's called Ben's bites uh I think he's gone from Zero Subs to you know 10 000 subs and a very short amount of time yeah if Ben's if Ben's listening what's up then yeah Ben's listening because Ben Ben was on the show a couple weeks ago and people loved it he talked about like his favorite AI tools and I think there's a few reasons why his newsletter's taking off the first is it's really authentic he was the no code guy before he was the AI guy so he's just spent like he sold his last company in his apir or zapier he just like knows a lot about No code and tools like that so like AI just is a tool in that tool set so his stories are just and his content comes across authentic check and then the other thing is he's just really good at like finding all these like Niche AI tools that are coming out like he's good at what want to hear something funny yeah when you sign up for Ben's bites which I just did there's one newsletter recommended in the you know the newsletter Swift uh newsletter Swap and it's uh it's milk Road oh no way that's hilarious yeah there you have it all right let's let's close let's uh let's close the loop here let's go to the third newsletter yep the third is the curation of links the the marketing email the you know the Greg's Corner here's five interesting interesting things I found today I think that is a great bang for your buck because if you can curate well curation is valuable right and so if I can curate five things ten things or you know write a little quip here and there that's great it's not a business right it's a part of a stack if you're a Creator you should at minimum have one of those right and you may actually say well that's that's all I want to do because my my main format is podcasting right my main format is Twitter I think you need again to have some connection but that's not a business I think too many people think they're five sentence Roundup or whatever is a business and it's not it's just a part of of your extension of your brand it's worthwhile you know it's it's it's uh necessary but not sufficient for for success in building your creator stack if you wanted to do one of these categories you want to build a newsletter in one of these categories today it's a new year new newsletter how did people actually get started like should they create like a one-pager of like here's my mission and here's like how many times a day I'm a week I'm gonna write like you know here what tools should they use like could you give in a nutshell how should people think about starting yes I think the first thing is you need to figure out what you're writing about right what community are you writing about let's say it's marketers right writing to marketers uh you need to embed yourself in that Community do a lot of user interviews understand what they consume what they're not getting out of their content and understand what it's like to be a marketer ideally you were a marketer because you want to be able to speak their lingo right you want to feel like an Insider I think you're going to succeed if you feel like you're inside the community you're telling the community you're informing from the inside and then you need to do what we did in the early days of morning Brew which is Persona work you need to say hey who's the writer of marketing grew right who's the writer of morning who's the right writer of the hustle milk Road the skin you know it's a it's a 27 year old woman who who spends her weekends doing this and who does you know who eats this food and and that's what we did for morning Brew we're like who is the Persona who's the person what do they do on the weekends right what do they drink do they go out on Friday nights do they go watch a TED Talk how frequently do they make this the decision to go to listen to Matt Malcolm Gladwell speak at their school uh versus going out to a bar and those are all the the questions we asked ourselves to align on who is this coming from uh and then you know who the reader is you know who's writing it and then you have to get reps and get better and better and better and that's all just copywriting practice right I was not an amazing writer when I started writing this I'm still not an amazing writer by any means I think that was the best decision we made which is was to replace ourselves we realized we could speak in the tone I mean Converse in the tone we could write a couple sentences in the tone but day in day out we couldn't write that tone across a full newsletter and so make sure you can write in the tone you want to write or replace yourself but if you're a one-person business of course you're gonna have to you're gonna have to write it and so writing a tone you can actually execute on shifting gears a little bit to monetization of newsletters and media businesses morning brew has courses now can you talk about how Beyond advertising how is morning brew monetizing and how did you think about those products versus other products yeah so we started uh the newsletter we started building up an ad business and our ad business is still the vast majority of our Revenue but we knew we wanted direct revenue and we so we built out a consumer Revenue team and we tested a lot of things we failed on a ton of things we thought people would want morning Bruce swag they did they didn't want to pay for it right we you know and again it's all relative to a 70 million dollar ad business so if you sell half a million dollars of Swag a year and that's your cap the question's like well you know it's nice but it's not going to move the needle and the question always came up would you ever launch a subscription and I always said for Content no but I think you can launch a subscription or or would you charge people I think was the general question I said no I think it's really tough to charge people unless you have a serious level of expertise or you're going very Niche uh or or you're the New York Times The Washington Post you have a 100 or 200 year old brand I said but I would charge people for community and for Access and for Upward Mobility to advance their career and I said that enough and then you know Alex was a big part of this as well we were kind of like well what if we did that what if we actually you know created that and along with an amazing team of early people we built what was originally called an MBA which was the morning Brew accelerator which is now seven courses we have six to eight week courses we have one week courses we've tested day-long courses and the idea is morning Brews news but it's also education and so some people want to be educated by with five minutes in the morning some people want to be educated with another five minutes in the afternoon some people want to be educated by watching our YouTube but there are some people who want to spend six to eight weeks with us learning about business analytics learning about leadership learning about financial forecasting and I think our brand has the ability to expand into a larger education brand and so we had a pretty successful year doing that you know going direct to Consumer and we're going to continue to go direct to Consumer next year but we're also going B2B and we're selling the businesses we're saying hey four of your employees paid for this program let's do it for 50 or 100 of your employees next year are the courses cohort based like are you with other students you get to meet them we have yeah so they're core based courses uh and so that's a lot of what we provide too is it's a network for a lot of people the education is is nice but the network is really important getting a newsletter listening to a podcast reading a tweet could sometimes feel very you know one way but I think that education is such a natural Evolution for where you guys are going because like I'm sure a bunch of people are like hey there's probably other people reading marketing brew that are like me that I'd love to meet you know you you call it literally an MBA like one of the reasons why people spend eighty thousand dollars a year in an MBA is because they want to meet interesting people so if you could curate those groups of people I think that's a huge huge opportunity I agree and I also think that it's something that is missing in the discourse around online courses right you're like oh should you do a courses you should not do a course is it worth the money is it not people say oh this contents on on YouTube and that might be the case but there's accountability there's Community I think those are two really important things that don't exist with content on the internet it depends the course right but I think like overall like the accountability meaning hey like I spent x amount of dollars I'm actually gonna go and do this like I run a course called Community College and like people come out of that course and they we give them tools to like come up with an idea for a community-based product and they like launch products so it's like hey you're going to launch a product in in 30 days and you're gonna have other people kind of like pushing you to do that that's worth something and then hey you're also like you can meet like you met Alex your co-founder in school right totally we've had people meet co-founders in our classes like it's it's Bonkers right and I think like that's when it becomes worth it is if you get a really high quality vetted group of people and it can't be all that you know some people could be very experienced some people should be earlier on like you want a diverse group but that's a really important piece of it so I I like that you're doing that yeah it's all about how you curate in the group of people and are they like-minded are they are they motivated right and that's what we look for what else besides courses are you interested in potentially monetizing do you have a list of you know ideas I'm not saying you're gonna do them but like what what are some ideas around other ways that a newsletter could could monetize Beyond courses yes so at morning Brewery view ourselves more as of a media company than a course so we do events we do in-person events we do these Summits uh and again if you're a B2B publication or if you have a valuable audience but B2B is where we do our events there's a big opportunity to get four or 500 people in a room and advertisers will spend real money to meet these people and talk to these people um we don't do these as much because normally it's not impactful again compared to a 70 million dollar p l but for creators out there small Niche dinners you know you get 12 15 people in finance marketers in a room you take them to a dinner and companies will pay a lot of money to get in front of those people uh you need to talk to the right person and you have the right people in the room but it's all about curation for those I think that's really interesting uh events you know bigger newsletters right maybe something much larger bigger scale beyond that I think there is an opportunity for non-core based courses right like you know people are succeeding with gun Road and things like that those it just needs to be priced correctly you know you need to make sure the value is there but it needs to be priced way less than the core based course because you don't get all of that right you know I had Jack Butcher on the show recently like he has a good model around that like it's a great model yeah for 50 100 150 Justin Welsh you know you know him too he's on the LinkedIn side and social media side he charges 150 for his course like you shouldn't be paying more than a couple hundred bucks for some of these courses and it's a volume play if you're doing Gum Road it's a volume play absolutely you know I gotta ask about Ai and how you're thinking about how AI changes the media business so I've been playing around with you know chat gbt3 a lot I've really enjoyed you know messing around with that I actually have a list of like the top 10 AI products I want to mess around with over you know winter break or over the Christmas break and so I'll I'll know a lot more and I'll probably put a bunch of content on Twitter about my experience doing that I'm really excited about that I think though what it can do people like oh it's gonna write its own newsletter and like maybe but I think it does two things one it makes writers way more efficient you can start with ideas you can edit things easier you can have rough giraffes easier that's the first thing can make you a more efficient writer right there's nothing more daunting than looking at a plain piece of paper and AI can help you not look at a plain piece of paper but I think the second thing is it only makes great copywriting more important it makes great great copywriting super unique and I think it's going to make the best copywriters worth so much more because when there's more content out there and there's more content that looks like everything how do you stand out how do you resonate with an audience how are you leveraging the AI to make you the best possible copywriter and I think that's going to be a big transition I couldn't agree more but one one follow-up question to that is when you were playing with chat GTP like how did it feel like as a writer as a person in the media business like what was that feeling that you had when you when you put something in there and you saw those answers I mean it's magical like chat is magical like it is it is almost scary it is the closest experience I've had to like wow this is not real life right I think really it's weird I think it's 90 magical 10 frightening it's like my analogy for it is like you're in New York right so it's like imagine it's winter time right it's December but it's like 50 degrees Fahrenheit out or 60 degrees Fahrenheit out you're like wow it's so nice the sun is out and it's like yeah that's magical but it's also like kind of frightening totally um couple more questions you and Sam par on the surface like you would think you wouldn't be friends but to your friends or he ran the hustle which was a you know direct competitor to morning Brew could you talk a little bit about how you're able to have a you know a good friendship with with someone like that yeah so we weren't friends when until we sold our businesses right and by the way I'm going on my first million this week and I think that's what I'm going to talk to him about it and I want to do it in a public manner I don't want to speak for Sam but I will speak for Sam anyways and I'll see if he agrees on Wednesday but I don't know if either of us had the the humility or the or mature enough to be friends with each other at that time I think we both had so much personal effort and and and so much of our self-worth was tied up in our businesses and I think we very much view them as our babies and they were so competitive uh at least they seem so competitive that there's no way we could have been friends now after the facts all of a sudden we have so many similarities so many stories we can share with each other about how he was doing this I was doing that and and that's how I think we've bonded and now I have so much respect for for him and how he's different than me and how he's the same same as I am and I think one interesting thing is I viewed him as he started the husk when he when he ran the hustle I had heard stories and I heard him on podcast and I viewed him as very very rude and I was like oh this guy's like an [ __ ] he seems like a complete [ __ ] and now you know I've been working with him on a couple projects I've been on calls with him and I've realized that he has this level of let's call it abrasiveness that I actually think works really well for him he's very transparent and I can see how it turns off a lot of people but I can also see how it's super effective when he's around people who are receptive to that and he builds these culture this culture of these people who are radically transparent and are open with people I was on a call with him and I don't give the specifics but someone started and said something and Sam was based that's like the effect of like dude what are you saying I don't know why we're on this call and he didn't meet in a rude way at all and it was and the guy you know took it really well and we all reset and there are so many people just yes each other the death in the corporate world and Sam does not do that Sam is is against a little bit abrasive I think in a great way and I I learned a lot from from that one interaction just the way he he carries himself and I think it's really effective and I think it's why he's so good at going zero to one he has no time to waste with niceties and oh yeah that makes sense it's like no no that made no sense what are you talking about like regroup and come back to me and I learned to love that I've learned to use some of that and and how I run morning brew and how I think about things so uh yeah we weren't friends initially but now I think we've become very good friends I love it I love it and you know you're you're a New Yorker so I feel like you've got tough skin and you're you're able to take it um yeah okay last question where do you see media going in five years what does it look like how is it different how is it similar more vertical eyes more Niche again morning roofer Rex and this for why and it's just you know the the cost to distribute content is zero it costs nothing to send an email it costs nothing to post on YouTube and so people can get more and more Niche by the way I don't think this is just media I think it's all of consumer consumer is going to go Niche and verticalize why would I buy the The Mattress the the general mattress so I can buy the mattress for guys who are 5 10 and you know weigh you know 175 pounds and and work out right or or why would I eat at this restaurant I just think that just generals going away and things can be so customized so tailored to you I think by the way that drives out a lot of the The Venture return to Consumer I think it's very tough uh because of that because it is Niche I mean I think media's uh is gonna have a big part in all these consumer Brands right and so you're gonna have your Rolex newsletter and you're going to sell watch collabs you're going to have watch events and media's gonna be a part of a broader consumer strategy and so I think you're going to have Niche you're gonna have vertical eyes and yes you're kind of a media industry but the difference in content and commerce and consumer it's all going to kind of just turn into one and every business is gonna be a media company every Commerce company media company every media companies would be a Commerce company it's always going to look like a lot of these companies already do today it should be built from day one you heard it here first General's going away niches niches the future Austin Reef thanks for thanks for dropping by always a pleasure chatting with you where could folks find you yeah I'm on Twitter Austin underscore Reef Austin underscore Reef go follow him sign up to the morning

welcome to the show yeah thanks for having me first time here uh Michael carton now for corn how do I how do I pronounce no you got it right Carnation apricorn okay cool we are in some group chats together uh we've never actually chatted I followed your work a bunch you know you created skillshare which obviously is a you know huge education business you created Otis which was acquired by you know public.com where I'm actually an advisor there newer B hands which got acquired by Adobe and uh friend of the Pod Scott belski started that and then hot potato which was an OG New York startup acquired by Facebook so you've been around the block and seriously and I've really been interested in your work recently because you're basically trying to figure out what's next and you're writing you're starting a YouTube channel about creators and why I wanted to bring you on the Pod is to talk about how you're thinking about what's next and how are you thinking about money something that we don't talk too much about on this podcast but like straight up like let's talk about money today let's talk about money [Music] I would say on what I'm doing next I have like a documentary in the top it's like rest and recover and rejuvenate so it was just like a constant reminder for myself to like don't Sprint right now just like have fun and recover but as I had a lot of free time I started thinking about money and just my relationship with money you know I didn't really come from a lot of money so it was really important to me to have money and I remember when I started skillshare like the mission was a the big motivator and I kind of told myself that money wasn't but it really was I mean if you you know if you really think about what makes the internet kind of run it is people making money you know their content creators posting because they can make money and we start businesses because it makes money but it also makes us money so I think the big change for me was thinking through like what happens after you get to a certain amount and why accumulate more money when it's very marginal so I've been very fortunate to you know work in text charge for a long time to be an angel investor to be early in crypto so I've had a couple windfalls and through that it just kind of flipped everything I understood about money so personally I don't want to become a billionaire I think every dollar over for most people 10 million is pretty marginal doesn't really add anything else I've done a lot of research into like what they call Hector millionaires so these are people that are worth over 100 million Network liquid you know either through Reddit or just talking to people there that much and I heard a couple themes that people just don't talk about like one is you literally physically cannot spend that amount of money it's just very difficult so after you buy all the toys you go through all the the you know hedonic treadmill of you know buying something and then buying the next thing to get that same feeling there comes a point where you just don't have things to buy anymore and you get really bored and you start questioning you know what your purpose and your mission is and um I realize a lot of these people are dealing with questions around self-actualization and I've I noticed that they all dealt with that in a very very different way um so some people went back to work and I would say that's a sub bucket it was either because they were very Mission driven so they felt like they're really making huge impact in the world and that was what they wanted to do and some people went to go make more money because you know they were flying first class and then they were flying like small private jet life and they rode on their private jet with their billionaire friend they're like oh I want that so they went back to work to pursue that or it was like related to their ego or what have you but the short answer is I think money is good and we should talk a lot about it but it does become pretty marginal at some point how would you recommend people think about what their number should be and should they even have a number in the first place I think people yeah for sure should have a number I think everyone has a few number which is basically the number you would reach where uh you have complete control of your time you can do whatever you want I think you know for those of you that haven't read my newsletter I decided to dedicate a few bullet points to money and at a high level here's kind of what I wrote about so I just pulled it up so one is money does buy happiness so I found this research report that says you know we've been told that happiness doesn't increase above 75 000 and all you really need is 75 000 and every other dollar after that's marginal but there's this new research that shows that you know the well-being Rises with income and doesn't really Plateau so they weren't really tracking billionaires but I would think that a plateaus at some point and what money can provide is financial Independence you know which ultimately gives you freedom and allows you to choose and pick what you want to do with your time which I think is one of the biggest factors for happiness in life is when you can wake up and say and financially independent and I could work on my own terms I could work on whatever I want with whoever I want and I don't have to worry the third thing I wrote about tied to that was most people when you read about money it's usually related to like flexing right it's like yo I just got this new rolly or you know I'm just traveling around the world I'm you know flying in these Jets and you know like in the Maldives you know I'm human like I like having nice things but most people should look at money as a tool to becoming financially independent in my opinion which gives you the ultimate luxury in life is freedom and time so what is the right amount so uh I think a couple weeks ago Jason calcaneus wrote like a couple million you're good 10 million is your Fu number for pretty much everyone and 25 million you're really dangerous anything above that who cares I totally would agree with that I would tweak this for the average person so I think he was referring to like people in Tech because with 25 million you could start any company you know if you have that much you know you could do whatever you want I think it's like 5 million if you live in a small town 10 million if you live in a medium-sized town like Phoenix and 20 if you're like in a major city like New York um if you look at like the current you know treasury bills rate it's a little under five percent but if you have like 10 million that's like half a million a year in passive income which covers like let's just saying you don't have like a lifestyle like inflation or not that's not the right word you're not like your expenses aren't really really high that covers most expenses for most people but I do like I said earlier I do think that money has a diminishing return so I think for most people the goal shouldn't be to make as much money as possible it's figuring out your numbers and and hitting that and then figuring out what your mission or purpose is basically and what you want to be doing with your time if you want to just be relaxing in spending to your family do you if you want to start another company you can if you want to become a content creator if you if you just want to dabble on projects you want to become artists I think that is what most people should kind of reach and it's not easy right so I'm not saying five or ten million dollars is an easy number to get to but it kind of flips the notion on its head that you know because everyone like our society idolizes billionaires but it's much more realistic to become a millionaire and I think that should be the goal for most people not to buy more things but there's like an acronym called Phi woot because there's like fire which is financially independent retire early and that didn't really Vibe with me because I was like I'm not trying to retire early I have a lot of ideas a lot of energy and I found another acronym was like f-i-w-o-o-t which is become financially independent but work on your own terms or work on own terms I was like dude that's that's pretty dope that's that's definitely what I want to be doing that's our generation version of retirement yeah which is like to us retirement isn't exactly go hang out on a beach and join a golf club or something and do nothing yeah we want to be creative and we want Outlets but one of the reasons why we want money or I'll speak for myself like when something unexpected comes up maybe there's a medical emergency maybe there's you know I just got a letter today that My Condo building is increasing their condo fees the feeling of in your stomach like oh like you know that that bad feeling I think we've all had that bad feeling of like something unexpected comes out or something's expensive when you have money you care less about those things yeah that that's like the second order effect of having money is I think we all everyone has challenges in their life everyone runs into problems that's just that's just life but you can have obviously a life of a lot less stress when you don't have to worry about all those little things that kind of pop up on a day-to-day basis and I've seen that in my own life where yeah that comes across and kind of like okay that's not a big deal where when I was much younger and much poorer I was like dude that that sucks like oh [ __ ] like that's that's a vacation out the door or that's like a reset on savings like [ __ ] I have to start over again and go from zero back up to a thousand or five thousand so money does help and I actually think it's a good thing if used correctly I I think a lot of what we see in in in culture today is money being used incorrectly like when you watch people you know on social and celebrities and how they're using it it's obviously like if you grew poor and you want you know a new car or whatever a Porsche is like yeah you're gonna go buy it and you're gonna show that off and you're gonna feel good about that being a reminder of like where you came from but doing that constantly is not in my opinion the best use of money yeah I think you know there's money and then there's there's wealth and yeah I think they're different to you what's the difference between money and wealth I kind of view a new version of wealth right which is all the intangible things that are valuable let's say something as simple as like having great relationships with people developing great experiences learning constantly improving I like to like having a sense of purpose working on things that you want to be working on and I kind of view that being wealthy whether you're a millionaire or not right so I kind of view that as a new form of wealth where money is just a toll that gets you there right so you don't need money to have that version of New Wealth but money does make it easier so that you don't have to go work a job you don't want to work or things along those lines but and I like that distinction because from a wealth standpoint you don't need to be rich to have that life and I do see a lot of people with all different networks that are very wealthy but uh that's kind of how I view the two like one makes that version of wealth easier but you don't need to have the money to get there you recently moved from from New York City which I think is one of the most expensive cities in the world definitely top five to somewhere in North Carolina did did did the the concept of what Jay cow was talking about which is you know a couple million dollars for a small town 10 million dollars for a medium town and 20 or 25 for you know top tier City or whatever did that play a role into your move or was it strictly personal strictly personal I think it was in the middle of Covenant pandemic we're living New York we didn't we weren't planning on moving it was just kind of like white families North Carolina let's just kind of go there for a few weeks and a few weeks or in a few months and a few months we're like okay let's just find a temporary house and then we're like oh this is actually not that bad it was kind of cool um and then it went from like are we going to stay here to like or move back to New York well let's just stay here and now it's kind of like okay let's plant root so you know life throws curveballs like that and you just kind of have to move with it but what's funny is that um while I live in like a like I would call it like a medium like somewhere between small and medium like my expenses I would argue would probably be a little bit less than New York it's like you have a house and then you have cars and you have to put gas in the cars and you know like because in New York you don't need to own a car do you just take Ubers or Subway or bike so it was just kind of like on a monthly basis it's yeah not it's cheaper but yeah New York is way way more expensive but all those little things add up like you send your kids to like school and that your private school and that costs and yeah so it definitely adds up if you wanted to there's definitely a jump in like some quality of life that you're seeing by you know your dollar goes further in North Carolina than that for sure no I mean the trade-off for us was like being close to family yeah close to Nature because in New York there isn't and we have today you know at the time we had like a three month old so now the triath is like you know where we live is a lot more family friendly there's a lot more things to do outdoors because New York is a very social City it's like most Gatherings or drinks food and you know cultural events but it's not like you go on a hike you know in the you know to the top of the mountain within New York if you're trying to make your your first you know million dollars five million dollars 10 million dollars do you recommend that person go to New York and network a lot get those connections or do you recommend they go to somewhere like North Carolina where you know cost of living is a lot cheaper they keep their costs down their their saving rate you know doubles or triples or quadruples I think they should start something and own equity in something that compounds over over time and I think they should have a push versus pull strategy so yeah you can go to event and network but if you're not working on anything you know like that networking could lead to something one out of 100 People You Meet could change a path that could change your career but if you start something you would be kind of like a magnet that pulled people towards you it's much easier to network when you're building something I think people younger should take a lot more risk I think as far as where you are in that risk restroom is really up to you like I tuck the go after a billion dollar outcome unicorn you know there are only a thousand of them and the the odd to getting there very low you could also buy business you know like a boring business you could become a content creator you could dabble in and try a new thing every year until something hits there's nothing wrong with getting like a 10 million outcome like getting some Savings in your your bank account and taking a much bigger swing like if you want to build some a some crazy AI blockchain space spaceships like go for it but I think it really comes down to like where you are in your career and what your risk spectrum is what level experience you have but if I were in my 20s I would start a company or own equity in something and I would try to become you know a millionaire as quickly as possible the challenge with startups is like your liquid for some two seven to ten years minimum the odds of you building a unicorn are very slim and you can spend a decade of your life down that path and exit with nothing or you know a little bit above nothing so I think it's not for everyone and that's not what's often talked about it's like kind of glamorized to build this billion dollar company and swing for the fences but yeah they're like a lot of companies that just don't make it through so yeah and they don't they also don't make it through sometimes not even because the founder or the team didn't do a good job but because like the macroeconomic environment changes or you know their particular space falls out of Vogue one example of that is like friend of the Pod Julian Smith who co-founded breather and breather had raised it was basically like an on-demand office product you know they'd raised like I don't know a couple hundred million dollars and ended up selling for scraps because you know we were imploded yeah people don't realize how much luck and timing goes into like majority of success especially for what we do as within Tech startups you can have a great idea but the timing is off and it just will never work no matter how hard you try like it just won't work and then sometimes like you just work really hard and you're just around for a long time where it just starts working because the timing just kind of shakes out to in your favor or can work really hard and like you know I'm thinking like bad running gambling or poker it's just like things just don't go your way and three five years later you're like [ __ ] that didn't work and you have to like pick yourself back up and try again so I don't think people really factor in luck in timing because most people believe that if they work really hard they will become successful but that's my opinion just not true like I know a lot of people that work really hard that are just really unlucky and you know it's just the way it is could we could we talk about the business of creators I know this is something that you're really you're really into right now it's definitely in the category of like investing in yourself because there's more control at least with an audience like you know why are you interested in in the business of creators and yeah let's start with that yeah I would actually re redo my answer if I were in my 20s I would either take three paths I had a really big idea that was really impactful for society I would go after that knowing that like okay it might not work but I have to try secondarily I would say I don't have an idea but I want to just make money right now and then figure out what's next I would probably do like a boring business or you know some you know something that was like low risk with like medium sized returns and if I was creative and it had like a very unique point of view then I would become a content creator and the reason is I think there is going to be a shift you know from like people trusting celebrities to then trusting influencers to then trusting like like very Niche content creators and the reason is because for businesses there's usually like two big factors or three obviously first at the product second is marketing and third is obviously teaming culture from my experience marketing has just become more difficult over time as it gets more saturated more competitive you know looking at all the chat GPT stuff that they do like this AI [ __ ] can like write better content than most content you know SEO Specialists so if you look at like any content creator or YouTuber if you build an audience you can kind of Leverage that into anything you want to do like Leverage it for recruiting for fundraising or for like marketing a business that you launch and that is something that you can do over and over and over again forever so that's why that's what I would do and that's actually what I'm considering doing next to my career is like providing value building audience and then kind of figuring out how I can leverage that later and not even worrying about that right now so let's talk about that so you haven't really been a Creator I mean you you've been you've been tweeting you know you tweet thoughts and and you haven't taken it a professional approach to creating and then recently I saw you know you got a sweet YouTube setup you created a YouTube channel you know you're creating Clips like you're you're doing it so how are you thinking about your 2023 content strategy so taking one step back I you know when I stepped down from doing Tech startups I was like you know everything in my life to this point has been very very planned right I was like okay I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that after that I'm gonna do this and then I was like you know what maybe for the next six months to your I'm just gonna see where things go I'm not gonna have any grand plan the only plan I'm gonna have is I'm going to protest my health and spending time with my family having fun outside of that I'm not gonna really Force anything I just want to see where things go and the YouTube channel just happened on accident saffron emailed me he used to work with Sean Perry and he wrote this really good cold email and I was like okay this is interesting and the first thing I told like look I'm not I don't want to start a YouTube channel and I definitely want to start one with someone else you know and then you know he kind of convinced me and then convinced me and I was like look maybe I'll do it just to learn but I'm only going to commit to like five episodes you know they just kind of one led to the other so the train to your question is uh for 2023 I don't know I'm just kind of like I think what I'm struggling with right now is if I'm trying to figure out what my Niche is and what I'm going to focus on talking about but I I do plan on creating a lot more content in 2023 so the way I'm thinking about it is I want to create uh similar to you like my own personal holding company within that starter incubate something every 12 to 24 months or 12 to 18 months first business is content in audience building because I don't really have any ideas I'm excited about right now but I am excited about content and I do look at that as giving back and if I could like you know change someone's perspective about money or help someone take a different path to become a millionaire like dude that's so impactful so for 2023 I do plan on creating my own YouTube channel possibly a podcast um and then keep doing what I'm doing with just Twitter and my newsletter and and trying to do it in a way where I can be very authentic to myself and not dip too far into the cringe you know threads where it's like hey I read I watch a thousand hours of blah blah blah and here's what I've learned because I don't even you know that's not even who I am like I don't spend a thousand hours researching but um what I'm trying to do right now which is why my Twitter my newsletter are so Random is trying to figure out like yeah where what is the intersection multiple things that I'm interested in that can help people right now it's money because that's just what I'm thinking about but I don't know maybe three months it could be something completely different from an outsider perspective I mean I love all your stuff oh thanks and I'm really interested in it and to me it's like the niches that you're in are personal holding company money and The Business of creators like that's what I see oh I like that I'm gonna write that one though I think though and we can use this as just like a live jam session I think that if you want to be a you know a successful Creator you have to be known as the ex-gal or why guy in one Niche yes because like in people's brains they just like bucket you as someone oh Mike he's like the personal holding company guy uh oh Greg he's like the community guy yeah and I think that you'll start seeing a lot more compounding once you commit to one one of those categories so thought about this you know I've been you know for doing a live brainstorming but I kind of look at like a major in minor like you have to be known as the X guy but you can have like a couple minor things that you talk about you know secondarily and what I actually want to talk about is like how can one person live a really great life and what does that mean but you know what I've learned is that nobody really wants to read that or click through it and it's just not that exciting for people because I was like that's why I've learned because I've written threads and articles or tweets on happiness and all those things and like I think when you know people are dealing with their own [ __ ] they're like dude I don't want to read this stuff then I started then I flipped and I was like okay what am I the most uncomfortable talking about and it was money um and I was like okay why is that one is like from an ego standpoint I want to be known as a money guy like what does that even mean like I don't have I have money but it's not like I'm like that rich you know so that was like one she was like okay [ __ ] where do I even take this from her because I don't want to become like a fintech influencer on YouTube and promoting like stocks you know like like stocks and like you know how to flip your house on Airbnb and all this other stuff but then I realized it's like okay um people seem to like that content and it could back into that secondary minor stuff around how to live a good life or how to be a good parent or you know how to like live healthy or you know because I am going to probably do a personal holding company and I might do startups to be within this I could talk about that stuff too because it's all related money so I think I am leaning towards the money angle and just doing it that's not like how to make a million dollars you know Drop Shipping or buying boring businesses but doing it you know becoming content creator or startup Studio or you know basically like how I would make money or how I am going to be making money and just talking about that I think this is a really good exercise for everyone which is if you believe that content is important I mean 99 of us would agree that having an audience and creating content is really important thinking about a Venn diagram of where you want to hit so you you know in the middle you need my opinion like be known as the x or y guy or girl right so like for me it's like the community guy and but I also have some minors so I also have like I'm interested in web3 I'm interested in you know product design that's why we run an agency like and and you kind of like have these other interests um and for you maybe it's like living a wealthier happy life and maybe there's these tools and minors like you know personal holding company rolls into that I've never been happier in my life and I've like you I've done the Venture back startup thing but the the personal holding company has has been so fun for me and it's helped me live a happier healthier and wealthier life so it all rolls up to it you know what I mean yeah so maybe a couple follow-up questions to that is like how did you land on being the community guy and was that something you've resisted and have you ever thought about changing that like as you have grown and then the second is like why like why don't you why don't you talk about your holding company more online because I'm like I think when we're chatting about what to talk about in the podcast you're like oh let's go through some holding coming I was like dude I don't know that many examples like this is not a a thing yeah I think that's why people like the concept because it's interesting and most entrepreneurs are very creative so I'll just always I was just curious about those two things like how did you land you know Community have you ever thought about changing it and why not talk about your holding company a lot more so I landed on community when I had some you know in 2020 2020 I guess I left wework uh whereas ahead of product strategy uh be an acquisition and I had some time like you to think about what's next and I looked at what is the common denominator of my entire career and literally everything I had have done both professionally and personally at the core of it was community I have never done anything that hasn't had community at its core and I had a list of Theses and ideas in that space and I was just like okay I'm gonna make a conscious effort in 2020 to put out more content related to community and I am completely okay being known as the community guy why because it's a small enough Niche that you know at the time no one was not many people were you know focused on it but it's a big enough Niche that literally Community is at the center of everything on the internet like if you're a Creator community's at the center of it if you're a web 3 product community's at the center of it if you're a cult-like brand communities at the center of it so I think it's important for folks to pick something that is small enough that you can own but large enough that you can kind of grow with it have you ever thought about changing or like reposition yourself out of community like when you're deep into what three becoming like the web three Community guy or I don't know like AI now or right I just feel like I would look like a child wearing really big like a really big suit like I would look silly I wouldn't be able to wake up in the morning and just like yeah put it another way like it's just not authentic yeah and although I would probably be able to grab another few hundred thousand followers if I would you know pivoted my way into something else I yeah I wouldn't be excited about it yeah yeah and that goes back to the whole like quote unquote retirement like in my mind I'm retired in that sense right yeah you know I'm doing things for for style points more than money and it's a good place to be and the style points on doing something that I'm not excited about content-wise especially because you're putting yourself out there would not be cool yeah for me and then why not talk about your personal holding company more because I I remember when I like went to your Twitter I was like oh there's an interesting click on it and it's just like oh I kind of understand it but I feel like you could be a lot more vocal about it because you are working on a lot of interesting things and you are doing a lot of interesting things and you could also be a great example for other entrepreneurs to follow so why not talk about it a lot more I wrote a post in 2020 which was why the future of startups are Studios welcome to the Golden Age of product Studios and I talked about my decision to create a studio but more more importantly a personal holding company because I talk about you know service businesses and this is up on my sub stack for people to check out you can just Google Google that and it'll come out and I talk about like why you shouldn't raise Venture and why service businesses is actually a really good place to start and how to think about launching experiments and how to think about a thesis for your startup Studio I got some people excited about it but then when I like compare that to like a post I a popular post I did like the unbundling of Reddit like that got a hundred times more or a thousand times more traffic than the studio stuff so I should the short answer is I should write more about personal holding companies because I'm learning about it in real time and because there's not enough it doesn't feel like there's a lot of information out there this reminds me of like Tech startups like 15 years ago when I when I first like entered that space in my career there was just not a lot of information on the internet right so it wasn't like it wasn't a y combinator there's very little written about like even like how to analyze a term sheet and then today it's like dude there's so much there's like too much information and I kind of feel like holding companies are kind of similar right so holding companies like you Google it it's like a lot of legal definitions and corporate holding companies but there's not examples you know just hearing you talk about like a SARP studio and then the service business to start to then you know generate cash flow to then reinvest into all these other things you want to do I'm like oh that's pretty cool like and it's not a theory anymore because you've already done it for a couple years now so like what did it work you know what part didn't work what would you do differently you know save me two years of making a mistake so I have written a lot online and the holding company definitely over the past six months has been one of the bigger surprises because I kind of wrote it like walking down the street oh personal income and that's you know because I'll try and think of something to explain to someone without what I'm thinking about doing next and that one tweet well didn't like get a lot of traction it got enough where I was like oh man there's definitely interest in this especially in 2022 coming between yeah I I totally agree I like I'm I'm feeling like I don't know if it's the coffee or the conversation or both but I'm feeling like actually pretty excited to talk about this more publicly there is a lot I've learned um yeah especially around the service service business stuff like for example we run this design agency and in the beginning we were doing a lot of like short-term two-week design Sprint type deals now we've moved to you know I'd say 90 of our Revenue is long-term 12 month plus deals with the largest companies in the world and why does that make sense well it's just predictable cash flow you know one of the bad things about an agency model is you're kind of you know always on the hunt quote-unquote for your next deal yeah and I think what I love about our model is you know when you're signing these long-term deals like it's not that case at all and that's like a lesson I would love to talk more about yeah there's more of that so if the money comes in from these big corporations I'm assuming there's like a percentage of that that's kind of left over our profits do you reinvest that where do you where do you reinvest that do you take it out of the business do you invest to companies or buying companies or starting like how are you thinking about I guess reinvesting that cash within the holding company it's like super old school uh if you think about it but we do a good old-fashioned profit share two times a year which is actually really awesome for folks because like you you know this like when you work for a startup and you talk about it like you don't see liquidity for 7 10 plus years sometimes um so it's pretty awesome that folks who join like check out like every six months they're getting a check I noticed like the Gen Z younger folks like they love the instant gratification of like cool like I'm gonna go on vacation or I'm gonna go buy this like whatever we do uh want to compound the money and that's why we have you know a pretty big budget for our startup Studio where we're incubating our own products and companies as well as a budget for companies to buy and I actually think that like right now going to 2023 there's you know going to be more and more distressed assets there's going to be more and more companies that are uh Venture funded that are not going to make it and there's opportunities to pick them up for reasonable and fair prices so I'm trying to keep that cash so that we can be opportunistic and pick up several of those companies you know I feel like we grew a whole other hour or just talk through all this stuff because I'm like so curious now how big is how big is the holding company and have you found it like a pain in the ass to like manage like all these people again I have an incredible co-founder in CEO who is like keeps the Train on the tracks so I don't even need to you know really think about the Train on the tracks how big is the team now and because I imagine if you're like got an agency you're going to be buying companies so you're going to be scouting those and someone has to run those and then you're incubating things so there's probably like a whole process around coming with ideas vetting them and kind of like you know like V 0.1 just to like dip your toe in the pole and they're like oh that kind of worked and then you have to like in vest more resources and time into those things so that's that's a lot of things to be doing it is it's a lot of things and that's the hard part about this model I think is the focus you know when you have a team you know I think we're like 40 plus team members so when you have a team you can do anything in terms of like you can build a startup you can you know work on this you can work on this agency you know I think that's the hardest part about building a startup Studio or personal holding company is the fact that I think it was uh Scott belski actually who once told me constraint fuels creativity uh for sure it definitely does sounds like a bellskyism it's completely right and I think that that's another lesson I learned from personal holding companies and startup Studios is that you do need to create some constraints on the business so that people basically don't work on anything and that also you know one other thing one of the constraints that we put on are our agency business for example is we only accept one new client per month uh that's awesome and we started doing that you know a year ago because we realized like we had a lot of inbound for for client work and we would just take client work and it's about taking the right client work so just in general I think like having constraints on your service business and then having constraints on your studio is really really important I'm I am really passionate and excited about phds personal holding companies because it allows me and my team I think to be the most creative version of themselves what I didn't like about working at a tech startup was that like I was like pigeonholed into this like space for seven years or six years or whatever and the Achilles heel that we talked about around you can do anything is also the most fun part about it I can definitely relate kind of similar to you I did the whole Tech surf thing and well this is like a limiting belief I would I told myself was like there's a very narrow definition of what a Founder CEO should be very operational very analytical like super Visionary blah blah like conscious leadership and all this stuff and over time you know I guess my career in the world's like 15 years but over time as it become less creative it it was just not fun anymore so I I that's what I like about the phcs is man you have this like whole spectrum of things that you can possibly do but it's so hard and you know it's like kind of what we're talking about becoming content creators like figuring out what your ex you're going to be known for same thing with like what you're going to build dude there's so many things you could possibly do and speaking of another belscheism um which is like the idea to idea syndrome where you get so excited by the idea you kind of start working around like oh this sucks what's really exciting is coming with a new idea and then going down that path and when it gets hard you just keep flip-flopping and then you know over a year or two you don't actually execute anything so um I think that's probably the balance and the challenges nearing in and focusing within a world where you have like unlimited things that you could possibly doing um but that's also what I love about it is it just becomes so personalized to what you want to do and it's not going to be a one-size-fits model for anyone I agree and I also think that while starting a phc is very much playing freestyle points there are also incredible businesses oh yeah and for sure I feel like most entrepreneurs should probably do that because one you're Diversified and the problem with text Harps is you're not like still like you know majority of my net worth is tied into very liquid stock so you can diversify you get cash along the way to reinvest or pull out for your personal use is extremely creative you know if something does take off great you know like you know that's also the problem with a lot of like really early investing for pre-seed pre-ideas like um you don't really know what's going to take off and like if I were to spin something out of a personal company I would want to do it after I feel very confident that it has a great a good probability of scaling not this Grand idea I have that I'm convincing myself in you that it's going to be big it's like oh no it's totally going to work because you know we already test out and this is like the 42nd idea that we've launched so I know and then I know you and I have talked about this on Twitter too which is um raising zero outside capital or yeah you know I talked about raising one round and keeping the team as small as possible which is like every entrepreneur's dream it's like I'm a super small team they're all like great what they do good work on multiple things and if something takes off and just blows up great like we could you know triple down on that but uh I hope that more entrepreneurs like take a different approach you know I think right now it's very popular like repeat founders have some type of access so you do have that time freedom but I do hope that people that are content creators can then you know they're perfect I think for it's like repeat Founders from Tech world and content creators are perfect today for a PhD totally yeah I think uh the biggest PhD Founders are going to be content creators oh I mean we're already seeing that with Mr Beast yeah um and I think I don't know why all these YouTubers do d2c businesses because I'm like dude like there's a whole world out there that's like like digital where you don't have to ship like physical items so I think what I think distribution should do in the team General I think you should launch a gaming studio um or something that's more digital Than Physical products but I think we will see a billion dollar phc I mean I think I guess we've already seen it with Mr Beast I think we'll see a lot more over the next couple years Mr Beast is like he's involved with night media right yes so I don't know if he's a co-founder there is he a co-founder there I'm not sure but from the light and analyzing I've just done on all Critters like you know Silicon Valley is Northern California Hollywood's obviously based in Southern California a lot of like the incubation star studio is comes more from like the Hollywood model versus the Silicon Valley model so if you're like a YouTuber and you have like million plus you know tens of millions of subscribers I would follow a more Silicon Valley model that's that's definitely what I would do versus like uh d2c or do both well I mean for D to see like Mr B's for example you know what's called feastables his chocolate bar is that what it's called like it's cool it's really cool and I love how it is yeah like he did the Willy wall healthy yeah exactly it's really cool but I think you know what's even cooler is like 97 margins on game on game yeah and a gaming company because he's also in the gaming too he's like dude like launch the next Fortnight Pro like you're in North Carolina like epic games is down the street from you like launch a gaming company down the street from epic recruit like all the top people there and just create the next Fortnight yeah partner with someone like he can yeah definitely don't do it in-house like don't do it in house buy a studio I agree though like he should you know Mr Beast if you're listening or team like please go digital yeah you get higher multiples of your evaluation yeah you don't have to deal with I mean yeah I feel like he's pretty diverse and like if I was like looking as partially like dude you're pretty deep into physical products let's let's try to do digital one next let's just diversify um all right man well predictions for for Content creators like where does the world of content creation and creators look like in in five years from now I think we'll see a lot more billion dollar companies that are phds from content creators I think I don't want to make predictions on like Tech with AI and all the you know but I do think we'll see sizable businesses evolve out of it and I can see a lot more creators taking that path versus what I call like the traditional Playbook which is like build audience drop a course drop some merch you know you know I could see them moving be like okay that that kind of worked for a Time oh that guy launched a business and it sold for three billion let's do that and I could see that becoming more and more normal um I could see that being a clear path for a lot of a lot of content creators you know once they kind of build an audience I love it all right and uh if you want to hear more from Mike where can we where can people find you websites Mike carnge mikk m-i-k-e-k-a-r-n-j.com or just Mike crunch on Twitter cool worth the follow uh great content and if you're listening to this and you want more PhD content from from me and Mike honestly just tweet us um and uh comment on this YouTube video with any questions you have about PhD uh we can we can use that as sort of a discussion ground um and of course subscribe if you haven't subscribed already to the where it happens pod thanks for coming on Mike you are the goat I feel like we're gonna be hearing a lot more from you on on phe's content creation money wealth not enough people talk about this so thank you for speaking up oh thanks for having me [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcome back to the show the weird happened show I'm bringing on my friend Ben tossel today uh he is the no code guy but more recently he's become almost the AI guy he's got this incredible newsletter called Ben's bites where he does all the work for you and kind of just looks at the most interesting AI stories what are interesting use cases in Ai and he breaks it down for you so I've been really enjoying his newsletter and just wanted to catch up with that what's keeping him curious and why he's really excited about Ai and so uh welcome to the show Ben and yeah excited to chat about stuff and all the crazy magic that's swollen the internet these days [Music] yeah so before we get into the AI bit could you talk a little bit about what got you excited about no code and how you're feeling about no code right now yeah so no code came from like a necessity for me like I can't code I've never been able to code I've tried I have tried I know people say that you'll be able to do it everyone should learn I don't think anyone should learn or every I don't think everyone should do it so that's gonna piss people off um and I was working at product hunt at the time so I was like a victim of my surroundings there's all these people launching all these cool things every single day and I was like I want to build something I want to do something as well I want to like put something together that I've built and I couldn't code so I I sort of looked to what can I use off the shelf and those things like zapier and type form and bubble and webflow so I was like well I can put these things together and then make it look like I coded it and it's a real thing so that's that's what I started doing and I started doing that a lot and started pushing pushing these like tool Stacks together and seeing how far I could push them so things were like Airbnb without code and stuff like that so I'd really go to to the extremes to show that these things are possible without needing to code and also it then became a really quick to do it you have to learn code for nine months and you'd have to like do all of that stuff you could build something in a weekend and then test it out on on the Monday and see if people liked it or hated it so I started doing that like a ton and people was just following me and they were just always asking how are you doing that how are you doing that how are you doing that and I thought I'll just build stuff and then just remember to record my screen and that'll be a business I'll like sell access to my videos so that's essentially what makeupad was it was a tutorial platform an educational platform a ton of tutorials on how to build stuff with no codes or how you can put these things together and build an Airbnb or build a membership business or build an Instagram clone on mobile and all these sort of different things that people don't know how to build if they can't code um so yeah that was I started that as a side project in January 2019 I took about 350k of funding from calm fund and other angels in September October 2019 and then we were acquired by zapier in March 2021 so it's quite quite a quick process but yeah it was it was awesome it was sort of like before the no code Trend kicked off and then we sort of rode that wave as I kicked off and I think it's even as prominent today as it was then I just think even with all this AI stuff I think they're all actually connected it's all to do with democratization of software development like doing more with software without needing to be technical or needing to know all these really specific things in order to do x with software okay what's really interesting about your story is you really just like followed your curiosity I've you know I felt like it came from a place of Purity it's like people should be able to do this or hey I really want to do this and other people might be willing to pay or or just be interested in it did you ever think the business of no code and teaching and Community could be really big or were you just like I'm just gonna put some stuff out there and you know hopefully it works out I think my whole life has been put stuff out there and see what works um I always wanted to be an entrepreneur always thought I'd be like some hot shot CEO one day and that never happened still um I don't want to be there actually it turns out but I just was never happy with this is how it is so learn to code or don't that can't be the the future of how people build stuff on the internet like it didn't make sense to me like you have to learn to code but what if I really struggle to learn to code like well if I can't I don't work with numbers and functions and I don't work like my brain doesn't work that way I want to have quicker feedback loops I don't want to be a software engineer I just want to make stuff and then yeah I tried I think I launched like 50 things before make Pad happened and make a pad happen because people didn't pay for all my other things they would see the things I built and say yeah cool I'm not buying that but how did you do it and I was like sort of that those who can't do teach type scenario where I was like well I can just show you and I I'd seen go rails is the website it's like a screencasting business it was called at the time I saw that on Indie hackers and I was like well this guy makes like 15 grand a month just recording his screen and building stuff that is interesting to him like that seems cool that's a one-person business it seems like a very simple straightforward thing to do um I bet I could do something like that I can't pretend that I like thought it all up and then made it reality it just happened as and when yeah there wasn't like a grand plan you kind of just like went with it no now you're spending a lot of time thinking about the world of AI and I think a lot of people are interested in Ai and they're seeing stuff happen but it's it's confusing I think to a lot of people just to understand like the lay of the land could you explain basically what AI is like let's start from scratch what is AI why should people care about it yeah well I'm probably gonna butcher a bunch of things in this episode about Ai and I'm sure people will be very vocal on the internet when I do but to me I think AI is like a computer doing something for you without with almost like a thinking element you can go into the technicals of neural networks and all things like that but to me on a very basic level it's just like it does magic stuff and I know that's really fluffy but I think when you when you use some of these things and you see the use cases of them you understand like oh yeah why why isn't it that and I suppose that's similar to the no code vein where if you're if you can't figure out a formula in Excel and you're like I just want to have this divided by this then Times by that why can't you write it like that and then have the computer that does has all this power in it to actually figure out what you mean by those things put it together write the right formula create it in a code that a computer understands and then pulls out the information that you're actually looking for that side of things people might understand a bit more where it's like you're translating what I'm trying to think of but I don't know the answer to and given it to computer to solve that problem for me um but there's loads of different use cases and I'm sure we're getting to a bunch of them today like um generative AI art and things like that so yeah there's there's loads of different ways to look at that I think AI is actually more of a a bolt on it's like a feature for most companies rather than AI is the thing AI is almost like Google search to people it's like oh how is Google like got all these results and put them all together and put them in a in a list for me a computer could do so many more things than we can understand and AI is just that on steroids like to a complete new level so we could finish a story for you we could write an email for you you can give it some context and it's what people are calling prompt engineering you sort of write a prompt so you write something write me an email that I'm asking I want to ask for a raise for my boss and then it will just create that from all of this information that it's consumed from the internet and then it'll put that together in an email that is readable it makes sense it might not make sense for your use case because you didn't give it any context but it can do those sorts of tasks which look quite fun I think on the on the outside and people are really seeing a lot of those kinds of demos and things now over the last few months they're really like they're going they're going crazy what are what are some of the categories of of AI like you talk about generative art you know you talk about writing give a sense to people you know what are the different areas that you think Ai and prompt based AI you know they said software is eating the world like AI is eating the world what are the different categories yeah ai's probably eaten software um they're all the same categories as startups and technology in general it's just AI enabled in front of them so audio for example everyone knows like we are recording a podcast now on a platform and we are doing some stuff they're recording things locally they're doing a bunch of things to make it easy for us to record this and then you can put it out as a podcast on podcast players now we're AI an audio sort of intersect there's okay well you can have Joe Rogan interviewing Steve Jobs where everyone knows that that interview did not happen but you can train AI on a voice it could understand how someone speaks what their mannerisms are what kind of topics they talk about and then they can put those things together almost like almost perfectly at the moment with like listening to a normal podcast like like you and I are speaking here yeah I mean voice cloning I think just in general you can you speak into your own computer 20 times and then it'll come back with you write a sentence you type one in or you have an AI generates a sentence for you and then that would speak to you in your voice and it's pretty good on the first on the first pass like you can go deeper and train it better and better but the technology there now is just it's really really crazy of how how advanced it is um and images is obviously a huge one that everyone's probably seen some some talk about AI art whether it's art not art and all of that stuff is because yeah pictures speak a thousand words and that image has never been created before like ever that image is not in its form has not ever been made before but a computer completely generated that from understanding the references within that photo so if it's a horse on the moon doing whatever like it understands what a horse is understands what the moon is and it like can put those together and generate an image that has never been made before and those kind of things are almost unbelievable as in I know we always say unbelievable but that is almost unbelievable that that kind of thing just can happen because for someone like me who cannot draw a ball it's it's like well I can make these images that are just so much better than I could ever ever dream of like doing and then there's plenty of use cases after that which is product imagery like you see all these d2c brands with X drink in colored background like you're gonna have a ton of those images you could even have ads being optimized like AI could be writing the copy and showing and generating an image and then all of a sudden it'll swap and change a few things and it'll see what that CTR was much better best go with this one and then they just optimize it automatically you can see that that is definitely going to be happening I just can't see how Ai and like advertising doesn't come to you set up something say I'm selling subscriptions to my newsletter or anything and you just sort of give it a prompt and say that it'll generate copy it'll generate images and it'll run the ads test the ads and get you the most like bang for your buck I suppose it's about 6 35 a.m here and I'm just about to have my ag1 by athletic greens it's this powder that I look forward to having every single day I put it in about 10 ounces of water it contains vitamins and probiotics and Whole Food Source ingredients that really uh gets my energy up my recovery up and my focus up and I look forward to it really really every single day just like how I have my morning coffee I love having my my morning AG one so for listeners to the Pod I think you might like ag-1 too so athletic greens is offering a one-year supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five of these free travel packs with your first free purchase all you have to do is go to athleticgreens.com slash wih and and claim it I hope you enjoy it as much as I do I want to talk about what are some of the most interesting like maybe the five most interesting AI companies or projects to watch and while I give you a few seconds to think about that I want to talk about one that I downloaded this morning that I think is really cool um it's by trungfan who you probably know you know he was a writer for the hustle he writes these amazing threads on Twitter that get you know I see I saw the other day Elon Musk replies to it so if Elon Musk is replying to your threads like something's working yeah um it's called barely.ai and I believe it works with open Ai and it's focused on writers so it's AI prompts for writers so I'm pulling it up right now uh let's see what it can do so you know just to give you a sense uh you can summarize content you know you can put something in and it'll summarize all of that content uh there's some there's a function called polish clarify and expand on your ideas so you just put something in there and it will literally clarify and expand on your ideas uh create an essay outline like one of the hardest things to do if you're a writer is writing an outline uh here you have a prompt for that headlines for your blog post um you know the right headline the right hook if you're a writer is the difference between your blog post or or post getting seen by a hundred thousand people or Millions so uh help here is is is super awesome and I started using it this morning and I was like wow this is like it's not perfect but it it at least helps me like let's say create an essay outline I might be like wow I never thought about Point number seven or Point number eight or Point number six and it actually makes me feel like I have a writing partner it takes something that's really big like gtp3 and focuses it on a niche and just tries to be the best thing for that particular niche um so I'm curious what you think of that product and then I'd love for you to talk about your five most interesting AI projects and companies yeah so um when we should talk about um like AI as a partner like we should talk about that afterwards but barely AI is something I use every day I've used it before it came out like it was I was one of the early users I think I might be one of the top users and I've got some requests that should be coming out within barely AI soon as well so the reason I find it so useful is it lives in my workflow so the difference with some of these AI tools is like an AI writing tool if you have to go to another place to start writing your thing but you actually like writing in Google Docs like that's already a change of a change of scenery for you and it might already disrupt your flow and you've got like your templates you've got things that you do to write in Google Docs but then if you're using something like Jasper or copy AI you've got to go there and it's it's a point for drop off whereas barely AI is a Chrome extension so anytime I'm on a page so say I'm on a on an article that I'm thinking this would be good to put in the email today I can click the icon click executive summary and it'll summarize everything in like two sentences for me so I can use that and say okay well actually I'd write it in this way or like there's something in there that's actually helped me understand what this article is about lots of these things are very technical there's all these research papers I use barely AI for every single one of them just to check that am I understanding this this concept correctly um so for me it's been yeah invaluable for my process to like actually create stuff for the newsletter too because it helps me explain it to to try and dumb it down and try and make it a bit easier for a reader to see what this thing is about so belly AI is my top used uh AI tool I think I think we've got to give a nod to stable diffusion so they're an open like open AI has Dali that's a closed system so you can't you don't know what's going on behind the scenes there but stable diffusion open source their model they've done like they've trained on a ton of parameters they've just released stable diffusion 2.0 so it's like 1.5 was only released six weeks seven weeks ago something like that so it's it's moving really quickly I almost think that being open source is actually helping it grow that quickly um so that's out right now there's another one called lexicon and some of the some of the images that coming out of that they've got a new model dropping any day now and the the photorealism like they can even do hands like AI art generally is quite bad with like showing an actual five finger hand but this Alaska one is it's just insane like they just had today this um Polaroid versions of like like an airline crew and they just look Flawless there's metaphor search which is a metaphor systems rather which is like a new search uh experience so instead of going to Google and say who is the best female investor um you go to metaphor and you say the best female investor is and then you click enter and it'll give you like a top search and then I'll give you other people and it gives you the link to where that person's information is Wikipedia page or a personal website and things like that but also the the issue I see with something like metaphor is you've gotta you've got to write it differently you've got to type in something differently and they give you help on how to like write the prompts but I just think this in general like I don't think prompt engineering is actually valuable a valuable thing because I believe all these models and all these tools will actually like abstract that away anyway so if I'm looking for the best female investor of all time however I phrase that sentence I should have the same result or I should have the like if there is a top female investor that's what I should see at the top um it shouldn't require me to do the work so until until these systems get to that point and like the prompting sort of gets better and I mean with all of these AI systems none of them are perfect but I think it'd be a mistake to judge what AI can do in the future based on like oh well there's no the hands have got three fingers so this is stupid like yeah okay fine but now almost six weeks later there's now a hand with five fingers like people are training on these and all these open source things there's tons of people doing experiments Here There and Everywhere that we research every day so people will quickly um dismiss it because it looks stupid but it is very early still what's the uh Peter Thiel quote we asked for like rocket ships or something and all we got were 140 characters it's like we asked for you know rocket ships but all we got were hands with three fingers yeah I mean with the Google example I think the question for me is is AI a completely new paradigm like just like how social was a completely new paradigm you know it's social uh you know Google was there you know Google started in the 90s they saw Facebook they saw Myspace they saw Instagram they had to buy YouTube um and they knew that search was a big component of of the experience of of searching people of searching content but they realistically missed it um and I think that if it's a completely new paradigm if AI is a completely new paradigm it's likely that they will miss a lot of it if AI ends up becoming just merging with the consumer experience like it's a new it's it's not a new paradigm but it's a it's a new tool in the tool set and they can integrate AI into the core experience I.E they don't have to change their core experience you still go to google.com and you still like write stuff but AI is it's like assisted then I think that they would you know survive and thrive actually better in that environment and we're starting to see that second case with notion like notion just launched with uh what's it called notion AI yeah all these writing tools with like hey now you can have ai in your notion docs until motion brings everyone out and then it's like well that's redundant because I'm on your side thinking of is it is it a completely new thing like Cloud was I I do think it is but also I do also think it's a feature add-on I do think there's a bolt-on to many of these experiences where if you look at notion obviously they're going to add an AI component like all of these other writing tools and mostly based on gbt3 so there's no reason why notion also can't also be based on gbt3 and provide almost the exact same experience but if you're building a new document knowledge space whatever it calls itself with AI from the start would that look completely different and could you craft something that there actually makes sense as an AI first product but lots of these bigger companies or lots of companies in general will just be able to do most of the capabilities that a lot of these like I don't want to like downplay them but these like more throwaway products that AI is enabling so all these like Avatar AI products like there's millions of them because there's no there's no real difference it's like they're all very very similar like you ask someone what the difference is of theirs versus this one is mine's got this added style I trained the model on or this one's twenty dollars instead of thirty dollars it's like yeah okay fine that's like also I don't know that a profile picture AI product is a new big company it's probably something someone does once um and I think it's good to show that like all these Builders are like can see something can make a move on it move quickly and do something really quite spectacular in such a short amount of time but some of these things are just redundant if a different company just adds that on so like these all these writing tools there's lots of them if Google Docs had their version of AI Clippy like does that then mean that barely Jasper copy AI a lot of those sort of go down in value or just think I don't need these as much obviously there's there's big like fine tuning in in their models and stuff but like when gbt4 comes out does a lot of that go away as well like all the mode they've built up in fine tuning and putting their use cases in and putting a few shot examples in does that almost go away with advances in the actual models themselves that they're based on so that's that's a difficult thing to to judge as well because we don't know what it looked like I think the playbook for if you want to create an AI startup and sell it for a lot of money is this I think you don't build your own AI models like you leverage like a gtp3 or gtp4 you find a niche that is underserved that could benefit from prompt based AI you explore that and create an a great brand uh an experience around just like how barely AI did it focus on writers and and you launch that product then you know you do business development deals with the large incumbents and you try to get integrated as much as possible into their products and that gives you optionality to potentially sell to them it also makes them maybe hopefully less likely to actually just like say you know what we don't need you barely AI we're gonna just build it ourselves um what do you think about that I think it's tough at the moment because like so many of these tools have a lot of value and lots of them are making lots of Revenue um but lots of them are copyable like I can just go into open AI playground and have something summarized it might not be as well summarized as using some of these other tools but like I can do some or part of that kind of job and I just think lots of these tools are yeah you can copy them quite quite easily if you have the know-how and any amount of resources I don't know that I don't know what we'll see in AI like as the big companies or what the bigger opportunities are I think things like if you look at audio Labs or like um resemble AI these sort of voice cloning technologies that you can see lots of use cases for like if all podcasts will run on that if people had all this content based off voice cloning um but again what are those what are those products for people who don't know what they are resemble.ai is one of them play dot HT and audiolabs.io so there's three already there's three that you can go and like you repeat a bunch of stuff that they prompt you on the screen it'll create your voice with AI and I think I'm pretty sure that most of it is based on again open AI whisper that's the model um and then you could have a wall of text an essay whatever it is a tweet thread and it could be read out in your voice so what I've been thinking of doing is for the email that I write just at the top have an auto generated podcast version that I'm not right like reciting this every single time but I've recorded I've cloned my voice once that just gets plugged in every time and then that is what is read out um but again like three companies come out quickly with that same but the same kinds of features and the same kind of thing um there will be differences in how well they've trained it the fine tuning the examples they give and that currently is what a lot of these products moats are I think if we can call them moats at the moment because then if a new model comes out like gbt4 for example with writing tools that's why I think the prompt engineering sort of goes away is because the best of the models are the less you need to be really specific on how you're writing it if you have to give it examples if you have to do all these things but the efforts on you but really what we're getting to is the effort is not on you the AI is creating all of that stuff so I don't know I think it's I think it's interesting to see all these products lots of them are a bit samey um but I've not seen anyone other than like metaphor systems to take a tackle search so far um there's one I saw today which was storytimes.ai and I had this I had the same idea the other week um which was I was gonna have a 20 photos of my nephew he's two and a half um I was going to get loads of photos of him train a stable diffusion model on his face and turn it into like a Pixar character then have a story generated with insert whatever the AI tool I find and then create like a picture book with him like riding dinosaurs and animals and stuff like that and I had that idea and I spoke to someone last week who also said they had that same idea and then today I saw someone yesterday had posted that they built this idea so it'll be really interesting but I think a lot of these companies they need to be quick they need to raise a lot of money like you've seen a few of them they've raised money and they they're sort of pushing out ahead and they've got lots of Big Marketing campaigns to like be the first mover um I I and I just don't know how it's all going to play out because it is it is early internal tools the software you build to help your team operate better dictates how fast every team from Engineers to sales reps can execute but you know this building internal tools from scratch and maintaining them takes a ton of engineering time and tedious work retool is a much faster way to build internal tools has a complete library of 100 plus fully featured accessible UI components that you can just drag and drop any interface and retools platform lets you build the custom internal tools your team needs 10 times faster it's one platform to build your interface all you have to do is connect any data source or API and you can publish employee facing apps in record time it's also pretty flexible you can write custom code nearly anywhere to customize how your app looks and works in app environments SSO permissions and other critical app functionality are all available right out of the box the result well you can build production grade internal tools without the wasted effort of Googling component libraries debugging dependencies or rewriting boilerplate code thousands of teams at companies like Amazon doordash NBC and our own company lay checkout collaborate around custom build retool apps to operate faster and better also teams up to five can build retool apps for free so we're big fans I'm a big fan of of retool if you want to learn more about retool you can just check it out at retool.com what are the social implications of AI you know when you talked about the Steve Jobs and Joe Rogan interview that's you know using your words magical but it's also a bit like makes me feel weird yeah it just makes me feel weird there's like probably a bunch of AI ideas that would be in the category of makes me feel weird for example like our loved ones that pass away and having caught and having the ability to have conversations with those people it might feel good but it also might make us feel weird um so can you talk a little bit more about social implications in AI yeah I mean I'm not very well versed other than what I've what I've sort of made my own thoughts about which if there's I mean everyone's I always my job is to sort of look at all the good things about it and look at everything in a positive light and think wow how amazing all this stuff like we get to use all this um but also Bad actors have all of that information too and they're probably using it and they've got access to all these open source models on AI and who's to say what's right and what's wrong with when they have closed systems and there's a lot of chatter about all of that and I I have no I have no answers for people there um and I just my thought on it is we're going to be able to tell actually I think I'm going to contribute myself but I'll carry on anyway I think we're going to be able to tell like they'll be there'll be a system that you can plug in or say tell me if this video is fake and it'll say fake or whatever like there'll be there's AI systems I've seen a few research research papers on like detecting what actually is already AI generated and even Google is not like ranking AI generated blog posts and I don't actually know or any content rather I don't really know how they do that but there's there are ways to detect what is generated by AI and I feel like there'd be systems in place that way but also it's probably gonna be as like few and far between as things are now so if someone if someone's using Photoshop and photoshop's an image of me and you doing something that we shouldn't be then like it's only up to us to say that didn't happen we didn't do that type thing but if this image looks Flawless and looks exactly like us that's a difficult thing to then sort of go against and AI can do that like you look at Twitter today you don't know what tweet is actually telling the truth like so much of it is hearsay or or just made up stuff like you just you don't know you don't know who's telling the truth today in the future you're not gonna know not only if it's the truth but is this Ben who's tweeting this or is this an AI plus no code that like has tweeted this thing yeah but also today is could this be a Ghostwriter that works for Ben writing this stuff like this still is still all the same stuff that we have to deal with now but it's just like it'll be on another level because things can be generated so quickly and so to such an extreme and to such accurate accuracy that seems like yeah but I heard Steve Jobs saying that to Joe Rogan and until you know well Steve Jobs never that never happened like that's that's where it is so I yeah it's a tough one I don't I hope I'm sure there's plenty of people way smarter than me trying to figure this stuff out on I'll be here to to link to it when when it when they come up with that stuff but yeah I don't know I think it's tough but I'm I'm just hoping for the best but I know it's it's a problem already so um I think AI just probably adds to it Ai and creators good thing or a bad thing great thing it's probably the best thing to happen to a Creator I don't know why anyone thinks differently it's again a Photoshop example having an AI tool at your disposal is like having a Photoshop expert at your disposal if I'm making a video or need to have a podcast edited or I want to make a a promo video for something things like Runway which is a creative video tool and their marketing videos are insane and they're all created in Runway like you can just type scenes that you want to see like walking down an Alleyway in Tokyo at night and it'll like change and erase street lights so I don't want that building there let's put this dog in that in that image there instead um you can just do so much more with so much less yeah I I look at it the same way like glass half full how do you how do you use these tools to supercharge you versus use these tools to cut you you know I think we're both optimistic in that sense so I I completely agree with you I read recently that Kathy Wood famous hedge fund manager has said that AI is deflationary and you know she says it's deflationary I think because if people are going to be using AI to run their businesses and they might need less writers they might need less designers they might need less engineers uh their profits you know could go up and they're also able to pass on uh cost savings to to their customers do you agree that AI is deflationary well I can see a world where that sort of stuff happens where you need less physical writers because one can maybe do the work of three if you're producing content like that obviously very specific very contextual writing needs someone from that experience to to talk about stuff so AI can can push you and suggest things and say have you thought about this as well or like what about the safety of this and all that sort of stuff kind of like topics we're talking about but it's not going to replace creative thinking as a human and I just think that yeah if someone can do the job of three people then why why would businesses hire three when they can hire one it seems like the same argument to say that oh actually businesses are now hiring contractors to do their content writing because their CEOs don't want to do it and I'm like well yeah that's how all of this works like you hire out for things that you can't do and you're looking for someone who's the most productive person at that job to do the best job that they can so that we can do this thing and we can charge customers and we can make profits and we can like build a good business so all of those things still are in line and I don't think AI will take all of these jobs you're still going to need someone to like steer the ship and say oh no this way this way I think you need reasoning and like the experiences and everything else to like bring that together I just yeah I can't see it uh I'm gonna ask this question you're gonna hate it but I'm asking it anyways uh in five years from now biggest AI prediction so it's you know we're sitting down November 28th 2022 right now uh it's November 28th 2027. how has the internet changed and yeah what's the biggest AI prediction for then um I'll make a very bold prediction will have a company pulling in like hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and it'll be like one or two people actually running that that company that can be a bold prediction and I just I don't know what the internet looks like hopefully Twitter is still around because I need it and I like it and maybe there's a badge that says only posts AI content um maybe it's that I like that I like that a lot all right well Ben this has been awesome if people want to get their feet wet in the world of AI what do you suggest well of course I'd recommend checking out Ben's bites so that's Ben spite stop beehive b-e-e-h-i-iiv.com soon we'll change to the custom domain but yeah Ben's bites um I just try and dump everything down and summarize everything daily so that there's so much there's so much going on there's research there's demos there's products I just put it all into one email for um checking out in five minutes or less I love it I'm a subscriber my open rate's 100 it's just it's really exciting it's exciting to be seeing all these new tools coming out almost almost every day like it feels like almost every day right and and just playing around with it like if I could recommend people do anything uh Founders Executives at startups uh Executives at large companies is just to like play play with it and and then you'll start going on walks or working out and you'll be like oh wow here's an idea for AI and then you can start you know take it from there so uh Ben's bites definitely it helps get the juices flowing so thank you for that uh if you enjoyed this uh please please give us a YouTube subscription or a a review on Spotify and apple podcast it does make a big difference and we don't have that many YouTube subscribers and we don't have that many reviews so uh I look at all of them uh so thanks for listening again and see you soon [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcoming Jack butcher to the show um selfishly I wanted to catch up with Jack and figured the only way he'd catch up with me would be on a show public not true not true you know you never know you never know um there's two areas I want to get into today Jack uh so one is just learning about visualized value how you structure the business and the other area is just how you're thinking about web3 yep [Music] um but let's start with for those of you who don't know you what visualized value is and maybe if you can talk through a little bit about the vision and actually our friend Aaron Alto had a really amazing map that he drew about really like a Walt Disney map almost of like the the vision of a lot of ways visualize value and I was hoping you can maybe walk us through a little bit about that yeah sure yeah sounds good man let me do a 30 seconds of context setting so my professional background is in graphic design study graphic design and got started on the internship circuit in London straight out of school working for tiny little Design Studios and um had a couple friends that were going to New York I went out to New York on a whim set 150 emails to Craigslist classified ads to try and get some a design internship while I was in New York got one response it worked out and uh kind of got into the New York agency scene and moved around there for about eight or ten years bunch of different jobs bunch of different scales of businesses so I started out in like a boutique branding agency doing like little independent businesses restaurants stuff like that went to huge consulting firms 15 000 employees doing like massive redesigns of big digital products and websites and you know like complete opposite experience of that worked in um a couple other agencies after that that were smaller that specialized in different things uh like an experiential agency that would do point of sale stuff in stores Museum exhibits stuff like that so basically got a little bit of exposure to every like little Avenue of like graphic design in a professional context I guess and then come about late 2017 had the I guess the naivety and arrogance to think that I could start my own agency and do it better than everybody else that I'd worked for in the past and uh I think to some degree like your energy when you're that age is like what gives you the advantage but you obviously have to have the skills to build a business and hire people and you know get to the scale that the people that you're working with need you to be in order to interact with you right like you have to play the role of everyone to begin with and that's what I did for the first six or nine months and I burned out horribly so this is beginning of 2019 and that the like genesis of the idea that created visualized value was basically the in the agency process or in the agency environment I should say the process where I was I think retroactively thinking about it adding the most value was in the pitch process so I'd sit down and you know there's 10 people in a room and you try and distill all of these ideas into a compelling narrative to go and take to a client and ask them for six figures seven figures whatever it might have been at the time in the different agencies and that process I've found very rewarding and it was almost the thing that nobody else wanted to work on at least in the places where I was is like this is the thing that you have to get there first for and you leave last and it's kind of a thankless job a lot of the times you're just doing the production work of putting together PowerPoint slides basically and um then I realized after burning out trying to do everything as an agency uh owner I was like okay I'm just going to focus on this and the name visualized value actually came kind of in collaboration with an early client who I think used that phrase it's like oh like we have all this intangible value you're able to help us visualize it and that was really the guiding principle from that point forward was just working with people who have ideas that they find difficult to explain or they have businesses that are intangible right if you're not selling a pair of jeans no one can like look at your product and say I want to buy that so a lot of our early clients were service businesses software companies uh people that build things that you can't like see traditionally and then visualize value social channels came as a device for basically finding leads for that service business so I was visualizing these Concepts that I thought had like broader appeal so the books that I I'm reading at the time or people that were like remote mentors to me through whether it was Twitter or books that I've been reading take their ideas add this visual context to it and that's where the social unlock came from so finding ideas that other people had already kind of perfected add some visual context they retweeted it my network grows as a function of that and then originally that led to us some more service work but then there came a point where the so the demand for service work kind of exceeded my ability to deliver on it and that's when visualized value became a product business it's about 6 35 a.m here and I'm just about to have my ag1 by athletic greens it's this powder that I look forward to having every single day I put it in about 10 ounces of water it contains vitamins and probiotics and Whole Food Source ingredients that really uh gets my energy up my recovery up and my focus up and I look forward to it really really every single day just like how I have my morning coffee I love having my my morning agey one so for listeners to the Pod I think you might like ag-1 too so athletic greens is offering a one-year supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five of these free travel packs uh with your first free purchase all you have to do is go to athleticgreens.com slash wih and and claim it I hope you enjoy it as much as I do when you were sort of remixing other people's content and adding a visual element on it were you like did you have a grand plan being like hey I'm gonna go and create social content and my plan is to get to 100 000 followers within 12 months or was it more naive than that in the sense of like you kind of followed your curiosity 100 100 more naive so uh this I was really new to Twitter as a platform too so I wasn't really aware of the fact that people of huge stature many many steps ahead of me were like waking up and checking their Twitter every day like the first couple weeks I was on Twitter I just I didn't I didn't understand how people used it as a platform I thought it was another like you know Facebook fan pages for example like people have that stuff uh made for them or they have teams managing it and stuff like that so I think like this really weird uh Arbitrage thing became clear to me it's like wow the people who I'm making this about are actually reading it as soon as that idea clicked it was an accident that I figured that out but as soon as that clicked I started to lean into that more for sure yeah I feel like you started doubling down because it's like a positive reinforcement Loop you're like okay and let's be honest we're all addicted to the likes and Retreats to a certain extent even if it's subconscious it's just like a pad on the back yep so it's like oh that thing performed well maybe this thing will perform well that's kind of similar and then you kind of just like before you know it you're on that treadmill indeed indeed yeah yeah yeah yeah and that probably was six or nine months of doing that before anything meaningful like that was it was a good a good amount of time between that transition from like the slow drip of you know maybe one or two people reaching out by email a week and saying like do you do commissions or can we sit down and work on something together I'm trying to think weirdly enough I know you I saw on Twitter just before we got on here you were interviewing David perel today it was actually a David perrell tweet that was the Genesis for the first product that we put out seriously put out there was a couple little experiments before that but our first like education product which was focused on the design style of visualized value was prompted by a David perrell tweet so you were following David perrell who writes about writing on Twitter he puts out a piece of content that's around productizing something via education or something like that that prompts well he actually no he actually said the skill that I'm trying to learn next is design and he tagged me in that post and then that was the you know that was the Catalyst for saying who else is interested in this I think I quote retweeted it it got a decent amount of attention I mean by today's standard not a huge amount honestly but it was enough at that point in in uh my Twitter journey to be like okay there's a there's more than you know half a dozen people that are signaling that they would pay for something like this so I'm going to put it together you know when I was coming up the Lean Startup was such a important book yeah yeah and it was a book about how do you you know test ideas iterate validate the ideas and this whole loop around it and I feel like that was very very much based on a web and buying traffic right web pages like now it's more social based I feel like like he tweeted at you you retweeted it you got some validation then you're like hey it's probably worth it to spend some hours dedicate to this and see if I can build a product yeah and I think even if you didn't build a product like just the direction that that points you in in terms of the content you start creating or the things you start talking about it's all as you say like just leading you in a more pointed Direction than just like spray and pray hear uh you know I think there was already some direction based on the fact I was looking for Consulting clients but I never really thought of myself as an educator or somebody who should be creating materials to educate people until someone asked me to do it and that like making that leap I think is uh quite empowering when you're making the material when somebody's asked you to do it right as opposed to you like just sitting down at a keyboard with a blank piece of paper and saying I'm going to teach people this this and this um knowing that there's a demand to learn it before and that doesn't necessarily have to be someone asking you directly that could be another Trend that you're observing I do think there was something distinct about visualized value that helps Channel some demand because this is actually when I was developing it I think I started with like design right here's a design course it's like that's just so ridiculously broad I have no idea where to start and then it narrowed down it became the title of it is how to visualize value so it's a very very narrow subset of design like how do you take an idea and use Simple geometry to turn it into a concept that people can look at and read visually and that like narrowed it down to the point where it feels like manageable both from like teaching and consuming I would imagine yeah some takeaways I have from that is well one is there's there's almost this invisible hand that exists on social that as you put out content there's this like invisible hand that's saying like put out more of this content or hey this product that you know you should probably go and build it so it's trust your trust the Invisible Hand I think that often we don't trust it and yeah for sure it's like there's a reason why people are resonating with it and then and the second lesson I have is that I'm taking from you is how much the importance of owning a phrase is um oh yeah for sure right like if visualized value was called something else like yeah graphic design it was broad as that right it's like how to how to do graphic design you just can't you don't build equity in that idea the same way and people just don't latch onto it I feel like we under index for naming a ton I 100 agree yeah yeah for sure like I spend so much time thinking about names like I have a a note in in iOS where I have like a million names and you know I follow New York Times new word mention you know what I'm talking about yeah yeah the Twitter account yeah yeah the Twitter account where it's like the first appearance of a word in the New York Times so like let's say like visualize value is published in the New York Times for the first time ever this Twitter account is going to public is going to tweet it and it kind of gives you some hint as to where culture is going and there's opportunities to buy those domains create products around that curious your thoughts on naming yeah I 100 agree and there's if you go back to that map idea the couple of other things that exist on that map after we created how to visualize value the second product was called build once sell twice which is like a meta commentary on if you have a skill set and you can organize it and productize it in a way that can transmit it to other people you can essentially build it once and sell it infinitely zero cost of replication and again you could find a way to describe that generically and it's not compelling at all versus you have this forward phrase that people are repeating back to you after you've said it three times yeah and I think uh what I love about uh build one sell twice is it fits into that category of like like a mantra um it's something that people can say repeatedly keeps them grounded it reminds me of um the founder of shopify's arm the rebels and yeah that's great Stuart Butterfield the founder of slack has we don't sell Saddles here I think it's important you know when you're coming up with an idea for a product or you want to come up with an idea for a product based on an audience which is what you had is thinking about what are different phrases that could come to mind um and what are uh emerging phrases um and how could you own them yeah yeah I think that's a lot of that came from the advertising world too you know when you're like in a war room in an agency environment and you have to distill this entire Brand Story or product story into something that fits on a subway ad or you know a banner or uh out of home ad that somebody's driving past at 70 miles an hour that muscle memory I think that I picked up in those environments definitely helped teach me the lesson that language is just incredibly powerful the first guy I ever worked for was a creative director with a writing background and that you know as I came out of school I put way I'd put so much more emphasis on how something looked or the you know the nuances of the visuals because I was a graphic designer um and then when you get into a commercial environment you start to get introduced to like what persuasion is what advertising is and how even looking at like print ads if you if you run through like uh David Ogilvy annual or any kind of OG advertising character they've got these print ads where there's five words on a piece of paper and you just like knocks you over how clever it is this is another lesson that I learned from being a designer is going into interviews and thinking that I was going to have to present my you know degree the way I thought about everything and like kind of communicate my perspective versus just showing up and opening my portfolio they and people look at it and be like that's good how much of that did you do do you want a job right and there was this one example that still stands out in my mind there was an agency that I always wanted to work for that used to do uh kind of spec work so they would just mock something up that they wanted to work on like they would say let's imagine the future of air travel this is in like 2012 and then mocking up these like incredibly thoughtful UI and ux patterns and animating them they didn't write any software they were just showing their vision for the space and then once they'd done all that work all the clients would come to them like Virgin Atlantic American Airlines Delta whoever else would be like we basically just want to put our logo in the top left hand side of the work that you've already done and that was so different than the agency environment that I've been in where clients would send you a request and they would often have misdiagnosed their own problem right there they've gotten to a point where they've made a bunch of decisions internally and they're like we need a campaign for this versus you know coming to you and saying we're not selling enough of these or like we want more of these types of people to buy our stuff they don't really at least in the environments that I was in didn't approach the problem that way versus this agency that I admired that would kind of create these magnets where here's what we're capable of here's the type of work we're interested in doing we've already done a bunch of the work and the thinking come and get involved and that I think translated over time to me it it's kind of reflected in that uh what we talked about with making the visuals for people without their permission just trying to add some visual context to these ideas I already appreciated and seeing the kind of Ripple effects of that so permissionless Apprentice is a really uh simple curriculum that talks about that idea of starting projects without permission using the internet to create opportunity attract collaborators clients etc etc it's a dollar and it's like the the portal into it's the first stop on that map that Aaron Drew that's really like starting to hopefully Prime a way of thinking that will make you uh much more able to take advantage of the vast opportunities that exist on the internet with a few tweaks to how you think about publishing your work when I think about visualized value it's different portals that are basically education community and tools to help you unlock pieces of the internet is that yeah that's excellent there I have to have to run that back clip that okay so you've built this ecosystem and you didn't talk about daily manifest which really in my opinion is the entry to you know the entry portal can you actually talk a little bit about that so we skipped over that that was actually the first product so before the David perel thing that we talked about um when I was making this transition from like agency burned out crazy like everyone else has control over your day right you're just like reacting to meetings and deadlines that are being set externally once I decided to stop doing that I had to like consciously make an effort to plan out my days and the daily manifest was like this little tool that I used to scribble out on a piece of A4 paper and uh when I was putting content out on Instagram sharing all these ideas that I was really latching on to what they were really helping me like think about how to build uh visualized value or transition it into a proper brand and business from this like chaotic service world I was living in a lot of the feedback I got from people was time management you know I'm procrastinating I can't manage my days I don't know how to like consistently work on something and the daily manifest was just like a test product I was like okay I'll take this thing that I write down every day formalize it basically put into a template in figma and uh package it up and give people access to the PDF and a community on the side so you buy the plan with the plan comes or the by the template sorry and with the template comes access to what was at the time of WhatsApp group and I think I sold it for nine bucks and I got probably 60 people in a few months to buy that so you know nothing nothing outrageous but again some validation and an opportunity to just talk to people one-on-one that were already interested in the stuff that visualized value was talking about and uh yeah that product is now free there's uh fifteen thousand twenty thousand downloads at this point and that is really the the foundation for all of these ideas is you know carve out a certain amount of time a day where you can start to work on something that will compound over time start to figure out what it is that you can do that is unique to you or that and a an Arbitrage opportunity that exists based on your experience and the fact that you have access to anyone in the world you have to kind of get to a point where you do something long enough to see a return start to happen and I think that you know I had the I guess the luxury of making that transition from already having some connections in the design world and had some service work going on if I was starting from scratch this was the tool that I thought would be the most helpful to kind of stay on track and start to record what's happening in real time so you can look back on it because we have a very strong tendency to kind of forget the evidence in favor of progress we're making right like even now you look at the stuff you're putting out and compare it to two three years ago it's improved massively but if you're not consciously making a record of that and reflecting on it very hard to see that I don't know if this was intentional with daily manifest but what you did with daily manifest is what I call building a community magnet and the old way of thinking about it you know from the advertising world too which is like a lead magnet which is yeah how do you create a piece of software or a product that people want access to and in return you get their information which you can then sell them things what you did was you created something free daily manifest which we focused on a niche that you understood well because at the same time you were building the social presence on Instagram and Twitter today you have hundreds of thousands of followers on both but back then when you're starting out you know you had a few thousand followers but it was enough to get started so now all of a sudden you have these people in your WhatsApp group and it's like oh hey like what do we share in common what do we you know what are we building here like what what could I build for you and it was basically like a very cheap quote-unquote way of having co-founders really in something yeah yeah yeah yeah uh it's very hard to even understand what attracts somebody to the thing you've built even after you've built it and gone through that process a bunch of times so even just having conversations about like you know why why does visualized value resonate with you which of the visuals was it that caught your attention first and just trying to really understand which uh pieces of all of the things that we put out are the most um are the most interesting or the most useful to people and then drilling down into those things and building more stuff around those insights has been the has been the formula since since starting it and it's still the formula now if you were to ask me what is the formula to the success of visualized value the formula for me is you focused on a niche that you understood really well you built a set of phrases that you owned you gave a lot of value up front you created a community magnet you owned an aesthetic the aesthetic of visualized value when you were posting and still posting to this day on Instagram and Twitter is you were like the reason why it turned heads of David perrell Etc was because we just never saw images like that um it was so simple your color palette was black and white that level just wasn't posted often and especially with the consistency the be consistent of you know every day like I see you even to this day like you're constantly tweeting you know the way I see it is you're putting you know idea germs out there and you're seeing what is resonating what isn't resonating and then you're storing that in your jack butcher brain which is so amazing and you're kind of like oh I should do this with that and while you're doing all this you're building new products new educational products new communities you're selling things we haven't talked about web3 and we will but you're selling things on Foundation nfts Etc um but thank you for explaining a little bit about how we got here where are we today with the business and you know where are you going with it sure yeah I think um one of the things and this is the first um conversation I'm having publicly about some of these Milestones so visualized value has also started mid pandemic or like early pandemic so there were a lot of different Tailwinds that made it popular at the beginning that I you know was aware of at the time but in hindsight with like Behavior changing back closer to what it was before the pandemic there's a few a few ways in which that's affected the business so obviously I don't have any metrics on it somebody's probably done this research but maybe screen time was up three four five x two years ago and everybody's just sat in front of their computer all day long and we didn't know how long this thing was gonna last and everybody's trying to figure out how to become more economically resilient like start participating on the internet et cetera Etc so this is like blowing up at the same time that visualized value is building all these digital resources I think that was 2020. so our biggest like it just exploded in 2020 that was like you know critical mass got to probably 10 000 students by the end of 2020 from the summer um last year nft craziness visualized value is still growing on the community and education side but not at the same clip it was in 2020 still does very well but the nft narrative actually I think consumed a lot of the people that were interested in visualized value previously so I'm sure you've seen this too like the idea of the Creator economy as a label for people who are interested in making they're living on the internet you know terminally online people a lot of those people transitioned into web 3 nfts things of that nature so I kind of again taking cues from the people that are consuming the stuff that I'm making or a part of the community of visualized value paying attention to the things that are interesting to them is also kind of part of the job so I say part of the job it's also like where I'd have naturally gravitate to as well like I'm I'm interested in the same thing so I'm kind of a consumer of the same things and uh that led me to start playing around with nfts personally in March of last year and the really amazing thing about that originally is kind of the thought that the art itself became the product versus the art being this proxy or this like thing you use to get attention to then have to build products build these additional things on the other side of the art in order to make the art sustainable and I think you could take either side of that argument now because obviously that was heavily propped up by a maniacal market last year so there's a sustainable like I think nfts do offer a sustainable way for artists to make money but there's also that is contingent on their ability to like build and maintain a network which I think visualize value had proven before I even knew what an nft was and that's why that's why it was successful and in the conversations I've had with people that have collected the work that's basically what they're looking for right it's like my bet is on the fact that the visualized value Network continues to grow into the future and nfts represent you know a bet on that Network and you know a piece of art that I want to hang up on my wall or stare at on my computer whichever whichever takes you fancy but the um the education piece of the business last year definitely shifted like attention shifted to nfts that stuff's still sold but if you think of it like an adoption curve what started to happen is I started to notice like companies more interested in some of these ideas so visualize value as a product that can help a company articulate their value proposition versus a person we still like it does really feel like an adoption curve where you're going from the like Niche Twitter you know this is a new trendy interesting thing that I want to master to this is like now a piece of your social media strategy like this is a new way for you to communicate with people so it's kind of gone from The Fringe of Twitter to small businesses and like a lot of the stuff that I've been working on the background is way more tedious than messing about on Twitter all day but longer sales cycles of getting this stuff into small businesses medium-sized businesses ultimately Enterprise over time but that's like I see the the kind of each of the products is slowly maturing into different parts of the market and then I spend a bunch of my time playing around at the edges you know the web 3 the nft stuff which you're getting is probably a long way away from being at the top of its adoption curve and I think you share that same thesis is we're a way away from that but we're there's there's so much interesting stuff happening so many cool ways to play around with it that um yeah that's the business is kind of uh it like Trails my interest by about six months you know like the stuff that I learn and the stuff that becomes like a proven something that I can prove I can then like codify backwards into a product and continue to like stay on the edge and try and learn and then put that stuff back into the stuff that we offer does that make sense it does so basically 2020 was a whirlwind education and Community products were growing by virtue of right place right time and also write product right time um 2021 nft Mania you it you know participated in that I think like you sold tens of ether hundreds of eth you know worth of stuff correct yes um and she made hundreds of thousands of dollars if not million you know seven figures selling nfts you know fast forward to today 2022 you have basically these concurrent paths around deepening um some of your existing products and basically applying them to more Enterprise or other use cases while at the same time what you're doing is you're like okay web3 isn't exactly where we thought it would be but you're still a Believer it sounds like and you're gonna Tinker until everyone catches up with you yeah for sure and uh also listen to what the people who have supported visualized value from day one are interested in too and you know the macro promise of web3 in my opinion is kind of slowly divest ownership of this thing and and allow the people that have contributed to it for all of these years benefit from the network effect so all the Enterprise stuff is happening and there's also a lot of like little products spinning up from within the community itself so the idea there being either it's a co-branded thing or it's just lives uh you know it just benefits from the distribution that VV now has but there are you know say half a dozen products that have been Community built within the last six months you know people find each other in Discord or they uh see something that someone else is working on on Twitter and they get involved in that project it's built by the VV community and by virtue of having you know a couple hundred thousand followers on the on a few social platforms we could get the first hundred users for that product right we can get something from zero to one way faster than somebody who would be trying to build the distribution and the product at the same time so it feels like it's getting to that level of maturity where it can be this kind of decentralized product studio uh and then would almost come full circle on some other things where visualized value can now partner with a startup that needs help articulating their value proposition but do it now with a lot more Authority and benefit that we can send back to anybody we'd partner with because we can distribute that stuff too so you know say we partner with a startup that needs help with their raising their series a and they need to articulate exactly their results over the last two years the concepts and the Tailwinds and the trends that made their business successful will do that and eventually I want to get the community involved in doing that so you almost make this Marketplace of people who've gone through all these education products and learned how to visualize value and companies individuals people that just want to pay somebody to do that put them together and use the distribution of visualized value to get more attention on everybody in that scenario so honestly it's kind of overwhelming there's a lot of different directions you could take it in but that's another thing that's you know another area that we're playing around with I actually um bought venturewith2vs.com so uh watch this space for that that's going to be a under construction there isn't a domain with two v's available anymore with you no no no no we're buying them all up volume all up I uh I love that I think one of the things you're hitting upon which I think is brilliant is this idea around once you've aggregated audience and community you've and you're essentially trained people with your way of how you see the world there's a set of products to be built for them and also with them so an example of that would be Dickie Bush and Nicholas Cole uh ship 30 for 30 which is a great program where it teaches people how to write for the internet and they you know people post every day 30 shipping 30 tweets a day or 30 threads a day they built a product called typeshare typeshare.io and like their product is so useful in the course um so they're like training people and then they've got this amazing product that they can do right and just sort of onboard it and you know one of the hardest parts about building a startup as you know is just the distribution is just a heading and so if you have that solved then you know you could do a lot of stuff yeah exactly the world is your oyster so I think you have that solved right you have 25 000 plus people who've gone through visualized value in some shape or form and they all have this you know some you know there's different segments to it right you have your daily manifest people you have your build ones sell twice people you know you have different segments and even within that there's niches within there there might be more web three people might be more web two people and then you have to ask yourself what are what is the product that I can build for them SAS style SAS multiples right forget you know service business that's what I would be doing I'd be I would be looking at how do I build products for these people and on a consistent basis for sure yeah there's we got a few uh a few under construction right now so we'll see we'll see we'll be testing them testing the waters but yeah there's definitely this feedback loop that takes a massive amount of time but also like requires you to go through these iterations of like gradually making the business less dependent on your time or one for one exchange right time for money so the really really bad version of the agency business is like I'll do anything for anyone that's like version zero and then version one is like I'm gonna do this very specific thing for everyone and then version two is I'm gonna do this very specific thing for a very specific person etc etc you know how that goes and then eventually you get to the point where I have this distribution and people know what the brand is about and that gives me the optionality to make a tool that people want to use and I don't have to change the functionality of that thing for everyone because I have the distribution to get it out there um I forget this quote you probably know uh you probably know it exactly but it was like second time founder first time founder versus second time founder the second time Founder's always going to pick distribution but I forget what the I forget what the comparison is between I mean it doesn't even matter the point is like distribution is King and getting distribution is fighting what's the expression tooth and nail it's like you have to kind of just like you're grabbing a customer over here you're grabbing a customer over there and like every day you can get you know one or two customers is an incredible day and and then there's churn and then it's like then you have to fight the churn battle and it's just like battle after battle and you know what's amazing about the Empire that you've built is that you have not endless people but you have people that are willing to test the products that you create and that's the thing that I think people are starting to realize about creators and in general is the op I mean you obviously you saw Kim Kardashian raise that PE fund like hey it's it's starting to hit mainstream where it's like if you combine a creator bonus points of that Creator if that Creator is focused on a particular Niche like with high Affinity yeah High trust like you've built a lot of trust with your community and I've been in your community I've done a talk in your community I've seen firsthand how trust trust how much trust they have in you once you have that trust and that audience and you combine that with product Builders who know to iterate that who are who are building non-cookie cutter products with a unique aesthetic that's the formula for like the next wave yeah I agree the brand or the individual that I think Affinity first is is uh a great way to put it it's like you can imagine it's not really white labeling but it's if this product is useful to more than 50 of the people that are already here then we both benefit from it being you know pushed out via the distribution of visualize value and this is where the web 3 my fascination with web3 comes in as an infrastructure layer to enable that permissionless contribution and run in experiments and um there's more of a legal and um you know entity debate around how to make that happen and obviously behavior and people like being open to doing that but a lot of it is like how value is exchanged in the real world is more held up by the rules then it is the technology that makes it possible does that make sense internal tools the software you build to help your team operate better dictates how fast every team from Engineers to sales reps can't execute but you know this building internal tools from scratch and maintaining them takes a ton of engineering time and tedious work retool is a much faster way to build internal tools it has a complete library of 100 plus fully featured accessible UI components that you can just drag and drop any interface and retools platform lets you build the custom internal tools your team needs 10 times faster it's one platform to build your interface all you have to do is connect any data source or API and you can publish employee-facing apps in record time it's also pretty flexible you can write custom code nearly anywhere to customize how your app looks and works in app environments SSO permissions and other critical app functionality are all available right out of the box the result well you can build production grade internal tools without the wasted effort of Googling component libraries debugging dependencies or rewriting boilerplate code thousands of teams at companies like Amazon doordash NBC and our own company lay checkout collaborate around custom build retool apps to operate faster and better also teams up to five can build retool apps for free so we're big fans I'm a big fan of of retool if you want to learn more about retool you can just check it out at retool.com so I feel like the fascination for you around web3 is is twofold I feel like it's one because you're in the business of visualizing value how do you distribute the value in for all the people involved where it's just like automatic you know like you know I made a coffee this morning and one of those automatic coffee machines and I pressed cappuccino and I just like press the cappuccino button and then like I don't know how it you know how it worked but like the milk was froth and the beans were grinded and in the water like that's web3 at scale is like the automatic cappuccino maker basically so I think the cappuccino maker piece you like and the other piece is just the art piece right like if you're gonna create art why not give people the opportunity to collect it yeah and if you're like gonna support a network if you're gonna give your time energy anything you're going to contribute anything to a network then the technology that exists to share upside in the growth of that network is uh currently limited but with time over time that's I think the the web 3 promise right it's like I've spent hundreds or thousands of hours sharing posts from this thing or talking in the Discord or making suggestions for what to do next or contributing to a product and in like an internet native World hiring everybody as a contractor or a W-2 employee that wants to contribute to the network is just not possible like it's literally not possible so the friction that you can remove by tokenizing some of that process is uh is what's very interesting but I think a lot of it is both behavior and just structuring entities and a lot of my frustration with web3 is people go okay come at it from the wrong end you don't need any of that technology to build the bond between the people necessarily I think there are a few examples where like you know people who built ethereum for example have a common goal and an incredible like Bond over the technology itself but you know to try and spin up a community just based on the fact it's uh the same thing that already exists but there's some web3 infrastructure from xero I find it hard to believe that you can like rally people around something like that for a long time versus standing for something for a number of years putting out art in this case that a lot of people identify with and then just integrating technology as it becomes more uh appropriate to do so or any technology that makes the your relationship with that brand or that Network Superior in some way you can integrate it but you know visualized value still continues to be visualized value whether with or without that but the advances that happen there can improve it with time it's uh you know October November let's say it's November 2030. what does the internet look like inside jack butcher's brain man I honestly think the world is going to be just so bizarre by that point in time it's gonna be crazy man like I'll make your life easier here will we be using Twitter in 2030 oh I'm gonna say no I think we're going like fractured networks will spin off my vision as like maybe Twitter is a protocol right that isn't called Twitter and visualize value for example is the network versus existing on a Twitter or uh Instagram or wherever else like I think the promise of this over the long term is this frictionless movement between networks and everything that people create can kind of be ported across these different networks I think I don't know how that's going to happen but it feels to me like that is the prevailing desire and I think we'll figure out a way to you know to get that I don't think the Twitter I don't think Twitter the way it currently works is a sustainable way for us to communicate for much longer it feels like it's starting to break in my opinion there's also the Wild Card of Elon Musk and and Co and how much they're going to change the product and backlashes from the change for the for the bet you know they might change it for the better or they might change it for the worse and you might just see you know we've seen in you know for example we've seen social networks have exoduses before um you know I was at StumbleUpon and stumbled upon was bigger than Reddit and that's crazy that's crazy to think it was bigger than Reddit and at one point bigger than Twitter and they StumbleUpon had a famous redesign and their redesign everyone was like this is horrible and they went to Reddit and Reddit became Reddit because of the redesign so there is a non-zero chance that there is a large redesign or reframing of how Twitter works that completely alienates a group of people and they move to other platforms I think the yeah maybe I should have answer should have been I think the intention is for it to not be Twitter by 2030 right if uh Elon hangs on to it he wants to turn it into a the X right exactly the everything app which is I think WeChat inspired or at least like analogous to WeChat right everything digital is happening there but yeah I mean it's incredibly hard to build these things and obviously there are a lot of people try we'll see what happens um so Twitter we'll see okay what else how about will my dad own an nft in 2030 oh yes yes what will my dad's first nft be it'll probably be like uh loyalty card or a plane ticket or uh concert to something like that you know something that's like membership oriented in some way come like uh to interact with a business in some fashion I reckon right yeah I think that's I think that's right I think he'll go somewhere and and the nft will give him either some access to something um or commemorate it and but there'll be some incentive for him to to do it and I think with so much like we work with a lot of athletic we work with like a ton of big Brands doing loyalty stuff and there's just loyalty is going to be huge with with web 3. yeah and I think this uh like portability of affinity and like the power of trust and attention having instruments that are uh like reward that feels to me like that's a natural progression a natural response to how the world is organizing itself and the type of things that we value as we value collectively is web3 is one of those things I think we saw this uh with Reddit which was basically the most like the antithesis of the nft argument for so long right I was like nfts are destroying the world they're stupid they're idiotic blah blah but I'm gonna spend 10 hours a day contributing to this platform generate gobloads of advertising revenue for you know a handful of people and then when you interact with this technology where it's like oh yeah there is I have created a bunch of value for this platform therefore this proxy for the value I've created is worth some money because there's a status signal I can send on this network I think it becomes really obvious when you interact with it that there's something intrinsically interesting to people about it uh but I understand why people who have never interacted with it think it's completely moronic I completely understand okay last one let's do it okay oh with all this you know gtp3 Dolly stuff and not getting bigger and bigger in 2030 will there be more graphic designers or less graphic designers than there are today interesting I think I think less people calling themselves graphic designers but more people doing graphic design and inverted commas more people like generating visuals whether that's like through a text interface or like sitting down and uh I kind of view it like the you know if you were a graphic designer in the 60s you have this like wooden drawing board where you're like sliding rules across and you know taking out Letterpress type forms and gluing them on one by one from that transition to Adobe Illustrator there's a huge leap in technology and then there's you know the ability to create prompts there's still going to be differentiated outputs based on the talent of the person who has been who's using the technology so I think in general I think a lot of these titles would just kind of fade away and it's like Greg and Jack these are the things that we do and we're interested in and this is our Network versus there's that good there's a great meme about like job titles in the past job titles in the future I'm sure you've seen it and like it goes from yeah I don't know uh blacksmith to gpt3 prompt engineer or Discord Community manager and uh I don't know I just think job titles in general are probably gonna be uh not as prominent in our culture in 10 20 30 years time especially for the terminally online like ourselves terminally online I love it I love how you call us it's true we are terminally online that is we are sick but it's fun it's really fun we're having you're having a good time yeah I'm having a great time man great time I met like honestly through the last three years I've met so many incredible people it's been a huge shift in the way I thought things were going to be going you know being on the agency career ladder in New York which is fine in its own way it's just different um this is like as entrepreneurship is man you don't really know what's going to happen and that's like unsettling but also very exciting so uh got the internet to thank for both of those both sides of that which is uh I don't know if I would want to be doing anything else so it's fine yeah it's a lot of fun yeah I mean that's the cool thing about Twitter and our whole world is like we put out content and we can just chat with cool people and I met you through Twitter and it's cool because like where you live like you can live in a town of 20. and as long as there's Wi-Fi you can still meet cool people and visualize value right and now we're back out touching grass as well so we're living the dream yeah exactly so without further Ado I'm actually gonna go touch some grass yeah all right good man and uh but this has been fun love your thoughts obviously on on building community-based businesses and also just web tree where things are going and people could find you where Twitter at Jack Butcher and at visualize value you can get to everything else from there cool and and you have a pod that you do as well yeah with a couple friends called not investment advice comes out on Wednesdays we just did one on uh ligma Johnson so go check that out yeah check out the Pod and uh thanks for thanks for coming man mate thanks for having me it's great [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
one of my favorite people on the show David perrell someone I've been following on the internet and I basically I think I cold reached out to you and I was just like what you're doing is amazing and you're the founder of rite of passage and I wanted to bring you on the show to talk about the business why you started it maybe some of the economics around it where you want to take it and just sort of dissect it all over the next hour or so yeah of course I could do it yeah tell us a story about rite of passage what it is maybe just a little high level yeah so and so I hated school I was a terrible student and did very poorly and I was uh kicking and screaming kid I was super unhappy for the first 20 years of my life and a lot of it was I felt like I was in a prison called school every day and I grew up thinking I can do better I can do better in terms of how a classroom environment is run but also I felt like I was gonna amount to nothing I felt like an idiot I felt stupid I felt dumb I didn't see how I was going to be able to contribute and that created a lot of nihilism and negativity in my own mind which was really hard and after college I took a course called building a second brain by Thiago Forte and I was just like wow this is this is the future cohort based live great economics and I saw how the internet was going to change the had changed the economics of Education forever we're going to go from teachers teaching at minimum 15 at most 40 students at a time to now teaching thousands hundreds of thousands and that the internet was going to fundamentally change how we thought about education and so after taking Billy a second brain about a year later I called Thiago and I said hey can you help me start read a passage he said yes and we did what he was doing for building a second brain we applied that to online writing to the active creation and it's been going ever since so did you did you know Thiago or you basically just took his course got to know him and then he became your business partner mostly the second I just really admired Thiago I still do and I was like wow this guy understands something about information capture something about sort of the creative process something about online education that I would really like to learn from and the man and his system just radically transformed my life and so I reached out to him I remember we had lunch in San Francisco and I called them on a rainy day in New York City December 7th 2018 and he in a five-minute conversation said sure um I'm happy to do it and at the time I had very little money and right around then I got a 20 000 Grant from Tyler Cowan's Merchant Ventures program took that twenty thousand dollars hired a Hollywood film crew flew them down to Mexico City we made these seven video modules and in 10 days came up with all the concepts that would eventually form the Bedrock of rite of passage and here we are now that reminds me I just read the the book about Summit Series and how it got started so Summit Series you know started off as sort of an invite only get together of entrepreneurs and creatives um and it got bigger every single year and it was started by these like at the time like 21 year olds and they ended up getting like these crazy people to the events like you know I think Bill Clinton played sacks at one of the events like if that happens like you know you've made it and then they ended up buying a uh mountain in Utah like they bought something called Powder Mountain which you know for their events and to actually create a permanent community and it's the whole story of how uh you know they had no money and they basically put all their money into these events and like you know it's the typical startup story which is like you know you you have this intuition that it's gonna work out but you don't really you're not really sure so it sounds like you had a little bit of that like you took the twenty thousand dollars you're like I'm gonna take this bet uh I hope it works out but could you talk a little bit more of how you were feeling at that time like did you feel like oh my God if I spend all this money and it doesn't work out and you know this is this is it I had nothing to lose I had nothing to lose I mean I'm a born entrepreneur there's no working for anybody else my dad was an entrepreneur I grew up under that and my dad always made me believe that I could do it there was no other option it was just an option of whether I'm gonna do it now whether I'm gonna do it later and I remember I knew very early on that having an online audience especially around ideas and something that you know about the world is super valuable I remember after I got laid off from my job my first and only job I called my dad and I said hey I'm gonna go build an audience and I have the worst plan for two years the best plan for ten and I think that was totally right that was one half a decade ago and those first two years were brutal and I think over a 10-year time Horizon it's gonna turn out really well but there's no other option for me man this is what I do and and shouldn't that be the advice for like most 20 somethings like have a bad two-year plan but a great 10-year plan I think in some ways yeah one of the issues with people in their 20s is they end up doing these stupid jobs where they go work in the soulless corporate environments where they you know quotes get paid to learn and sometimes that's true don't get me wrong sometimes that is very true but the majority of people I know who justify what they're doing with hey I'm learning a lot it's okay I don't like it that much but I'm learning a lot most of them are having a lot of the ambition and a lot of the agencies sucked out of them and I actually think that's quite tragic um I don't use those words lightly I think that your 20s or a time of peak creativity you have less to lose than at other moments in your life and of course all these things are person dependent but on a cohort basis people in their young 20s should should be taking risks they should be trying to be ambitious and the other thing that people their young 20s don't know is that everyone is willing to help you when you're young I interviewed 150 people on my podcast and I would just parade around New York City with microphones and audio equipment over my arm got it stolen one time and I would just interview different people and I learned so much doing that I just felt like every person I reached out to was super helpful and I just learned and I learned and I learned and to this day I've just surrounded myself with people who've done it before who are smarter than me who give me really honest feedback who can help me navigate the the trials and tribulations of life when you're in your 20s if you make a mistake unless you're Elizabeth Holmes you know you're getting you're getting a a pardon you know when you get when you become in your 30s and 40s and you're making mistakes it's it's not as easy you know when you make a mistake because people are like well you should have known better like you've been in the game yeah and I think it you know really matters what kinds of mistakes you're making right like don't be making mistakes that are legal mistakes and breaking the law and stuff like that but yeah go take a risk and go out and and and and try to like come up with with with something that you see in the world that is unique to you I was talking to a to a friend from college three or four years younger than me and he called me up and he said he said hey I really want to start a company and we started talking about it and I said hey your ambition is like an eight or a nine but your knowledge about what you want to do is like a two or a three and I think that this is very common you have a lot of people who they want to either be seen as entrepreneurs or they have a genuine desire to make something of their lives but they don't have their requisite knowledge the differentiated perspective on how the world is where the world is going and you have to build that you build that through expertise by reading by talking to people by doing stuff and just by constantly taking all of these small bets you know I think a lot of the mistakes that people make is they take a way too big bet too fast um where now you know naseem's lab always says just keep surviving just keep surviving and you don't want to do that what I did was I worked in a lot of like sort of a portfolio of small bats really inspired by Naseem celebs anti-fragile which changed my life when I read that but then once I found the thing I really went all in and committed like people are like oh so like what do you want to do after this like you know write a passage or you just teach your course like what do you actually really want to do I'm like no this is it this is what I'm doing I'm building a great education company like this is what I believe in this is what I made to do and I feel destined to be building this this company and I'm now along for the ride and I'm fully committed so I sort of started off with trying all these different things and once I found the thing I'm just like hey I'm all in yeah what makes you so committed the world needs this writing education sucks education is terrible it's super expensive teachers get paid very little it's not excited for the kids none of the learning science that has come out in the last 70 to 80 years has actually been implemented people aren't legitimately using the internet to advance themselves in more structured ways there's a lot of people use the internet to sort of teach themselves but these cohort based styles of learning which is really how we've always learned that are very true to how human psychology functions talking to other people going through these classes with others I mean it's just right for the taking and I'm like it's so clear to me that it can be better so who else should build it but me you know it's like I see it and I think it was Alan K who said the best way to predict the Futures to invent it and I hear that quote I'm like that's exactly what I'm gonna do for education yeah I think a lot of people when they think about writing they're really overwhelmed and they're like I have nothing to write about and that's not true I mean if they if you had nothing to write about you wouldn't talk um you know I think what people need to keep in mind is that when you write and I've been writing for 15 years on the internet when you write it really does attract a lot of opportunities just this morning I saw a literally a world leader or a manga world leader tweet something and I saw that her DMS were open so I dm'd her about it and then she responded it's like here it is like I'm a guy who's literally recording this from literally a closet like I'm staring at my clothes and I'm on the internet and I'm connected to this person who's probably in this Parliament building you know super super powerful person and it's only because I had built this audience on Twitter and she followed me for multiple years that she respects my opinion and she wanted my perspective on something that only happens in an Internet connected World which we're in and in a place where there's social products that are conducive to words spreading and this has only happened in the last 15 to 20 years where now anyone can produce and share content for free it's only really happened over the last five years and my perspective and maybe you disagree but once Twitter changed their home feed to be more algorithmic based it allowed people like me people like you to create content and if a lot of people like that content or even a few people just started sharing it with more and more and more and more people and it allowed us to gain audiences relatively quick in the same way that Tick Tock is designed for people to go viral and because of that people like us have been building audiences and words have been the format to do it um previously I felt like words had been very similar to how podcasting is podcast Discovery is notoriously difficult it's notoriously hard to start a podcast unless you have an audience already start a podcast disseminate it distribute it get it seen get it listened hundreds of thousands thousands even hundreds of times and it's because the platforms don't lend themselves well to shareability do you agree with that or not yeah totally and I would just add sub stack in here I think sub stack has done a lot of the same things that Twitter's had and especially now substack is doing a great job of recommending newsletters that's what people need help with distribution it used to be that anyone could start their own blog but those blogs wouldn't get read and now if you're writing on sub stack if you're writing on Twitter and your stuff is good it'll be seen and it'll be seen by people who you wouldn't be able to meet in real life and that is something worth taking advantage of and right of passage is a five-week program where people learn exactly how to step into this world and put it to use for them it's about 6 35 a.m here and I'm just about to have my ag1 by athletic greens it's this powder that I look forward to having every single day I put it in about 10 ounces of water it contains vitamins and probiotics and Whole Food Source ingredients that really uh gets my energy up my recovery up and my focus up and I look forward to it really really every single day just like how I have my morning coffee I love having my my morning AG one so for listeners to the Pod I think you might like ag-1 too so athletic greens is offering a one-year supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five of these free travel packs with your first free purchase all you have to do is go to athleticgreens.com slash wih and and claim it I hope you enjoy it as much as I do I'm curious about like the business and economics behind rite of passage like I'm I'm sure that it's a fulfilling Mission and you love coming to work every day because it's just it's in your blood and I can see it but like you could be doing anything you could be starting a venture-backed startup raising hundreds of millions of dollars like I'm sure that you're looking at this and looking at this being like Oh there's also a big Financial opportunity as well so can you talk a little bit about that it scales like it scales very well it doesn't scale like a software company but it scales incredibly well and I think that there's a few ways to think of it so I'll talk about right of passage and then I'll talk about other schools and how they're thinking about it so if you take traditional education you at most could only have 40 students and like that's it most and then you're still doing lecture formats and if you look at the science of lecture attention people retain almost nothing like when people are just sitting there and listening it's almost nothing now the teacher is also responsible for grading they're also responsible for coming up with the content they're also responsible for exercises for assignments and doing all of that I have a whole team to help me out and I can do that because I have good profit margins in my business so right now we have five week program 438 students from 41 countries I have 38 people who are helping me run this in some capacity I have a full-time team of editors so that every single piece of writing gets editing within 24 hours I have a full-time team of mentors so that whatever it is within the world of writing that you're interested in whether it's the psychology of writing whether it's how to be vulnerable in your writing whether it's how do I distribute my writing whatever it is there's a different Mentor who's gone through the course who does this well who's writing consistently who basically teaches their own mini course within rite of passage then I have a full-time team an operations team a course design team and that way because we have so many students and every student pays you know quite a hefty fee you know you can't get in the course for less than four thousand dollars though we do offer scholarships because of that we you know we're we're we're doing fairly well every cohort and we can then provide a bunch more attention that someone in in person can provide we're just counter positioning and competing along different vectors this is a classic thing in business and it's a classic disruption type thing new use case comes along they're over serving their audiences in some ways we come in Meet customers where they're at but the new Technology's moving faster and what one of the big Theses I'm saying is look at all of the Technologies around me that I basically have the shadow Workforce that's working full-time to make my product better I have the team at Zoom that is working to constantly improve that product this week they added screen sharing for breakout rooms now if I were to build that in my own company that would cost me half a million dollars Zoom just does it with a quick software update and that's the end of it I maybe pay a thousand dollars a year for Zoom to be doing that we have Circle that's our community back end circles improving at a crazy rate a crazy rate it's gotten so much faster for Community Management's gotten so much better their DMS their 101 DMS are really good if we were trying to develop that in-house it'd be really hard and so basically we have the Winds of technology that are working with us we have scale that's working with us and we can also be reaching the scale of the internet so if I try to run if I try to run Reddit passage in Austin Texas where I live well how many people are going to take it so I'll tell you I think we have 31 alums in history who live in Austin Texas so we have fewer alums than would fill your average classroom in person not only that that 31 like if you threw something you know IRL they might be like oh you know I have something at that time or I can't make it it's like you know rush hour or something like that but now we have people from 41 countries and I remember I was in college I was sitting in my bed and I was reading Ben Thompson and he wrote people will always underestimate the scale of the internet because and what you can do is you can build super Niche products because a small percentage of a giant number is still a giant number and that's how the internet works you can go into these niches you can build something for those kinds of people in no way am I trying to build the writing education platform to solve all education platforms we're much more like cereal there's 30 different kinds of cereal when you go to the supermarket there's Lucky Charms there's Fruit Loops there's Frosted Flakes there's all the healthy stuff we are one brand of cereal we're not for everybody and it's working you know I I could tell you because I I've when I interview someone that's graduated right of passage like to me that's better than working at Google or graduating Stanford whatever's in the water in that course is working and and it sounds like from a business perspective like you're a humble guy so I'll say there for you like you're generating millions of dollars of Revenue via this business it's profitable and you know you don't have to rely on VCS to keep the lights on and you know you're doing what you love you know I just had recently uh Natalie Ellis on the show I don't know if you know Natalie she also lives in Austin and Natalie runs a business called boss babe and boss babe is basically you know the framework for how I think about community-based products is you know you have audience at the top so how do you attract the audience you take that audience you actually turn it into an owned audience maybe that's an email or something like that then you move that into a community so maybe you use something like Circle and then you take those people and you move them into a product that they're gonna love and she's really mastered this whole idea where she has this audience called boss babe which is for female entrepreneurs she has a community and courses and master classes that people can take and then she has products that she also sells like digital assets and stuff like that and she told us she's making like six million dollars in Revenue which is incredible within the framework of that I know I'm putting you on the spot but like you know do you think of your business like that like generating you know attracting a lot of attention at the top bringing them through funnels taking them through the product you know because we have a lot of people listening to this that are building their own businesses um so anything you can share that would be helpful yet the most important thing is to be sending out a unique signal into the world that is the most important thing it's going to become more important to be differentiated as artificial intelligence and gpt3 gbt4 as they begin to do a lot of writing for people you're gonna need to have a unique voice and I always think of it like radio frequencies the way that the internet works is everyone's tuning in to different frequencies and you have different radio stations you got your radio station for learning radio stations for comedy radio stations for entertainment but on the internet those are social accounts and the more unique your station and what you're saying you get uniqueness and you get strong signal you get strong single signal with Clarity and you get uniqueness just by being differentiated having a different perspective on the world and then people find your station and if they like the content then they want more and so what we do is the community of rite of passage the course is now it's like a live event so you like the band you've been listening to their stuff on Spotify and radio and stuff like that now you go to the live event you have all these die hards and write a passage just like our Coachella where people come in there's all of these things you can't possibly do anything or everything but then you can come in you can do two Mentor groups here you can write these five essays and then for the next time the curriculum is going to change and this this and that way and then you go to different Mentor groups and now you've thought about these things for four months and so now you're gonna have a different experience I ran into a guy named Zach last week one of the co-founders of cabin the Creator Dao and him and Jonathan Hillis they met right of passage and started the Dow together I think that Dao is worth 38 million dollars now and they met each other in right of passage and I said Zach you know it's crazy because it was a Saturday we're doing a live writing thing so we're chat and then I ran into him on the streets in Austin 90 minutes later I said Zach like what what what has you back in Reddit passage and he's like you know it's the people and and and having these conversations but having it be directed towards some kind of output and I'm like dude remind me how many times you've taken right of passage he's like this is my fifth time through the course and I think that that's what it's about it's about bringing these people together and I always think of Camp man I I used to go to this Camp called Skylake and the big status symbol was they had these white shirts a little bit of green on them and then they had a like a pine tree on them and for every year that you came back you would get another pine tree on the back and so I was like a two three four pine tree kind of guy but I remember there's this guy named Jason and Jason had 11 pine trees and he was the coolest guy was like the coolest thing to have 11 pine trees and that's how we think about right of passage I'm sort of obsessed with how do you create culture you don't do it through rules you don't do it through laws you don't do it through guidelines you do it by taking people who represent that culture and sort of promoting them showing them off their shout outs showing them off their leadership positions and then having them do things because humans are very imitative there's this great video that I like to share on Twitter where there's this guy he's at a music music festival at the Gorge Amphitheater and he's sort of dancing alone he's got like the speaker system he's totally alone and everyone's looking at him he's like what the hell are you doing and then somebody else joins and then the two of them are dancing I was like you guys are total weirdos and then you look 45 seconds later and there's like 150 people dancing because that's how humans work the first person to do something weird the second person do something weird the third person a little less weird and all of a sudden they've started a trend there's 150 people and I'm always about how do we create culture in that way instead of these very concrete verbal laws rules and customs yeah I think that's a that's a really good point like when I'm creating communities I'm often looking I'm often starting with very little rules and seeing how people are adapting and doing things and then being like okay how do I double down on that behavior so okay for example I just launched this me and my team launches freedom in uh nft project called the pencil case project and I started to notice that noticing that people started calling themselves pencil heads and I was just like okay that's funny and then I started writing in the tweets pencil heads like hey pencil heads like how you how's everyone doing and people just went crazy and that's this that's the sort of thing that you know when you think about a community like what is it it's like shared identity shared language shared rituals it comes from very much deeply rooted in religion um in lots of ways and I've I've heard you actually talk about religion before on other podcasts you know I know you're a student of religion but could you talk a little bit about maybe some similarities that you see with what you're building a rite of passage and interestingly enough how religion is structured yeah it's funny that you talk about the the similarities I never have them be similar so I'm just gonna go on the religious tangent of why I think that this is important and then we can sort of horse you and sort of try to connect these two things I haven't really thought about that before um but so I'm secular I grew up Jewish and I had this realization that the Bible is the core text of Western civilization and the more that you look at it you realize that the moral framework that we have whether you're atheist secular or Christian Jewish it is all within this judeo-christian tradition and even the most atheist of westerners actually have a quite Christian moral framework and you see this in the Constitution right we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal it's not self-evident at all that that's the case that sort of Builds on John Locke's ideas and that then goes back to the Bible and I realized that when I I was basically swimming in Christian Waters and I didn't understand the Bible so every week I do a Bible study with the teacher every Sunday morning for two hours and I'm deeply obsessed with learning what the Bible says going through it and then I also work with a Chabad Rabbi in town so I can get a different perspective and you know part of this is my own Journey to Find Faith and part of this is my my own interest in just feeling like in order to be an educated Westerner you need to understand these things so this is a huge part of my life I have a piece called the book you need to read which is about the Bible and why you're Christian which goes through this logic just step by step and I think that a lot of what it's given me an appreciation for is what writing does a lot of people say I'm spiritual but not religious I think I'm closer to religious but not spiritual and I like the aspects of religion where it says this is how the world works and I think that it's just fascinating to try to understand these different perspectives the implications of them what follows from them and I spent a lot of time thinking about this so now getting into your question about community you know I suspect that there's a lot to learn about the early growth of of of religion right like you have Saul who's traveling to Spain who then becomes Paul and he's totally against Christianity then he has this Revelation with Christ and all of a sudden he becomes a major evangelist for the Christian faith and I think a lot happens there right like you're doggedly against something then you become doggly for it then you have the 12 disciples and they're sort of going off saying these unpopular truths I suspect there's a lot about community building that we can learn from those stories but for me they're very separate and I'm very uh certain to not tie too much economic motive to my study of Religion because I just I sort of want them to be separate yeah to me to me they're similar um from my perspective because when I look at religion I see you know every great Community okay you know every great religion has a cortex a Bible of some sort every Community has a cortex of some sort you know every religion has short-term and long-term incentives like for example going to heaven um and every Community has short-term and long-term incentives you know and I can go on and on about that I think you know even when you give the example of the 12 disciples the 12 disciples are not too dissimilar from the example you explain at the Gorge like where you had that one guy dancing and then it became two and then four and eight and twelve like that could be the story of a religion in the making yep but I understand why you're separating church and state the separation of church and capitalism exactly exactly I mean you know we live in the US as the state is is a capitalistic state so um you're in Texas and I'm in Florida so but yeah I think uh I find it interesting that you are going you know going deeper into religion because it is in a lot of ways unpopular like an R like group am I am I misstepping by saying that I feel like an R kind of crew of people like I don't know a lot of people posting and writing about religion and going deep and and kind of having a a pastor over here and a rabbi over there yeah I mean I like I think that's ridiculous you know I think that I looked at a lot of the secular and atheist perspectives on and I say this is someone who's not religious but I just looked at a lot of people around me and I would ask why are you not religious and their answers for why they're not religious I thought was very shallow when I looked at the average person and I said hey I don't know what my answer is but whether I'm religious or not I better have a good answer for why I think that the different perspective is false you know it's Charlie Bunger saying hey you should understand the other side's opinion better than they do what they think better than they do and for me I don't care what Christians do I care what the Bible says and that's what I want to focus on and I want to know this stuff well because I think that that's what it means to be an educated Westerner I think that this is a core thing and I think a lot more people should be learning about it not to be religious but because it's important to know the Bible because so much of your life if you live in the west this book The Bible the Old and New Testament influences your life each and every day and understanding that moral framework how the stories that are told influence the Constitution and the laws of the countries that you live in I think it's an important thing to know so I spent a long time doing it yeah I think you know I love that and I love that you're not afraid to say it and I love that you nerd out about it one of the interesting things about religion for me is just how stories based it is yep and you know you can just look at religion I know you don't look at it this way but you can just look at religion based on like the Bible is the number one best-selling book of all time and so by definition the stories are very compelling and you can just look at it being like I want to understand how to dissect these stories so that I can be a better Storyteller myself and actually say like I'm gonna spend 12 18 24 months just like learning it from that perspective and applying that into my life like you don't need to be religious quote unquote to basically dissect something and I think that's like kind of like the world that we live in now which is like it's so like you know Polar Opposites I mean they're in or I'm out the Bible best-selling book of all time what is the most highlighted highlighted Kindle book of all time um give me give me a hint the four hour body by Tim Ferriss wow why is that I I don't know and I think the four hour work week is number four I mean it kind of it kind of makes sense you know I think like for our body so many of us are not happy with our physical appearance and here you have a guy saying like here's how you can optimize it like in those words basically and for our work week like I remember I I bought that book in 2006 and it changed my life I mean it's a corny title but like the concept of like I don't need to work 100 hours a week in Goldman Sachs or whatever to make a good living I could like basically create systems and become financially free the concept of financially free is so compelling to people and also the concept of passive income you know it's like what's so exciting to people it's like go to heaven passive income looking good that's it it's all you need getting laid Yeah well it's funny because we were talking about the stories and a lot of biblical stories whether you're religious or not have something in them that is a lesson that then you can apply to business so in 2019 I wrote an essay called Peter thiel's religion which is probably the most popular thing I've ever published and in that piece I talk about the Cain and Abel story which is my favorite story in the Bible I think it's like 16 lines and you could spend five years dissecting the implications of that story and it's all about sameness and how sameness leads to competition competition can lead to envy and envy can lead to violence and murder basically and how if you look at the Bible twins are repeatedly a curse and the reason is that twins are like this symbol for two people who are too similar and in the Kate and Abel story there's Kane who kills Abel towards a rock at him because he's basically envious of him and if you follow what then happens with Peter Thiel who is a Christian guy at PayPal he had this rule where every single person had to work on one thing and one thing only and he would only talk to people about one thing and he would Apple did the same thing they have to directly responsible individual similar and what I think the lesson here is is you want people to be differentiated own their territory not have other people stomping on those territories because that creates this competition and envy and this leads into the philosophy of renas your art who basically says that violence happens not because of differences but more because two people are too similar and similarity leads to violence similarity leads to destruction which is very at odds with how I thought violence went and deeply informs my worldview in terms of how I think about setting up a corporate structure for myself how my friends operate and stuff like that and I see the Kane and Abel stories show up some place in my life every week internal tools the software you build to help your team operate better dictates how fast every team from Engineers to sales reps can execute but you know this building internal tools from scratch and maintaining them takes a ton of engineering time and tedious work retool is a much faster way to build internal tools it has a complete library of 100 plus fully featured accessible UI components that you can just drag and drop any interface and retools platform lets you build the custom internal tools your team needs 10 times faster it's one platform to build your interface all you have to do is connect any data source or API and you can publish employee facing apps in record time it's also pretty flexible you can write custom code nearly anywhere to customize how your app looks and works in app environments SSO permissions and other critical app functionality are all available right out of the box the result well you can build production grade internal tools without the wasted effort of Googling component libraries debugging dependencies or rewriting boilerplate code thousands of teams at companies like Amazon doordash NBC and our own company lay checkout collaborate around custom build retool apps to operate faster and better also teams up to five can build retool apps for free so we're big fans I'm a big fan of of retool if you want to learn more about retool you can just check it out at retool.com so could can you even make that more tactical like from a corporate structure perspective or a friendship perspective or business perspective like what have you tactically done based on that story for example say that you have you're trying to get your finances in order okay and you have a cheap Opera a chief operating officer and then you have a Chief Financial Officer and you're trying to get your quarterly budget in order okay so the operations person could say hey this is mine to own because I'm an Ops person and it is my job to set the budgets for each department and I communicate with each department so therefore I should own that project then there's the financial person who says wait I have Finance in my title that's my territory and so then they both are working on it they have a disagreement so one person wants to work what is it like a cash basis another person wants to work on a cruel basis I don't actually know the words for accounting but they have different perspectives on how accounting should work and now all of a sudden they're fighting against the thing for for trying to fight for the same thing they have a slight differentiation Freud called this the narcissism of small differences it was Kissinger at Harvard who said the competitions were so Fierce because the stakes were so small and so often people bicker over the smallest of differences I heard about these two professors one at Yale one at Columbia who loathe each other because of some difference in an interpretation of some character in Dante's Inferno and they just despise each other because they have a different interpretation of this very s Fringe thing and so this shows up and so in a company what you'd want to do is you'd want to just carve it out you'd want to say no this is the finance person's job this is the operations person's job and operations person you are directly responsible for this this and that Finance person you're directly responsible for this this and that and the buck stops with them and we're very very clear within the company to make sure one person owns certain things because once two people start to own something all of a sudden there's there's competition there's Envy there's rivalry all these sorts of things and you don't want that yeah I also think it's it's super empowering to the person to be like hey here's your here's your territory like this is your kingdom yep and you get to decide and it's enabling versus like what sometimes CEOs do is they'll say like okay you'll get this piece or you'll collaborate with this person and what ends up happening is like they don't feel the agency over the the work uh and and that yeah to your point creates problems what do you think of uh companies I mean I know the answer but what do you think of companies have co-ceos I I mean I I don't have strong opinions but I would be skeptical on it from the outset that's my hunch based on the Canon able story is that like how do co-ceos really work if there's not territories like you're just collecting your you know your twins and you're making decisions on the kingdom no yeah I didn't expect to talk you know too much Cain and Abel today I gotta say I didn't have that on my bingo card with you but I want to talk about opportunities so I'm sure that you're you're seeing a ton of opportunities building what you're building like for example you know what would a rite of passage look like for XYZ vertical and I'm wondering first of all do you have any ideas where you're like oh I wish someone would build you know write a passage for XYZ so that's one question and the other question is you know are you tempted to you know basically expand your curriculum like what does this look like in 10 years let's say I don't know but a lot of how I think about what the company wants to be is I sort of work back with who are my heroes and what is the fact that they're my hero the fact that they are that I'm so interested in what they did how they built their career I sort of ask what is it about what they did that's really interesting to me and the person I'm just obsessed with is Walt Disney I went to Disneyland earlier this year and I flew out to Orange County to just say what can I learn from Disneyland that I can then apply to write a passage and I basically want write a passage to be like Disneyland for writing I eventually want to have houses around the world where people can come in and have conversations that embody the right of passage Spirit uh test them out to Greatness what does it mean to sort of be surrounded by people who've actually added something to human civilization you know there's no coincidence that right behind me I have the story of civilization books right here by Will and Ariel Durant I have a whole collection from Michelangelo and da Vinci like I want this room to basically be this holy place this sort of Cathedral of knowledge and I would love to build places around the world that embody that and I want rite of passage to feel like Disneyland and some of the things that Walt did that I thought was fascinating is like for example when Walt was building Disneyland people thought that he was going to throw his career away he had been at the frontier of Animation he'd been at the frontier of movies he had done all these things and the war comes the war ends and Walt gets obsessed with Miniatures he gets obsessed with little models and he basically buys a house in the Los Angeles Hills just so that he can build a 1 8 scale train that goes all through his house and he would invite people over and everyone's like well what are you doing you're one of the great entrepreneurs and now you're obsessed with model trains what the heck is wrong with you and so he then had attended a lot of world's fairs he hated Coney Island in New York he thought it was just the scum of the earth and he was at um what is it Knott's Berry Farm and at the time amusement parks they talked about each guest and they called them Marx mark one Mark II mark three mark IV this very utilitarian numerical way of thinking about people and Walt said no we can build something way better we can combine my love for Cinema with this belief that we can build a park that's not just great for kids but great for parents because he used to go to Griffith Park in Los Angeles and he would go with his kids and he would just sit on a bench and he would just Daydream and he's like why isn't there entertainment for me he took all of those life experiences he says I want to go build Disneyland and it's not a coincidence that when you walk into Disneyland what's the first thing you see you see the train now that train is at 5 8 scale and that train I I I sort of think metaphorically it's like a reminder to not be so purposeful about what it is that you want to do and to follow your passions regardless of whether you're certain that they're going to go somewhere but at the same time studying Walt I see that there's moments of a magical Divine unlock what he did was he worked with a designer and the two of them worked for 40 hours in a row to make the original map for Disneyland Walt basically narrated and they drew a whole map of what the park would look like frontierland thinking about the future over here and Main Street Snow White Castle and that original map was very close to what Disney ended up doing and he was obsessed with getting the details obsessed with getting the the details right and what I love about Disney is he was he put product and he put quality above everything else he was an artist a creative and an entrepreneur wrapped up in one and I see so many people who get obsessed with the numbers who get obsessed with the business model who get obsessed with the the exit and I just think it's very uninspiring I'm inspired by Walt because he cared about those details every single one of them and he committed to getting the details right and wasn't so worried about cost benefit and stuff like that and I think that it's important for the kind of companies that I want to build where the leader is like that and then whatever the other thing I've learned from Walt is to then surround yourself with people who could be the operational Financial people so Walt's brother Roy was that person at one time they didn't speak for two years and they had a lot of tension at times but without Roy the company would have gone bankrupt Roy was sort of there to protect well but Roy was really there to push Walt and his Creative Vision and I'm so inspired by that because Walt just went all out all out on trying to build the most beautiful thing that he could do and taking his imagination and trying to make it real so so you have a you have a Roy on your team like that equivalent my my VP of Ops is like Roy and he's amazing it's it makes life so much easier I can just bounce things off of him I'm like let's go go go go go no budget come on man and he is really good at disagreeing with me he's extremely financially sound he has built an education company very similar to the one that we're building and we go back and forth every single day and he's super super helpful I have that as well like my co-founder CEO Theo taba you know I always say that he keeps the Train on the rails and without him we'd be flying would be a flying train into a into a mountain probably um but now after your analogy I think about it is he keeps the Train on on the rails and I design the trains yep and I think that's a really important Dynamic to have if you're building a company like you need to have the Walt Disney energy if you're marching towards something big if you really want to build something big but you need to have Roy's soberness basically like as Founders as founders of vision and product Founders we're often like drunk on the product frankly and we need the soberness to bring us back to reality or else you know you don't get anything shipped or else you get like I don't know if you remember in The Simpsons Homer design like a car he designed like I think at the time it was like an 80 or 100 000 car and like the the horn was like like Cucaracha or something like that and it just like didn't really make sense but you know his heart was in the right place and it was just that he was lacking a Roy to kind of keep him on track yeah I remember earlier this year I was with my co-founder so this isn't Chris Mancus my CEO this is will man and who's my brilliant co-founder and product guy and will and I were going back and forth talking about this super small thing and we were just like who's gonna own it who's actually gonna get this across the finish line and it was a very tense conversation and I was just like okay this isn't gonna get done and we've gone to the point now where we have small things that because we don't have a good VP of Ops like Chris who can take care of that we're just gonna bicker because now the energy that you need to get that across the Finish Line we don't have that fast forward six months later we were in a meeting with an entrepreneur in Residence we have now and we got to the end of the meeting and we were all ready to wrap up and Chris goes no we are still at 5 000 feet we need to land the airplane and then we need to get the airplane to the gate and then we need to get our bags off the luggage carousel we need to get the Uber and get home and it's so funny because I'm like I'll take off I'll go to 40 000 feet I'll even come down to five feet to 5 000 feet but I need somebody to do all that stuff at the end who can help me just boots on the ground would we tactically need to do what are the objectives what are the next steps how will we know if we're successful and I was super skeptical of these things half a year ago and now I'm much more aligned and I just need his help to basically almost be like a mini curmudgeon to basically be like hey I need you to do this I need you to do this we need to Define stuff and it's super helpful it's the stuff you learn I don't know how old you are but it's the stuff you like that's the stuff you learn in your 30s I feel like when you're in your 30s like you're like okay I know myself well enough that this is what I need in order to become successful um and I guess that even you know compounds as you get into your 40s um we gotta rap out we're we're out of time but I can I can talk to you for hours um where can our listeners find you and write a passage probably the most interesting thing is to type in 50 days of writing into Google and then my name David perel and you'll get a 50-day email course that's all about how I think about writing it's totally free and that'll help you think through ideas right from abundance right from conversation right in public all the basics are in that email series all right check it out everyone thanks Greg

you need to divorce two brains if you're a product builder in the space one is like why you're building and what you're building what you're excited about and the second is like the generative greed t-gen greed on like trading and then making money because I'm like if you let the two brains come together it's gonna get very messy for you and your enthusiasm your motivation is going to be this like toxic mix of like why are you building you know um and so I think obviously for anyone that's in it for degenerative to DJ and greed uh they've lost a ton of enthusiasm as things pull down and then you gotta like you know like seek shelter but I think for a lot of people they're building it for well I would call the right reasons which are like The Primitives are changing and it's the promise of like a better future foreign of the where it happens podcast welcome welcome today's episode I want to start off by telling a little story when I was 21 I was working on a app called five by and it was this video discovery app that allowed you to find the most interesting videos on YouTube and I was living in Canada at the time but I had to make a trip to Silicon Valley I had to see like where all these big companies uh started and and Grew From so I went there for a few weeks and I got introduced to this entrepreneur who had started and sold a company uh to Google I was already following him on Twitter so someone who I knew about so I was really excited to meet him and I met him for coffee I remember it was super rainy out and I you know I walk in there wet a few minutes late and I was just so excited to be there um I apologize for being late and I asked him you know what are you up to what are you up to now and he told me about how he was starting a video discovery at how he had raised millions of dollars and I just I felt my stomach turn I was like oh my God is this is this my ideas he's is he working on my idea of course he couldn't be but I ended up asking him to tell me more about it and I said hey could you could you maybe show me what you're working on so he pulls up his laptop and he starts pulling up the mock-ups for this app and literally pixel for Pixel it was the same like we had the same idea and I cringe right I was just I was this early 20s uh you know not as much experience as him living in Canada he was this big shot raised millions of dollars had hired all these Google engineers uh and it was tough and at the time you know I left that coffee shop and I didn't really have um like a support network of entrepreneurs to to to to call and say like you know to to voice how I'm feeling and that's why this episode I wanted to bring on my good friend Danny Trin uh later I moved to San Francisco and Danny became one of those friends who I could definitely vent with and I think that it's really important for entrepreneurs Founders makers to have someone or ideally multiple people that they could be real with uh so during this episode there's tons of gems from Danny uh about the importance of having that support network um and you know I hope you really like the episode before we bring on Danny Trin I wanted to make an announcement the reason why we started the where it happens podcast was we wanted to give you an inside look into what happens behind closed doors there's so many conversations of well-known people happening behind closed doors what if these conversations we're open to everyone what if it was like a FaceTime basically um that you know two well-known entrepreneurs are having that was public and one of the things I realized you know we've done a ton of interviews is the most interesting conversations happen with makers they happen with builders and they happen in these three categories Community people Commerce people and creators and why well it's because those people are shaping the world and we're Shifting the format to only interview those types of people so if you're interested in those categories you are going to be so excited about the guests we have lined up uh the other quick announcement is my co-host sahil Bloom is no longer going to be co-hosting with me it's just going to be me um he's focusing on his book and I'm focusing on this podcast uh as well as my company late checkout so I'm excited uh for him and I'm I'm really excited about where the podcast is going and I know you're going to enjoy uh this conversation with Danny Tran and what we've got cooking for you because it is incredible thank you well well speaking of that by the way I remember the last time I was on it's crazy to think that it was six months ago so much has changed this year I feel like at the end you all were jokingly mentioning particle and I think I joked I was like are you all behind particle let me tell you part of full since that time good Lord I I feel like I see it everywhere and um it's just been uh it's been crazy to see good for them you know yeah so you want to do you want to describe what particle is for people who didn't listen to that episode and why why you might think it's interesting yeah I mean it's like it's a paperless posts uh brought into the new era for mobile uh or like you know for SMS and just the way people might do invites and as obviously things like Facebook events and other things have died uh there's been obviously a need for to make it really easy to organize um and at least here in New York I've been seeing particle go out but even some of those birthday party or or whatnot or dinner it is sent out a particle link um and it's really smart you know it's on SMS um it's like sorry it's a website that you can say text or snap to somebody um yeah I've just been genuinely surprised to see that it like has Consolidated and it's like the thing for sending out like a really quick impromptu invite you know yeah I think what's cool about it is like when I when I chatted with the founder she was like yeah it's basically like I don't know paperless post but for Gen Z and when I when I go to websites where it's like hey is this product for Gen Z or it's this product for Millennials like that never works like you can't say it's for that person you just kind of have to like when I go to I just went to the particle website and it's like it's not like it says gen Z anywhere on this website yeah just like I mean I I know nothing about the team behind it but uh I wish them all a success it's pretty cool uh especially in a space it's so crowded or it's full of so many uh it's me dead folks who've tried it out uh yeah wait who are the particle founders today's episode is brought to you by a company and product that has literally changed my life and one that I use every single day I started taking ag1 in 2011 because I wanted to feel great it's been a staple of my morning routine ever since yeah that's 10 years and 99 compliant I met the CEO when we were training at the same strength training facility way back in the day he had been creating an early version of the product to battle his own gut health issues when he realized how challenging and expensive it was to create an optimal routine on your own I started taking it during those college baseball years and was completely hooked over the years it has kept me feeling on point physically and mentally the best part it fits into whatever lifestyle or Diet I'm currently experimenting with from keto to paleo to vegan and more it's a tiny micro habit that you can execute daily that has large long-term and compounding benefits the product has over seven thousand five star reviews and is trusted by a long list of professional athletes and leading Health experts I love it they do and I know you will too to make it easy athletic greens is going to give you a free one-year supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase all you have to do is visit athleticgreens.com wih again that is athleticgreens.com wih to take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional Insurance you won't regret it for the last 10 years I've been building internal tools to help my sales teams or engineering teams work at blazing speeds but the catch with internal tools is it's really hard to build from scratch and maintaining them also requires a lot of engineering work and it's just frankly super tedious thankfully there's now a retool retool is a much faster way to build internal tools it has a complete library of a hundred plus fully featured accessible UI components that you can just drag and drop into any interface retools platform lets you build the custom internal tools your team needs 10 times faster it's a one platform to build your interface you can connect any data source any API and publish employee facing apps in record time it's also super flexible you can write custom code nearly anywhere to customize how your app looks and works and app environments SSO permissions and other critical app functionality are all available completely out of the box the result you can build production grade internal tools without the wasted effort of Googling component libraries debugging dependencies or rewriting boilerplate code thousands of teams at companies like Amazon doordash NBC late checkout collaborate around custom built retooled apps to operate faster operate better also teams of up to five can build retool apps for free so you shouldn't be surprised why we're big ritual fans at where it happens to learn more you just gotta go to retool.com um I only met one of them um I'm blanking on her name her name is let's see hold up [Music] um I think her name is Joy Tau oh no Shreya that's who I met um and and yeah she's probably in her mid-20s really product design or like Focus like you can see it in the product like it feels very much like I mean you get it it's like when you use the particle product it like it feels really good when you use Eventbrite like you want to take a shower um yeah well I don't remember the last movie was Eventbrite but uh yeah I guess and by the way it looks like you just used Eventbrite because you know that hair is looking looking real real real real clean you know oh yeah exactly yeah I just got it I just got out of an event right uh session that's why uh yeah for the listeners I just I just took a shower so yeah well yeah I guess uh what else what are you seeing these days do you see anything fun lately the the caught your eye um I'm curious like you know I've been seeing a lot of stuff you know we chatted a little bit about web3 um you know obviously a lot has changed in web 3 over the last six months um and it was just right before this uh in between shower and this call I was I was uh I was reading Koopa troopas uh newsletter around music nfts yeah um and I've just been fascinated with like web3 and music uh thinking about royalties thinking about like you know the role of the label um curious your perspective um on music nfts and then also just in web 3 in general like um yeah what is change are you still bullish you know talk to me yeah I mean it's two things a especially music entities definitely not my bag um I know a lot of people who were really kind of excited about it or and I know there's a lot of energy there I think obviously a lot remains to be seen so you know um I think it's also actually something randomly it was like it's called like sounds XYZ or something they released as like some protocol or something and anyways very excited for them or like whatever finding out visit they are there but I think that's the question is there they're there so I think you have all these people like kind of just telling each other it's going to be awesome or it's the future um without you know a ton behind it and but I but that's not to take away from um than them trying to change uh the foundation of it all I think web3 in general kind of reminds me of web 2 right now and that like I don't think a lot of people remember web 2 how web 2 at least from where I'm sitting ended and that you had this like oh the future the web is social and you had all these like microblogging competitors you're like oh web2 is so exciting it is Ajax we're gonna age it everything's gonna be alive and it's gonna be awesome but there was definitely a moment where like things got really tough and rough like 2008-ish or like things Consolidated a lot of that stuff is now dead you know and it's nothing wrong with those Founders or those people but just you know even though there was this generation you know the internet becoming more modern or things that we now accept to be table sticks a lot of stuff was cleared out and I think you know as we're in Winter we're so firmly in winter again uh you know there's there's a natural consolidation happening of like you know some of the less sturdy and frankly some of the more hypey noisy stuff uh is getting washed away um and it's yeah it's force and folks to go back and focus it's like you know it's Beyond Winter now it's like a nuclear winter it's like um I think it's bigger than any of the just web3 stuff it's like the world we live in today um where where it's just really really rough I mean one thing so I'll segue really quickly like I'm pretty excited about October 11th uh Japan's opening its borders for like non-business um excuse travel and it's like the US dollar versus the yen is an all-time crazy High um and it's like that's a bang got nothing to do with like crypto that's just the world we live in like the you know things are just getting crazy and hectic like they think that the Euros at a 20-year historic low against the dollar and whatever like all I'll say is um it's kind of a crazy time we live and so I think web3 yeah suffering or like that entire generation of companies right now but so many others are too um so it's uh it's interesting to watch because I I will say I think some of the best most resilient Founders and teams tend to get started or tend to survive improve themselves for surviving periods like this um and you know this period is far from even over or frankly even getting started I think we're still in the free fall into like in this is the depth of some Darkness so um yeah God wishing godspeed to all the folks out there trying to darndest to stay afloat and uh keep building and stay focused um yeah could you uh yeah could you talk like I want I want to come back to the web three thing but I want to actually jump to to web 2 for a second living in San Francisco during the Heyday our buddy Addison just sent us a uh who's also you know in that in that scene just sent us a text message of like a video of our buddy Jeff and a few other people just like being in San Francisco at that era and you know social era mobile was coming out it felt like really exciting um could you talk more about like and and you were in it too dude like you were yeah you were at dig which was like one of the most you know hottest startups in Social at the time path when the hottest mobile startups at the time talk like what was it like in your in your mind being in SF at that time yeah um because like we've got thousands of listeners who just like what weren't they what one thing one one thing I'd say is that okay definitely 2008 you know financial crash in its own right you know that's that's the year I got to SF um you know everyone now knows SF to be displaced for people like way overpaid like the minimum like salary out of college for a good CS degree is like something crazy you know like everyone basically has expense Lifestyles with like free mini kitchens and laundry and buses and stuff um and I think the one thing I'll say is like when you get to SF 2008 like there wasn't a ton of money floating around like it wasn't like every company that was alive was over funded and you know there was just cash everywhere it was kind of like this um is this place where you you went there because you just attracted to hanging out and seeing what other people were building you know and it wasn't because it was super lucrative I'd argue you know Facebook sorry Googled gone public but it really was probably until Facebook idea 2012 or so when things got kind of kind of crazy you know um and so I'd say what was great about that period that's around the same time you know Addison and what was out there and that we all you know so many friends friends that I keep to this day lifelong friends were made was it was just like hey uh what do you have to what do you build in uh my first apartment was in Hayes Valley because it was the place I could afford not because Hayes Valley which is now like the cool the cool kids little mid-market area like it's not just like you you would kind of just surviving and and and trying to build stuff and like again it wasn't this crazy like overvalued time it was just a lot of fun I think frankly there were so many people that had such bad terrible apocalyptic experiences with the first bubble like 2000s that they would almost like laugh about this idea web 2 or people doing startups again um and like trying to make businesses or whatnot figure it out and you know a lot of that was fair because a lot of those companies didn't make it uh what's funny is some of them are still still going strong today um yeah and I it was a fun time I think what was cool about SF in that time in or you know I don't know if your question is just about SF or web 2 but I think what was so cool about the time was you'd bump shoulders casually with some of the best Builders ever with like No Agenda and there was no ego it's just like hey whoa like oh you're working on that like oh tell me more uh and you're like do you want to get a burrito like you can walk around the mission like get a Fair leader or something or grab beer somewhere and and it was uh it was just a really I don't know it was it was just a really so yeah yeah a couple things so first of all I completely agree like the start like today like there's tons of startups that are like flush with cash back then like even the startups that were quote unquote flush with cash like when we we didn't there wasn't that much money there it was very much like us versus them like didn't path you know I don't know if yeah path was tried or Google tried to buy path at one time and I remember like I think it was like 100 million dollars or more and I remember like everyone was kind of like no we can't do like path users were like no no way they can't do it like it it felt very us and them though I mean I guess it feels like that a little bit uh or sorry it felt very US versus them back then it still feels that way a little bit now but it's not it was way it felt way more of that back then back then do you agree yeah I think back then everything was just a little faster loose because you didn't know but you didn't know right like I think 2010 that that particular year things changed the iPhone 4 changed like it was like a seismic shift right finally the camera was good enough right and then in the following years as connections got better and like the mobile your Cellular Connection got better there's a seismic shift and so there was no like right or wrong way to do things right whereas I'd say like if you look at consumer now like I I think it's a pain cave for a Founder to go out without some angle or strategy on how they're going to get distribution you know like what advantage they're gonna have because say you make something great it's gonna get copied or snatched up by somebody so fast you know um and and so yeah I think especially around then it was a little bit of the wild west but you didn't know like you were undergoing the shift in Mobile a lot and I know there's that I'm tired so low-mo movement which made me cringe at the time it still makes me cringe to say it out loud today uh but like explain what that is yeah for people who don't know what that is well they're pillars that now sound really damn obvious which is like can you make social location mobile um experiences or companies and products and yeah at the time it was an entire wave right like it began with like the first bit I think it's you know South by 2009 where you had um Foursquare in guala you know and it's like it now seems so medieval and primitive to be like oh my phone knows where DPS I might be able to check in to a place where I'm at right and obviously so many people have built on that right um but I yeah it's there was this crazy Cambrian explosion of people you know taking different bits and Legos and assembling different ideas you know off of these like big new things that were unlocked right like gowala was the competitor and it's cool to see Josh Williams and Co and he's gotten like a lot of that original koala team back and they're out trying to do it again um but you know Google was the exact same time and was building some very different things with like these little collectibles uh and little like passports you know that you you could uh you could drop or leave for others you know and so those were just the first two like I didn't you know there were so many other companies that got going around that time you know obviously Instagram won it all at that time um you know but but there's so many others right like they're so again it's it's a yeah it's it kind of is a reminder that like at any given moment especially like when you talk about web3 or anything like next generation of companies yeah a ton of the things that sound great and awesome are probably gonna go you know be be like be you know erased or or or or or not make it but um yeah it was it was a fun time um yeah sorry my mind just randomly thought of Vine for a second and I was like oh I miss I miss Vine I don't know Vine it's firmly under the solo it was definitely a social and mobile um it's not a location stuff in there but uh yeah Vine mine is crazy um yeah yeah I mean I think like Vine had a magic moment for so many people when people downloaded it and it felt just so different like it was six seconds I think right those six second videos and um it was also so you know we're talking about particle like really well designed like Vine was also really well designed um totally right um yeah I think the other cool thing about it was you I mean it was the precursor to tick tock of course but like you could post something on Instagram get no love but post something on Vine and like you know yeah I have a friend you know I had random like my friend Jerome jarr who got like millions of followers on Vine was like this random french guy who just would have funny videos and then changed his life you know and I yeah I think that's the crazy the crazy part to me is that probably there's there's hundreds of millions there's a generation of tick tock um either users or creators who probably may not even remember Vine but uh yeah Vine is definitely in the DNA you know like the looping video the talent show like how how funny can you be within those constraints you know um even the idea of stitching things together right like obviously Bond wasn't the first to do that but they were the first really to bring that um you know that mechanic out there and yeah I miss it now yeah I don't think they they they die to slow and painful death um but you know it's just the nature of our industry right it's like everyone's kind of building on the shoulders of other people um yeah and that's uh what a good app I guess that's kind of where I want to shift gears a bit which is okay I figured it out I want to shift gears to we we lived in San Francisco in our 20s during the height of you know social and mobile and we we partook in that economy and we had some really high highs and some really low lows um right yeah I can picture them now and um there's a whole like we were the young kids then like we were the Gen Z back then right like we were we were the up and comers now and we're in our 30s like we're we've been there and done that and we're kind of older so what do you like what can we what do you take away from your time doing Social Mobile SF that you can impart to the Next Generation in terms of how do you build products that are gonna they're you know that people are gonna love you you know one thing I'd say there's a lot to unpacked there but but it's funny when you said Ben there done that I I actually something I try to pride myself in is this notion of The Beginner's mind um but just because you know you maybe maybe learned a particularly painful lesson or you learned you tried something that didn't work um that you can like continue to like keep that freshness and that enthusiasm so it can keep exploring you know things you're interested in um it's funny how I said I would never work in consumer social again but look at where I am now um and it's like we end up back here um one one thing I'd say is with the benefit of hindsight on that time was the joy of beginning the joy of starting was a superpower right like something I tell all kinds of young people is when they get started especially designers and creatives our industry is like you may not be money rich but you're definitely time rich and when you have when you're time wealthy which means you have like a ton of times like work nights and weekends and like work ABF like uh on a schedule that it would be uncomfortable for a lot of other people who have other lifestyle whatever who have like kids or whatever um there's nothing wrong with having kids by the way um it's just that you you can try more things and you can be a beginner much more frequently um and that's something I think is super important you know like especially as our industry gets Fuller and Fuller people just like you and I who had a certain set of experiences and certain years out there because all these people want to tell you like how you should be doing things or how you should approach things or let me tell you about that time we were growing LinkedIn or let me tell you about that time we were making Tinder grow on you USC new UCLA's campus and it's like okay sure maybe it worked that way then but it may not work that way now and I I think that that was one thing in SF that really caught on I I if so my most painful memories are like and you're listening to The Experts they're listening to like the like you know the people who've been there done that tell you how you need to be growing or tell you how you need to be approaching a problem um you know it was it was uh it was often really bad advice um and so yeah there's one story that actually resonates really specifically with me which is we were you know all in on mobile and like building out apps for the iPhone and Android um and literally there was someone who insisted that because his grandmother didn't have a smartphone when you like dedicate Two web Engineers to sending out an email digest to her uh for her to like you know um be able to follow and in hindsight now the I would tell that person to [ __ ] off but in the moment you're like oh wow this is a very experienced smart person who's telling us about the total addressable whatever being about that and the other okay yes let's spend two of our four web Engineers if that makes sense right um and and yeah what I'd say I don't want to cherry pick on that person um but I'd say like in general SF I'll probably carry these values with me lifelong that there will always be some notion of like experts or like the right people telling you how things need to be and especially in consumer the way you would grow is constantly evolving right it's so Dynamic um yeah I'm curious for you but your Tech because I know that you we had we experience of the highest size and lowest lows together I'm very curious for you uh if you flip the question on you um you know what comes to mind well I mean going back to our earlier conversation about where the Pod is going like I I want to bring on Builders like I don't want to bring on VCS like and I I think that and this is kind of a hot take I think but just because you invest in a company doesn't mean it's your company so a lot of VCS what they'll say is oh one of our companies oh I am so they invested out of their fund which they invested from LPS so not even their own money yeah they're going and they invest and then they're saying oh particle yeah that's one of our companies yeah sorry sorry Chad um yeah but just because you wired the money does not you were not in the trenches and you were not in the trenches you play a meaningful role in your connection with the business and it wouldn't exist in its current state without you but but I still but I still think that you know I'd much rather when I when I'm training notes around building consumer products I want to talk to Shreya I don't want to talk to yeah the VC here yeah like I think yeah all perspectives are valuable that I I can agree with you that I know there's some sometimes folks like VCS well like it's almost like a claiming credit for the success of like a singular credit I mean it's like yeah of course you help him but like if it's yes it's a little dirty when when they it's almost like they're taking credit for for the success of this it was especially funny though is like when they take credit years after or like talk shade what's worse is not even taking credit when they talk when they talk shade on the founder who has been successful after them or whatever and I think that's the entire other tangent um but yeah man like uh Builders tend to be the most fun to hang out with you know shared misery and shared Joy you know uh of of the process and yeah I don't know I mean that's how that's how we bonded like we bonded I don't know if you remember but we it was right before you you know you had a trip out we went to what was that beer garden yeah yeah and I remember exactly where we were we were we were at the second level and you were just telling me about free which you should tell people what it was because it was like ahead of its time so like crazy ahead of its time and it was so right on so many levels and you were having a hard time frankly like in you know yeah and [Music] you know not because you weren't executing well just because startups are difficult and consumer social is difficult and teams are hard and and it and we were bonding over that shared misery I think um but yeah tell folks what we was the timing you know because I think it's relevant well so I'll give some context that basically a path one of my my last things that were done was our messenger and I remember I literally put like the Targaryen symbol the dragon symbol from Game of Thrones on the room when we ship that messenger and mind you this is before Facebook Messenger got their act together like Facebook Messenger like you suppose like a very basic thing at the time um and and we wanted to really build like what would be what would be paths take you know on a messenger and like kind of went crazy there and so I'll say is from building that messenger saw holy cow the numbers around a messenger are just different you know like we also technically have the same loop as stories but you now would consider stories where you could post a photo and someone like no post a photo once a day and like come back like five ten times a day to see who else has seen it because that's what we call them scene it's empath um but the numbers change for Messenger like the the amount of time someone uses that if the message are just like crazy right and so I was like okay I really want to go build a messenger but I want to build a messenger um with a purpose and the purpose is like it owns that first message in the conversation and the classic picture I'll tell everyone is it reminds me of like this season sorry joke where he says like if you look on my phone on a Sunday I was like a psycho because I'm texting all my friends hey I want to grab brunch hey want to grab Brown she want to grab brunch you know um I think our friend Nikita has a funny joke which is like every social founder at one point tries to make an app for like getting people to hang out together IRL um and it's it's so true I think free is definitely my my uh my my version of that lesson um I think free yeah it was it was the the other way I would refer to it was like I grew up on ale and some messenger and I missed the Green Dot when you'd go home sign in and see your buddy let's see who's green and like for the green people you can chat with them and they were your friends and I wanted that for the real world and so I just wanted to see who was free at any given moment kind of like the hornagon door or like the bat signal whatever we built it I won't bore you with all the details or build more of the people your little details but um solve so many problems I think there are pieces of its new user experience and onboarding that still echo in a lot of apps today um you know I I made a ton of fun building it but also yeah a ton of Joy a ton of misery um and yeah I think when at the time I I also remember distinctly that they were in Southern Pacific I I think it was one of those moments where I was a Founder you kind of like you have you start to get a muscle for sketching out 9 12 and 18 months in advance even which at the time as a 22 23 year old I was not very good at you know um and I was like damn I think I think this isn't I don't know I don't know I don't know what's happening here um and and what I'll say is I think a lot of my conversation with other Founders today and I see myself and so many Founders I hang with today like it's that realization of like damn I don't know who else I can talk with like this you know because think about it with a team you have to give great you know you're trying to keep the inspiration like that that energy on Mondays and get through the week of like yeah here's the vision and like maybe your investor updates maybe you don't know truly how to be that candid like you know you know or to speak that bluntly because you also want to like Inspire confidence and faith in the team I think it's a very special type of like trusted relationship it can't be with investors too but or like other Founders or operators you you you you you trust but it's a very specific type of relationship where you can kind of share that you know um and and talk through it and really sketch out all the options you know for what they'll all look like um yeah and I remember that day it was it was a special day and a special weekend but we don't have to dive into that um you know I uh yeah but um that was that was a good that was that was a meaningful that was a really meaningful time for the last 10 years I've been building internal tools to help my sales teams or engineering teams work at blazing speeds but the catch with internal tools is it's really hard to build from scratch and maintaining them also requires a lot of engineering work and it's just frankly super tedious thankfully there's now a retool retool is a much faster way to build internal tools it has a complete library of a hundred plus fully featured accessible UI components that you can just drag and drop into any interface retools platform lets you build the custom internal tools your team needs 10 times faster it's a one platform to build your interface you can connect any data source any API and publish employee facing apps in record time it's also super flexible you can write custom code nearly anywhere to customize how your app looks and works and app environments SSO permissions and other critical app functionality are all available completely out of the box the result you can build production grade internal tools without the wasted effort of Googling component libraries debugging dependencies or rewriting boilerplate code thousands of teams at companies like Amazon doordash NBC late checkout collaborate around custom built retooled apps to operate faster operate better also teams of up to five can build retool apps for free so you shouldn't be surprised why we're big ritual fans at where it happens to learn more you just got to go to retool.com today's episode is brought to you by a company and product that has literally changed my life and one that I use every single day I started taking ag1 in 2011 because I wanted to feel great it's been a staple of my morning routine ever since yeah that's 10 years and 99 compliant I met the CEO when we were training at the same strength training facility way back in the day he had been creating an early version of the product to battle his own gut health issues when he realized how challenging and expensive it was to create an optimal routine on your own I started taking it during those college baseball years and was completely hooked over the years it has kept me feeling on point physically and mentally the best

again that is athleticgreens.com wih to take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional Insurance you won't regret it yeah I think um you do have to put on a bit of a face when you're talking to your team or VCS or advisors like it's it's hard to be a hundred percent unfiltered but with other builders it's hard not to be it's hard to be anything but 100 unfiltered right so it's your time to be like okay here's what's really going down I'd really love your opinion on XYZ and I don't think I don't know if I've said this on the Pod yet but um every year me and a group of uh six or seven entrepreneurs used to rent a house in La um and it was like a mastermind basically of Founders and we actually hired a moderator and we hired like a chef and I know this is sound bougie as hell but like not you know initially not not a lot of us had money we just like poured it into this and we would sit there and we would all work on each you know work with each other unfiltered Mastermind Founders and like we had like Sean paulry was one of those Founders um Julian Smith who you know who's been on he's a guest friend of the Pod uh you know he came up with breather there um I came up with Islands there flow water Nicholas Reichenbach who create you know it's in every Whole Foods Across the Nation he came up with it there uh it's not publicly traded company and I've been thinking a lot about masterminds and I want people to hit me up if this is interesting to them um but like we gotta we gotta we gotta we gotta we gotta bring it back you know I think it'd be I think it'd be awesome to to bring it back yeah I think it's awesome also because like especially because so many of us live on Twitter and and places like that where it's just like you just okay there's a couple things so people are you know spend a lot of time on Twitter and you can't really get feedback really on places like that and then big events big conferences and stuff like that is just like you're not it's so hard to find your people there so like these smaller like six to eight ten high quality trusted people bring them together do you know do a proper um I feel like that first of all no I feel like that's a huge opportunity for Founders and also like I feel like it needs to exist and all like I also think you can build a business around that I I tell you I'm just a weird epiphany of the day not Epiphany but just like how I think of things I mean it's funny that we're talking about this is such a public or a semi-public uh a forum but it's like the more public a place is even if it's for discussion you know conversation the more judgment there is right and I think judgment like the level of judgment in an area is inversely uh correlated to how like actually meaningful the interactions are going to be you know like I think that on Twitter you're like oh it went viral with the 100 300 000 likes you know you feel this like dopamine rip of like wow all these awesome people may have liked it or a lot of people saw it but like how meaningful was that versus a room that's low judgment where someone can bring up some really deep [ __ ] or like some whatever's on their chest and like talk about it and know that like no this is not like something that's gonna be people like screenshot and share around and all that toxic you know whatever stuff is going to go there but it's a meaningful place and so yeah I I think about at least for Builders you thrive in low judgment zones um look I've never been to Burning Man and I think everyone has a there say it's now actually a high judgment Zone from the from the the Peta gallery of like what actually happened to burning man these days but I think the idea of a place where people can actually kind of let their hair down and be themselves amongst the similar all you know amongst other people whether they know them well or not and into and to share ideas and talk through their [ __ ] sounds kind of awesome so anyways your masterminds sound dope I mean I love the I'd love to join the the one that you the first one you do when you bring them back you know yeah I mean maybe we can even share this like I think it needs to be sort of like it also needs to be fun right like so we would do you know 50 like structured okay everyone has a certain amount of time these are the questions you can ask like I think the structure is really important that's why the moderator is key here the whole thing and then we would have fun at like night times like dinners going out I don't know if we can show this image I I saw like on a like you know one time the only time I've shot a gun was in LA at one of these events um oh and uh yeah maybe we can like post the like in the show notes I'll I'll find the the picture it was like 12 years ago by the way non-sponsored uh plug if you ever want a cool place to shoot guns in a place that isn't about shooting guns drivetanks.com uh I don't even know if it's still around but it's in the mid it's like two hours outside of Austin you can literally Drive tanks and then the belt it's like it's very safe to take care of it for you and should you desire to you know build like a used car like they'll let you aim the cannon and shoot it also you let you shoot a Howitzer I actually now remember you can also shoot actual guns like like decals like miniguns it's very safe very supervised very like team off-site e energy but uh it's a great place to you know like go blow off some steam you know it's pretty cool yeah I mean listen I'm uh I think uh if you're gonna do an off-site Mastermind type thing like that like put it around something like that so you also have these like new experience like how many times have you driven a tank like for me like never right so then like not that I really want to drive a tank at all or shoot a gun but like the fact that I'm gonna do this with this group is like a bonding experience yeah I I'm sorry I just open drivetanks.com and look at their Sizzle reel on their front page and uh it's it's pretty it's pretty awesome you know I I kind of oh man this is a literally amazing first of all wow so what I'm looking at is I can't I can't believe this exists it looks like dude it's a tank literally going over a fully like tank that could be in Iraq or whatever like going over a car and like shooting missiles from it I look I've done this I've done the like crush a car underneath it I've definitely done the shot and I actually like this website's pretty good um you know like when they talk about like it was conversion like front page conversions I'm like it's so simple it's called drytanks.com the three offerings or drive a tank shoot a tank shoot big guns uh you know uh they they got to the point really quickly so it's um it's pretty good okay I'm pulling up the price list I'm curious how much this cost wow okay so there's a bunch of Tanks they've got like 12 different types of Tanks I gotta be real with you all I have no idea what the different tanks are but the the cheapest tank to drive is gonna cost you uh 600 bucks um yeah which is totally doable the most expensive like baller you came up with a billion dollar idea today at the end of The Mastermind is the stug three it's twenty two hundred dollars you know some good and then yeah it's uh I you know I'm not I'm really not here to plug them I think they have some packages too but you know hey uh for what people spend on like bottle service in the club versus uh a once in a lifetime memory driving a tank you know I think they're they're you know um yeah cool no I'm happy you made it I'm happy you talked about that so no I think yeah I think it's really important to to drive tanks at your at your at your Mastermind and I think like um yeah just do do things that are that are going to open you up both on on the structured piece of it of coming up with ideas but also on the bonding piece of it too yeah um yeah cool um going back we talked a little bit about you know sort of web 2 SF and but before that we talked about web3 and I wanna I wanna understand what what Danny Trends current state you know lay of the land of how you're feeling about web3 and and right now oh gosh I I think uh my my short answer would be you know it is it is definitely absurdly winter I think there's a lot of really cool people that I'm seeing charging forward and continuing to build um and I think it's it's it's kind of poetic that one of them is is Kevin you know I think he recently just moved down to LA and like there's really building out the proof team for my understanding there and like really going for it um yeah and it's yeah and it's it's um excuse me last week yeah I just realized that a bunch of other great people uh in that same in the same crew and family are all there and kind of pushing and so I'll say like it's kind of awesome to see you know um yeah there's that same kind of uh what's the right word for it um yeah the the perseverance and also the conviction to keep going like it's awesome to see now overall web3 a lot of other crazy [ __ ] like Del Quan you know he's got Interpol he's got a code red on out for him uh that's kind of awesome uh sorry I don't want to I don't wanna laugh at other people's Misfortune I think it's just you know there's all kinds of Corrections on the good and bad um and yeah it's it's it's it's it's a spicy time I mean it's it's absolutely winter so you know a lot of the Jokers are gonna leave a lot of the tourists they're gonna leave um and it's it's Pro it's definitely for the best I think this time last year you're probably at Peak hype Mania uh just blew up like a dad uh not and okay I wanted probably some fun not bad that like it was all bad just that there was just a lot of noise that probably wasn't healthy absolutely is not healthy um yeah we're back to Winter uh if you believe in the space you believe in the space if you're someone who was talking [ __ ] about it all for the last 18 months or years you feel very right you feel very like uh validated uh I don't think this will be the last winter I I think that there will absolutely be a future here um and yeah I I'm excited to see how it all goes down um but yeah I think if anything it's it's good that teams can be quiet less distracted like thinking about if you had a team in this space over the last 18 months especially on the run-up you're probably dealing with a bunch of more than 18 months years you're doing a bunch of crazy distractions or probably everyone's trying to hire their other other people constantly wondering like am I working on the bright thing am I missing out on like life-changing opportunity working on something else or trading something else or whatever and now that things are more quiet like there's going to be a ton more folks who are just focusing like you know kind of really pure about things and and doing and you know making the moves they want to make and I think we'll see where it all nips out who even knows how the rest of the world Nets out you know um right now like I think we're probably another six to nine months of a minimum of like sliding into finding where the bottom and darkness is um so something like definitely you know I don't think about every day it's not my it's not my day job uh but it's definitely something I'm keeping keeping tabs on you know yeah how do you um like I know I know you've got a day job but I do know that you're also like a lot of web 2 Founders in that era like we talked about Josh Williams like he's in web3 now Kevin Rose web 2 you know prolific web 2 founder yeah he's in web3 yeah I've been doing a lot of web3 stuff and a lot of our friends in that you know Donnie denge web3 now um what do you like why do you think were attracted to web3 and why do you think that we're still excited about it um and do you have like are you less or more excited about it than let's say a year ago so there's something that there's some advice I gave about this stuff to believe this time last year to someone that was just getting into it I was like you need to divorce two brains if you're a product builder in this space one is like why you're building and what you're building what you're excited about and the second is like the generative greed DJ and greed on like trading and then making money because I'm like if you let the two brains come together it's gonna get very messy for you and your enthusiasm your motivation is going to be this like toxic mix of like why are you building you know um and so I think obviously for anyone that's in it for degenerative to DJ and greed uh they've lost a ton of enthusiasm as things pull down and then you gotta like you know uh seek shelter but I think for a lot of people they're building it for well I would call the right reasons which are like The Primitives are changing and it's the promise of like a better future um yeah I think a lot of those people and everyone I talk to is it's almost like business as usual like they're continuing on amidst the challenge right and this is not the first or last time that the people in this space have dealt with crazy challenges or being told are completely wrong and silly like it's funny to me I actually remember probably around that time 2016 when you and I were hanging out in Southern Pacific where like I feel like it was chat Bots Ai and crypto we're like the three like laughing like you could like the butt end of every joke right like oh remember that person worked on chatbots another person worked on crypto stuff remember that person who worked on AI and it's kind of funny now at least in 2022 that I'm like AI like nothing to joke about with AI like some of the crazy truly like crazy [ __ ] is happening before our eyes like making it into a very like into the mainstream right crypto like and no one's laughing about I mean you may laugh at the collapse like if you're laughing at that collapse laughing at the economies collapse which is you know um but you know that's your prerogative and maybe yeah Chef bats yeah like if anyone's working on a chatbot now I'd still be like what are you doing there uh folks um but so what I did is like what are you doing there like uh that's probably my PC uh it's my like PC yeah uh whatever but like but you know Cycles right and like I think the thing about people who are generally excited about these things like their enthusiasm gets tested and retested and the ones that tended to last through multiple Winters and do the best are the ones that keep persisting right like if you're a conviction in some of these spaces is so low that you get you know you you can drop this quickly you probably aren't working in the right space you know um and if anything I think one thing you can't deny is that the the conversations change right like the conversation on the types of people are interested in this stuff and the types of things they're building is is now like we we've opened we've gone through a one-way door right because so many major companies so many major like universes of Ip are are into this now it's gonna be really exciting to see what happens um I I think that's the one thing about right now you're like oh are you so excited about it like well whether I am or not excited about it I'm absolutely not going to ignore it you know like the the thing about it right now is like it's it's typically the people that ignore shifts like these are the ones who are the cautionary tales it's like the Nokia guy talking [ __ ] about the iPhone you know or or like uh ever or like all the like the big consumer web apps that were like they're kind of [ __ ] on like the move to Mobile in general you know um and yeah it's I think typically the folks who record default dismissive of of of interesting new things technically take years to bore out those are the ones that like uh you know history always remembers as the fools and so I think right now look tough times like guess what been here before multiple times you know and so I I think it's um it's interesting to see you know so who knows who knows what the solvers what are your thoughts uh on web free loyalty I saw a few weeks ago Starbucks obviously launched uh a really big push into loyalty I'm curious uh what you think I think around that that that's in the I I hope that a recording of This podcast hasn't become like a cautionary tale me sounded like an idiot a few years from now um I think my immediate reaction is like it's cool to see them build it's cool to see an experiment that's where you're talking about like sf2008 it's like when I was a teenager still I'm a youngster and a beginner's Mind At Art I'm like it's awesome to see people experimenting if it doesn't work out I'm like net net something they did when in that experiment will probably be a building block that someone else grabs and uses and takes off I think Starbucks is probably going nowhere maybe this is like the funny quote for like two years from now Starbucks implodes um but like I don't think Starbucks is going anywhere so cool on them to experiment with some stuff maybe they'll change and approach maybe they won't you know it's kind of like motor before the iPhone Motorola made The Rocker with apple which is a 99 song limit on it and everyone thought like this if this is the iPhone this is not the future I'm like okay I think people will experience with loyalty stuff just as like music entities are trying to figure out what the pardon like yeah what the [ __ ] that actually all means you know uh but yeah I think that's essential to getting there um there's a book I really love about like you know like a good model for Innovation is like you have artists and soldiers right and like if they're defined by their relationship with risk right it's like soldiers are fundamentally about low risk because you don't want to kill everybody and artists are fundamentally about high risk you're rewarded to take lots of risks and to fail a lot fail a lot and typically soldiers and artists hate each other's guts because they misunderstand each other like soldiers look at artists and like you don't do any work you don't have any discipline you're just trying a bunch of stuff that goes nowhere and artists look at soldiers are like you're so like like unafraid of trying anything new and like you're so you're like you're gonna be like left behind and I would say that's the moment where we are right now like in one of these like like you know Winters where the artists and the soldiers look at each other and and and think the other one is the fool right like the the there are many artists like you're talking about some great friends they're going to continue to push on and try things Starbucks what not like I think there's a ton of other companies trying stuff and the soldiers who are like trying to survive you know in economic recession or Worse are looking at them like you idiots I can't believe you're continuing to move on you know and that's my take of right now is that it's it's artists and soldiers I use this same model actually like for people who are working teams where you have an office still you know the people who come in super early and we also leave early until we come in super late and leave late and I'm like oh there's those two people judge each other just at different times of the day like those early people come in they're like oh I can't believe so-and-so is not here yet and then those people that come in late see those early people leaving earlier like oh I can't believe you're calling it you're throwing in the towel so early you know and and so you know fleshing out my answer here I I think when I look at stuff like Starbucks or I see people trying out stuff I'm like okay I think I net buys towards the artist lens which is I love seeing people try stuff even if it goes you know to zero and fails because that's what gives me energy you know like uh seeing people like take take a shot now yeah I do I advise the artist's lifestyle for soldiers or the soldier lifestyle for artists no um and so you know I think especially when you look at something that's polarizing as web 3 right now it's like really easy for folks on both sides to really entrench in their positions um and so maybe my last thing on this long ramble I'd say is like I would ask someone where they think they are like deep down on it and if they could empathize for a second for a little bit with the other side um and and that that's my my take on what three is like it's it's a look in the mirror for how you feel about these things in general um and so someone who's a soldier by day works a big company life and like only like scales things looks like two to five to ten percent God forbid gains uh looks at some of these moves as like really risky or like like rear ending and I'm like okay that's that's just it's cool that people are experimenting like it's like and I think you know I'm I'm happy that on on the start you know from a startup of one to a startup of Starbucks or a company of Starbucks like that we're kind of we're not taking the status quo as like okay this is the world we live in and like these are the products that exist now we're gonna like push the envelope over here push the envelope over here try different things and we'll find out what what is going to resonate with with folks um yeah but I think I think um I think it's cool that first of all I love the soldier um artist like kind of way of thinking about it and I also think it's cool that I happen to be on your camp like I love I like when I see people um on Twitter for example like seeing the launch of a startup and being like but actually you know like the but actually guy um but actually this is a bad idea because XYZ and it's like no like we need to celebrate peep builders yeah yeah I I mean if anything think about like I look at like this like if you're a meme account that loves to like trade on being like you know making hilarious jokes but other people and God knows I love a good Meme and I love I love there's so many accounts I find very hilarious but net net I think a lot of those meme accounts Pander to like the soldier type who likes to be you know like yeah duh look at that failure like oh so clearly bad or like oh got him you know got em yeah I got him and you know like oh and I'm like okay go back to your like whatever life you know like they chuckle at the meme they heart it and they move on with their like whatever the [ __ ] they're doing for the rest of the day and it's like okay you know the it is it's it's what makes this account successful and like uh it's it's what gets their engagement up you know and I can't knock that hustle either because they're slowly trying to like get EX like blow up and make a business I'm sure whatever they're doing like it can be hilarious um it's just not you know I I'd like to think in my pure heart that I I'm not I'm not there even though I know I'm probably very guilty of that same type of uh dunking sometimes but yeah like I think that that it's uh on the on the spectrum of like soldiered artists like the audience of the people like getting giving all that like feedback of I got them are just like it said not to be artists you know like that's and that's fine it's totally fine um yeah cool let's uh that's a mic drop I think that's a lot for people to to digest and think about where they sit on the Spectrum and um artists versus versus Soldier and um D Trin you're you're you're you're your family you know you're not just a friend of the Pod you're you're in the family so thanks for coming back on and uh where could people find you on the internet yeah just teaching is my my Twitter and what I'd say is I I hope you stay safe with hurricane Ian I hope that maybe when this comes out there hopefully a hurricane is well passed you know um or else your hair is gonna get a lot more wet you know what I mean you're gonna you're gonna require a podcast like in the middle of a little hurricane uh but yeah it's it's always a lot of uh Eventbrite RSVPs you know hurricane Ian it's just hidden hidden that of Emperor at RSVP a few times yeah um but yeah wishing you all the best man and and candidly I think if anything this is just like a semi-public face time with you so I I'm like I'm glad to catch up and then see yeah and hear your voice it's great to see you it's great to hear you and then that's like that's the new vision of of the where it happens pod is just like catching up with friends basically publicly who are interesting in creators Commerce and community and and then people listen to this and you're gonna be smarter because you're gonna listen you know you might not agree with anything you say oh [ __ ] yeah go for it Danny no I have a crazy idea for your format I mean if you call it like based on with friends it could be literally like your screen recording and like you're actually it's like it's about that so they keep it authentic it's like you kind of tell maybe you tell it's almost like remember like Who Wants To Be A Millionaire you would tell the fellow friend people roughly to be available in case their friend was on the show and they're being called but like you could show literally you're FaceTiming some people and they're not there they hang up or like they say like they don't answer the call and then finally someone picks up and you're like Yahtzee you know um and like and that's who we got this week you know uh but like you're just keeping it real they're like hey yeah we tried a few people like uh you know and then bam like right now we're just gonna FaceTime with friends and keep it super chill um I like it I mean dude there's enough interview podcast like where it's like okay hey like so tell me about tell me your story and it's like okay I went to here and went to there it's like no I think that's you know going back to like the trenches and stories and the trenches I think people that's I think that's what people want

while it was definitely messy i didn't avoid that because well my background is in nothing like this i didn't know anything about product anything about communities i was just like i have this idea and so a website i didn't realize would just crash if i had a certain amount of people on it i really had no idea about these things so at each kind of milestone we just kept out growing what we had and i had to learn about bringing in a product team and what even a product team looks like and a community manager and people with experience of being able to navigate that so i definitely didn't avoid it but it taught me a lot [Music] thank you so much for uh for joining us and and um and first to stephen your husband for uh helping with the tech the tech check there i know i just grabbed him out of his workout i don't even know how i run a podcast honestly but it works we got it it works and we're here and we're thankful for it you know i i do um this is kind of a funny and awkward start to the whole thing but i was like doing my prep for this and greg sent me a bunch of things uh you know to take a look at one of them was your instagram account and the first thing that jumped out to me on your instagram account is that we have a common love of uh cold exposure and the cold plunge so i need to ask as a starting point how did you and your husband i assume he uses it too how did you guys get into this in the first place he persuaded me and he put this thing in the backyard and he was like we're gonna get into cold plungers i was not interested i'm only three months postpartum i was not interested in this at all but one morning the baby just didn't sleep and i had to wake myself up and coffee wasn't working he was like just get in the cold punch i swear it'll work and you know when you're like i've got nothing to lose and i jumped in and i've never experienced bliss and energy like it when i came out so i'm converted i'm hooked i'm sold i it's what it's pretty wild i mean i've been saying this to greg and greg's like uh you know why would i do something painful and hard you know like we have a difference of opinion on this in general but i'm like uh so so back in the day like baseball days natalie so i played baseball in college back in the day i had this friend of mine this guy chad rogers who was a professional player i was playing in college and we used to do like crazy stupid [ __ ] as like mental training under the guise of mental training and part of that was like we would go in the dead of winter in boston where i lived and we'd go like swim in a frozen river like we'd go into our necks and go swim around and see how long it would take before we thought we were gonna die and um so i like used to do stuff like this but then for like 15 years did not you know 10 years did nothing of the sort and got the cold plunge and immediately felt that like massive dopamine rush that you're talking about feeling i mean it's it's crazy like this the first 30 seconds of misery is followed by like pure bliss and almost even like uh euphoria when you're when you're getting out of it i know and i really didn't expect that because i'm not the kind of person that likes to put myself in like very uncomfortable physically torturous experiences like that but getting to the other side i was just posting this morning about how it's such a lesson though because so many times we give up before it gets good because we don't know that it's gonna get good and i was so close to doing that at the weekend because i was trying to do a 12 minute one and i was so close to getting out and all of a sudden something switched and it started feeling so good and i felt like i probably could have stayed in there way longer but it just it goes for everything if we knew if we could see what was around the corner we probably would keep going but we can't see what's around the corner so too often we're like man i'm gonna go the other way but it's nice when you push through when you get that feedback and you're like okay reminder i get to keep pushing through these things for the last 10 years i've been building internal tools to help my sales teams or engineering teams work at blazing speeds but the catch with internal tools is it's really hard to build from scratch and maintaining them also requires a lot of engineering work and it's just frankly super tedious thankfully there's now retool retool is a much faster way to build internal tools it has a complete library of 100 plus fully featured accessible ui components that you can just drag and drop into any interface retools platform lets you build the custom internal tools your team needs 10 times faster it's a one platform to build your interface you can connect any data source any api and publish employee facing apps in record time it's also super flexible you can write custom code nearly anywhere to customize how your app looks and works and app environments sso permissions and other critical app functionality are all available completely out of the box the result you can build production-grade internal tools without the wasted effort of googling component libraries debugging dependencies or rewriting boiler plate code thousands of teams at companies like amazon doordash nbc lay check out collaborate around custom built retooled apps to operate faster operate better also teams of up to five can build retool apps for free so you shouldn't be surprised why we're big retool fans at where it happens to learn more you just gotta go to retool.com want to address why i don't do the cold plunge i feel like i need to defend myself please do so i've been doing startups since i've been a teenager which is the ultimate cold plunge except you might not get the the payoff of the euphoria that's startups i feel like you know i feel like that's what it is it's just incurring pain uh that might not have euphoria at the end well yeah i think like there's this romantic idea of startups and you know everyone wants to be an entrepreneur and you know it works out okay when i talk about startups i'm talking about like venture back startups i'm not talking about being a creator or bootstrapping something i'm talking about like going big um to me the cold plunge is going big except yeah that's the vibe i get from it i mean there's a whole host of like actual science-backed like research proven benefits from a physical and mental standpoint dopamine release thing is actually very real um i actually there's no there's no surprise why like natalie's husband was a professional e-athlete right he was one of the what's yeah and uh it's interesting to see you high performers you know baseball player league of legends um people like it you know love the cold punch so much there's just something about the cold man do one hard thing to start the day it makes everything feel easier that's all i will say i'll say do one easy thing to start the day this is the difference of opinion grant i don't think we're ever going to agree on this man it's good it's good i don't want to agree on everything with you but this is one for sure um well natalie i um i'm super excited to get to have this conversation i mean there's so much that i feel like you and greg have in common around you know you're thinking on on communities and community-based building um maybe just as like a starting point though can you can you just like give the quick background on you and how you kind of came to be where you are today yeah i've always been very entrepreneurial just from a really young age i always knew that i wanted to be my own boss i didn't even know what the word entrepreneur meant so i had a bunch of little businesses i would say throughout school and college and i started my first kind of serious business right out of college where um i was manufacturing supplements wait one sec can you hear the baby in the background or no i've got the same thing on my end so i was literally hearing it and being like is that my kid is that i have a three month old i was like is that my kid crying nice three months too let me just tell us at one time please greg while uh while she does that i literally i literally had that reaction i could hear it and i was like i went on mute and i was like going like this to try to figure out like is that my kid or is that natalie that's amazing i thought i thought it was roman roman's kind of got like a little bit of like uh i'm trying i'm trying to work with him on it like his his cry is still a little bit too high pitched for my liking so i'm trying to get him to go into more of like a deeper roar of a cry yeah like him to be more it needs to be more raspy i was talking about my son's cry it's a little too like it's a little too dainty still and it's really cute it's like it's very it makes me very sad when i see him crying um but he needs to get a little more like chest i want him to get like kind of a chest cry going well you're lucky because your boobs don't leak when your baby cries i need to be like can we get the baby to the other end of the house it's like it's a little different you and my wife should definitely have a conversation about this um is like a total total thing that's like a new world to me but man parenthood we're definitely going to wind back to that but you got cut off from your uh from your story so i had my first serious business out of college where i was manufacturing supplements and i had no marketing budget this was just completely bootstrapped and i just i i was in love with the idea of what i was doing but i knew i just wanted to get something out there versus going to the graduate job that i'd just been offered with accenture and so i in this time of getting them manufactured i started an instagram account and i think we grew to about 35 000 followers and so when we launched this business very very quickly we were shipping to over 60 countries we then got stocked in um a store called boots over 250 stores across the uk which is the equivalent of walgreens in america and that was my first foray into real business and managing cash flow and i was absolutely terrible at it i couldn't for the life of me figure out how to manage my cash flow and so while i was doing this i started just looking around for other women like me i just thought there has to be other young women like me figuring it out having no idea what we're doing and that's where i really got into instagram and i started posting stuff that was just very very real entrepreneurship you know at the time quotes weren't as popular as they are today so it's just very real tongue-in-cheek ambitious and that instagram account grew into what boss babe is today so and so let me just pause you just for one second so your your nutritional uh your like supplement business um what was it for a particular niche was it broad like what was the customer base or the brand or like how had you decided to start that yeah so it was for a particular name she was for young women that was struggling with acne prone skin okay and basically i'd found i'd been traveling to america while i was still college and i found that it was really normal over here to put powders in your smoothies which of course we all know now but at the time you know in the uk that just wasn't a thing people didn't know what this was they didn't know what superfoods were and i found that just by making a blend of all these really high nutritional ingredients it was really really good for your skin for your energy and so i started putting that together so it was just something that i had the idea for and no one was really doing it huh okay got it so just like i'm fascinated by um greg knows this i'm fascinated by people who like have an insight like that and then with with no like formal training are able to just go and launch a business around it that you scaled so like what did you actually like what you clearly had a bias for action to go start it but how did you get that going like did you go find a contract manufacturer did you go find like what was the actual process in the like zero to one phase of that yeah i had no idea i just built it off of google honestly so i i had an idea of all the ingredients i wanted to use and i started making things in my kitchen and then i went to a formulator to say hey does this actually like work is this gonna hurt anyone does this work can we make this into a product worked with a formulator and then was still just kind of blending stuff up in my kitchen and then ended up going to a manufacturer who i just agree they agreed you know what we'll give this little business a try we'll do really really small runs for you and it just kind of grew from there it was very much just me and my laptop and like trying things in the kitchen and you were going through wholesalers like you were selling to retailers or were you um were you going direct to consumer and selling like through a d2c page yeah i was going direct to consumer through instagram and then one day um someone called me and they were like hey wear boots we saw you on instagram and i thought it was a hoax and that was the retailer asking if they could stock it in stores and i was like yeah sure but i had no idea how i was going to even pay for it because with retailers you get paid if you're lucky 90 days after you deliver the product and i'm paying my factory two months before i even it was i just said yes and i've always had that attitude of like yes sure and i'll figure it out but it was a headache and i probably wouldn't do it again honestly you learned about the joys of uh working capital uh in the early days of that business i've seen a whole i mean you see a whole lot of businesses go under because of that exact dynamic like you know you're paying your your uh producers so far in advance of when your your retailers are paying you it's like you know a terrible dynamic to have to deal with when especially when you're growing it hurts you the most when you're growing so you think everything's going well and suddenly you realize you have no cash left in the bank because you paid all your manufacturers way out in advance of when you're due to be paid um okay so sorry i cut you off um the next iteration of this it sounds like is something that i want to kick it over to greg around too which is like you had an insight around community like you were struggling entrepreneurs probably an overstatement it sounds like you were doing quite well but you were a female entrepreneur you know at a time when you felt like that was rare and there had to be other people out there that were struggling with the same things as you greg you know like you as a community-based product guy that seems like an interesting um an interesting overlay there where there was like an insight around community that came out from actually building a product well i think i think natalie correct me if i'm wrong but you know you were just being yourself right like you you you created the instagram page because you're like i feel like this needs to be out there just so it just turns out that there's millions of other people like you that have that want that support and then i think you did a really good job and i want to get into it around like how do you create a product to support that community yeah exactly and i had i didn't have an intention of turning it into a business but it got to a point where i realized there was a lot of women looking for something like what i was doing like this kind of community in a more formal place and the way we turned it into a product was i just thought what if every month we got to learn from a really amazing entrepreneur would i have more chance of convincing them to teach me stuff if i had this community who were also there to learn from it and that's really just it just grew so organically and it's kind of every product we've ever built has been like that it's just grown from what they're asking for you know it's such like an interesting um i've learned a lot about this just from being around greg but it's such an interesting way of reframing being a product company to be a community company and build that fervent tribe and just taking it to take your direction from them like just as you said right there it becomes abundantly clear what product you need to deliver what service you need to deliver when you're in touch with the community and when you have this group of people that is uh you know being cultivated along the way um it seems like just such a de-risked approach to consumer like greg had a tweet you had a tweet recently greg of like um something about like the next wave of large consumer companies are going to be community based and it strikes me as so true actually when i hear it put in this perspective because you hear um you know consumer companies that have to take massive bets on products that are unproven that's so scary um and you end up investing so much up front for something that is like an unclear payoff but when you have a community that's told you a million times that they want exactly this or has signaled to you in a million different ways that they want this suddenly you're so de-risked in terms of the product launch and what your roadmap actually looks like greg any reactions i mean my reactions is like i've been like screaming about this into like a black hole for like so many years and then i feel like 2020 hit and then community became this like massive buzzword there was just like a rush of companies that just were using it improperly and i feel like actually now you know we're in 2020 2022. um i i just feel like especially with the economic downturn coming you know here and recession here like now is the best time to do a community-based product because it de-risks it for the entrepreneur and you don't have to spend a lot of money on ads to basically get people to your product so i think what you're gonna see is like over the next two three four years there's going to be this massive sort of influx of community-based products again can you talk about um either one of you actually like what it actually means to you like what is a community greg you you just i think had talked about like your framework at late checkout for what is a community and i think you had this like the tribe test around it um can you just walk through that actually uh as like a framework for us to talk about boss babe yeah so i tweeted um stop calling your instagram audience a community an audience doesn't equal community how to think about audience versus community and at lake checkout which is our product design agency you know they developed this uh this test called tribe which is you know we call it the community test so is there togetherness are there rituals is there member identity uh is there belonging and do people engage with each other so if you have those five things then you have a community because i was just like seeing so many people just throw that word around community community community i was it was getting a bit frustrating um and so yeah we came up with the test for it go ahead natalie sorry i i love that and i think it's so true and i even see you know some people trying to take their instagram community and putting them uh instagram following up community and putting them into a facebook group so they can sell to them and calling that a community and i still don't think it is because you know we do it slightly different in a way that we have certain things that we do with them on a weekly basis they know what they can expect they know exactly what they're coming for we're not just building this community to keep selling to them over and over and over again the community is the product that's the thing that they're there for and sure there's different ways they can get up sold into certain things if they segment themselves but you can't i don't just think you can put people into a group and assume that they're a community if they're just there to listen to you doing live videos how are they interacting with each other where are they getting the real community value from so i want to do a little exercise around this actually because i think it's i think it's a super interesting topic but it's one that to greg's point is constantly talked about and yet rarely actually workshopped like everyone talks about what is a community you know oh you need to start a community but like how do you actually do that and how do you build these things and natalie you've clearly done this and are doing this in real time greg has done this and invested behind a bunch of businesses that do this so let's use like just as an example because this is something i think about a lot and am thinking about a lot my newsletter list um so i have a newsletter natalie for reference called the curiosity chronicle today it's about 115 000 people on the newsletter list open rates are great like around 50 percent very engaged people constantly reply send me thoughts etc it's an awesome you know group generally around like growth growth-minded growth-oriented topics productivity self-improvement um you know life lessons things like that i am currently in the process of thinking through building out a community around it and i would love to just like get your guys thoughts in almost like a workshop setting of like how would you actually launch a community like what do you actually have to functionally do to go hit this tribe test and to go build it or are some of the things intangible and you just don't know if you can do it i think that's definitely tangible and i think one place i would start greg i love the way you called out the identity piece so with our community women call themselves boss babes and it's very clear that they're labeling themselves as being part of the community and so when you're thinking about that identity piece it's thinking about what does it mean for someone to be part of my community you know if they were to meet another person who's on my newsletter in my community in the street what would they be talking about what would they know they already have in common and how would they refer to each other i think that piece is really really interesting um and that's something we always did from the beginning and i do see when people can call themselves something it resonates are you have you seen the same thing greg a hundred percent and so like if people are watching this on youtube like sahel's watching uh wearing this new hat intellectually curious which i just bought yesterday and it's all about you know i think if you can sell out merch that's a good sign that you're you're on to a community-based product because it's people self-identifying and being like i love this so much that i want to go out there in the world and i want to rep your stuff yeah that does seem like a good razor i you know you know i talk a lot about razors like little rules of thumb and things like that the merch one definitely does seem that way the other one you've talked about in the past which i love is like is someone willing to watch you on a live stream talk about nothing we were just talking about that greg about martin shkreli that like [ __ ] you know i think he's like one of the worst people on the planet we have a friend who really likes him um and thinks he's super interesting but um one of the things about that guy is like he's probably one of the most hated people on the planet but he also has these raving fans who are willing to like watch him on a live stream for hours and talk about nothing and do nothing and like that is a community that he has that clearly for whatever reason really likes him and thinks he's interesting um so that strikes me as like another razor of thinking about whether you have something that could be the seeds of community how did you think natalie about like this whole thing of engaging with each other like was that natural to the boss babe community immediately that the women were engaging with each other or did you have to like kind of go in there in the early days and really like stoke that fire of engagement yeah it wasn't natural because when we launched our first product which was our membership you know we it was trickling in we were doing it live so people were joining this group and there was like five of them and i'm telling them this is the best community online of female entrepreneurs and there's like five of them looking around and one thing that we did early on was these rules of engagement and it didn't matter whether there was five people but we told them how to engage so that we took the guesswork out of it they didn't have to just pull up a blank empty post and think am i gonna say hi and tell them about my kids today or what am i going to do and so we set these rules of engagement of this is a really supportive place this is where you bring transparently the problems you're working through in your business this is where you bring a solution if you've got something you can offer someone else and you can do that kind of trade this way you'll do it and i was just really clear from that in the beginning and then i'd facilitate the conversation so every day would have a theme and on the certain theme i'd post something and start to get people commenting on those threads on the day and people just grew very used to that happening so they knew on a friday i was going to post something that meant they could come in and share with us their latest product links um and get feedback on them so it was little things like that i did to facilitate it and before too long it kind of became second nature to the people in the group and when they join our community would really helpfully help other people to curate their posts in in the way that's going to get them the best response so two two follow-ups to that number one you mentioned the kind of the fear in the early days of like there weren't many people in there and you're like oh this is the best community in the world and there's five people would you in hindsight like if you were giving um advice to someone that wants to start a community today would you wait until it got to some like until you had enough sign ups for there to be like a critical mass to launch it or did you do you think that was the right way to do it to just start it and kind of have the gated access from the get-go i think it was right for us because within that i think office launch period we were open for seven days and i think we brought in like 1500 paid members so it it felt like enough to get something really going and off the ground but even if i hadn't had that many people join i still would have done it like that because i really don't think you i don't think a lot of people know the importance of that to like back and forward conversation with those early audience members and early community members that's who's really telling you what they want to see and so i would still be in there and just treating it like it's okay it's me and my five friends and i'm gonna build some raving fans here because we're really gonna listen to each other and support each other and i i tried to keep i still would say i try to keep the community like that you know it's way bigger now but i still go in and i try to always know the names and faces of members if they're regulars coming to calls and i call them out and i make sure they feel seen and i read through the post to see what the common threads are and you kind of yes you might not have that big critical mass in the beginning but if you've got those raving fans you've got something really invaluable there and those are the people that are going to go and bring more people in in my opinion yeah i like how you're you're thinking about the culture like you're thinking about the boss babe culture and how to how to how to always improve upon it have you heard of uh the eternal september mindset or the eternal september story i feel like style you love this one no i like it tell me so [Music] eternal september um you know before there were forms on the internet basically there was this thing called usenet it was like a bulletin board in like the 80s and early 90s and back then it was college students who got access to the internet and what they noticed is that every september basically all these freshmen would come in to the these bbs's the bulletin boards and they would completely ruin the culture and they would because they didn't know how to use the internet it was their first time and they'd post stuff and it basically would create a horrible experience for everyone else and every september would happen until it was like 1993 or 1994 aol basically started offering bulletin boards and there was this like massive influx of i guess like a million plus users and it completely ruined the culture for bbses this particular bbs and the lesson they call it eternal september is that it's so important that as you grow that you're you're you're thinking about okay it's great that you know word of mouth is happening it's great that there's an influx of people but how do i improve upon the experience uh not make it get worse it is such an interesting i mean just tactically i find it so interesting because we have a lot of listeners who i'm sure thinking of either as a bolt-on to their existing business or for the future thinking of building communities i mean a community is a an amazing solopreneur business model we know a lot of people who have built you know a community that um is small niche around a really interesting topic that a few people care about and they've built a really fervent you know paid community around it that can be a great business to own and run and be able to live your lifestyle and this strikes me as like a very cool tactical discussion around how to do it the scaling part i'm still a little stuck on so i'd love to hear more of your thoughts around it like you have the early days you bring people in there's a ton of excitement the energy of the launch carries a lot of momentum i imagine in terms of people engaging with one another and the rituals and belonging and all of these things on greg's tribe test and then you kind of hit you know what our friend scott belski talks about around the messy middle of the community i imagine where the the excitement and energy of the launch has worn off um a lot of new people have come in that maybe don't have quite as much connection to the group um did you start just like tactically were there things you did like did you hire community managers that were really important for kind of keeping things and making sure everyone understood rules of engagement um did you start like a sort of alpha member committee like the people that you knew you could really count on the ogs the day ones to to ask them about different things you were thinking of launching like what were the things that you really did to ensure that that messy middle wasn't so messy as you scaled for the last 10 years i've been building internal tools to help my sales teams or engineering teams work at blazing speeds but the catch with internal tools is it's really hard to build from scratch and maintaining them also requires a lot of engineering work and it's just frankly super tedious thankfully there's now retool retool is a much faster way to build internal tools it has a complete library of 100 plus fully featured accessible ui components that you can just drag and drop into any interface retools platform lets you build the custom internal tools your team needs 10 times faster it's a one platform to build your interface you can connect any data source any api and publish employee-facing apps in record time it's also super flexible you can write custom code nearly anywhere to customize how your app looks and works and app environments sso permissions and other critical app functionality are all available completely out of the box the result you can build production-grade internal tools without the wasted effort of googling component libraries debugging dependencies or rewriting boilerplate code thousands of teams at companies like amazon doordash nbc lay checkout collaborate around custom built retooled apps to operate faster operate better also teams of up to five can build retool apps for free so you shouldn't be surprised why we're big retool fans at where it happens to learn more you just gotta go to retool.com while it was definitely messy i didn't avoid that because well my background is in nothing like this i didn't know anything about product anything about communities i was just like i have this idea and so a website i didn't realize would just crash if i had a certain amount of people on it i really had no idea about these things so at each kind of milestone we just kept out growing what we had and i had to learn about bringing in a product team and what even a product team looks like and a community manager and people with experience of being able to navigate that so i definitely didn't avoid it but it taught me a lot so what we've been able to do that i think keeps our excitement really high within the group is every month it's kind of like a mini launch every month we still continue to bring in a really well sought after female entrepreneur that i know our members are really excited about learning from and we do a lot of build up of what's coming we do like sneak peeks into the content and then we drop the content it's very digestible we made a big mistake in the past of trying to throw everything at our members in the hope of being valuable and our engagement plummeted so when we thought people would be really excited and engaged it plummeted so we realized when we got to a certain point we had to do fewer things and do them a lot better and get more out of our content that part was really really important for us um you know i would also say in that kind of messy middle you're you probably have to move away from a really tight niche that got you started in the beginning so when i first started i had this really really tight niche because the avatar was me whereas when we started having you know multiple thousands of members through that niche started to widen and in order to scale we had to widen that and luckily our community on instagram continued to grow and grow we've never successfully ran ads it just never performs as anywhere near our organic stuff and so i'm a big believer in just going all in in one thing and we probably will figure our ads at some point but for us it's just been organic organic and how can we continue expanding that and so with that i had to have one ear to the ground of the instagram and podcast newsletter community that i'm building and another ear to the ground with our actual paid community and see how i could expand both together so yeah i didn't avoid it and i'm sure we'll still hit another messy later at some point as we outgrow certain things but i think we have built enough trust in our community that they know when we hit those kinds of things something better is coming because they've seen it happen before where are you today like size wise how many people are part of this community we've had over now 25 000 paying members through and in total with our just all of our products um we've had about 170 000 members through so we've gotten to a good size now where we have to learn all of the things about product and tech and and being able to sustain it but yeah i mean i'm living proof that you don't need a background in any of this stuff to make it work google and is so helpful so and the business model is is a monthly subscription for paying members is that the standard yeah so there's a few angles to the business model so our community yeah it's a monthly membership you can pay monthly or annually and then we have two accelerator programs that we open a couple of times a year and then another arm to the business now is partnerships um and working with brands how much is the monthly membership out of curiosity now it's 49 when we started it was 27 okay got it so i mean there's like very real arr coming through the system from just the subscriptions on on the community yeah which has been so great for us and i'm glad we did that first because always having that recurring revenue has meant that we've never had to make decisions that we'd regret out of cash flow fear because i never wanted to be a venture-backed company i always wanted to be able to bootstrap this and i do feel like if we hadn't have had that revenue that i know was coming in we would have had to make some decisions that probably would have compromised where we wanted to go as a brand in order to bring some quick cash in whereas having that has meant i always knew what my cash flow looked like i could make really smart hiring and investing decisions and take the product growth really really slow yeah i um you know i typically try not to do public math on um on podcasts because i think it's like generally just a bad idea but just like the the scale of what you're talking about is really amazing and so i do want to call it out because it's super impressive we don't have 25 000 paying members we've had that many members too okay i see i see i got they're not there's not currently 25 000. there's a lot of members members today i would have to pull the numbers but in in our recurring programs i would probably say there's about 9 000 oh still a lot yeah there's still a lot but it's not the 25 000. yeah yeah sure um that's okay that's still i mean it's it's still really amazing i mean like that's that's easier public math for me if i take it if i round it to ten thousand so it's like you know it's like a half a million dollars a monthly recurring in there and six million dollar error just on the subscription business it's it's i mean it's real scale businesses that can be built around fervent communities like bringing people together that have a common problem a common um you know a common set of concerns and worries and things that they're striving for it's i mean it's really really remarkable and you said you didn't you didn't raise venture around any of this no which is the other thing that just strikes me is unique here like um you know that i keep coming back to like there were these high-flying tech unicorn female communities like what was like the wing or was one of them or something like that and there were there were like a few that i think were launched um and i don't know what kind of numbers those things do or where they are today but man i would take your business over one of those any day like not having bosses and being able to continue to kind of build it in my vision in my way to the scale that you have yeah i want to say one or two things on this so first thing on um being able to grow this many paying members and one thing that i will say is really important has been really important for us is by offering higher tier programs that people can jump into because if we if we kept on the lower number that would have been a lot harder to scale um whereas offering other tiers where people can stay in your community but jump into an accelerator program at a higher amount a month that's been really really important for us to get to these numbers um where you're at is interesting outside that's interesting so it's almost a contrarian insight to me because when i think about getting people you know growing numbers i constantly think about like oh a lower price point will allow me to grow numbers and so you're saying like when i go to your website and i i look at different plans having different tiers to how it works um and different things that you can kind of upsell them into where you're offering more connectivity and more opportunities more value more products has been a thing for driving new subscribers that's been bringing in net new people new subscribers and increasing how much a subscriber is worth because especially on these lower numbers this this is why a lot of people i think in my position would have considered getting venture capital because it would be a lot easier to scale a business of you know 27 to 49 a month if i had a good chunk of money to put behind ads and i was bringing it in consistently whereas the ad landscape these days i mean i struggle to see a company like mine that's able to do those numbers and make money on like a 27 to 49 i i find that quite difficult whereas if i know um a client comes in i know they're going to stay for x amount of months our attention is pretty strong now wasn't it's pretty strong now but i also know the likelihood of them upgrading to an accelerator program which is where a big chunk of our mrr does come from um because we do payment plans on those and we extend those out that's been really helpful although we're not running ads to be able to justify how many posts are putting out on social because i do see a post as an ad because if i'm putting something out that's selling i have to think about what that does in terms of growth i can't have one foot on the gas and one foot on the brake and so that's been really important for me to think about but there were a number of reasons that i didn't go and raise capital so i've made decisions like that that have allowed that if i didn't do that maybe i would have had to raise money put another way what you're saying is the content that you're creating for the instagram account for the youtube for the podcast there's a there's a dollar cost to it right exactly that's the way i see it because i think you've got three types of content on social it's content to build your brand content to help you grow or content to sell and very rarely is one piece of content gonna do all three things for you sure every now and then you're gonna get that which is great but if i'm putting out a piece of content to sell people into my membership that's a piece of content that's not necessarily bringing in new audience members so what is the cost to that and it's just how i always try and have our social media managers thinking about putting stuff out i've always wanted to ask this question to someone that does this but um having the annual plan next to the monthly and showing best value and showing how much you can save by doing annual how much has that impacted uh the kind of ability to convert people to annual like is it are most people taking the annual offer now that are jumping into it or is it is it still pretty mixed so it depends how they come in there's typically two ways that people will come into a membership they'll land on the website on the sales page and they'll choose the monthly or the annual option in that sense about 10 of people will choose annual and 90 will choose monthly the other way that they come in is they do a free online training with me where i teach for an hour and i basically teach the entire roadmap that we have inside of the membership and at the end i'll say okay here's the roadmap go download it you can go do it yourself or join us in the membership and there i make a really compelling argument for joining us annually versus monthly and so i throw in tons of bonuses that really make the value worth it and on those trainings i can see between it varies seventeen ninety percent of people are joining annually wow wow that's pretty amazing um it leads to my next question in general which is just around how you think about funnels in your business i mean it it seems like a big part of what you're doing as you think about growth is optimizing these funnels from the different channels that you have uh how are you thinking about that like was that something you've really studied or are you kind of learning by doing it what's the um what's the process around that yeah funnels is something i've studied very in-depth in our business runs off of them they're really really important from the moment someone subscribes for them to be able to self-segment so we can send them into the appropriate funnels to when someone joins the membership how do we then segment them firstly make sure they're getting the most out of the membership they're going to be using it and then be able to identify if and when they're ready to move to a next step do we offer them accelerate a program do we offer them add-ons that's been really important for us because again on the front end we have our instagram podcast things like that when we get them into our ecosystem we want to make sure that we're able to ascend them through without you know having to send out fresh emails every single day and kind of throw something at the wall and hope it sticks for a few people we want them to go through the appropriate funnels they've been amazing for us and we don't have many funnels in the business but the ones we do have every single week they're being optimized can you talk about the importance of offering some of these free materials in order to get people into the ecosystem because it sounds like i mean that's always been my approach which is like show people value or it's the gary vee like what does he call a jab jab hook uh model um i kind of like like jab jab jab model where you're kind of just jabbing and and let people kind of come to you and say like yes i want this but i'm curious your perspective on that it's been the number one way that we've grown our list um it's been so important so the way that i tend to think about it is when i'm selling a product i think about what's a diluted mini version of this product so if someone downloads this thing i know they're the exact avatar that would be great for my product and then i think about how can i absolutely over deliver so they've got a really good feel of what's inside of it so whether it's a free module of an accelerator course so they can watch it and think great i identify with this teaching style the way in which they're teaching it i know this is going to be really good for me um or whether if if it's for our membership i get on a free training and i basically walk them through the entire map that will teach them and i'll show them what's inside of each one i'll show them how they can go do it on their own and so i always want people to if they get something free i want them to feel like it was really really worth their time because there's no way they're going to invest more if they don't believe that so we do it through free pdfs free um webinars like online live trainings um we do it with like excel downloads we do it with emails challenges we just do it in so many different ways it's just been invaluable in the early days was this just you doing this and now you've scaled the team over time to you know have people constantly thinking about optimizing funnels and doing all of these different activities i have a co-founder danielle so that was us and yeah it was just kind of us and we had a fake assistant that was basically us um as our community meaning what we just had a community manager that was named something else and the two of us would be in the box i thought you literally meant a fake assistant like i've had friends who have been like i wanted to seem more legit in the early days of my startup so i would have a fake assistant answer my emails and be like hey you know i'm scheduling yeah that's what it was she was she was our community manager she she answered our inbox because if it was us we'd end up in conversations there was this was a fake person so it was two of us in a fake person and then we've just grown the team again just really organically i this has been the best business degree i could have possibly wished for because i would notice something and realize okay there's someone that knows this a bit better than me let me go hire them and then i would learn about building out teams and who was needed and so it's really been one foot in front of the other who do we need and slowly we've now built up an executive team and we have great people working in the business but it's been very very slow and what's next for you for you all like uh from a product roadmap you know standpoint like where do you see the business going in one or five years so a big thing that we're leaning into now is the brand so boss babe is a brand me and danielle have been more and more wanting to take our faces off of the business because it's really not about us it's about the women inside of the business and i think we've built something really special where they're not coming to boston for us anymore they're coming for the brand so a big part of where we spend our time is how can we get the brand out there even more will you see us in stores will you see us you know with more mass appeal hopefully so that's one area and then in the product so we're currently building a brand new membership product and we're just in the stage of doing tons i think we've just finished our 500th member interview where we're just figuring out what can we get rid of what can we do better and i think it's going to start to be less about the content that's inside of there and more about the community so how can they hire each other how can they advertise sure the content will be there but it's not something that needs to be updated every single month once you've got a good curriculum you've got a good curriculum so we're going to be doing that and then we're going to be thinking about is there something we can offer where we can match women with really really good experienced coaches that can help hold them accountable and guide them through the curriculum if they're wanting that more accountability what keeps you up at night like what are you what are you most besides your baby of course yeah yeah actually yeah and we can talk about parenting and lessons of early parenting because that definitely keeps me up at night as well at times um good joke greg i like that it's good baby joke um no i mean what like just around the business there's a lot of amazing features of a business like this um you know and especially the way you've built it and how deliberate and thoughtful you've been so i don't want to take away from that at all like what what do you feel nervous about or what what do you what do you stress over what if instagram didn't work tomorrow what if it got deleted tomorrow what if it went away and i lost you know nearly four million people um what if my newsletter system crashed and i lost all of my emails you know with it this kind of business it's all about the people that are in it and i feel like they're living in the ether somewhere and there's always these new platforms popping up i or like that keeps me up at night worrying about how we can really safeguard that audience and make sure that we still stay relevant even if instagram becomes a non-thing how do we still stay relevant as a brand i mean is that like platform dependence yes uh how do you guard around i mean is it just that you're building because i should think about that right like i have a lot of my business ecosystem runs through twitter and that concerns me the newsletter is a great hedge against that because you own emails but not always perfect to your point so like how have you thought about that um you know and de-risking that long term well greg i'll definitely grab some of your advice but emails that's our biggest thing like that's all that's the thing that i care most about building is our email list phone numbers um web traffic we try and think about taking people off of instagram um yeah email email email email yeah that's what i was gonna say like if i were you i would just be [Music] like every piece of content would be about not every piece of content but a lot of the content would be getting the emails getting the emails and then building a media website um partly probably curated uh curated content partly like community generated content and then how do you make like a destination uh of web traffic probably the two two things that come to mind and also and i'll just share i think that's so true and that's one of i would say the more the downsides of not being venture-backed is there's always these infinite resources and it's like where do you put them and so what we've been doing this very very slowly and we're only now starting to think about okay do we make our website media destination because we've got the that's going we've got a good system around it and so we're doing that very very slowly but if we were venture backed i know we could have popped that up a lot faster but it's something that we need to think about have you ever looked at pipe.com is that a sales thing no i don't know it's like the upfront revenue it's like they'll they'll finance your revenue basically like it's basically factoring but then i have they'll give you a bunch of money for your subscription up front if you wanted it it's like that's how i used to find it financing yeah that's how i used to finance going into retail back in the day i just don't want to do it i there's something really amazing about having a business like this where the cash flow is great i have no one to answer to i can sleep really well at night um i just love that too much to even think about any kind of financing i don't know if that's a bad thing and it's probably making me grow slower so i will i agree with you in principle um around the general response although there are the so pipe is one of them cap chase is another one um there are a handful that basically offer like it's effectively no strings attached it sounds crazy it sounds like one of those too good to be true it must be a scam type things but it's effectively no strings attached non-dilutive financing where they are basically just taking um your stream of recurring revenues that you have and in pipe's case there's just a marketplace so there's investors on the other side that it's abstracted that are basically buying that and you're getting a discount rate against it so it is the same as factoring but you don't have a boss in that sense like you never have to talk to pipe it just is a constant process that's happening it's realistically to your point for your type of business probably not something you need to do unless there was some big growth thing that you needed all the cash up front like if you wanted a few million dollars up front to go buy another community this could be a way to do that without raising a bunch of venture capital but for your actual ongoing needs given how you're running the business i don't really see a reason you would take it on i agree yeah i could i could find reasons to take it on but there's just something that i love about being in full control of the business and totally get it growing it in a way that's slow and it's not as big as i think it could be but it feels good and i'm not paying for money you could you could grow the business like 25 30 year-over-year like conservatively and like fast forward that to 10 years from now and this is like like style i know you don't do public math but you know you're better at this than me like you know what sort of what is it the law of sevens doubles yeah no i mean it would be a very very big like if you if you grew it at fifteen twenty percent um you know over that period the rough math is like twenty percent you kind of double the business in like four years right three and a half four years or something like that so um yeah i mean you'd be yeah it's like the rule of 70 greg it's the is the thing you're ready for you just divide by yeah you divide by 70. so it's like three and a half years you double at a 20 growth rate yeah so i mean it's like it's it's a really big business in a short period of time by just growing you know at a modest and attractive clip and you own it and to your point you don't have to be responsive to anybody what is like just to back to my question of like thinking of starting a community if you were to start a community from scratch today either one of you since you're both like my community gurus what's like the the tool kit for someone to start a community today like what is the no code or like very light code toolkit is it like slack discord plus you know a facebook group like what what is the light um you know tool kit for someone that wants to start a community and build something like this for me i would say i think it varies based on what your is already using so the last thing that i'd want them to do is have to download a bunch of new software and learn how to use it what we're seeing in our space is a lot of people are jumping on the circle i'm not sure if you've heard of it but not web-based right yeah it is but a lot of them are using it so it seems it seems like a lower lift if you were to hop on that um and slack a lot of them use slack so i would kind of find out what they're using i'd probably stay away from facebook groups but i find out what they were using and try and integrate into that as easy as i could what about you greg so greg's gonna say discord no no no i think no no no i hate i think no no two two communities are the same so that's just the law of communities no two communities are the same therefore there is no one-size-fits-all toolkit for all communities so i want to put that out there that being said i think a group chat just like a straight up group chat is like your the easiest minimal viable product for a community so if you want to test a hypothesis around hey i think there should be a community in acts because people you know have this lifestyle or people you know need support from going from here to there then can you get 10 15 20 people from the internet in a place imessage whatsapp groups that's where i'd start got it have you um have you heard of stephen bartlett yeah i actually know stephen a little bit stephen and i like i went to a few i was i was on the board of this company and steven spoke at like their convention a few times until we like got to know each other and then um i mean i haven't talked to him in in years but he like he'll share a bunch of my stuff on on linkedin sometimes um but i've never interacted with him it's like it's a funny thing yeah he's he started a community on telegram and i mean i want to say have has over a hundred thousand people in this group chat which might not sound like the best way to do it but when he drops merch he just drops a single link in that telegram and it's sold out instantly like just a single link and it might not be the most perfect way but like greg saying there's no community is the same and if he found that people are using it he just hopped in there and it's it's just so fascinating to see if people really want to be part of your community they'll jump in and they'll make whatever work i'm curious to test it like i am going to uh i'm going to i'm going to ping you natalie now that we're now that we're connected i'm definitely going to ping you on this as i do it i'm hoping to roll something out in q4 and start at least testing and learning you know on a smaller scale with some people but um i think there's something here we'll see we'll see if i sell out these hats greg once i announce them publicly well what i i i'm pretty confident that if you added like a a community that had a mission basically like you that's what you need to start with like what is the mission of your curiosity people um like for natalie it was just like here's a bunch of entrepreneurs and creators who who want to go faster who want support who want to stay accountable like i would start by style just like opening a google doc and just being like hey what is that for for my community and then once you have that and if you feel strongly about it then i would say don't invest in you know millions of dollars of custom software to go and build it just like start testing it what you know ritual by ritual i like that i feel like this was probably the most tactical conversation around community building that we could have had so i'm super excited to uh to get to release this and and hopefully some people are inspired to go start theirs um because i feel like it was a really really cool dialogue around it um i'm glad you guys humored me on that natalie where could uh where could people drop their email to subscribe to some of your stuff yeah like where can people find you um what should people be listening to what should they be subscribing to etc we have a podcast called the buzzfeed podcast which is awesome or you can go to bosswood.com and you can kind of see how we lay out the freebies and stuff on there you'll get a good sense of the business from there and then i'm on instagram at i am natalie and at bossbabe and you can watch on natalie's instagram videos of her getting through absurdly long cold plunges i am gonna start pressuring you peer pressuring you to go in up to your neck and do the like full you know breathtaking experience of like getting the air just sucked out of your lungs from going off you know what my boobs are going through enough right now that's probably true i will back off on that one my wife will give me [ __ ] for having said that so yeah i will back off on that one you're great you're crushing it my husband said the exact same thing to me i was like well you can feed our baby for the next week and i'll do that why not it's funny because i posted that and i had so many women comment the most hilarious things and i'm like you get me you know where we're at right now yeah i um i came inside one day and uh my wife was holding roman our son and she was um she was like um you know i'm really tired or something like that and i said like oh why are you tired and i literally meant it like why are you tired like what what had happened like you know was there someone that had said something or like had some event during the day and she looked at me with this look of like why am i and i was like no no i didn't mean it that way i know i know you're doing an absurd amount i didn't mean it that way oh so yeah no it's it's a uh it's i mean it's been an amazing amazing experience being a first-time parent so i'm excited to get to connect with you in person and and chat more about that um in the near future i will definitely let you know when i make it out to your neck of the woods amazing thanks for having me guys thank you so much it's been real thanks so much for listening to today's episode if you have any questions that you want featured in a future

with him oh ages ago literally i didn't know greg had been getting into beefs on twitter for that long he wasn't he wasn't he just found himself in the crosshairs of a buddy of mine that like just enjoys doing that that's his i don't want to say that's his thing it might be a pretty good thing that's all right here's here's what happened here's what happened first of all it was a one-way beat

success stories and greg was like a success story that was kind of circulating so greg was a person whose name i heard before i ever saw his face okay okay greg continue that's that's what that's how failure of a city we're from you know that like me and harley i'm not buying that anymore man we've had way too many of the like montreal mafia on this show and all of y'all are unbelievably legit in

thread before threads were a thing and just like went deep on me and i actually don't i don't even i didn't even see the beef go down i also just i have a mutual friend who is his who's like connected to him who also knew of greg so she was like oh yeah him and greg are like beefing on twitter and i was like what's going on what's happening and yeah that was just one of the first times that i um and were you already doing epic meal time at the time harley uh no i think i did it a a year or so or two years after this maybe okay i think i think so um but then again like it's just a weird time the before before times were so crazy it was just very weird i hear you um so greg like you know 20 2010 was a weird time yeah for a number of reasons we can get into because i do want to hear the genesis story of epic meal time but greg it's funny that like the origin story of your guy's relationship is greg getting into beef on twitter because i feel like greg for one of the nicest guys i know in all honesty greg gets into more beef on twitter like gets more [ __ ] on twitter from people than any nice person that i know like there are people that are [ __ ] on twitter that i see getting [ __ ] and i'm sort of like yeah okay you know you brought that up you said a bunch of abrasive things whatever like greg will say something like propose an idea uh you know like he'll say nfts are gonna be like the future of everything whatever and it's like yeah i'm gonna draw you you kind of get you have to respect it right like you you um whether or not you agree with it the person is taking a stance on something and proposing a version of the future that looks different than what it is today and people like i mean honestly people are like yo go burn in a house like you know like how dare you propose this it's wild man i mean the internet's crazy happens to me honestly it happens to me like on instagram comments someone will say something and i'll be like i don't know about that and then like all of a sudden like it's been like four messages each back and forth publicly in comments and then like someone will call me and they'll be like yo you're actually beefing a guy i know and i'm like oh [ __ ] i know him too i didn't even realize that was him wow like friendly fire like i didn't even know that was happening it's so good man i i twitter is i would say twitter is probably like peak of it too because i i don't know what this whole bot thing is going to land on with the like elon musk and the debate over whether he buys twitter or not but i anecdotally i do feel like there's just so many like anonymous bot like accounts on twitter that just sit around you know like whether they're in their mother's basement or where they are just trolling like that's their entire persona is driven around just like just hating on people and like saying mean stuff about your family and everything so i don't know if it's like the same i'm not as big on other platforms so i don't know if it's the same but man twitter uh twitter is rough for that kind of stuff yeah and even when i said when i said like oh let me turn that off when i said 2010 is uh was a weird time like i literally was thinking of the things that professional comedians would say on twitter at the time are what people what they would tweet out or what was like like possible as funny then and everything and it was just like it was really cool what do you mean by that like are you thinking like like you know it's sort of before the rise of like woke-ism um you know for lack of a better weight yeah yeah like things like you know you'd go back and like uh you know um i remember they they semi-canceled james gunn for a minute for something he had tweeted back in like 2011 and what he tweeted is terrible but back then it was just an interesting like twitter for some reason you were allowed to say the things that were like a step beyond inappropriate it's not yeah it was twitter it's the overton window the overton window has shifted have you guys heard that phrase it's actually like a pretty important concept it's basically the idea that like um there is a window of acceptability around you know it was originally around politics like there's a window of acceptability around what political stance you can take like what you could propose in congress et cetera that might be acceptable at a given window and there are certain times in history where it expands or contracts or if it shifts left or right and so like the overton window at the time i think on social media was much wider like the realm of acceptability of things you could say was actually just much wider than like today i mean you could say something that's you know to your point 10 years ago would have been totally normal and mainstream and you can get completely obliterated for it because i do think that overton window has just narrowed um significantly oh yeah and it happens fast i mean like like i would hate to tell you what you know um my buddy's uh grandmother was referring to a certain color of jelly beans and what she called them casually amongst people in the room which was like the most racist thing i ever heard in my life and she was literally just casually asking for jelly beans in a full house and it was like the most insane thing ever and for her to be like oh yeah different i mean old people are wild still like old it's like young people and old people have no filters because they just like never learned to filter anything like young people because they just haven't learned to filter anything and old people uh you know because they just didn't grow up in a time with it perhaps or they just don't care anymore they're like i'm gonna die soon what the [ __ ] do i care excuse my language uh and so i've always found that like people's grandparents sometimes they'll say something you're like whoa oh that's like zero to a hundred percent my parents my parents will say something and i'm like oh i don't i don't you can't really say that anymore but like why not and now i'm like i'm not going to be able to explain this appropriately i'm not going to be able to get this message across i'm like just some people don't like it just know that you're a good son you're doing you're doing the right thing yeah because she posted on facebook and like tags me in it so okay so it's a weird time pre-2020 2010 or right around 2010. what led to you starting epic meal time like what was the genesis of all of that i think ultimately before um you know before i were to comment on the fact that it was a lot of people coming together at a certain point in time to create something which was epic meal time the youtube channel um i was desperate to make something happen i was a teacher before at this time i was a high school teacher i'm filming rap videos rap music videos i mean there's rap music videos on youtube with my phone number at the end uh still like my exact cell phone number because i want people to watch the video and call me to make more rap videos i would go to live shows did your students know you were doing rap videos well that's the thing a lot of times i never put myself in front of the camera because i had an education degree and i was like i'm not gonna be able to uh be a teacher if i'm doing this weird stuff on youtube um so i never put myself on camera for like my first couple of ventures into uh production on youtube um then i just happened to end up connecting with a bunch of buddies from about like three different circles of friends mine friends of mine from here friends of mine from there and we kind of all came together and um started filming these food videos on youtube but youtube was so different in 2010 it was like you put up one three minute video in the week and you're like oh we did the video for the week and people will watch that video all week on their laptop like you have to understand 2010 you're consuming youtube on the laptop maybe on a desktop like very rare does someone have it hooked up to the computer i mean to the tv and even then it's still like that and very rare like in 2010 are people watching it on their iphone there's no youtube app literally you're going to youtube.com in the browser so you just weren't consuming a lot of youtube then people in general um and like [ __ ] we just got very lucky with the timing timing's everything because i see people that are now they're like i want to be a youtuber and the rewards are much greater but at the same time everyone wants to be a youtuber now like back then there was a lot of people like you can make money off of this you can make money doing youtube videos you know the you know explaining it to my mom that like even if it's free for her to watch somehow there is a means to get paid here what was it like in those early days i mean this is like you started getting big 2010 2011 2012. i mean i get i go back and look at some of your most popular videos they're still like you know they're 10 to 11 year old videos some of those early ones like the the ben roethlisberger uh the ridiculous massive burger i remember watching that one back in the day uh i think i was in college at the time but um what was like what were the economics of this like what how were you guys monetizing was it through youtube like were you getting the youtube ad revenue or was it sponsors people were paying for these uh for these videos and for those for those people who don't know could you tell tell them what epic meal time is yeah and what the concept was yeah uh so epic meal time is a channel on youtube um my name is harley i'm the co-creator of it i i started it in 2010 and it was uh within like a year and a half it was the number one most subscribed channel on in canada and within two years for a period of time it was in the top five most subscribed in all of youtube we have like uh 1.5 billion views and 7 million subscribers on youtube uh way more on facebook somehow things are weird um and uh yeah we've been doing this and although no longer a novelty and not in its heyday i mean some people will you know say you know epic meal time we always say your dad's favorite youtube channel because maybe in 2013 2014 he was watching it i think uh it was also um yeah it was just a [ __ ] channel but we did one video every tuesday and it was like silly it was like silly silly goofy young guys um goofing around so okay so go just route back to the economics of it because i'm curious like in the early days of youtube how people were making money off this stuff you guys got huge um yeah i mean you had a novel concept right like no one was doing food this type of stuff like not like this no one was doing it like this um and what was really funny was um the ways our 25 year old brains myself and my partner at the time the way our brains simultaneously tried to create something but also try to navigate the minefield of being friends and conducting business together was really interesting i look back on on the days and what we did was it was myself and at the time my best friend and we went into it and we're like you know 50 50 we're gonna make a channel and then we start filming with other guys and this is where we're like okay like i bought this laptop with my teaching money and we split the camera you're the cameraman i'm gonna edit we'll produce the videos together let's call up you know uh this buddy and that buddy you know um these are these are like you know guys that greg knows you know muscles classes alex perot uh tyler lemko a guy that i worked with at summer camp super super funny person one of the funniest guys i've worked with until this date even um josh elkin who is an excellent chef my good friend amir who is also an excellent chef um dave huff who is just you know some guys were just there down to ride didn't know how they fit in but that was it and i i like amassed this little team of guys that we all lived like within three minutes from each other but at the end of the day i remember like which i always find looking back now is as fascinating as i'm older and if i were younger i would have never spoke about this stuff but like our little 24 year old 25 year old conniving brains we were like we have to keep the receipts no one splits the meal with us the first meal i remember we did it with alex and he was like oh let me throw in for that and we were like no no we don't want your money it is only our money that is going into word and we were trying to like do something together because he and i had we filmed the rap videos together for years so we had this little production studio in our brains aka our camera in his basement and um we didn't want to complicate it we understood each other we understood each other's uh motivations all those guys who i mentioned which are great guys we didn't know what they wanted where they stood we didn't want anyone to have a stake in this and i look back on that now and it's so funny because he and i had a falling out at the end of the day i ended up going to court and we ended up settling this as co-creators of the brand and he's a guy i talk to now um he's uh um just an old friend of mine and his name's sterling we had a a falling out back then we went to court for like two years and it was so funny because it was just i wanted to be a silly guy on camera and then you find yourself in a position where you're like the boss of your friends and you know there are different people putting in different amount of work sweat but then there's other people that are getting attention online so now i'm the one that's like hey this guy is doing a lot of filming he knows how to edit now and i'm like but they [ __ ] love this guy so it was really um when i look back i'm just like damn how however i pulled that [ __ ] together for as long as i did doing bacon jokes for the 10 years and and and juggling egos most of all my own ego was really the the tricky part and people are like you know they want to they want to go into business with their friends they'll ask advice me and my friend i'm like for sure do it it's great it's great you better figure out your relationship before success though because the problem with sterling and i was before we figured out what our business relationship was success came in and you know it's easy to think that i was like oh i'm the star i have ultimate power it's easy to think that that's how i would be thinking in my brain and it totally like comes off that way but it's not entirely wrong i was like oh i'm the only one whose face this is if you know someone's going to be making decisions they're going to be making decisions on where i go what i do early days in the in the show it was just like you know it was a guy on camera talking about food um and we were stressed about money he worked at a restaurant i was so you weren't making money on like in the very early days you weren't making a bunch of money off this yeah you couldn't you couldn't make money on youtube until you've done a certain amount of things like have three videos up uh certain amount of views certain amount of now they're more strict about it but they still had it so it was only on the fourth video where we were like okay this one's gonna make money and we went really big we put we sewed five birds into a pig and i like was stressing i was like this is eight hundred 800 this is 800 we could literally buy like another dope ass lens so let's invite people to my house strangers even and we'll charge them twenty dollars and they could be in the video and that's a turban epic episode it's literally like some friends some strangers but people paid 20 bucks we were scared um that video in that week made it ended up making like 750 us dollars like in the first week and we were like oh thank you and that was through the youtube like ad revenue or whatever like it was paying you out yeah was it i'm curious if it's change i assume it has where like back then it was probably a lot fewer views and clicks to get 750 than it is today for a creator to make 750 on youtube well it depends it depends they're they're more hesitant on what they put their ads on and like what the cost of ads are like we're in the premium program of youtube so the ads on our channel because we're grandfathered into it are just great ads um and people sometimes request the brand specifically even to this day um but back then it was um it was like like i i cuz every every situation was unique you two handled it one way but other people that i knew would sign to these mcns that existed these multi-channel networks and they would guarantee people like four dollars cpm no matter what and us it could be sometimes 60 cents cpm to like six dollars cpm it depended on the time depended on everything like you know the timing the the year or you know what was going on um we ended up i think we were one of the first youtube channels that made our own t-shirts a lot of people did them elsewhere um you know they would hire a company we owned the inventory and so me and the guys who were literally on the show would would go into a warehouse and we're packing up these bacon shirts and we're like hiding beard hairs in there or like writing little letters and sending them out um and um that was wild i mean you know this we made this shirt said bacon strips and bacon strips and we sold 60 000 of that t-shirt like of that design you guys were just being enterprises i mean i feel like you guys the story of the success and the trajectory that it took was like you weren't you didn't have like mbas and business degrees you were just pursuing opportunities that came up that you were seeing and identifying as you were going and like being enterprising and having a bias for action around all these things which is what to me makes it such a cool story it wasn't like you know some grand strategy or design it was like hustling your asses off on a daily basis figuring out holy [ __ ] there's an opportunity here here and here let's go do that and how do we make it work yeah it was very much like now is the time okay we have a million views you make shirts now that is what a youtuber does they make shirts and what's so funny is like now like i watch my buddy's kid talk about youtube you know he's like 10 and he's like oh i'm gonna be a youtuber he's like i'm gonna make a channel and then after two months i'm gonna have my merch drop or we're gonna have t-shirts and then after that i'm gonna do my face reveal and after that i'm gonna congratulate and he's got this whole road plan for a channel that doesn't exist and i'm looking at it and i'm like i thought i was such a [ __ ] businessman at 25 and here is a 10 year old just doing the same thing because it really was like a format there was a template to follow and if you were fortunate we were fortunate you got to like make that happen you got to sell t-shirts you know um [ __ ] buying 60 000 of a shirt i didn't do it all at once but there is a point when you're like oh you're gonna have to buy you know 25 000 t-shirts to make this whole thing worth it and you're like [ __ ] i know people like it but do they 25 000 t-shirt like it my mom ran the merchandise and i was like and she was like yeah we could do it and i'm like are like are we gonna ship out all these shirts like what's that gonna be like um and it was it was a lot and it actually was it was like that's like one of the things where it was tricky because i i wanted to value everyone's opinion and there were guys who were quote unquote day players but really they were there since the first day and they have input they have ideas you know why don't we sell like towels and why don't we sell apron my my mom knows a guy who could sell these things we could also do that and i didn't want it to come off like uh like you know like little like loot bag things that you would get like at a bar mitzvah or quinceanera i wanted it to be like you buy the t-shirt we have t-shirts do you put your credit card in like you're gonna get the 30 item there is no four dollars you were also doing all of this because you were doing it all before like all of the innovations that now exist that make it easier for creators to do this like it's it's so funny now just hearing you talk about that some of those struggles and what you were dealing with a lot of entrepreneurs have like heard those struggles and gone and built infrastructure to make it not as much of a struggle like you talk about having to buy 25 000 t-shirts like the inventory problem holy [ __ ] that's scary having to buy that up front and then hope i sell them well now you can do drop shipping like we're gonna go beers like buy print to fill yeah like these shirts these shirts were like in my house and we tried our best yeah you're like packaging them up yourselves sending them out now there's just drop shippers or there's pick pack and chip whatever like it's so cool to hear uh that early story because it does map to like all of the innovation that's now happened to make it easier for creators um as they scale to go and monetize in all these different ways um well early youtube also the culture was people like are you trying to sell me something right now bro why don't you shut up and provide the free content if you ever tried to sell someone something they're like sell out wow skye wants to make money like get a real job if you want to make money now it's like you know you see people like jake paul logan paul that like plug the merch in every single thing they're happy to launch they can do a video that they're launching an energy drink and people are hyped about it they're happy that they're successful they're happy they show off their like versace onesie and everyone's applauding when we were like yo this stuff costs money so here is you know our t-shirts if you want them and they're like wow wow sellouts so the the culture of youtube at the time was people really didn't support a youtuber with a branded deal or anything you know i remember we did uh netflix when netflix was very very new and um and i'll never forget the pricing structure of this because i'm like this was insane to me but um for we had to tell people go to netflix.com bacon and if you went there and you signed up for the one free month with your credit card it'll automatically okay netflix gave us sixty dollars us per person per person so like the pricing structure is just so insane because like netflix was new but the the service was so easy to convince someone like because it was a good service i hadn't had netflix until that deal came through in 2011 and they offered it and i was like oh can i get a free login and they were like a free login we're giving you 60 bucks per person that signs in i think you'll be able to afford a month or two after this and and that was the truth and like and they were like so how do you want to do what a lot of youtubers like to be like hey guys don't want to bug you um but there's this awesome service and i was like oh no we'll just by using the character i played a character on the show i'll just be like oh sign up you get free movies i get money for bacon and it was just such a 2011 2010 humor mentality um and we did it and i remember the comments people were like well i really respect them for just being like up front that they're making money on this like i know youtubers that when i went to visit them they drove escalades they were successful they literally had two escalades this youtuber and he would go and dirty a dish on purpose and go to his second like his back kitchen sink and pretend to wash a dish there and talk to the camera to be like i'm just like you guys when he wasn't and we were the ones that and we did it through characters because we still thought it was douchey to do it as ourselves we did it as characters we like we were up front about like yeah we're making money we have so much money we're so successful at the same time i was driving like a nissan center and living in my parents basement but i was like we have millions of dollars we didn't but we kind of leaned into that mentality on youtube and that's what the youtube culture is now and if it's if it's not it was for a long time and it's on the tail end of it but i really feel like people were like whoa we kind of treated it like rappers believe it or not like half the people on epic meal time wanted to be rappers when they were growing up that was the the form of entertainment that they wanted to be a part of so i think they brought that showmanship there was like a show there was a survey that scared a bunch of people this might have been like a year ago maybe you guys saw it that was like it basically asked a bunch of kids in the u.s and then in china what they wanted to be when they grew up and something in the u.s like it was like 40 said a youtuber um and in china really seventy five percent by the way and in china it was like 75 of kids under the china it was like you know engineer like i don't know maybe it was manipulated data in china because i don't trust much that comes out of there but it was basically like oh [ __ ] we're dead [Laughter] it's like the chinese communist party filling up the surveys over and over again they want to be astronauts they all want to be asking astronauts military doctors technologists all that um i do want to i want to talk about um and greg you and i were chatting about this earlier this week um sort of like some of the darker side of um of these algorithms and of you know fame and and audiences and and all that happens with it um you know there was this great uh blog piece that i think tim ferriss had it in his five bullet fridays so it went pretty viral last week because of that it was called the perils of audience captures by this guy gurwinder who's a uh an indian guy who writes these really thoughtful pieces and basically the whole thing was built around um this guy nicholas perry nicotto um for for people who who don't know him who was you know original he's a ukrainian kid was doing like violin and talking about veganism he was an excellent excellent violin player excellent and still is and absolutely gotten any real traction doing that but was posting like very authentic real videos of himself doing that and then basically started um going towards these videos of him eating like absurd amounts of food and as people saw those videos and liked them there were comments like do more do bigger you know eat this eat that whatever and so he kept doing it because it was getting a ton of traction and a lot of views and he was making money off of it presumably um and it ended up really spiraling you know for his mental health and physical health for a lot of reasons and i just i wanna i wanna say it because i don't know if you would say it i don't know you that well but to those listening he was an extremely lean vegan boy and now he is the fattest jiggliest marshmallow of a person and you might be like hey that's not really nice but no this is a guy that has leaned into his fatness sells merch on it if you google him he is really like a gigantic marshmallow um and like that's kind of the brand that he's been yeah and it went from i mean it's like it's very sad to actually look at it before and after um because he went from like this you know kind of cute wholesale kid to what he looks like today which it's fine like everyone has their own life but yeah yeah but he was poor and now he's rich yeah he was poor and scary now he's rich so the whole article kind of lays this out of how we in a world of audience and in a world of these algorithms we are progressively falling victim to what our audience wants and effectively we are slaves of our audiences or of these algorithms if that's what you believe in and i thought it ended with a really good line and said this is the ultimate trap door in the hall of fame to become a prisoner of one's own persona um i thought that was just it punched me in the face because i was thinking about it for myself like how do you how do you think about this harley your own you know career in life doing crazy eating videos and crazy cooking videos did it impact you um and how do you think about that for creators today today's episode is brought to you by a company and product

won't regret it i think um i mean that's like i'm so lucky personally that this happened to 25 and when it did if this had happened when i was 18 things would have been disastrous epic meal time early on was frat mentality was like get drunk eat food party get drunk eat food party get drunk party like lots of part that was the mentality and when we started i was 25 and i was kind of over that already so by 27 when that's what the audience were thriving off of like they liked how much of a disaster we were sometimes um i was kind of comfortable enough to just be like no and i've done this from the very beginning and it's such a it's it's like it's it's such a thing that's always been discussed internally over the last like six years since like you know my channel started to decline since it wasn't popping like it once was like what are we gonna do and there were lots of things that we could have done and i didn't do and whether it's the persona that you are that the audience wants or whether it's the maida the meta of the the the you know um youtube at that time like will we you know will i will i get drunk and like lean into being a disaster will we start to do pranks cause pranks are cool now and oh we didn't do pranks well that's good pranks are super uncool now uh will i go have a baby with someone start a family vlog those are popping right now wait now family vlogs are looking kind of weird and filming your kids like things go back and forth and i think maybe because it was the early success of it all or whatever a perfect storm of my age and my experiences i never to the detriment of my success in some respects i never leaned into the meta of the youtube game whether that be the persona or whether that be uh you know what i'm doing so like mukbangs like the things that nicotto did where he'll sit there and pig out a part of me was like yes i kind of want to do that people would watch that we know it gets views i'm like but i've done a lot of this eating stuff for a decade i don't want to start this next decade on the foot of like i'm going to pig out constantly i would meet some successful youtubers and they were in the midst of like writing a battle rap against their own brother in a music video like a drama music video where him and his brother are fighting each other in music videos saying kind of [ __ ] up mean [ __ ] and i'm like i'm so happy i'm not beefing my brother i'm so happy that's not my path to success and i don't look down on people's hustle i get it like who knows some people they're trying to get something popping but i look at some things i'm like oh i could never do that and i'm not like i only do the best things i just look and i'm like oh yeah the pranks were taken off i didn't want none of that um you know like if eating yourself to get like so fat i was like you know i've had a little taste of success i don't know if i want to go and chase success so badly um there are personality types on youtube that you see in every line of business for sure there is this type of person who is so ambitious and insatiable and they are chasing something that is fleeting viewership i know people look at me some of these people that i know i and i can see it in their face i know they look at me or like my channel and they're like oh that would be a nightmare if i went from like getting 30 million views or like a 2 million views in a week to like getting under 100 000 views oh my god and i see that when i engage with people or i would engage with some of these people and they would be like oh my i'm i'm growing in subscribers and i'm like i can't remember the last time i like sat there and you know refreshed looking at the subscriber count um maybe it's just being older i'm 37 years old maybe it's like having this experience maybe it's i felt like i did something i don't have anything to prove i'm not sure what it is but the most successful people that i've seen on youtube they chase that fleeting number of likes engagement viewership the video got a million it's got to get two million oh you're only getting 800 000 [ __ ] my channel's dead got to do something crazy got to do something crazy to get back in the news get back in people's thoughts and i think maybe the most cloud-chasing thing that i've done is i did a a charity boxing match a couple months ago a youtuber boxing match which i always thought like i i love youtube drama so i was like is that where we are in this weird form of gladiators where nerdy youtubers are gonna hit each other for more clout the nerdiers the dirtiest youtubers by the way i watched it i watched it like like graham 7 like cnn god oh my god love that oh yeah he is he is and he went against michael reeves also great just two great guys it was and that's why i did it because i would never do the boxing thing but this was for charity and i really liked the creators that were in it they weren't like doing they weren't trying to prove anything everyone was like hey this'll be a great journey and we're doing it for a good cause let's go and do it and we all did it we had a great time um but it was different and then i got offered to box on the ksi card which is uh on the um 27th of this month and i was offered 150 000 to box one match in that card and i was like nah they were like 150 000 some most boxers will never see anything close to that amount ever a lot of championship boxing matches aren't that amount um and i'm not scoffing at the money in my current state that is an incredible amount of money and an excellent opportunity and i think it's a ton of money and i absolutely think it's so worth it and great but i'm not a fighter i did it for a personal journey chasing the check and being a like come on being a boxer 37 what if i get punched stupid you know what if i come out of that dumb dumber or so what if i break a nose that's like just forever weird who knows it's just it's not like my passion um plus i didn't know who i was boxing um but i looked at that and i've been fascinated by the youtube boxing thing and even the fact that they're like hey you're a washed up youtuber do you want to box someone for 150 000 and that's one side of one boat on a card with like eight matches and i would probably be bottom of the card so as you go up people are getting paid 300k 600k i'm sure whoever's fighting in the main event might be getting a million i think uh when when youtube disrupts industries that is like my favorite that's my favorite thing when i see that uh you know i know some people are like oh it's boxing like you know they're ruining it the coach that i had here in montreal he was like i've not had as many sign ups for boxing with young kids since jake paul started boxing and talking about it um and i just love i loved i've always loved you know you know same thing with like twitch whatever like disrupting the gaming industry when video games come out and something that wasn't that popular happens to be popular on twitch now that entire company is like completely talk about what you're doing on twitch i think that'll be interesting to people because you know you seem to be always ahead of the curve so yeah what do you work what are you working on on twitch yeah well see like twitch i remember in 2015 i saw an article that said after netflix the number one most streamed website was twitch and i knew justin.tv so i was like twitch i'm like well that's careless of me i'm on youtube and i don't know what twitch is and i went over to twitch and i watch people and i was like so crazy people watched someone play a game and i noticed a money culture that wasn't present on youtube people gave money on youtube like that was that thought was insane like don't even ask for money bro don't even sell me something free video free video shut up i'm skipping this ad right away and then you go on twitch and someone's like gets a headshot and they get like a 20 donation and they're like thanks for that donation and like that said i'm like that's what that person paid for it was so insane to me didn't understand it but i kept putting it on because i wanted to understand it and then i found a streamer that i liked this guy i'm a cutie pie and i would start watching him he would stream at 7am i'd go i might wake up at 7am back then for work and like he would be live and he'd be there and i'd be great and like if he was late i'd be like that's weird and like i just had like my first parasocial relationship on the other side where like i was a viewer and i'm like this guy and his cats i love his music taste he doesn't know who i am at all and then i was like i'm gonna start streaming on twitch and i started in 2015 and you know what it ended up being really really good because um and i only would get like you know at the time what was very difficult for me and this was probably what really helped my ego or uh or or like destroyed my ego in the sense that i'm like i'm not i'm not my viewer numbers you know was i would stream and people didn't know i was on twitch in like 2016 and i would have like 300 viewers and people would come in and be like oh my god epic meal time fell off they used to get millions of views now he has 300 viewers but like now i know firsthand 300 viewers that will watch you when you go live every time that 300 viewers is literally worth more than 300 000 views on youtube 100 000 because these 300 people are like they're all ambassadors they're sitting here for hours dude they didn't watch your video they're here with you and they want you to be here tomorrow um and i thought twitch was so fascinating like that and i was like oh i'm gonna do twitch for a long time and then i got hit up by facebook and this proved to be extremely fruitful for me and this is i'm not ahead of the curve now but i was then because i was in a position where facebook hit me up and they're like we want you to be part of our gaming program and they offered me a contract that per month dwarfed the biggest best month i ever had on twitch because it's like facebook money and so they gave me this deal to stream exclusively on facebook for three years um and i did that i streamed on facebook for three years and i had a guarantee i just had to stream you know 80 hours a month um and i was doing that on twitch already and that facebook deal was great i did that for a couple years and that just ended uh recently last year and i went back to twitch because just facebook you don't pop on facebook people go on twitch and pop you know aiden ross or you know uh even a lot of andrew tate clips are popping off like on twitch him going onto people's podcasts um and i just uh was fortunate to be part of that facebook thing and i think i may have stunted my twitch growth having been gone for three years but it was a risk i took and one i'm happy with because you know like i said there was a guarantee there um and i got to just chill and now i go on twitch and you know i got weird sleep schedule it's midnight not really sleeping i'm gonna play games and i'm like i know you know through my my instagram and through my snapchat i'm like i know my demographics top audiences are los angeles and england i'm like okay so it's 9 p.m in l.a and england's gonna be waking up soon i've just justified me being a degenerate playing [ __ ] mario all night long now and you know sometimes i'm there and sometimes there's 25 people there there have been times when there's been 5 000 people but either or there's just and i i'm like so grateful that it happened at this time in my life at this age that these are the things that don't they don't hurt me you know what i mean um people will see me and they'll be like oh my god epic meal time i used to love your show and my mom will be with me and she's like but why don't you watch now why don't you watch him now he needs the views and i'm like oh heather chill i like that your mom's around it's okay you know like that's big you need everyone needs money oh 100 100 yeah last night at 3am i was like streaming on twitch and uh you know and i'm like oh yeah this that i was like i went by my mom's house and then like a chat pops up harley's epic mom and she's like that's right and you need to check the mailbox we're waiting for an important letter and i'm like here's my mom i've got a funny at 3am i've got a funny mom story like so i have a lot of um i've got a lot of my friends moms who like follow me on these different platforms or read my newsletter like my friends literally won't read my newsletter or do it but for some reason their moms love my [ __ ] and i had i used to like before i you know started doing the twitter thing and got big on twitter i had this like kind of janky newsletter that i would send out once a month just saying like what i read during that month and basically like a review of that book and so like you know i'd read four books a month and i'd put a review and a star rating out of five and um i have this good friend from stanford whose mom um was an avid reader of this thing she loved reading books and so she would like read my things and then take them as suggestions and i wrote a review on um this book where the crawdads sing which was like a happy fiction like novel you know like happy ending like the whole thing you know right i liked it i'm kind of a simple guy when it comes to fiction so i wrote i gave it five stars i wrote this thing i get a response from this guy's mom who like i think i had met one time in my life that was literally the most scathing response angry and she was like yeah she was like she was like you know i normally trust your reviews reading this um but i did not expect this from you sahil um you know the uh she said something to the effect of like like it was rated five stars on reese witherspoon's reading list and she was like i expected this from reese witherspoon but not from style blue and i i kept it and i was like man i said it to my friend i was like dude i don't think i'll ever recover from this man this is the end i love i love how she burnt you and recently this morning at the same time raised further yeah and you know what like actually reese witherspoon was great i'd i'd be happy legally blonde man you gotta gotta respect that's so funny he uh yeah i was yeah i'd be like wow i guess it was bad enough for them to make them exactly uh i want to see if it's produced by reese witherspoon maybe she produced it she produces all types of things now yeah uh that's that's so funny i think that's uh hilarious and you know what it took me a long time to realize it but like that's like some of your top fans that is the behavior of this 33 i hate this by the way about these freaking review sites rotten tomatoes i'm on tomatoes where are the crawdads saying 33 on the tomato meter like the critics review audience score 96 so like that's all i care about man i don't care give a [ __ ] about the critics like you know it's like totally the audience is the man in the arena man the critics are like going from the sidelines you know what though but sometimes like sometimes rotten tomatoes like thirty percent or a hundred percent and i see that i'm like yeah i'll see about that there are a few i'll see about that i'll be back i'll see i'll leave like a thirty percent i'll be like yeah sometimes i'm not about it no no no i i'm like i go back and i'm like yeah now let me see what you guys you always wonder about now that i thought i wanted to redo some of those things like because i always used to wonder that with yelp like who the customer who leaves a review on yelp i think is like it's not your average customer and so there's like a selection bias towards the negative in my opinion like my um i i have a family member you think so yeah it's very the problem with and someone should solve this whoever you know there's a bunch of entrepreneurs listening right now it's yeah anyway i should solve this that's oh signing myself basically you have the problem with it is you have a bunch of people who are so you know you go to a italian restaurant nico's italian restaurant it's amazing you love it you get to know nico five stars five stars he like was really nice to my mom you write a whole long review or there was like a bunch of hairs in your pasta dish you know and you would leave a one-star review so you end up having is this weird bifurcation so inherently yelp style reviews are pretty are pretty yeah i wonder who can fix that i live in the new york area now and say hill where do you live okay because i'll tell you like i've been operating this way montreal like where i live the reviews of places here like there's a chance that i'm like reading the review on facebook and it's like a friend or a person that i know so like i know them and i've seen reviews here they're pretty pretty accurate pretty good when i go to the states and i open up ubereats or i'm looking and i'm googling restaurants like in montreal if it's below a four star i would never go there never if i'm in the u.s a three star i'm like that might as well be a four and a half here like a three star's very high in the u.s like people only go on yelp and stuff for the most part when they're pissed it's literally when they're pissed off because the reviews are so much more passionate in the u.s like i read them here and they're like we go there every time tom's our favorite waiter hey tom if you're reading this and then i go to like like i'm in like orlando and i'm reading like if it's like one star this [ __ ] manager that works at this place and like it's like so much more aggressive and so like when i see a three star i i'll bump mine's like a personal issue like i think i have a mental issue around this where like i grew up in a household uh where i felt like excellence was the standard like that my parents demanded of me um for better or worse right like that has a great side to it and that i always felt like you know i was pushed in a good way but i also think there's a downside to it at times where you like you know you feel like you can't do enough at times or you feel like there's a standard that's set that's really challenging to meet but the result of that for me in like random things like this is that i don't feel the need to like praise someone for doing their job you know like uh like at a restaurant if i have a good meal at a restaurant i'm not going on yelp to say yo i had a good meal cause i'm like that's your job like i was supposed to have a good meal at this expensive nice restaurant that i just went to on a friday night with my wife if you did a bad job then yeah maybe i'm gonna like figure out how to fix that for you in the future by leaving it something but a good job unless it's like unbelievably excellent way out performing you know like anywhere in the eight to nine range i'm like yeah that's kind of what i expect if i'm gonna go pay 200 in manhattan for a dinner with my wife yeah no it's uh like that's the thing i love playing video games and people like oh yeah they're so mad about this game they're on twitter everyone's on twitter talking about i'm like no not everyone the people that like game are literally playing it so the people that don't like it don't have a competing force on twitter to be like no it's great because they're literally playing it and sometimes games come out and they're like taking these twitter takes and i'm like that's a person honestly like that might be a person like that loves nintendo and this is a playstation game so they're like that game sucks and people are like you hear this someone's saying something about something and i never get caught up on on any of that now also i'm like i'm a star wars fan so like i've been through one of like the most craziest fan bases of like in the last like six years the star wars fan bases just really went through it with each other it used to be like people like star wars fans and then there was like star wars fans that also liked the prequels and it was like two types of star wars fans people that like star wars and people that like star wars and also like episode one two and three now it's like divided and divided and divided and it's just like toxic i watch [ __ ] now and i'm just like i hope this show gets an ending you know sometimes things get canceled before they end and like that's why i won't even like i didn't even start watching breaking bad until it was like a success in the fourth season i'm like i'm not gonna watch a show and get caught up and then they're gonna take it away or so you have to like that that's the type of that's the type of guy who like gets heartbroken and like doesn't want to date anymore because he's like nah they're they're all they're all poison yeah yeah yeah exactly i'm like i like this show the show get cats the writing was bad anyways you've got this video on youtube researching for this episode that i want to ask you about because it's awesome that is like basically you it's it's got a bunch of your old bar mitzvah video clips in it uh yeah it's a great great job funniest clip this is i mean you know the only reason why i could say this is a the funniest clip is because even though i was a producer on the show the uh actual like show runner producer this guy greg heller great guy he put that together like he calls my mom asked for the bar mitzvah so when i was screening the episode actually watching a cut of it i was like where the [ __ ] did you get my bar mitzvah stuff he was like i asked your mom so like that was all him that's why i'm allowed it was so good i mean it's a great clip and i encourage people to watch it it's like you know you're kind of talking to your future self in the bar mitzvah clips out of it and you're like you know you're going to be dope you're going to be awesome you know whatever and then you're like reflecting on it in the future talking to your prior self so it brings me to the question of like which i think is a fun place to end and maybe we can all reflect on it like what what advice would you have to give to your like 2010 self you know you're starting out your substitute teacher at the time you're trying to figure out what's next um you know you're rapping on the side doing you're doing your thing trying to figure out youtube what um what reflections or advice would you have for that for that version of you there's so you know there was so many things that didn't play out the way i wanted it to but at this exact moment sitting here right now like talking about everything talking about where i am right now i wouldn't change in any way so i i as crazy as it is i wouldn't even go in and be like yo do everything you're doing except buy way more bitcoin that's all and maybe sell some of it in like 2021. uh like that's like maybe i would say that but beyond that like i i really wouldn't change the approach there were some things that you know definitely were sad definitely were heartbreaking definitely were stressful or hard to get through but no matter which path i end up taking that's bound to happen for everyone in life but i'm very grateful for today right here so i wouldn't change that and i think you know if maybe now this year is someone else's 2010 you might be starting a journey you might be doing it like just do it just do it and wing it there's so many perfectionists out there and i'm the opposite to a detriment um but like some people want to wait i don't know writing their book i always say writing the book that book you want to write like you actually just got to write it back then i was scared to go in front of cameras because you know i wanted to i had the teaching as my backup plan but it's very easy for your plan b to automatically become your plan a through your actions and i'm i'm happy that i i made that commitment to plan a um so yeah i mean just do it maybe you get lucky i like that no there was a lot of fall starts before you get lucky what about uh you know we talked earlier about how young people all want to be youtubers and how you were lucky that you became successful in your mid mid to late 20s should teenagers sign up to youtube and become youtubers or should youtube put like a a requirement you need to be this high to sign up no i think they should i i see like teenagers like they have their phone and i'm like how could you not how could you not you absolutely should like i always always think about that kid remember that kid someone took a picture of him at target and then he was saying today 700 000 followers on twitter the next day alex from target no no alex from target he was just like cause like that that yodeling kid at least like oh yeah i do remember that this was just like a cutest boy at the checkout line someone took a picture and like it was over his life was different do you know how many people like went and filmed the tick tock and then that tick tock has 60 million views and then now they have like 800 000 followers that are like what's next from you and i'm just like yeah you should however anyone who leaves school or quits school to become a youtuber you don't have it buddy i'll tell you right now if you cannot be in school and do your youtube you're definitely not built for it because you're not going to compete with the type of people that that do this [ __ ] like i know successful youtubers that are so hungry about it like they're still out there no name producing other shows or working like a real job or whatever it is and like if you're like if you think you need to leave school to become a youtuber like you you don't have the chops because when you are a youtuber and everything goes great and you're super successful well that's when things come up obligations or travel or meetings or you're going to court or whatever it is and like if you can't do both like you're not you're not going to cut it so if you happen to be a teenager listening to this or like a a an up-and-coming entrepreneur or whatever it is like specifically for youtube i can't talk about everything if you can't do school at the same time like you don't have to stay in school so make sure you get uh i think we can hit on that if you're not ending it on stay in school i don't know dude this was awesome so much fun i hope you go get some sleep because i mean holy hell i have a newborn at home and i'm sleeping way more than you i won't i won't no i won't because it's going to mess up my schedule like i need to like just drink more of that g fuel g fuel 69. uh thank you so much for coming on where it happens man this was a blast thank you thanks so much for listening to today's episode if you have any questions that you want featured in a future episode email us at hi trwih.com

and then there's the whole meaning meaningfulness what was it the three schools of Viennese psychology um and then search for pleasure man search for happiness man search for meaning and I think that there's that sort of like I think about my mom where I'm like I just want to be like my mom I want to I want to be as invested in my grandchildren as she is in my son I want to work out six out of seven days a week without fail I want to get seven hours of sleep like I want to have this um defining your terms social wealth mental wealth physical wealth and like if you've got three of the five there it kind of it does beg the question of like what is the goal of financial wealth and and I like your friend's Journey right which is that it is the output of having done something meaningful [Music] what is up you guys so excited to share this amazing conversation with Andy Dunn the founder of bonobos and more recently the author of burn rate launching a startup and losing my mind it was

really benefit a lot of people both on the building journey and afterwards as you try to improve your own life so without further Ado please enjoy my conversation with Andy Dunn well Andy thank you so much for joining the show today man this has been a long time coming I feel like I have been a big fan of yours from afar for for a long time and uh you know we're just now getting to connect thanks to our mutual friend Jim kunahiro pick shout out to him who who actually brought us together to to have this chat so super excited to have you and excited to dive into uh all of the cool stuff that you're working on and inspired by right now so thanks for joining thanks for having me excited to be here so you know I generally like to start these conversations with um you know this idea that I think of or call um the map of reality and you know this is like this general idea that we all have our own set of paths circumstances experiences Etc that kind of frame our map of the world and and how we view things and Pursuits that we've gone after things were inspired by Etc so I'd love to start there and just like set the stage a little bit before we get into all of your work and career and some of your your recent writing and Inspirations by just understanding a little bit about your background and path like what established your map of reality you know where did you kind of come from grow up were you entrepreneurial as a kid would love to just set the stage with that totally yeah I think for me the the origin story for me has to tie back to coming from a heterogeneous environment culturally you know my mom is a Punjabi Indian immigrant my dad's uh Scandinavian Midwestern American white dude you know we have this in common no I know I think this is part of why Jim connected us yeah I you know I but I don't think I put that together until just now I mean my mom is from Bangalore you know uh immigrant from from Bangalore India and my dad is a white Jewish guy from the Bronx so we are we're both part of the the half Indian Clan here yeah there we go and to make matters even more fun I'm now married to a Brazilian Jewish immigrant and converted the Judaism right before I got married so wow so you're a you're a Hindu then you're like me I you got that or I'm half Punjabi depending on how you want to talk about it that's that's a good one I've never heard that one before you know I am convinced that the uh you know like mixing of Gene pools and um you know like the G the uh the like genetic strengthening that comes with that is something that I'm convinced by I don't know if there's any research around that but everyone that I meet that comes from like mixed race backgrounds I just find have these like like super good looking or like really smart interesting like I just think that there is some strengthening that happens from the mixing of uh from the mixing of Gene pools so you've clearly done a lot of that which is fantastic yeah I mean maybe there's something to that I think there's also something for me that I've learned about just communication Styles and family traditions around communication I like to joke my dad's family they don't speak about small issues small issues become big issues and eventually you don't speak at all my dad doesn't speak to either of his siblings really my mom's family who are the big Indian family you say exactly what you think in real time to everyone except the person that you're thinking about so it's like a perfect exchange of information through gossip with Minima you know minimal conflict this is yet another thing by the way that we have in common I feel like we have this Eerie set of similarities in our lives now um you know my dad I haven't shared this really publicly in the past but my my dad uh was disowned by his family when he wanted to marry my mom um so my dad has four siblings I've only met one of them um you know I have first cousins that I've never met uh never met my dad's parents um I think his mom actually lives near me um somewhere in the in the general New York area I've never ever met her um in a similar vein right like small issues become big issues when you don't address them um and uh you know and then there's too much water under the bridge at some point in life where it becomes really challenging to remedy those big issues so um yet another thing that I feel like we have a Common Thread in that uh in that vein yeah 100 and I want to hear more about that someday or at some point or we can flip chairs or something yeah but it did set the stage for me for a lot of transformation when I met my wife because in her family you say exactly what you think in real time to the face of the person you're thinking about so like the first time I had dinner with my now wife and mother-in-law my Scandinavian side was in the bathroom dry evening being like I don't think I can be a part of this family because they got in a quote-unquote fight which I've turned out you know turns out it's just a spirited disagreement um but I came out of this heterogeneous context culturally you know religiously it was fascinating because my dad was a Christian but was lapsed really became agnostic when the Swedish Lutheran Church that he belonged to um basically everyone left when black people started moving into the Austin area of Chicago so he was like well this isn't very christ-like you know we have some kind of racial diversity emerging and let's get the hell out of here right which mirrors a lot of the challenges we have in in modern day uh religion which we could talk about and then my mom's family were you know not openly religious but pretty my Mom feels pretty connected spiritually so I came out of this environment where it was amazing because I had so many questions I had so much stimulation you know from from different places and everyone I was around was homogeneous right like I was I was the only quote-unquote person of color in my school you know until until one you know young black man showed up from Cabrini Green on like an exchange program which is at the time where were projects on the near north side of Chicago so had this really amazing mixture of identities you know to navigate was it amazing growing up or was it a challenge like did you did you feel um you know as a kid it's like fitting in is the most important thing in your own mind you're like I want to just fit into a group and it's you know you want like I remember struggling to just figure out was I a jock or was I a nerd was I you know brown or was I white like what what was I and how did I Define myself like was that a challenge for you or did you feel like it allowed you to kind of toe the line and be in many groups it was both it was both an asset and a liability as is the case with so many things in life I wasn't really that aware of it um until I got to an age where there there was this sense of otherness that I began to process around being half Indian or you know being singled out as different um my my real wake-up call on it was almost getting my ass kicked at a bar in Ohio for being like a quote-unquote sand fill in the blank that was in college and that was the first time where I like I actually experienced the threat of physical harm for being Brown and it just blew my mind I had never really I'd never really thought about it as someone that could fall into Harm's Way which by the way is like 101 for skin color in some and so many other Stripes right um was that post 911 or what was the like it's just it's surprising I know no it's pre-911 huh um fascinatingly so you know growing up it was um I think it was both it was a sense of otherness in in to be honest I just avoided the Indian side of the equation like I distanced myself from what made me different and so I had this contrast where my cousin celebrated Hindu holidays they spoke Hindi maybe they spoke Punjabi they were really immersed in the culture because both of their parents spoke that language in the home and my mom was a rebel right my Mom married a white guy in the late 60s and my dad was a rebel because he married an Indian immigrant and so I was raised by people who didn't subscribe to the importance of cultural norms or homogeneity and yet I was in an environment where everyone was from one or the other world and so it took a long time to kind of re-embrace what made me different and I probably didn't want to go there even in college because I went to college in an environment at Northwestern I was in a fraternity where it was mostly white guys right and and it was there actually were Jewish guys you know what's called Jewish and not Jewish because I don't want to describe the rest of folks as Christian but yeah I was in a fraternity called Sigma Chi and there were so many Jewish guys in the house that we used to joke at Sigma I had that at Stanford too yeah so um you know that that's a bid on my origin story I think I guess I think I would think I would add is I have an older sister who I'm really tight with and that was a big part of my upbringing was having this like protective Overlord female presence and same thing with my mom's family where she has four you might know the name like four mossies which is a endearing term for your mother sister and so I was just raised by a strong female environment and so you know at some point it occurred to me I was building an apparel brand named after a matriarchal great ape and I was like okay and by the way what makes bonobos the animals different is they have no violent conflict and we think part of that is because the women are in charge I definitely want to come back to that point there are two sort of through lines that you mentioned in in talking about your background that I want to I'm going to keep hammering on so I want to like call them out here one is the idea that something is both an asset and a liability um because I do want to come back to that I think it's a Common Thread um for a lot of things that we'll talk about and the other one is this idea of like early on distancing yourself from your differences like fearing being different and really wanting to um really wanting to kind of embrace um being the same as everyone else but then learning as you kind of go on your own hero's journey quote unquote to embrace what makes you different as the unique attributes that create your Edge and that make you you know the special person that you are and I want to talk about both of those because I think a lot of the listeners here will um you know really hear a lot about your journey and what you're working on today and where you've come from um and it'll resonate with a lot of people um you know it certainly has with me so um maybe we can transition as you know with those two in mind to talking a little bit about your path to entrepreneurship you got done at at Northwestern I believe in 2000 um and you didn't start bonobos right away you kind of had a journey from there to Stanford Business School um what was like were you an entrepreneurial did you have an entrepreneurial bent right away or did you kind of go down a traditional path first you know you have the the Indian uh Indian parent so I know they would have wanted you to do medical school or become a PhD or something so what was the path yeah I guess we're continuing your through line because my mom's side of the family the Indian side it was all doctors yeah which was you know one of the two ways to get a visa to the US my mom actually worked in ultrasound because she didn't get a chance to go to med school for reasons of her father uh being ill and she had to send money home and be a more innocent source of income because it's a little bit delayed as a doctor she never got to go back to India for her father's passing which is very tragic and then my dad is a U.S history teacher but his family there's lots of Physicians as well so my only Role Models growing up were doctors and then I won somehow the high school yearbook was like the most likely to be a millionaire I don't know how that happened I remember being like this is weird because I wasn't I wasn't particularly coin operated I wasn't one of those people with like a side hustle you know whatever mowing lawns or something like that and so it it took a long time to let go of that family sense of success which in my mind was tied to going to med school and so I actually went down the whole path in college I took all the coursework I was signed up for the MCAT and I was studying for the MCAT and I had this moment where I was like I just don't care like I had all these part-time jobs at a hospital I'd worked in the dark room and that was a thing developing x-rays the front desk of the emergency room got my EMT degree or whatever you call it and I just didn't want it as bad as my classmates wanted I saw how much harder they were working particularly three friends of mine who are now all surgeons and when you're when you're bumping up against people who care about something more than you do that's just a good sign that you you haven't really found your swim Lane yet you should be swimming in a swim Lane where you feel like you can go the fastest and you want to go the fastest if you don't want to be there then back to your word Edge you know you might have the edge and I might have had the edge like intellectually to get there but I didn't spiritually or will or drive wise and so that then invited this crisis of well if not this one thing I've been thinking about for 20 years then what and so I did what a lot of people do who don't know what they're doing which is I became a consultant you know I became an analyst at a consulting firm which I feel like is a way to delay you know it's kind of like a way to delay a decision yeah and that's where you met Jim I assume at Bain uh yeah yeah Jim by the way Jim is you know one of the most incredible mentors in my life I think he was he was a mentor to you he's also one of the most fun people I've ever been around like his ability to go out his he has the most infectious and hilarious sounding laugh uh in the world but um it's just someone that is like a true joy to be around at any point in time and so um I'm glad that glad that he brought us together in this context um totally funny story about Jim's laugh by the way we were at a bar night one night at the Sears Towers like outdoor bar that they had back when it was called that and Jim was laughing so much I think mostly because I'm that funny and um they we got caught he got cut off before he had a drink because he was laughing that way yeah like they thought he was like so hammered because his laugh was so big that they were like it's hard to describe other than that it sort of sounds like a dolphin call uh if you actually break it down I'll leave people with that but uh it uh it is a pretty unique and interesting laugh uh but an amazing person you know what one thing you mentioned um that I do want to hit on there was like um you know this this idea of like how you decided not to be a doctor because you realized you just didn't you weren't really in it you didn't really care I've always had this General framework um that I've been sort of like wrestling with recently of um sort of the idea that there is like a societal um like Max net benefit uh to finding the right thing for you to do and you know I'm kind of uh word gaming this a little bit in real time but basically the idea is like you could have been a doctor and I'm sure you would have made a great doctor you know you could have done you like put your head down grinded it out studied become a you know perfectly serviceable doctor and you probably could have impacted a decent number of lives right you would have saved some people you would have helped people they would have felt good um you know you could have changed a few lives that way but if that is not what you are like best equipped to do like not you're not you were probably weren't gonna be because you didn't care enough about it the top point zero one percent of doctors in the world but there was something out there that you were equipped like you had the tool kit to become the point zero one percent in the world at and impact way more people and at scale in a very different way you didn't know what that was yet but you kind of had an inkling that it wasn't being a doctor because you weren't pulled in the direction becoming like that true Obsession and nerd there were people that are and that's amazing for them to go and become doctors because they will impact tons of people and they will be so invested in it but you should always my framework for young people has always been that you should find that thing that you are going to have the unique ability to be point zero one percent at like if you're ambitious don't settle for being a consultant because you can be like a decent consultant and make a good living find that thing where you're like Circles of success or Circles of passion come together to make you uniquely qualified to go and truly win that game on a grand scale that resonates and I think what you're saying is even more nuanced which is you may not know what that is but if you know what it isn't you may have to walk away from what you know it isn't even though that feels like a safe and comfortable path to create the space to figure out what that what it is but that might be years later so for me it was effectively eight years from when I walked away from the idea of becoming a doctor to the beginning of the entrepreneurial Journey and there's a lot of confusion in that eight years because you've walked away from something but you don't know what you're walking towards and I think that's one of the hardest it's like breaking up in a relationship that's not working part of what makes it hard isn't the deepening awareness that you might not be with the right person it's the fear of the unknown on the other side and potentially having to start over I mean I had that hard experience I I mean Jim who we talked about I was working with him at an amazing firm that I had been at for you know the first six seven years of my career and I knew that I wasn't ever going to be the best at what I was doing there because I wasn't so invested in it the way that others were and there was this thing that I had started doing creatively on the side that I started to realize like oh maybe there's something there and it was the incline but I didn't know what it was yet it wasn't a thing and um you know over the course of a year or so and honestly with the mentorship of some great people that transition happened for me but the fear of that like oh my God I'm giving up something that is very secure very certain um you know there's a great trajectory to it there's a path in order to go after this thing that like I don't even know what to call it I don't know what it is um is terrifying in the moment when you do it I mean there's no other way to to describe it like the scarcity that we all feel of oh my God I'm gonna be broke which is so you know sort of misguided for 99 of people you're not going to actually end up broke you have skills you'll figure something out you'll be okay but that fear is so Primal uh when you're actually making that change totally I think it can be paralyzing and I think I wonder what is it about someone where they kind of cultivate the conditions or the courage to do that you know versus not because I do think the Paradox is that it all makes sense in retrospect and some of the happiest and most fulfilled people I know are ones who've taken those kinds of risks and succession and so I worry about I worry for the idea that you're taking Financial Risk when the risk is in fact spiritual which matters so much more you know yeah spiritual I mean happiness fulfillment like I just I would say I've generally and I'm sure you're in a similar boat like I've generally shifted what it means to me to be wealthy uh dramatically over the last year and a half like I just Define wealth so much more comprehensively than just being about money and financial gain and that's made all the difference in my life in terms of my happiness on a daily basis um which is a huge what have you added into that time I imagine having time yes I mean I would say I now you know and I've written about this and I might want to write a book about this at some point um and I'm going to need to pick your brain on the book process at some point offline um you know I would say today I Define wealth in kind of five buckets I think there's Financial wealth I think there's physical wealth you know Health Fitness Vitality mental wealth which I would kind of bucket um you know like General mental health mental Fitness like knowledge accumulation you know ability to learn and retain information I would bucket like spirituality and faith into that mindfulness um uh and uh and then time wealth um you know uh just the uh the general you know freedom freedom of time and then I guess the last one sorry of five would be um social wealth relationships people family um status uh in that bucket and so that's kind of how I would think about it more comprehensively I would say and my general mental model for this has been um you know the blind pursuit of financial wealth often robs you of of the other four forms of wealth and you don't want that to happen you know that's a that's a race to the bottom it's such a great point I know someone who recently has become extremely wealthy through a series of events and I I must admit some Envy you know that I felt less towards like just the sheer amount of money but more what I feel like I could do with it if I had that kind of money and then someone I know ran into him and was like oh man he looks rough and I really hadn't thought about it because I I met him recently for a meal and I was like it definitely has come at the expense of his physical health there's just no yeah I made a doubt about it I had dinner um recently with a close friend um who I won't name but um who sold his company last year for a billion dollars um and uh you know made probably 300 400 million dollars in the transaction owned a big chunk of the company um you know and basically went from like working on a salary on this thing that he was his baby for many many years to all of a sudden being extraordinarily like mind-blowingly wealthy get anything you want the rest of your life you're pretty young guy still too um he's single and I asked him I was having dinner I was like so are you much happier he's like well I'm definitely happier because it was a real grind um but I wouldn't say I'm happy like in a in an absolute sense I was like well why not he's like well you know I went on the like big you know trip after the sale and uh you got this boat and you know he had all my friends come out and everyone was so excited to come and celebrate that we did this and you know we're in there and we're getting on the boat and there's these two much bigger boats right next to mine and all the people are going and getting on those and the whole time I was just wondering like who the hell is that you know who got that boat like how is that boat so much bigger than mine and my friends are all looking at it being like damn that boat's sick my boat's not good enough and it just made me think like wow there's always going to be a bigger boat like to use the metaphor no matter what like if if Financial wealth is your scoreboard there's always going to be a bigger boat and yeah the reality is like we glorify it like you go to a party and there's 100 people in the room um generally speaking Financial wealth is the easiest way to like stack rank people that are there and so when there's someone that's extraordinary really wealthy there there's some billionaire in the room everyone is attracted they want to learn about what made that person so great and made so much well now if you flip it and you say like thought experiment let's imagine that everyone walks around with a happiness meter on top of their head and it tells you how happy the person is if you walked into that same room and you saw the billionaire and it was like a one on a scale of one to ten and you saw a you know an accountant who has a 10 I probably would go over to the accountant and be like what is your secret you because happiness at the end of the day is sort of what I want like I want fulfillment I want happiness money people think is a means to that end but it's a flawed one for sure yeah and then there's the whole meaning meaningfulness what was it the three schools of Viennese psychology um and then search for pleasure man search for happiness man search for meaning yeah and I think that there's that's sort of like I think about my mom where I'm like I just want to be like my mom I want to I want to be as invested in my grandchildren as she is in my son I want to work out six out of seven days a week without fail I want to get seven hours of sleep like I want to have this um defining your terms social wealth mental wealth physical wealth and like if you've got three of the five there it kind of it does beg the question of like what is the goal of financial wealth and and I like your friend's Journey right which is that it is the output of having done something meaningful but once it arrives it can be a very unhelpful yeah you know barometer in it yeah I mean realizing that is a huge step um and we'll talk about that in the context of your own Journey but before we get to um burn rate which I do want to talk about your new book super excited about and loved um can we just talk for a few minutes about the bonobo story um we referenced it in the context of uh of the of the gorilla um what was like the foundational Insight behind bonobos I mean what what was it you know you were at Stanford Business School I believe you met your co-founder there um what was like the Insight that that sparked it I think there were two colliding insights one all credit to my co-founder Brian spaley was men's pants don't fit that well you know we were coming off of the 90s and the 2000s where there was a revolution in the fit of men's denim stretch became a thing five pocket fit improved there were lots of different Silhouettes so people just started wearing denim and I think people in a certain demographic that could afford it started paying over a hundred dollars for jeans I remember the first time my dad was like I was trying to buy a pair of seven the original Seven For All Mankind genes and he was like a hundred dollar you know it was just mind-blowing yeah and so I feel like the fit of denim and the investment that men made in great denim paved the way for someone to do something comparable in pants and my co-founder was a savant and figured out this whole curved waistband thing that enables you to to fit your thighs and your butt in a pair of pants that also fits in the waist and he was brilliant about fabrication and the right kind of soft pinwheel corduroy that was to where we started the company in Northern California it worked for like the 85 degree middle of the day and it worked for like the 60 55 degree you know evening so that was sort of insight one was There's an opportunity to do a better fitting men's pant non-denim non-five Pockets so chinos and corduroys and then the other Insight was that Brands were going to be built on the internet and back in 07 this was very much not clear yet this was it was wasn't obvious and there was Zappos which we heard about was selling a lot of shoes but they were selling other brands the way they were doing it was category of soft goods was assumed it'd never go online like remember this is before Amazon had a fashion business and I can remember when Amazon went into fashion and the New York Fashion industry that I was a part of were like mocking it like oh they're never going to be able to do that so we were pre the big e-commerce platforms going into apparel and here you had you know this guy Tony Shea selling shoes by offering great return policy great customer service and having this highly energetic customer service team on the front lines and so my thought experiment was well if you can sell existing soft goods Brands online meaning you know fashion Footwear home why can't you build one and the more we pitch the idea the more we heard like who's done this and the answer was you know we didn't have an answer and that that of course became you know the beginning of the digital direct to Consumer brand movement which was very exciting to watch unfold because I think you know we got to we got to be a first mover on that whole movement you raised a lot of money um which I don't think I had appreciated um in just being kind of an outside Observer of the story I was a consumer of the of the product you know from my I'm trying to think what year you must have you must have started it but I you know when I was at Stanford I was there from 2009 to 13 and I think I started to First hear where about maybe in like 2012 or so and then during my early career years it was like you know the go-to um you know pants and product um but I didn't realize you would raise a lot of money along the journey would you have done that in hindsight you know do you think that was necessary um did it you know hurt or help in any material ways that you'd kind of flag for entrepreneurs that are just starting out today no I would I wouldn't have done it if I could go back I think there's so many problems with raising money I think the first is psychological which is that entrepreneurs can associate Capital raises with success and I prefer another construct now which is think of capital raising as a sign of failure like the more money you need the more open questions there are about the future you know business potential and and I think we could get nerdy about it but there's only very there's a very small number of businesses out there that are emerging that require over 100 million of capital and usually those are companies with asymmetric upside where the fundamental product is technology or software and I think that leads the second problem that Capital can create and try to solve for us was like there was no good technology stack for building our brand and so we added one of those like classic I had one of those classic delusional moments that you have as an entrepreneur where you're like well let's go build that like let's go build that other thing that actually has nothing to do with what we're currently doing and so we put a lot of energy and time and capital against trying to write better e-commerce software and it turns out that it's hard to write software inside of a pants company and it turns out there was a guy doing that in Canada named Toby and he's now got a company called Shopify I heard of it and that's that's what they do right and so there's this fine line between fantasy and reality as an entrepreneur and that line gets pushed out further when you have access to Capital yeah and then thirdly I would say you know most retail Brands aren't meant to raise a lot of outside Capital like retail is meant to be done profitably and I think the direct consumer world that's been built is a lot of profit losing companies and I think the the irony is that what could make a lot of those Brands great is really opening up their brick and mortar distribution not through company on brick and mortar which can work bonobos with 60 stores we made it work but actually through wholesale which is the relationship commercially that most DDC entrepreneurs frown on and if like for my sister's brand and the baby apparel space we're now live at Target we're live at bye bye baby we have a new partnership coming that actually is where you re you can raise money from from wholesale operating profit and and I think we've been through a decade-long delusion that I feel like I helped spearhead which is that a standalone direct consumer business is a good business it's not look at what's happening in the public markets and soon to be coming in the private markets and that you have to go It Alone pure play When the truth is that 80 plus of retail is still spent in brick and mortar stores and if you pick the right allies that can be a massive win and that was part of my logic of of actually selling the company to one of the probably the best brick and mortar company ever which is Walmart there's a lot of interesting stuff um in the bonobo story you know as we walk through it there that kind of traces the d2c journey and like what has happened in the d2c space like the early days of bonobos I mean there was a time when you could literally um you know any keyword in the world on social on Google you could put it in and like there wasn't anyone competing against you and you could acquire customers so cheaply and there was great Returns on acquiring customers in the early days on social and on those platforms now you know if you try to go acquire customers uh through Instagram so like you Toby actually tweeted something you mentioned Toby tweeted something hilarious recently that was like I think you could smash your face into the keyboard and have a hundred people competing against you at whatever jumble of words you know comes out jumble of letters comes out it's just gotten competitive everyone started flocking to that just like in any market and so it was interesting to me because bonobos was also early you know in addition to being early and thinking about d2c you were the first ones that I ever saw innovate around what a store looks like and you had I think you called them guide shops um your look shops but I remember going into my first one and being like wait what do you mean this is like I can't actually buy the clothing here it was like to experience it to see it and then they were sent to me direct um and now I think you've seen a lot of companies following on to that Pete you know there was the whole movement around owned retail where like you know um rent became the new the new CAC and there was like that whole meme around you know consumer Brands opening up all of their DDC stores and Soho like you know the streets were aligned with every single direct consumer mattress brand that decided they needed to open a showroom there or whatever it was um where do you think we are today so do you think um you know the d2c brand or the consumer brands of the future are going to be built in this um you know kind of wholesale or at least uh Channel agnostic manner like what do you think the future looks like for the consumer landscape yeah I think that the direct consumer part of the company what you said is perfect which is that the it used to be disruptive to bring in customers digitally and now it's just another form of middle person so when we when we launched an enterprising early employee of ours discovered that Facebook's ad platform was about to launch and we were one of the first 50 brands on Facebook's ad platform and so there was a period of time for a few years where that was interesting as large corporations which were suspicious of Facebook weren't on it and then as you had larger flows of capital in and people started to realize wait a second maybe this is going to be a way to spend ad dollars because back then it was like not clear that there was a great digital ad spent outside of Google and what was so interesting about Google was it's hard to advertise the je ne sais quoi of a pair of pants on Google it is a more utilitarian thing not that many people wake up in the morning and Google pants that make my butt look good right but if you're on a Facebook platform and you see a pair of pants that looks attractive and there's the right copy you have a more ineffable reaction which we used to think applied to let's say magazine advertising and fashion or whatever and now it turns out like actually you can do that in any medium that has imagery you which is why partly why Facebook became enormous with ads certainly Instagram as they brought that in and so you're right there was a period of time where it was there was Arbitrage and that that quickly changed and yet the Venture Capital Money pouring in to fund digital cpms basically turned Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Page and Sergey Brin into the landlords of the digital age yeah collecting rent on everybody collecting rent and by the way with far more Market power than your average real estate landlord right at least the real estate landlord world is competitive here we have yeah duopoly I would argue and I guess Amazon's getting into that game now so that's a scary player to have moving into that so you're right and I think as we learned that that wasn't going to be the thing and as I woke up to the fact that I had been imagining that a pants company and a menswear company was actually a technology company once I came to grips with the fact that I had been wrong and I feel like that's one of the strengths of an entrepreneur is being able to say like I was dead wrong about that that thing I was shouting from the rooftops about two years ago was wrong that thing I raised my last round on turns out not to be true that that freed us up to go after not only our own brick and mortar but also in critically this relationship with Nordstrom and what was cool about that was we got to 100 stores within like 18 months yeah and super cost effectively and totally and you don't you don't own the inventory once they've bought it you've got National reach and so that's kind of my aha is like you don't need your direct consumer business to be the majority of your business you just need it to be the thing that tells the story that enables you to have a direct relationship with the customer and then wholesale actually is an amazing way to monetize that if you pick the right partners and I think the narrative even five years ago was well all those people are going bankrupt right like brick and mortar's dying software eats the world and the truth is Walmart Target Sephora Costco you know over General Dick's Sporting Goods Dollar General 25 billion dollar market cap company there is a react fundamental reality that the Lion's Share of retail dollars in in the United States are transacted in brick and mortar and you have a small cohort of DDC entrepreneurs who think for some reason that they shouldn't engage with that eight percent and and I'm seeing that start to evolve um in entrepreneurs who figured that out earlier by the way many of them are raising no money or very little money and I feel like that's the new playbook in GDC is get the brand to scale and GDC open up wholesale relationships thoughtfully strategically perhaps some brick and mortar and raised less than 20 million dollars certainly at the high end I was talking to a entrepreneur friend recently who started a um a consumer a food food business or like spices and foods and he was actually telling me that they make more money they make more margin dollars on an Amazon sale than on a website sale through their d2c website and I just thought that was so interesting because a few years ago the narrative was a complete opposite it was like man you gotta buy through d2c that's where I make all my money and I'm making nothing on Amazon Amazon's killing me and they're actually making more money and having better um you know actual delivery and customer service on the Amazon sales 100 I was just writing a note to two Founders where I we were talking about the delusion that we have around looking at gross margins rather than margins after marketing and so I have this nerdy metric now I call cpam contributed profit after marketing which is like what actually are you making in terms of before your fixed costs and most people are vaporizing all of their contributed profit on marketing so if you're spending 30 or 40 or 50 percent of your total revenue on marketing you're you're basically building a fundamentally worse business than anything you could do in brick and mortar yeah the last realization I have from what you said is um you know there's this tendency I think you were at Stanford Business School um you know you'd gone through Silicon Valley the tech Hub of the world like techno optimism everything um you were in this environment and I think now the world is sort of in this environment because we've had this 10-year Raging Bull Market of like this is what I'm supposed to do I'm a tech founder and you know I went to Stamford business school I'm going to start a tech company and what you do with the tech companies you go and raise money you go in Sand Hill Road and you go raise money from the VCS and then I'm gonna go become a unicorn and that Mantra and that story and narrative has permeated so deeply into the like entrepreneurial Roots globally that I think it only will happen in a bear market like what we're experiencing right now that we'll be able to break that and that Founders will think from first principles about does it make sense for me to raise money what is my use of this Capital does it make sense to take on the dilution should I prove product Market fit before I raise money because now I know what works and what I can actually deploy it into to grow um but I think that'll be a great thing and I actually think some amazing companies are going to be founded and built and the founders are actually going to own a bigger chunk of the companies when they you know reach maturity because of that shift totally and the other question can I can I even raise the money right because the market will help force that answer onto people yeah because it's it's quite hard and we started bonobos right and right before the Great Recession and so 0809 2010 we had to raise our first 8 million from 100 plus investors and so we had that forced Capital constraint and it wasn't until we had Venture Capital that I could pursue some of these other you know ideas and anyway we could we could I digress a little bit but I do think there's to your point enormous opportunity that gets created by the focus of um a bear market in terms of what it means for fundraising and by the way the valuations get more realistic too and I think that's a good thing for entrepreneurs in the long run although they don't they don't view it as such in real time I know I didn't sure so I want to shift gears a little bit um to your book and to really the message um and some of what you're sharing and the vulnerability that you've you've been sharing more recently You released a book um it's called for people who haven't seen it it's called burn rate launching a startup and losing my mind you can find it anywhere today I'll post the link when we share this and in the show notes you'll be able to find it it's fantastic I read it and I I found it to be um you know both deeply emotional um causing me to reflect a lot on the journey but also really inspirational um and I want to sort of dig in a little bit to that story if you don't mind um to be able to tease and kind of share for for other folks some of what you shared you know by by writing it um there's so much about the journey and your personal Journey your spiritual mental emotional Journey that you covered in the book um you Embrace a level of vulnerability in the book that I think is basically unprecedented I would say from an uh from an entrepreneurship standpoint I've never really read a book where I felt like someone shared that much rawness um of their journey and of the ups and downs of that Journey every now and then you hear it maybe from creatives from you know writers comedians Etc but I have never seen that you know from an entrepreneur um and I think it was a beautiful thing that you shared that so what what inspired you to write this book what was it I was tired of being ashamed you know I spent 20 years living in secrecy with this illness and you know we talk back earlier about belonging and difference and I think one of the ultimate forms of difference that one wants that I wanted to keep hidden as a severe mental illness who would want to present that information to others if they didn't know it and that's the way our that's the way our culture determines what's shameful implicitly is what's unspeakable and so if you can't talk about something what I internalized from my inability to talk about bipolar disorder was there must be something to be profoundly ashamed of that there was something fundamentally broken in who I was that I was a disorderly person because if you have a disorder and then this horrible thing that we do with mental illness which is that we say someone is bipolar rather than has it imagine being told you have cancer versus you are cancer it's like unimaginable to tell someone that they're cancer um and yet that's what we do with bipolar we we basically say your identity and this illness are now one and the same you actually are that illness and so that was a that hit me like a sledgehammer when I was diagnosed when I was 20. the the force of the slab Sledgehammer was met by the same level of energy that I put into denying that it existed so I spent a decade where it was really a suppressed memory didn't deal with it didn't take medication didn't see a doctor episodes during that period or was it largely not an issue it was it was latent um and that actually was really unhelpful in our diagnosing the diagnosing psychiatrist had said you know if Andy doesn't have another episode for five years it could be that this was a one-off event and I had I would say I had about 10 years asymptomatic and then if and that was after the first episode which was a manic episode which for people who weren't aware of it think about delusions of grandeur mess ionic seal incoherent speech Rapid Cycling of moods laughing crying ranting raving across while you were in college I was in college and so the sheer Ingenuity of my family got me to the hospital came back down to earth over a week you know a week of medication and then got out and everyone basically pretended like it never had happened well it was unfortunate timing but I had done mushrooms a few weeks earlier and so that was kind of the thing that everyone hung on their hats on and amongst my friends at Northwestern we know it was like Fight Club you never talk about Fight Club right like we all knew it had happened including me but we didn't talk about it and the fact that it wasn't spoken about was to me a source of Shame and then it wasn't until a decade later when I fell into like fearsome depression as I was navigating co-founder divorce and the trials and tribulations of building a company that I started to experience the other side which is just catastonic depression didn't could barely get to work didn't want to live and and you would think at that point that the that it would start to compute but it wasn't until you know 2016 where I had a really the second meaningful manic episode hospitalization ended up you know at Bellevue in New York City for a week and and walked out finally ready to deal with this and and walked out straight into handcuffs and was arrested for a felony and misdemeanor assault and that that began you know the process of of really confronting this and um a credit to my wife and a credit to my doctor and credit to a family that rallied around it I got through it and so to your question on writing the book I felt like the normal thing to do having dodged the bullet of almost anyone knowing about this would be to say nothing but the the thing that I would be condoning if I did that was the fact that this has to be unspeakable and so I felt it would be a disservice to the community to not share given that I was lucky enough to get through some of this stuff and I felt selfishly like I just wanted to expunge the shame and so the way to do that is to say I'm going to actually put the whole story on the record because there's this wasn't my fault and if it wasn't my fault then this is just a story about something that I've been through um and it's been beautiful it's been beautiful how accepted I feel I feel like a fully known person for the first time so there's so much you said there and I appreciate you sharing so openly you know there's so much you said that I want to dig into a bit one of the things that I just have this general feeling or realization around is that the way we treat mental illness in this country really globally um you know is basically like if we don't have to talk about it let's just not talk about it we're just gonna like hey oh yeah maybe that happened but let's just like push that aside I don't you know it's like very difficult for us to confront and so our response to that is like hey let's just not confront it it's fine you know Andy you were fine too you know it happened in 2000 or whatever year it was one-off episode and I'm sure your family embraced that you know Indian family I imagine um you know is challenging for and um that is such a negative thing um you know broadly speaking that we do that and and I hope that through sharing you know your story other people who have you know come forward and shared their experiences the people that your book inspires to come out and share their experiences I hope that we can start to kind of shift The Narrative on that uh more broadly a hundred percent yeah and it was this Indian side and the Scandinavian side too my dad's side it was fascinating that my my dad's mother actually had profound mental health issues and was institutionalized twice by her husband who had become a psychiatrist we we now think or my dad thinks partly because of his mom's issues and so here we had this like intergenerational family issue that you would think had opened up the con that would open up the convo but um it served to do the opposite it served to prepare us for the silence and I think this is what we have to invert in all these situations families at companies societally we've got to invert it so that we can have a conversation about things that are hard enough without the silence and the shame and I think we've seen that happen generally entertainment leads the way right like with with the gay rights movement you know we start with our entertainers right or even with with uh you know movement within the black community there's sort of like entertainment is first then Sports and I feel like business goes last um and and so I felt like if we could pierce the veil of the conversation in the business world in Corporate America where it's assumed that a steady hand is what's required shepherding Capital hiring Talent if we could pierce it there that could start you know a snowball a more meaningful snowball do you think I don't know if you've ever heard this um concept well I think it was Jerry Seinfeld was on an episode with Tim Ferriss and talked about the idea that um you come with like a kit in life you're kind of born with a kit um and for Jerry he was talking about it in the context of creatives comedians who have um generally in a in a population experience extreme depression um alongside this incredible creativity and intelligence that allows them to be exceptional at what they do and he calls it part of the kit he's like look I just have this kit and I experience these you know periods of downness and um and then these ex incredible periods of Flow State and Brilliance um that I that I work through you talk about a little bit in the book you know this idea of like hypomania um which are kind of the the upstates of bipolar disorder as I understand it where you have this amazing creativity and flow and energy um do you think that like to go back to the idea of asset and liability ability was was this an asset and a liability for you like did it also uniquely enable you to go and do these things that you accomplished and and you know create this amazing business and do some of those things I think we have to be careful I remember there was a moment in the process of the book where there were some folks that wanted to call it Here's To The Crazy Ones after the Steve Jobs commercial from from I think it was the 80s um or early 90s and I remember thinking I don't like that title partly because let's not celebrate or lionize craziness we do a disservice to the imminently sane people who are doing very creative and Brilliant things um so I wouldn't want to conclude that it's this like necessary requisite ingredient in the creative process but I would say there's clearly a correlation of it over indexing and that's in the data so three percent of the general population has some form of mood disorder most commonly bipore disorder we think that index is seven to one in entrepreneurs so we'd be talking about one in five and and that definitely resonates with me so for me was it a was it an asset and a liability absolutely this hypomanic state that is before you're really going off the rails with Mania but that is a highly energetic state where you have elevated speech more Vision more ideas more excitable everything happens for a reason tremendous energy often for me anyway like a lot of extroverted energy you know five internal meetings in a day with the group three one-on-ones two interviews a press interview dinner maybe dinner was with a candidate then afterwards out and New York City was perfect for that and by the way it was it was totally fun it was dizzyingly fun and then these massive crashes that would come it wasn't alternating day by day it would be like three months of hypomania and then like three months of depression and I'd say look depression terrible for building a company you have to act when you're around other people you don't have positivity or ideas it's hard to get to work so I think there's something too aspiring for a more stable place and still allowing as my doctor calls it for like peak days and so I think that becomes the challenge and you know I'd love to talk to Jerry Seinfeld about that because here's someone who he's talking about you know the downsides no doubt that said I mean what a decade-long series or 12 years so there was like a prodigious amount of of positive mood State there as well and like for my part I'd rather trade some of those hypomanic days to trade away the depression um so it's a way of saying yes to your question with an asterisk of like let's be careful not to celebrate it or assume that it's a prerequisite sure so we're coming up to the to the end of our time and there are a few things I wanted to ask you to kind of to wrap this um wrap this all up and you know one of them is like we're not investing enough in this as a society we're not investing enough in mental health in supporting people who are experiencing these things in making people feel comfortable sharing in the way that that you did to your point it was like it was shame you know you wanted to hide it you didn't want to be different it was easy to um to just not talk about it and you know and keep it from the Limelight rather than embracing that difference to go back to that what should we what should companies be doing um to invest in this in resources to um you know to help kind of change the tune around this massive problem that so many people are experiencing under the covers yeah I think well here's the good news five years ago there was like 100 million in Venture Capital that went into mental health Tech last year I heard that was five and a half billion wow so the money's coming in and that could speak also to the Venture Capital glut that we've been talking a little bit about but there's been a lot more investment coming upstream and so I think what companies need to do now is is three things first create an environment where disclosure is encouraged I think that starts with leaders When leaders go first disclosing their mental illnesses their mental health issues and by the way you don't need a diagnosis to have struggled with your mental health you know as you know you don't get to a certain age in life without having had some things that you've really that have really almost um taken you down second is community so having a neurodiversity community group ERG whatever you want to call it where we can trade those stories internally and find a way to to identify our common experience and if you look at the span of it bipolar disorder is just a tiny part anxiety OCD grief addiction um the autism spectrum high functioning Asperger's unipolar depression which affects one in five people it's hard not to get a check mark on one of those as a person and if you assume one degree removed in families a hundred percent of families have got these stories so we got to build community around it and just make it normal to talk about it and then thirdly and the hard part is investment investing in treatment investing in care so that means actually having a relationship with Modern Health Lira one of these mental health providers that becomes a resource to your teams and then second reimbursement so the reimbursement rate says we all know on Mental Health Services are bismal you know they're they're not so great on typical physical medical issues and yet we have like dental and vision in part because that's not covered so let's take care of your teeth and your eyes but as for your brain best wishes and and yet that's like the stuff of how we conjure reality that's how we understand the world and so the pitch that I'm making to companies is treat this as one of your best investments because it's going to improve the productivity of your teams and that that means we need to do things like what my friend Ariel safira is doing it real which is she acknowledges that she's a mental health tech company the reimbursement rates are too low and so she provides a two thousand dollar a year per employee stipend for reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses related to mental health wow and if a company with you know 50 employees can do that then we need to we need to call to action our Fortune 500 companies to make the same investment because we know that psychiatrists and therapists are not going to voluntarily reduce their rates we know they're not going to voluntarily join and affiliate with insurance companies that takes down their after tax and we know that insurance companies aren't going to pay more money than they currently do for reimbursement so the only part of the ecosystem that the money can come from are corporations investing more in the productivity of their teams yeah productivity and retention I I mean I imagine for your friend that drives a lot of affinity with the employee base that the company is investing in them and in their brains in that way so it's it's brilliant it out last um last two questions so one you know a lot of entrepreneurs are going to listen to this aspiring Builders investors Etc many of whom I imagine will or have struggled with mental illness in some way shape or form what advice would you would you give to someone who is going through this currently um and who is struggling I think um I think there's a two-step process the first step is to acknowledge it with yourself like to be in the conversation with yourself about it and I think that's such a remarkable thing to do like to even say the word I am depressed when you've never said it it's a big Journey because we attach a lot of significance to not being the kind of person that has that issue and so I think Step One is try to cultivate the courage to be honest with yourself about how you're feeling or how you're doing or what's happening to you and then once you've done that and maybe someone else helped you with it but once you've done that then the second step is to acknowledge that you're unlikely to be the person that can solve that on your own because otherwise you would have you know what I mean and and that's where the next big step is to go see a mental health professional and that starts with a simple simple talk therapist just go talk to one person that isn't your boyfriend or Mom or co-worker someone whose sole job is to find a way to get you healthy and that is the best investment that you can make and and I think that's like you're in the 10th top 10 percentile if you've acknowledged a problem in sought help and I think for most people you know remarkably um they haven't taken both of those steps yeah it's a scary thing to take that first step because you know we attach a level of shame to it the way you expressed earlier because we you know I think especially for people who are high Achievers and you've you know accomplished a lot you've graduated from some school and you feel like um you know from an external perspective your life is supposed to be great and I'm supposed to be happy and um why wouldn't I be happy I have you know a wife or whatever it is that you have in your life and you're supposed to be happy quote unquote and yet you're not and it's very hard to make that mental flip as you said um the other thing that I would say to to anyone out there is um just talk to your friends and ask them how they're doing like it's it's such an easy thing to do to just reach out to someone that you haven't chatted with in a while and just ask like hey how are you doing you know anything I can help with love to chat about Etc because one of the things about your story um that I find so interesting and compelling is you were on you know from an external view on top of the world like had raised 100 million dollars from Excel all these amazing Venture funds you had founded this amazing company you were selling it for all this money reading the news articles you're like man this guy's crushing it this is the most amazing he must be so happy um you know everything's good good looking guy you know everything right and yet you had you had this internal struggle deep deep struggle that you were wrestling with and so my whole thing has always been you never know what's going on behind someone's eyes so never judge someone because you don't know what type of struggle they are dealing with internally and always ask just you know reach out to people and say hey how are you doing because that small little thing might be the one step um that that kind of takes them to get help and to to improve their lives so so much to to take away from this conversation I um I found it an absolute Joy I I have to admit this was one of those conversations where I came away feeling like I can't believe I get to do this for a job so um I really really appreciate your time and super excited to get to do this in person and hopefully over a meal with our with our common friend Jim as well so Andy Dunn thank you so much where can people find you and um where can people buy your book yeah thank you it's awesome to be here and I would add one small thing to that check-in with people is be honest with other people when they check in with you we have this beautiful thing um in the English language anyway which is how are you and the typical answer is like I'm good how are you and I would encourage you to experiment with I'm not great right now and you'll be stunned it stops people in their tracks and it leads to some of the best conversations because see people are so surprised that you're actually being honest and so in addition to checking in with others role model being honest with them and sometimes that kind of frees up the convo in terms of finding me yeah I love I love to I love to be in happy places so email is an unhappy place for me uh because it's just work so I like to be in happy places my happy places are uh Twitter DMS um Twitter banter Instagram DMS banter there playing around with Tick Tock which is addictive and fun and then I love LinkedIn because LinkedIn I feel like is a great place to have iterative you know it's kind of like slack for strangers so I love LinkedIn too by the way that's like I've been where I've been growing the most recently I love LinkedIn it's really fun and then book yeah um would love you to buy it in an independent bookstore uh but if not amazon.com walmart.com are great places amazing well we will um we'll post everything in uh in the show notes so that people can find you and uh until next time I'm so so excited to uh to be able to release this and look forward to all the benefit that people will be able to take from it so thank you for thank you for writing this book thank you for all the vulnerability and congratulations on on the entire journey I look forward to hopefully being a part of the next phase of it amazing thanks so much thanks so much for listening to today's episode if you have any questions that you want featured in a future episode email us at hi T R W I h.com leave us a review at Apple or Spotify to help us grow the reach of this podcast until

what did you learn about about tom brady about how he goes about his business on a daily basis i i tom is uh very methodical and very detail-oriented and i have a lot of respect for that because i'm wired that same way he's found what's been able to work for him and uh seeing the guys that he has around him that helps him reach his heights um he obviously tr has a tremendous amount of trust in them but also he's not afraid to put in that work each and every single day and so those are the different pieces that i see that influences a team and allows them to infiltrate quality locker rooms quality habits probably one of the most hardworking people and competitive people that i've been around and we still compete and have competed on on the practice field and i mean i enjoyed playing against him but i i'd much rather have him be on my team

when you look at the risk return of going and buying a company and being on your own and being on the ownership side of the table it's it's truly life-changing not only for you but potentially for your your children your grandchildren so the risk-reward trade-off is is heavily in the reward favor [Music] sieva xavier so excited to have you guys on for this episode it's one that um both greg and i have been wanting to record for for a while i mean obviously we're all friends and we know you guys but you know from afar getting to see the rise of of what you've been doing and building over the last year plus as we've known each other um but even more you know publicly as you guys have started to share more about it and kind of build in public quote unquote around that journey and and uh you know and around really this like opportunity that i think a lot of people have to kind of opt out of like traditional employment and you know potentially uh go and build and acquire and uh uh boring businesses and kind of the rise of like boring business twitter as it were um so super excited to kind of just like dive into the details and and dig into things but thought it would be helpful for everyone um you know and honestly myself included to just like set the stage a little bit uh on your guys backgrounds and uh really like where you came from and how you uh how you kind of wound up with the insight to start building enduring ventures and we can dig into the details on what it is and the whole story and what you guys are working on but would love to kind of set the stage because you're both independently quite amazing and um would love to start there so xavier maybe we can start with you um and uh we'd love to just kind of hear more about you and like you know you were born and now you're here what happened in between well i'm a little older so that gets that's a long and boring story so i'll give you the the short version is i was always an entrepreneur i think i was i was mowing lawns when i was 11 at least a mini golf course when i was 14. um so i was into boring businesses early pause pause you leased a mini golf course when you were 14. yeah i was i was frustrated that you couldn't get a job like a proper job until you were 16 or some with some would take you when you were 15. and i really wanted to earn money and i was i was willing to work you know whatever was required and so i found out about this opportunity where the small town i grew up the the mini golf course uh they weren't even gonna run it because they just paid some kid to sit there all summer and then i lost money and so um i worked out a deal with the guy who was head of the parks department uh and the deal was basically i get 90 and he gets 10 but he doesn't have any fixed cost i have to fix up the mini golf course and then i have to run it and whatever i make i make um so that was my introduction into low marginal cost uh business because it turns out the key to a mini golf course is just making it look busy even if people aren't paying um and then other people want to go play on the mini golf course and pay for it so that's amazing sorry i cut you off i had to ask that's all the that's also the key to the nightclub business i think as well [Music] the creating the is creating the buzz creating the buzz so we sold um a few family passes comically cheap it was 20 for the whole summer and there was some families who would then just send their kids down to like play mini golf for four hours a day so they could get some work done um and then that that created enough commotion there that other people would walk up and and play um we also illegally sold uh uh cold drinks and uh uh chips i don't think we're supposed to do that but there's no other convenience store in town so we seized on the the window love it it's like the your version of the lemonade stand uh in a much more complicated manner i love that um it's just been like top of mind for me the reason i paused you is because you know i have this newborn um you know little boy and my wife and i have been talking a lot about how i didn't feel like i was raised in a uh household where entrepreneurship was you know really a focus my dad was an academic um and my mom actually did have a business although i never we never really it was a consulting business and so i kind of always thought of it more as like services not really super scalable you know tech enabled type business more like renting out your time and um you know i just felt like growing up it was never top of mind for me to go and do entrepreneurial things and now that i'm exposed to this world and i meet guys like you like greg and i spend time with these you know people who as kids we're just off doing business stuff and like randomly cobbling together businesses and trying different things and like going door-to-door and selling stuff and um all of that i just think about it a lot now with my wife of like i want to prioritize that same set of principles and skills in my son as he gets older and like be able to kind of foster that same creative entrepreneurial spirit in him that i feel like so many of my really smart friends built from a young age yeah you know and it's funny like my parents were not entrepreneurs at all my brothers were not entrepreneurs and so i think about this with my own kids too and i think you know i got to start with the motivation so they got to actually have something they want because like my middle brother would just keep any money earned in a pringles jar never spend any money on anything and so it was very hard for him to get motivated enough to go earn money where for me i was really into um i was into early computers and i was into games and that was like a bottomless pit of money that you could sync into like mid 90s computers and so that was what was motivating me to go out and earn my own money because i wasn't gonna get that on my own so i always think it starts with the motivation and then once you have the motivations like okay well here's i'm not gonna just give you the money but here's a path where you could earn it i think that's that's probably the best way to approach that yeah so um i started uh i also started an early proto college social network in college which would have been like year 2000 um so that was um it was another that was my first entrepreneurial adventure where like it went bigger than like just a small-born business it was like the whole campus was using this site and that was kind of cool um i was a little early with that idea but um i i was going to go to silicon valley and try to start a company around it uh in 2001 when that when the crash happened so that was what got me um was it literally like a facebook or like social network type experience yeah we had a e-dog book feature so we had a feature on it called the e-dog book uh we had uh peer-to-peer teacher reviews were actually the biggest thing on our platform we hadn't gotten the social dynamic quite right uh i would say we hadn't thought of like likes i think likes were sort of the early genius of facebook's uh viral growth the other thing we were categorically wrong about is we thought that hyperlocal was the right approach so our idea was like i was nd today where i went to school notre dame and then we did a yale today and we did a pen today and the other ones just didn't take off in the same way that the nd that one did because i so intimately understood that campus and was able to kind of make a perfect product for it but a lot of the features on the site ended up being like large standalone websites uh someone else did in their own right like i never made any money off that but like rage my teachers is like a big platform that um we were doing kind of way back in those in that proto that swamp uh internet swamp of 99 um and so that uh i guess it was really necessity in some ways it set me off selling textbooks on the internet it was like in a way back to um doing a boring business in a in a realm i understood which was college um and i'll make a really long story short but i founded a company called better world books that's a social impact company so the idea is it um raises money for literacy um and for libraries um by taking the on-run books of the world and selling them on the internet so lots of people donate books to their alma mater for example maybe you bring your whole book collection to stanford when you move and um students also often don't need the books at the end of class and don't have the patience to stand in line with seldom and so better world books ended up being built first around college book drives and then around sort of every unwanted book uh to take those books physically take possession of them sell them in a warehouse um put them into where i'll sell them on the internet uh primarily through amazon ebay originally now uh primarily through its own website um and uh that was that was sort of a 20-year journey of i think the company has sold in aggregate well over a billion dollars worth of books on the internet since since i founded it yeah whoa that's crazy was it like kind of chegg before chegg yeah we actually helped get chegg off the ground um we had a jv with chegg uh for a little while uh we should have we should have gotten some equity in it but um it was uh chegg was focused on textbook rental and we were really focused on um taking books essentially being outsourced online sales um and sometimes organizing the book drives as well so we would almost never pay for a book like new york public library is a good example they would send us semi semi truckloads full of books that the good people of new york had donated to them and we would market that on the internet and sell those books and then we'd revenue share with them um and with the literacy program that they picked um and that was probably new york public library alone was probably a two and a half million dollar your account uh where they would ship us books we would sell well um it's kind of a cool like there's a greg you and i have talked about this in general it's like there's a cool business framework around that same type of you know just like general generalized idea and model which is like you know take something that uh is not their core business model and that they are bad at or have no idea how to do and sort of just like abstract all the complexity away from them of that process and like you take on all the headaches and the challenges of it but you're quite good at it for whatever reason you figured out how to streamline that process and so like for new york public library they have no idea how to sell things online it's just not their core competency they have no clue how to deal with it they would rather pay someone and be happy to pay the margin of that person to just get rid of it and get it off their hands um i saw a business recently that was trying to do that with like lost and found for big arenas and you know big locations which i thought was kind of neat it's like those places don't want to have to deal with you know logging and categorizing lost and found and you know this company was basically coming in and saying like we'll do that we'll abstract all the complexity away and make it a much better experience for your customers you should be happy because it'll you know create a much better more seamless experience um i think it's kind of just like an interesting general framework um and then you ended up in um in the solar space right like in energy yeah so i i worked on better world books for about eight years i went to business school for a year and then i was chairman of federal books after that but i started this um distributed solar company in africa um also a social impact business so the idea was to make solar accessible to the mass market in africa um which it really wasn't uh at the time um and that was sort of 2011. so the idea was if people could pay um in small increments like a prepaid mobile for the power that a small solar power system produces then that would be cheaper and better than their alternative which is paying for kerosene for lighting for example or there's actually a non-trivial industry in africa paying other people to charge your cell phone so going the going rate is about 25 cents a charge to uh have the guy at the shop charge your cell phone crazy crazy crazy all right so we've got xavier's background um and there's a lot to unpack there too see eva i want to give you the uh i want to give you the time of day before we dive into all the uh all the fun and games on enduring yeah sure and i'm and i'm happy to tell you a little bit about my career i think in some ways uh entrepreneurial like xavier's he's uh he's a little bit older and wiser than i am um and all of us i guess your your original question was uh from birth until now and you know it's it's probably worth noting that my story or kind of the decisions that i make in this world i think are largely impacted by the immigrant story in america um i don't know if i've told you the saw but um my mother immigrated to the u.s from the soviet union in the early 90s there was a jewish refugee program going on at the time and she came over with me i was a baby at the time she didn't speak the language she had heard that america was this better place and that she could create a better future for her kids and it was just just this incredible jump that she made and i think you know when i reflect on like what drives me what what gets me up in the morning what keeps me going it's really to um do honor by the the kind of risks that she took and the effort that she put in in those early days and i think i think about that a lot um xavier and i ended up talking about that quite a bit as well so i moseyed kind of through through life living in california i had always wanted to be a doctor i'm in college i took pre-med i interned and kind of shadowed some doctors at the time and then i think you know became a accidental entrepreneur or business person um i wanted to start an education company i felt like there weren't enough resources at my public college to support students so i built a tutoring company and then a note sharing company and kind of a few startups later i guess fast forward to most recently i had a built a healthcare network so totally different industries i pivoted out of education i went into healthcare and built this network of clinical research sites where we powered clinical trials for large pharmaceutical companies so our customers were companies like pfizer and novartis and novoderm and we built this network and we used technology in order to connect patients who needed access to trials as well as those pharmaceutical companies who wanted to accelerate how fast they were getting patients into those trials because it's so expensive to to run the trial or to just keep one running um so that was pretty successful and ended up selling that business right before xavier and i started enduring ventures got it got it okay so you guys came from both entrepreneurial but very different backgrounds um presumably you met uh along the way and and had become friends what was the what was the insight that led to the creation of enduring ventures and then can you just give us the like quick uh point on like what is enduring ventures what are you actually creating and then i wanna i wanna actually get into the like nitty-gritty of this model because i think you know the general characterization that i would have for it which i think you know we've talked about on twitter in the past is like you're building a baby berkshire hathaway warren buffett and charlie munger's brainchild um and there's something amazing about you know two guys setting out to kind of go and do that and sharing in public that journey and how you're doing it and like really the mechanics um and getting into the weeds of how you're going about that process so i want to get into the nitty gritty of it because i think there's probably a lot of people out there listening that um you know they may want to pursue something similar in the future so can you just talk a little bit about that founding insight and then let's dive into it and and one thing i just want to highlight um [Music] so before we get into that because i think it's an that's a really good like i also want to dive into that but sieva and xavier were living in san francisco at the time at least i met you guys in 2016 in san francisco i didn't know that sean yeah sean poury was hosting these masterminds before sean poury had my first million as a place to like get his ideas out there sean pory basically you know every few weeks would invite different entrepreneurs into this room in san francisco at his office and we would basically order pizza hang out and just talk about ideas i show up uh you know i was going to these things often and the people that were showing up were like the nikita beers of the world social founder um the josh buckley's of the world who at the time had a you know video game um alex ii who's the founder of com.com like mostly just mobile apps with social features or social apps with mobile features like that's basically where it was at and i show up and these two guys are in the room one guy xavier is like working on this thing in africa about solar energy way more ambitious and so i was like what and sievo was i don't remember exactly i think you were working on your education thing at the time it might have been your yeah your i think it might have been no chairing at the time and which was also like completely like uh different than what people working on it so there's something that you two have which i find interesting and i'm curious your perspective on it which is you don't exactly go toward the trend is like you just kind of come up with ideas that connect with you and you just like are curious and you follow it is that right i mean i think that's within hand grenade range i think we're also both very cheap i think that's something to know about us and so in some ways we've been much more comfortable in the world you know i had this experience of building a bootstrap company with better world books and then having the complete opposite with the solar company or had to raise absolute boatloads of capital so you know over 200 million dollars raised just on my watch for that business and um the whole raising boat loads of capital that was like 70 of my job was like you know not just the like oh making the pitch like that's the easy part but really holding together a high-powered board that had maybe different opinions on which we think should go on um you know on sort of navigating funding rounds that don't always happen at the time when the market wants them to happen and so they can be tough to close so i think for me personally getting back to the fundamentals of business was was really interesting i think that's something sieve and i kind of share is like both a sort of broader view about like social impact beyond just like let's make something that grows as fast as possible and we can sell for as much as possible and then also like the real art and fundamentals of business as an as a practice i guess rather than like what is what is the hypey thing right now that you could dive into that if you're lucky someone will buy your company and i know see but what do you think about that well i i was going to say um you know i spent five years just fanboying xavier from afar i thought he was like the coolest guy the coolest entrepreneur he was building this social impact business in africa lighting millions of people's homes um you know raising capital for flying back and forth between europe africa and california and obviously very positively affecting people's lives but simultaneously building this incredible recurring revenue kind of commodity business that people really needed so you know that was something that i really looked up to him for and it was greg was really in that room in that mastermind that sean used to host where xavier and i became really good friends um and it was it wasn't until many years later that we came up with the idea for enduring but that certainly was the genesis of it and sam do you remember what the actual like when we came up with the idea i feel like it evolved so organically like i don't remember what specific conversation it was it was like oh let's let's do this thing yeah i don't i don't recall the exact day i think it really started with you know you you hired a ceo at your previous business and for years you guys had worked together you know you were ready to move on to your next thing and we first decided that we wanted to do something together and then it evolved into this conversation around well the next thing we do let's reverse engineer what is the last business we would ever want to work on right like what is something that we would want to work on for the next 20 30 or 40 years which is really different from our startup experience both i know you and i talked about this where you start something you know in your head you're like i'm gonna sprint after this for five to ten years and then i'm gonna sell it or i'll hire a ceo and leave and the idea for enduring was really how can we think long term about something and then that's when i think we really pointed our kind of uh our laser towards uh towards warren buffett and what he had done uh with berkshire hathaway and i think we were always fanboys of his of his yeah but that's i think like anyone anyone that had had that experience uh you know of like being interested in investing and you know reading the berkshire hathaway annual letters uh you know probably had that like same uh feeling of like fanboying around it right like you know the general story around berkshire and and warren buffett just for anyone that doesn't know it that you should go read it if you're at all interested in investing but basically they bought you know he bought a dying textile mill berkshire hathaway and it was cash flowing um pretty significantly i think like on the order of several million dollars a year um and at the time he was like reinvesting you know the money into the dying textile industry quickly realized that that wasn't the smartest way to reinvest the dollars for the best long-term compounding return and so started reinvesting the dollars from that um from that business into higher profit you know and more kind of like macro growth industries which you know has now grown into a massive you know hundreds of billions of dollar conglomerate or non-conglomerate holding company of insurance and you know big other like heavy industrial businesses and bnsf and you know the railroad company a whole lot of other things but basically started this engine of taking cash flows and reinvesting them into um you know long-term compounders the reason i say that a lot of people fanboy over is i think a lot of people read it fanboy over the idea sounds really sweet oh so cool you know quote warren buffett all the time on twitter uh everybody be greedy when everyone's fearful like it's the it's all in vogue to quote it very few people actually go and do anything about it and go and build around this general concept and idea uh you guys did so can we just like dive into it a little bit um from the get-go did you envision the structure that it was going to take um you know and kind of the way that that created certain advantages from a tax perspective and from an ability to reinvest that really uh attractive um you know kind of compound growth rates like what was the general vision for it from the get-go yeah i can i can start diving into that so you know the the kind of search fund and private equity road is really well trodden so if you if you know if you heard of search funds that's essentially where an mba goes and raises a bit of money to go try to acquire a business and then run it and essentially the way they're compensated for doing this looks a lot like private equity which is fundamentally a sort of more or less a carried interest model i get if i sell it for more than i paid for it then i get some some of the gain in my pocket yeah this is where i get this is worth pausing on sorry sorry this is worth pausing on because it's actually a really interesting model that has proliferated a ton recently this search fund model it's like it's become you know you know this you guys know this i spent the first seven years of my career in private equity and um several of our employees left went to business school and then raised search funds and it became like you know it used to be that people would go to stanford business school or harvard business school and then go take a job at mckinsey or at a private equity fund and it became the new like in vogue thing to go do after business school because all of a sudden you're armed with this network of really wealthy people or people that think you're really impressive that you can convince to give you what is effectively a blank check like they commit to uh investing in whatever business you find you don't have a business and you say like okay let's let me go raise a 10 million dollar search fund and you now have committed 10 million dollars it's not in your bank account but people have committed that they're going to fund it when you find the business now you go and you know go through phone books or like the digital version of phone books and find a bunch of businesses you know maybe you find like a local or regional hvac business uh that is not optimized for whatever reason you strike up a deal with the you know the owner of the business that you're going to acquire it you call all the people who have given you the commitment to give you the funding for the deal you buy the business and then as xavier alluded to you kind of you know normally it's in the form of like what's called promote but you effectively have you know kind of upside equity that you didn't have to buy into in this in this business going forward so if you eventually sell it you now kind of got paid both a salary while you were running it and then also on top of that you know a big chunk of proceeds if you expand the equity value of the business but it's a pretty interesting thing um for young people to potentially do if you are coming out of business school or you do have a network of people that might be willing to fund you to do something it's a pretty cool opportunity and like a way to take a big swing without having a whole ton of downside risk since it's not your upfront capital yeah i know i really think it is and in some ways we sort of started as a search fund on steroids in the sense that we were saying we're not just going to go buy one business we're going to go buy a portfolio of businesses but the structure was very different so we didn't like the promote structure because it fundamentally incentivizes selling and selling as quickly as you can and i've just been on both sides of that transaction so both selling a business and buying some businesses while i've been running businesses and i know how much work it takes to actually prepare a business for sale if you're going to do it right and you really run a business differently and there's no two ways about it you run it differently if you're going to long term hold it than if you're going to sell for maximum proceeds um and so that uh that sort of didn't appeal to us and also on the on the buffett side you had to look at why did buffett not start a hedge fund or he actually disbanded an investment partnership and and bought berkshire and it's it's so that he could have a stock in one company and then the cash flow could flow up to that company and he could keep allocating it and so having an internal capital market means i don't need all the friction of going to a pool of investors and pitching them an idea and saying here's how much you get and here's how much i get and or if i need debt going to a bank and saying okay well to borrow some money so i have cash flow from business a and cash and business b needs some investment capital you can just make that decision and go and the the increase in efficiency is enormous right so even if you don't have the tax advantages which you do it's it's the ideal structure for long-term compounding you have you have the flexibility of decision making and operation and and the portfolio effect that if one of your businesses is suffering that doesn't mean the whole thing's going to crumble it just means that that business may run at zero profit for a while while the other ones um you know the other ones keep cranking um like what are the high points of the actual structure of it so if you wanted to set up something that has um these features of of the vehicle like the berkshire hathaway the baby berkshire that you guys are building it enduring what are the the kind of the key features that uh that it would have so the most key feature is that it has a parent holding company that's a c corporation and ideally that c corporation has very few to no employees rc corporation has no employees it's um how we actually even save and i just get a salary from enduring consulting group llc which is a subsidiary so you really try to wall off the the battleship at the top and the only thing the battleship at the top does is have capital go in and capital go out so if we need capital to buy businesses then shareholders buy shares and capital goes into the holding company if we uh want to buy a business or invest in one of the ones we already own the capital goes out in the holding company and then the subsidiaries are a combination of c corps and llcs we have a whole menagerie there's probably 16 of them or so that are underneath us right now and the way that sort of breaks down is if we think a company will eventually raise external capital or um or spin out into the public markets on its own uh if we think it has that potential then we'll set it up as a c-corp because that's much more friendly structure to take external capital if it's just a small cash flowing business that we're just going to reinvest the cash flow then it's uh llc is a much simpler and lower cost structure to do that in got it okay so a couple questions um for either one of you guys so c-corp at the top um what's the reason for not wanting any people associated with that like what why is that is that a qsbs thing because i know like i want to get into qsps and understand that for people as well um it's just risk mitigation right anytime you have an employee there is some small chance they could yeah i could i could slip on an ice patch on my way to work and have a beef with cave and sue the company right or there's a um there's just small risks that you want to minimize so for example we don't have any debt that is guaranteed by the parent company that's very important because then if business a for some reason has a catastrophic failure it doesn't take down the rest of the ship so you're sort of limited in your exposure in each business in in terms of the money you invested and that's that's a real buffet ism is don't lose money i think that's that's one aspect of his model that is really underestimated is yeah is is his view of the downside risk he's actually okay with relatively low rates of return as long as there's some uh possibility of growth of the business he bought um yeah so he's not thought that that was i always thought that that was like a really interesting um just like experiencing sort of two ends of the spectrum of investing personally like you know going from private equity and honestly like i was at a value-oriented private equity shop so going from that to doing early stage venture stuff it was a really interesting change because in in you know in value-oriented private equity it was like the whole thing you're basically like you're underwriting credit almost where you can't lose money and if you manage to just not lose money on deals like if your bad deals are a 0.7 moic like you get back some of your money you like claw your way to a you know shitty .05 outcome or something but you don't just get you know washed it's pretty hard to have a bad fund if you do that over and over again if you're like you know buying reasonable businesses because ultimately you have a few that do 5x or 7. like something goes really well and it clicks and it goes your way and if you can just avoid those like complete washout deals the fun turns out pretty well and that's like more the buffett model versus venture where it's like yeah i'm gonna get washed out on nine out of ten and if the one is a thousand x who cares and i feel totally fine about the whole fund yeah i think i think buffett talks a lot about the hardest part about his job is sitting on his hands and doing nothing and the reason most people fail is because humans are naturally impatient we want to be doing something we can't sit still in a room so a good opportunity might come at us and we know it's not the best one but we jump at it right and that's when things can fall apart for your fund so a big part of our job and something that xavier and i talk a lot about is there's thousands or millions of great opportunities out there especially in this segment of the market where we participate in which is really the smbs and if a deal isn't a perfect fit if it doesn't seem like an obvious growth opportunity or worst case scenario as you said we get our money back then we just pass you know we're happy to spend a few months doing our diligence understanding in business and if it doesn't check the boxes even despite all that effort and maybe costs we're happy to just wait you know we have our little capital engine going so no matter what we have cash flow that we can pull on at a later date what are some buffet-isms that are sacred to you all like you know you maybe it's like uh a few of them that you're just like wow this is how we're running enduring and what are some buffetisms that you're like wow he is totally wrong on that and that's a great question um that is a great question all right i'll shoot um so i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm terrible at quoting things so but he has he has this notion of management by abdication that you um you basically that as long as you have the right ceo and they're compensated properly based on the company's success the best thing you can do is probably leave them alone and so i mean buffett took this to incredible extremes where he would not even ask for financial reports from companies for sometimes you know years at a time if he trusted the ceo let alone like a monthly board call or quarterly board call he'd just find the right guy and you know sort of let them loose they wouldn't standardize anything there's literally still 40 people in the berkshire head office and most of them do the tax return and it's amazing and so you know they run it like a small business i mean it's like you know warren and charlie and like the two ted's and like a few other guys like deciding okay we'll put 400 million into snowflake okay we'll buy this 20 billion dollar company you know they'll make these monumental decisions with an awfully small team um and so i think that it's amazing like despite having had that really clear message from him we almost immediately went oh it'd be nice to have a recruiter on our team let's hire a recruiter and then sure enough what happens she was a perfectly good recruiter but then the ceos start losing agency and they're like oh well it's a during ventures job to recruit my talent so i'm not going to worry about that i'm just going to interview whoever they bring me and the second people start losing agency they don't have full responsibility for the outcome of their business which is actually the the most fulfilling work as a ceo and like also the thing that makes the model scalable and so i think it's also why buffett can be in industries he doesn't understand at all because uh you know he doesn't know how to make airplane parts but he knows what a good airplane parts making company looks like and he knows what a ceo does when they're running it competently um and so sometimes people will try to say oh well warren buffett owns this company and they have a sexual harassment suit or something like that you know berkshire hathaway has a bad culture and like berkshire hathaway doesn't have a culture it's an owner of these companies and it doesn't try to impose its culture on on the individual organizations that's really driven by the by the ceos um so i think that's that's something really sacred and then i'll say one thing i think we could do better if we do it right which is uh federating capital allocation and so uh buffett has a view that basically it's his job deck allocate capital and nobody else's and i think there's a world where you can train your management teams to also be buyers of businesses in their sector and to smartly allocate capital and it for and and step into it so at first they propose allocations of capital and we evaluate those and push back and then eventually as we get five or ten years on i would love to be able to just give certain chunks of capital to managers and say okay your job is to grow with this to make one or two acquisitions within your sector or invested in your in your current operation whichever whichever way you think you can grow the best i mean one of the things that they have to that like i personally just feel they need more pushback on because i like i'm similar to you guys right like i've always worshipped a lot of these quotes and i have a ton that i love but like their stance on crypto and web 3 and bitcoin um and i say day because i'm i'm grouping charlie munger into this um i just think is i just think it's kind of silly like charlie munger has the quote of you know you never allow yourself to have an opinion on something when you don't know the other side's argument better than they do and i just like you can say that that's great there's no way they have dug into this i don't think or understand it as well um as the like true you know patrons of that industry and yet they are extremely vocal about their distaste for it and that's like i i get it but i feel like you're talking out of both sides of your mouth um when you when you do something like that like it it seems like what would be logically consistent with their perspective on on uh you know having an opinion and earning an opinion would be just not saying anything about bitcoin and crypto and just saying like look we don't get it we don't agree with it we're not investing in it but like you know calling it rat poison squared over and over and over again and saying that it's like you know for criminals and degenerates and like it's just maybe it's part of their shtick and it's kind of the whole like they're folksy and that's their thing and you know they're eating coca-cola you know they're like talking about bitcoin and crypto being the worst thing for human society while like drinking coca-cola and you know eating candy on stage um i just like that whole thing it would be the one area for me where i would just kind of say like i get it if it's part of their shtick but i just don't agree with it yeah they're definitely creatures of their era every great company has a great narrative and the berkshire narrative is so strong around productive assets buying wonderful businesses uh never bet against america like they've got like these sayings that are so iconic and i'm a crypto guy so obviously when i hear like icons like charlie and buffett saying like bitcoin is rap poison squared like a tear slowly goes down my face but at the same time if you ask them about gold non-productive asset they're not buying gold they did buy a gold mine though well that's a product which is a productive yeah yeah that's so i'm not surprised that they latched on to it it's also i mean like if you look at other things if you if you're a believer in crypto and web3 and you believe that you know it is like a new paradigm for the internet or the new age of the internet um you know warren and charlie have missed uh real tech trends right like the the time when they bought apple how long they passed on amazon for like they have not been historically very good at you know predicting mega trends within tech um and so maybe it's just you know circle of confidence right like to go back to one of their things maybe it's just out of their wheelhouse and they can you know have their narrative and their shtick and the you know focusiness which everyone loves and it's very endearing um and it's just not worth paying attention to like they're gonna keep kind of saying their thing about it one of the ones i absolutely love which i think relates sieva to one thing you were saying earlier is like warren buffett's quote about like when you find yourself at the bottom of a hole the first thing you need to do is just stop digging um i think about that so often for my own life and myself because uh to your point earlier like when i find myself in a bad situation whether it's investing or just like personally you know whatever you screw something up you're in a bad spot my first uh instinct is always to create motion i'm like all right i'm going to do this do this do this take this action jump this way do this thing um and oftentimes you realize that like all of that movement you're creating is actually just digging yourself deeper into whatever you're in and that the real action that you need to take is inaction it's literally just stepping back and doing absolutely nothing for whatever period of time um and i think you alluded to it of like sometimes the best investment decision is to just do nothing to just say no um and i think that that is like the mark for me of a really sophisticated investor is the ability to literally just do nothing and you tweeted it i think recently so you have a um something to the effect of like you know the best investments are made at the end of bear markets um not at the beginning of them and so like being really patient you know we're in this time now where it's like oh asset prices are down do i just start buying things um how do i kind of go about this and sometimes the answer is literally just do nothing just wait like see how it plays out i'm thinking about it now with my venture fund it feels like a great time to have dry powder but i have no idea how much asset prices are going to reset and so part of me is like i kind of just want to pause for three months and just see like in three months what is the average seed valuation gonna be my guess is it's lower than what it is today um and so doing nothing actually right now would really benefit me in terms of the vintage of the fund and how it's gonna turn out um so i i mean that that really resonates with me more broadly yeah and i think xavier and i you know relative to maybe a year ago we're still investing we're still looking at opportunities but um we're happy to be patient for another three to six months to see where kind of the world lands where everything resets and then pick up the pieces and jump back in with both feet so what uh what businesses do you guys buy and like how do you think like what's your framework for for buying businesses we're we're really looking for um what we call boring cash flow businesses um and i don't think you know they're not boring to everyone they're really boring because nobody's writing about them in the news they're not on the front page of tech crunch you usually won't hear about them in the wall street journal we really want to buy the businesses that power america is how i think about it you know really those small mom-and-pop shops of blue oftentimes blue-collar industries that um you know that generate good revenue incredible cash flow have been going for 20 30 years um and now you know maybe they don't their employees don't want to take over or they don't have a son or daughter that wants to take over the business and enduring ventures is just a perfect buyer for that type of company examples might be you know we love plumbing service businesses hvac service companies we own a series of businesses that provide broadband to people's homes and offices so all of these companies that are largely recession resistant have been around for a really long time that we can buy a very reasonable multiple multiple of cash flow that is which is sometimes different than sas which we can talk about but that's really our sweet spot and it's follow that playbook and do that over and over again over a long period of time xavier do you have anything to add there yeah the only other thing i would add color on that is we um we really like to see some growth angle to the business so we'd probably rather buy the number three plumber in a metro rather than the number one um especially if we think that the number one is is vulnerable in some way and so when you're buying businesses you you protect your downside by buying it a little multiple but you really deliver returns for your investors by by getting the business on the growth track especially if it wasn't before and that usually usually comes with bringing in new energetic management with with good ideas and then how are you actually buying them so like you know two of the principles that jump out to me here um as far as the advantages of your model it's like the actual financing structure of how you're financing the deals um you know to generate returns and then um the whole qsbs thing which i want to just like understand a little bit better so how are you financing the deals like are you doing sba loans are you doing seller financing you know kind of what's that like actual structure of how you're doing these deals that people can take away to you know to maybe execute in the future for themselves yeah so there's we we've done everything in kitchen sink so everything from all equity to seller finance to sba uh to uh you know sort of we've gotten close on some mezzanine financing we haven't actually done one with a mezzanine lender but there are folks out there who will lend say five to ten million dollars you know they lend to search funds for example which are sort of classic um you know uh users of that capital i would say if you think about the universe of businesses you can buy if it's under say 500 000 in profits you ought to figure out a way to buy it personally as a listener with an sba loan that's like a real sweet spot because you can probably buy that business for one to two million dollars and it'll set you for life if you just run it properly and grow it a bit um and how does that work so like if someone wanted to do that if i found a half a million dollar a year profit you know local landscaping business that i wanted to acquire um how would i actually go about getting an sba loan for that and what would you know typical kind of terms like what would i be signing up for with that sba loan and like how much cash would have to come out of pocket just like give me a quick you know napkin math on it so napkin math is let's say you pay three times cash flow which is very achievable some sectors you'll have to pay more some sectors you can even pay less but let's just call it three times um so you're paying 1.5 million for it you are taking an sba loan for 80 to 90 percent of that purchase price so you're coming out of pocket maybe 150 to 300 000 if you don't have that 150 to 300 000 um you can get an investor to come in and provide most of the capital if you're if you sort of have no money at all and no assets at all sometimes the bank will be cautious just because you're you're a very weak uh guarantor there's no sign you can put in any more money if things go sideways um but those deals can still get done um and then the sba loan is a 10-year loan so your payments on that would be awfully reasonable let's say 15 dollars a month just just spitballing and so maybe a third of that cash flow goes to service the debt um and even without growing the business another third goes to pay your living expenses and then you have a third you can sort of reinvest in in the business um now if you can grow that from 500k to a million in cash flow that millionaire cash flow is probably worth four or five times and so you've created two or three million dollars of equity value right there in addition to having obviously really strong monthly cash flow for your personal use yeah this is like the entire model of like the opt out from the traditional track that i find so interesting and like great greg and i have differences of opinion on like the headaches of potentially running one of these as an individual um which i think are very real and people need to consider because you actually need to go run this business if you're gonna do that form of like a one person you know sba go buy a landscaping business but it's a pretty neat idea like you know i had a friend who was working at deloitte and i don't know he's probably making 150 a year as like a director at deloitte and doing quite well but it was like really stressful wasn't getting to spend time with his family and he literally went and did this he bought a bought a local landscaping business and got an sba loan and now he's probably making like a million a year he has employees he's like you know probably works like 20 hours a week at this point it was a grind for a while as he got it off the ground for sure but it was kind of a cool way that he just like within a year opted out from the entire track that he was on like the partner track at this consultancy and did it the other thing which you mentioned that i think is so cool that people don't fully appreciate with like an sba loan or with business loans when you acquire a business it's like people equate it to like getting a mortgage when you buy a house the challenge with that uh with equating it to that is like when you buy a mortgage with a house you take sorry when you buy a house with a mortgage you're you're taking a loan against your income and so like your income is what's kind of providing the collateral that they're um that they're basing the loan on um when you buy a business with an sba loan you're kind of buying the business with itself because you're buying you're getting the loan against the cash flows of the actual company it has nothing to do with you there might be a personal guarantee on the back end in that case but you're able to now service the debt with the cash flows from the business and so like it's a it's a unique hack of american capitalism that you're able to buy businesses with loans against the cash flows of those businesses um it's just like a very neat thing and then you know combine that with seller financing which you can often get in these deals um and you can often do them with very very little cash up front um which generates just an absurd return on your equity that's that's exactly right i mean you you should really underwrite 100 equity returns when you when you do one of these um and that should be a very that should be a base case that's like growing the business 10 a year um so it's really it's really really juicy um there's some really good sba lenders out there some of them are on twitter uh we have one uh we use again and again happy to send a referral if anyone dn wants to dm me uh for that um but uh yeah it's it's a really special i mean it's an only in america thing i i don't know the equivalent anywhere else in the world okay so that's that one um and then qsbs you got to hit us with soon to get uh here on this because um i i just have so many people like asking me the question i don't know all the details of it so like just hit me with uh the the kind of high points on like what is qsbs and why does it matter and why is it such an unbelievable hack for um you know for business owners so if you set up as a c corp and you buy original shares so you you invest some money that could be just you register the business online and you put in 50 to get your shares and then you hold those shares for five years and you sell them and there's a few other caveats consult your cpa or tax advisor on this but um essentially you can sell up to 10 million dollars of that stock uh tax-free you may pay state capital gains but you won't pay federal capital gains on it um you can even go further you can have your kids buy some of the stock your wife buy some of the stock and they each person um gets a 10 million dollar exclusion so it's kind of amazing um and this is up to the first 50 million dollars in assets on the balance sheet of the company so all of our original investors along with me and sieva had that treatment in the company um and uh you you do as well as an investor i think about the first eight million of that we raised uh qualified as qsps so when you do sell if you hold for five years um that should be a very clean transaction 25 years is my plan at least beautiful for what it's worth um i mean this is like again you know america being the home of um you know of entrepreneurship and and kind of incentivizing capitalism um it's an amazing you know people push back against this kind of stuff because they're like oh you should be paying your taxes the flip side of that is this incentivizes a whole lot of people to go and build and to go and create jobs and um you know and build businesses because you are going to get these advantages from doing it versus you know working in a in a salary job so i um i think it's amazing and it's like a very cool way that um you know that builders and that people that are kind of compounding long term and doing things for the long term to your point the five plus year thing so you're not doing you can't do this with like quick flip you know flip something you know in a year and hope to get the same tax advantage um it just incentivizes uh entrepreneurial long-term thinking which i just find to be a really awesome thing no it's a really smart policy and it's it has suffered some assaults by some small-minded people so it's important we we keep fighting for it it almost got taken out in the in the buildback better bill which was uh but it but it survived huh um so i know we're running up close to the end of time and we're gonna have to do like a follow-up episode on all of this um because there's just there's too much to cover in one session what like maybe from each of you um it would just be great to like get some just general um either general closing thoughts on you know how listeners can kind of take away some of the insights from what you guys are doing to um you know to go and do this like things you wish you knew um as it were uh or uh give us like one just like fascinating business or story that you've seen recently that is um you know kind of capturing your attention sort of like uh sieva's scaffolding story that he shared recently that that that drummed up a lot of interest on twitter i love that business too i still think about it like on a weekly basis um so i'll give the advice because i get hit up a lot on twitter dms where people are saying hey i want to buy a business like what should i do and i think the number one thing is honestly having a really honest conversation with yourself and your spouse about like your readiness on a scale of one to ten to do it because it absolutely can be a grind to run a business and it's it's probably an intensity that if you've only worked in an office you haven't fully experienced because and i've seen i have seen people um you know where businesses haven't gone well really suffer and really grind for years and years and that's not you know that's not what you want to see um but at the same time it's when you look at the risk return of going and buying a company and being in your own and being on the ownership side of the table it's it's truly life-changing not only for you but potentially for your your children your grandchildren so the risk reward trade-off is heavily in reward favor but if you don't know how if you never manage people especially if you have never managed blue collar people if you've never managed p l um it could make sense to go work in a small business and help them build it and make sure that that feels like what you want to do before you actually go go try to buy one i see some folks who are like 23 saying i'm gonna go go and buy a landscaping company and it's like man that could go horribly awry because you never manage people so you know that was that was the the gift that i think sieve and i both had is that we had we had done every job that you could do in business before we went and started buying them and so even though we might not know something specific about plumbing we we do know if a business is working or not by looking at the financial statements and it's it's financial health as well as culturally and and the team perspective and apply some heuristics to that um so i think that that's that's the advice i would leave to people but that doesn't scare you like you're you both are have experience in tech building tech businesses then all of a sudden you buy this uh plumbing business and you're in the plumbing business um but you can't fix your own toilet you know like does that not scare you or are you that confident that you're gonna hire the right people to manage it and you'll be able to troubleshoot it yeah it's it's a little article of faith i mean uh better world books was more of a logistics company than it was a tech business so with 300 people working in three warehouses around the globe and shipping an enormous amount of books here here and there um so i think like in just in terms of sort of managing a blue-collar workforce i probably got a little more exposure than most folks in the tech world um but the point is really well taken and it does it's a little scarier uh for sure to buy a business you don't fully understand and i think that's something we've really gone into is saying we need to really understand how this business makes money and where we would find the kind of people who know how to run this business we don't need to be able to run it but we need to be able to understand it if something goes wrong and you know business like scaffolding you actually can understand a bit more simply than maybe some you know some industrial chemicals business where you know it's really it's really sort of obscure and you don't know exactly what could go wrong um and i think we've seen that in our acquisitions that the best businesses we've bought have been at least somewhat in our circle of competence and in a weird way local plumbing and hvac is as much about internet marketing as it is about um yeah there is kind of like generalized knowledge versus specific knowledge in these businesses too and like you guys have um incredible generalized knowledge and have probably been able to find you know patterns across all of these that apply and then it's like how do you retain the people that have the specialized knowledge that you really can't afford to lose to greg's point like the people that if you know if they're gone and you you lose their insights or their um you know their kind of like uh institutional knowledge um as a good way to say it you're gonna be in a lot of trouble and then making sure you incentivize those people for the long run absolutely um steve do you have a do you have a business uh want to share one of our businesses we've seen um yeah i'm happy to and i think you know adding to some of the comments you were saying earlier i also get dm quite a bit on twitter from people that want to start holdco's and or holding companies and the main focus is identify your ongoing cash flow source and that may mean buying a business right using sba debt to buy something small that then generates cash flow for you so you can buy more businesses or in the world of the internet you know that may mean starting your own business be a content creator you know create a course or whatever it is that allows you to build some ongoing cash flow engine your own little version of the berkshire textile mail because once you have that you have unlimited unlimited opportunities to go out and buy more businesses and that's really been our focus at least in the early days of enduring um and then as far as like businesses that we love you know i'm a i'm a die harder for the blue collar businesses the high cash flow generating companies recently i actually posted a twitter thread about a scaffolding business that we looked at in the midwest we ended up passing on it but i can share some of the fun dynamics of that one scaffolding is is an incredibly cool concept because if you think about it you're buying a bunch of equipment right all the different scaffolding pieces that you're renting out to general contractors but once you buy that equipment which which can be really expensive so that's a real barrier to entry which is tough for new people but great for people that already have the equipment um but once you have that equipment let's say you have 10 million dollars of scaffolding product you can reuse that scaffolding equipment year after year for all of your contractors and you really don't have to replace it too often you know of course there's some maintenance cost there's going to be some amount of costs where you're buying the latest and greatest equipment but your core business is this beautiful recurring revenue engine and the one we looked at in in the midwest was doing about four million of ebitda we could have bought it at what wasn't xavier maybe four times he did that yeah i think four times four times even uh yeah um and you know what you get paid you just get up you get you have to get paid to put up the scaffolding you get paid a day rate well it's up so any construction delays just go in your favor and then you get paid to take down the scaffolding it's amazing yeah and i mean just to like the craziness of buying companies at four times ebitda like in a world where everybody was talking about you know 100x uh uh adjusted you know or like you know arr in um in the venture world six months ago or something like buying a business for four times cash flow you know ebitda as a proxy for cash flow um is insane like if you just do the math on you know i bought it for four times that uh you know and so it's going to generate um you know and it generates its ebitda with no growth uh in an unlevered world where i didn't use any debt i bought it with all cash i'm still generating a 25 return on that and now i lever that uh you know with some debt and you're generating you know you generate like 100 plus return if you if you leverage effectively potentially in year one with no growth it's like it's completely insane um when you uh when you think about the math of buying businesses at that price i always thought by the way um seva that like the best business in the world is those um uh the like dumpsters that get dropped at like construction sites and just sit there um yeah like at even in like office parks and at um like apartment buildings there's just like a dumpster that sits outside and they come and pick it up every now and then but it just sits there and it has to be rented at like a pretty attractive rate you never have to maintain those things because they're just like old dumpsters there's no like specialized equipment no one's standing on them like scaffolding um that has to be an unbelievable business yeah i mean we love anything where you can buy it once and just rent it over and over again i think there's a franchise that's taken off uh like maybe one of the fastest growing franchises right now they're called like junk crushers i'm totally butching it butchering it but basically they put that junk bin in front of your house you put a bunch of stuff in it and the only difference is that they have a machine that comes and compresses it in order to create more space for you so it's much cheaper than the previous rendition where like maybe your chairs alone filled up the jump um and they're doing incredibly well they're going super fast and we certainly have our eye on them oh that's cool that's a cool business you know i think the ultimate god of the cash flow businesses is the smart card at the airport every you notice that thing where you pay six dollars to get an airport cart yeah i mean what whoever invented that to me is the all-time genius of cash flow businesses yeah that yeah that's probably right actually i'm actually curious now now that you mentioned that i want to dig into this now after like if anyone knows that's listening any of the mechanics of those businesses um i would love to learn more about that one because like i mean it used to be that there were people it was like someone would come and you'd have to pay them and they'd kind of like hawk you down and you know you'd have to tip them or whatever it was for helping you like when i was a kid and that still exists in india actually um and then it became the coin operated uh you know dolly carts and now it's credit card like i think you could pay with a credit card and get one of those um i haven't used one in years but i wonder what the actual economics are of those things yeah they must have a revenue share with the airport or something but it's it's it like solves the airport problem because it makes it easier for people to load and unload it uh you know you pay six bucks when you get it and you don't really care where the person leaves it because either someone else will take it for free i think you return it you get like a quarter or something so there's like some incentive for people just go walk around and return them and then every once in a while someone walks around the airport at the end of the night and then picks everything up and there's no alternative like you just you have to do it otherwise you're not getting your bags you know if you have three screaming kids and you got all your big bags for your long vacation to hawaii like you're just paying the six bucks you're paying the uh yeah the pre you know like there's no uh there's no pricing discipline around that all right well guys this was awesome um absolute blast and i feel like i um i have like a hundred things that i learned and now a hundred more things that i need to spend more time learning um because you've opened my eyes to a bunch of cool new stuff so thank you both so much for uh for joining where can people find you i know you guys are both sharing a lot on twitter um i believe it's at xavier helgeson um and we'll put in the show notes the spelling of of your guys names because neither one of you has a particularly easy last name and at sieva kaczynski um both highly recommend following because um sharing some of the most interesting tactical insights that i've seen on twitter and and what i think of is like real earned insights um from things that you're doing actively on here so um super super thankful for for both of you coming on yeah my biggest takeaway is thinking about the plumbing business as an internet marketing business like if you start thinking about all these services businesses as really just like internet like 95 percent internet marketing 5 like sort of old-school utility then that really changes your mindset on these things and then you can just go one by one and look at all these different cash cow industries and see how you can play a role so thanks for that and uh that's a great takeaway greg because i think you you guys all know nick huber um the uh sweaty startup on twitter but he had a thing a while back that was like um the best way to find business opportunities is to go to all of the like local businesses um in the niche that you're trying to operate in and look for the ones that still have a fax number listed on their website or like don't have a website or the website's not optimized for mobile and you'll immediately identify opportunities because you'll be if you're thinking about you know opportunities to improve it and you know create more tech enablement um clearly anyone that still has a fax number on their on their page or or at their business is is not ready for uh for what the future looks like that's the truth i always like that honestly you can even scribe you can even sell leads you can start out internet marketing just sell leads to local plumbing companies and once you have the engine cranking then you can eventually go buy one it's a really interesting strategy that i've seen before and often that's the best way to start because you actually learn you know you learn the players that way you learn the economics that way so yeah folks listening like get in the leads business and it's a fantastic business and a great way to learn we should do an episode on that greg we should do an episode on the leads business there's a i think there's a lot to dig into there that'd be super interesting yeah i've got some people there awesome all right guys well thank you so much super appreciate it um look forward to everyone that's listening following you guys and and learning more from you guys in the future so thank you both thanks guys all right thanks guys [Music]

the minimum viable community is going to become the new standard and you're already seeing it in pfp projects you're already seeing it across crypto um i think you all are clearly building a business around this concept that is the new challenge and and the core reason for that is everyone is overwhelmed with options attention is scarce as a result and one of the best moats for that is community and and i know that because i lived it like i read it for five years between i left in 2010 i came back in early you know late 14 as as exec chair had almost no investment by con and asked in the product the product didn't improve for half a decade barely stayed online okay there's no business on the planet let alone in tech that should be allowed to do nothing for five years five years grow every single year that should not be allowed that breaks every rule and the reason it broke those rules is because of community

yeah no I think um I think it's a very um it's a very real problem and I think I said this to you we were doing a call maybe a month ago there's a great quote on this by Blaise Pascal which is all of man's miseries arise from an inability to sit quietly in a room by oneself right think about it you can't just sit still you can't have a moment of boredom um one of the things I did after this dopamine fast was I said you know rule I don't listen to things when I drive so I just have these quiet contemplative 20-minute drives everywhere I go I've now slept obviously um given I relapsed but um I do think those sorts of things are really really helpful and that experiencing boredom at some time in your day is important

one of my oldest memories is going to the met and uh there's sort of an egypt room there with this giant slit like sloping glass you can look out and there's a cleopatra's needle and there's water in the room and i used to think this was the most amazing room in the world it was just i'd never seen anything like it there was architecture there was historical art and i can visualize it stood with me for forever yeah it's like romantic it's literally i romanticize it in my head i've drawn it like there's pictures from when i was a kid drawing that room um and that always stuck with me [Music] my man how you doing what's going on oh dude i i'm great i'm a little under the weather and i can give you the context on that uh because it's related but um you look great i like your your hair is looking good you look like you just you're either going with the slickback look or you just took a shower let me guess uh that the reason you're sick is because of the the event that you were at yeah yeah that's right much to my wife's chagrin uh yes i i think that is the i think that is the uh the culprit here for sure so can you talk a little bit about that um i think i think people kind of want to hear yeah yeah so for people that didn't have context on this or didn't see it on social or wherever um last i don't know it was like a week ago or so now um hosted an in-person meetup with um our friend sam parr you know host of co-host of my first million and um founder of the hustle which which he sold to hubspot um and basically the whole thing came around in like a pretty funny way but like sam was in new york this summer we were hanging out a bunch um uh you know our wives are friends etc and uh he like texted me one morning and was like yo we should do a meet-up in new york and so i just said yeah cool right like i was just like doing something else i was like alright cool sam yeah and then a few minutes later he's like all right i tweeted it out and i was like what and i look and he's created an eventbrite link that says like sam and sahil meet up it's got my face on it and he's picked a date for it without asking me the date and sent out this whole thing and then literally like you know it was like three weeks in the future and for the like two and a half weeks leading up to the event i'm getting daily texts from sam just being like yo 600 people of rsvp yo 700 people of rsvp'd and i was like dude do we have a venue like i didn't know what the hell any of the stuff was happening for the event like i literally had zero context on it um so in the end we ended up having this event i think in the in total like 1400 people rsvp'd saying they were gonna come to it um these two guys andrew and tops like basically volunteered themselves to uh to coordinate the event found this insane venue in lower manhattan um that we kind of got comped and uh hosted this event like a thousand people showed up dude so i don't mean this to come off the wrong way but i love both you and sam but the fact that you guys could just like tweet and twelve 1200 people are going to show up in a room to hang out with you with no agenda blows my mind today's episode is brought to you by a company and product that has literally changed my life and one that i use every single day i started taking ag-1 in 2011 because i wanted to feel great it's been a staple of my morning routine ever since yeah that's 10 years and 99 compliant i met the ceo when we were training at the same strength training facility way back in the day he had been creating an early version of the product to battle his own gut health issues when he realized how challenging and expensive it was to create an optimal routine on your own i started taking it during those college baseball years and was completely hooked over the years it has kept me feeling on point physically and mentally the best part it fits into whatever lifestyle or diet i'm currently experimenting with from keto to paleo to vegan and more it's a tiny micro habit that you can execute daily that has large long-term and compounding benefits the product has over seven thousand five star reviews and is trusted by a long list of professional athletes and leading health experts i love it they do and i know you will too to make it easy athletic greens is going to give you a free one-year supply of immune supporting vitamin d and five free travel packs with your first purchase all you have to do is visit athleticgreens.com w-i-h again that is athleticgreens.com w-i-h to take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance you won't regret it so first off i think most people probably thought there was going to be some sort of agenda um to sam's credit in the in the uh eventbrite description he was like don't fly in for this event that's too much pressure he was like it will be at least okay but probably not great or something like that and so there wasn't really an agenda um the one thing i will say is like i don't know how many people showed up to hang out with us as much as like to meet us potentially plus get to hang out with each other like you know i said it when i was speaking at the event we did a little bit of speaking and when i said it at the event but like one of the amazing things about a city like new york is that you can go out on a thursday night to something like that for free basically and there's just like there was a thousand other like young ambitious excited people there that were all there because they wanted to learn and and you know and be around other smart people and that was so cool like the you know i called it intellectual chemistry but like the intellectual chemistry in that room was really inspiring to me um it also just left me feeling like we need to do more in-person events again um you know even even us like with you know with our podcast recordings like we need to get back to doing more of these in person because it's just so much fun when you get people's vibes in person um and you start coming together in that way and then my final realization which um kind of ties directly to some of the stuff i want to talk about to you around your guide to startups which we can dive into is like the power of community is really hard to overstate um i i came away from the event saying like man i need to do more um community building on my platform like the fact that i have this newsletter and this twitter is great but there are thousands of people within those communities that want to be interacting with one another um and that i can you know help bring together and facilitate so i need to figure out the right format to do that but there is something really really powerful there i also just want to go do meet ups in like every major city in the world now it's also a testament to people are tired of being in front of their screens all the time so like they see a tweet about hey there's this in-person event and i follow sahil and i follow sam and they're so excited about just actually rsvp rsvping and going um so the same sort of like energy that we saw like uh around digital products in early 2020 you're kind of seeing with irl type products yeah it's a good point i mean we've seen it with some of these different events right like um art basel where we were filming last year like the excitement to be back in person some of these nft weeks that people have had la tech week you know happening right now miami tech week like all of these things i do think the energy around in person um is pretty unparalleled right now so i'm excited to start doing more in person hopefully not you know getting sick from it i don't have covid by the way um but uh but did come down with a little head cold here um so pivoting a little bit um i texted you prior to this episode or maybe like a week ago that i wanted to um dive in on a tweet of yours uh which is kind of like a weird backdrop to a to an episode but this is like it's such a prime uh tweet and thread that i feel like it bears um i mean you could probably write an entire book on this greg someday and so let's do an episode on it we can start with that and if you if you decide to write a book on it i'll i'll hook you up with somebody um but your tweet was it was called my guide to startups um and you know as context everyone knows you um you know probably that's listening to this but you've spent your entire career and life working on bit you know businesses startups ideas etc and so you have um as you said in the tweet you've lost millions hired hundreds raised millions and sold companies all before the age of 30. um and so this is like your guide it's like your hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy for the startup world so what i was hoping we could do if you're open to it is basically go through this and it's it's sort of like a set of distinct principles and i imagine each one comes with some sort of story or experience you had and insight and so i'm kind of hoping we can like dive into um hopefully all of them but but if not you know some of the most salient ones for you and and uh and go from there let's do it all right so the first one on the list is something that we've definitely talked about in the past you said venture capital and pr are like drugs drugs can kill you or save your life use accordingly so i thought that that was really interesting because of the juxtaposition of can kill you or save your life so we'd love for you to just like kick off there and tell me what you were thinking around that so i've seen what let's just talk about vc first i've seen what how helpful vc could be and i've also seen it destroy you know lives and destroy companies um you know the last company i was at wework you know famously is i mean it's the poster poster child for where venture capital could go wrong um you know i joined the company i think i was the thirteen thousandth employee employee in acquisition by the time you know i think it was like four or five months later i remember someone telling me that they were they were already at 17 000 employees so imagine hiring you know a thousand people per month you know it's just so insane it's so insane and i think with vc sometimes comes this growth at all cost mentality um which sometimes works and sometimes you know the wework story obviously doesn't work yeah i mean there was like a during the raging bull market there was um an assumption that you could like eventually make a business model work um and if you just kept growing you'd eventually figure out how to make the unit economics work i think people have now come down to earth and realized that generally that's not the case it's very hard to like all of a sudden find a unit economic model that works um and so to your point like uh that vc like raise at all costs grow at all costs mentality that existed um i think led to a lot of bad decision making along the way um what about the pr one so like pr is like is like a drug what did you mean by that so pr like it feels so good when you're on the you know front page of techcrunch you're on cnbc like it feels really good but it's very fleeting so it's a very fleeting feeling and you know for startups the most important metric as you know is just it's product market fit everything is should be around product market fit um and you know it when you have it um the pr could be helpful like vc in a sense like it's good for like finding new customers or hiring people but uh again it's very fleeting what i had before uh actually i'm remembering what i had before writing this uh that you know vc and pr were drugs i had vc and pr like fast food they taste good while you're eating it but afterwards you're probably not going to feel so good i was feeling i was feeling a little pessimistic on pr and nbc so i removed it and i said you know in some cases pr and vc make sense yeah i like that i mean i i like both of those analogies i do think that the um the thing with pr and with journalists in particular is like it's great when they want to write the positive story on you like great fundraising round you raised all this money like fast that company um you know the one click checkout company like every journalist techcrunch forbes all of them were like touting this is such an amazing company raised all this money it's like growing like crazy it's amazing and then as soon as the company was going under or like challenged every single one of those publications was like dunking on them with like zero regard for the things they'd written previously and so it's one of those like easy come easy go right i mean it's the same thing with venture capital pr and vc um so that's a good starting point you're um your second one i think is the most liked one in the entire in the entire thread and uh it said okinawa is an island in japan with the highest life expectancy it's called the land of immortals the secret almost everybody gardens entrepreneurship is a marathon not a sprint be sustainable find your gardening i love this one because it like it it's so um your vibe and like personality around these things so please uh please speak to this one you know what i did about an hour ago gardened i went and go pick some blueberries from my blueberry tree you know it was four o'clock uh on a wednesday around there 3 30 4 o'clock and i took a break to go outside pick some blueberries eat the blueberries like have a connection with the food like sit look around look at the tree get a little sun on my face i know you talk about that a lot get some vitamin d on your face then come back took a shower that's why my hair is a little wet and here i am and i'm a big proponent like of just you know slow living this is called slow living where you know it doesn't mean that you're not working hard it just means that you're also taking a little bit of time to connect with nature or connect with yourself and be really creative and you know we had a discussion with delian on the pod uh recently and he talked about you know how irl work you know is sort of you know you're not serious unless you're doing irl work and you know that mean that might mean for a lot of people like you know taking the subway into new york takes you know an hour to get to the place and you're you know there's people everywhere and you're catching your colds and and coving and stuff like that and you're you know you're eating you're eating food instead of taking a lunch or eating right in front you know while you're typing an email and i think what we're going to learn is that people who live sustainable slow lives are gonna live longer and that's why i put the story uh yeah about this japanese island i mean this is one you this is probably my favorite one in the whole list because this is something that i have like really viscerally wrestled with both sides of as you know you know like i spent the first seven years of my career in a hardcore finance track where it really was like you know work till you drop 90 100 hour work weeks and like that was you took pride in that now you know it's like delian right like you take pride and that grind and um you know not sleeping and not having balance and but i'm gonna make money and i'm gonna do something hopefully world changing and you know create a bunch of value et cetera um and i i don't i don't know if saw the light is the right answer for it but i definitely have found a a world of a lot more balance and fulfillment um on the other end of this and you know for me like my gardening is taking a walk with my son or with you know with my wife and son just being outside getting sunlight cold plunge like all of these things that i'm doing um now where i've tried to kind of find and strike a balance i would argue were actually productive for um you know my end goals of creating value and so like i i um i've wrestled with both sides of this exact one and i definitely have found uh you know anecdotally that uh this balance lends itself to uh higher feelings of health both physically and mentally um i mean my actual health metrics have improved markedly from from my kind of before state to where i am today like all of my blood blood readings etc are better um and mentally i mean my mental health is way way better than it was right because i'm sleeping more and i you know get to spend more time doing things i love and with people i love um so there's really something to this um and i think the point you're making is is a is a well-made one in that it doesn't mean you have to do what we're doing right like it doesn't mean that you have to have the lifestyle greg has where you know you're really you know moving slowly on things and finding time to death throughout the day and like you know working less and creatively and um or that you're doing what i do and um you know taking five walks a day with your kid like you don't need to do that it might just be that you're in a high crazy you know stress environment but you find that one time a day where you are able to do your quote unquote gardening where you're able to do that one thing that unlocks you and kind of opens you up and so i thought the way you said it was really important because it just means that you need to find time in your daily life for that version of gardening for you to take that like one step that sort of um allows yourself to unwind and to unlock i mean i'm not a religious person by by any means but like the whole idea of a sabbath you know one day a week you turn off your phone turn off electronics you spend time with friends and family i think there's a reason why that you know comes from thousands of years ago because i think we're we're not meant to be in at the 75th floor you know in midtown new york for 18 hours a day uh i don't think that's you know a sustainable way to live and i also don't think that if you're in a lot of people listening are like creative people if you want to be your most creative self i just don't believe that you can be that in that lifestyle yeah um that's a great one let's jump to the next one um or another one rather i'm gonna jump around a little bit here in the interest of time um for most people forget harvard or living in sf with the internet you're more powerful than you think you are learn anything you want connect with anyone you want be anyone you want and do it all hyper efficiently what a time to be alive again something that we've like talked about in passing with different guests on the show curious for like your most recent take on this i mean just yesterday we're in a group chat and a pretty well-known fa fa we're talking about money with a pretty well-known founder i won't name him but um i told him i was like do you want to be 10 times wealthier you want you want me to tell you the secret to being 10 times wealthier because and he's like yeah leave new york city like leave new york city like it's one of the most expensive places in the world to live and that means everything you know food uh rent uh entertainment everything is more expensive and comparisons comparisons are the most expensive [ __ ] thing in the world excuse my language man where you're like because your friend's doing this thing so then you start doing it and you don't think about it and you're not like you know planning to do that thing but when everyone is doing it or when you're trying to keep up with the joneses as like part of your existence um life gets really really expensive exactly so that being said like do i believe that new you know we just talked about new york like you had this really amazing event and there was a lot of value there do i do i i see value there i just think that uh there's so much high leverage work that you can do on the internet by building your personal monopoly posting on twitter posting on linkedin creating a blog post creating a podcast and then do what i did which growing up which was i would go to new york city uh with you know for doses of inspiration i call it doses of inspiration so i lived in a way cheaper city montreal where at the time you know the average apartment was 500 a month and i would drive you know five and a half hours and i'd go to new york city and i'd sleep on a couch and i'd get some inspiration and i drive back and then you know the best part about that is you spread that inspiration to your hometown yeah i mean what you're hitting on is like this powerful point that i mean i think of it as like opportunity playing fields there's that there's that really famous um i don't know if it's a quote or like an adage that um talent is evenly distributed but opportunity is not and traditionally historically opportunity has really not been evenly distributed and what it required was you going to harvard or are you living in sf are you living in new york in order to have opportunity and what you're hitting on is that that is no longer the case you actually don't have to because of the way the internet and the digital age has proliferated opportunity and it's not to say that opportunity is evenly distributed yet but we're certainly closer and you can certainly be a kid um you know growing up in rural india with access to the to the internet with access to discord servers with access to online courses online training etc and you can come up the curve and have the same opportunities hopefully in the long term and in the future i do think that actually will be the case it's still not perfect but it's getting there and i think the last thing that you hit on uh is a really cool one which is like visit go to those places and bring your energy back from those things the things you've learned and bring it back and spread it back to where you are it's like um you know like that that used to happen with like uh with plagues right like uh the plague was spread um uh or sorry the spanish flu was spread after world war one because all the soldiers who had come together and gotten it went all back to their home countries and it spread like the virus spread but the same applies to good things like you can go get energy from these places where you go and come back to your hometown or to where you are and spread that winning um feeling and spread that energy in a positive way um that was a really cool way that you put that i love that um all right a few more from your guide to startups uh and by the way if you have any like absolute personal favorites that i'm not hitting on please jump in and and let me know um all right i'm gonna hit uh let's see how to negotiate well i love this one listen ninety percent talk ten percent listening equips you with the info that you can use the listener usually wins um this is like interesting contrarian advice to me because i always think when i think of negotiating is like you got to be the like you know the negotiator you got to be talking and constantly uh you know constantly saying things so what's your perspective here and what was this what was this guided by like personal experience wise i think who told me this was uh at the time i almost regarded him as my my indian uncle ramsharam i don't know if you know rom no um rahm is like an og silicon valley legend okay he um he sold his company i believe to amazon in the in like the mid 90s he was an executive at amazon he was the first dollar into google and uh sat on the board of google from seed up until very recently [Music] and uh yeah just a prolific investor and rom was sat on a board of a company called stumbleupon and in 20 2012 or 2013 i sold a company to stumble upon and i believe i asked him i was like rom like you know i was 20 i don't know 22 23 at the time i was like how could i have gotten a better deal because i remember when they offered me the deal i was like great where do i sign you know like i didn't negotiate at all it's just kind of like this is amazing like this is gonna change my life and uh rahm said if only you just listened more if you you know you came into that meeting and you were just like pitching pitching pitching and we offered you something and you're like okay and that was it if only you just sat there and let us do the pitching and let us kind of sell you i think you would have gone away higher multiple so since then even though it's sometimes really painful to be in a negotiation and to be silent uh more than you are talking because you're so excited about getting the deal done it's kind of counter-intuitive but it's for me it's been super effective yeah it's like that um epictetus i think that's how you pronounce it the stoic philosopher we have two ears in one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak um it's sort of like the practical application of that idea um i've always called it the paradox of words like you talk less in order to say more um and in those situations i when you said it when you wrote it i was like oh that's different than what i would have thought and then you think about it more and you're like oh yeah that actually is what a great negotiator does they kind of sit back listen and then when they strike they really strike and they have the really thoughtful perspective and the idea so um it uh it makes a lot of sense i love that one i think we've got time probably for one more um before we have uh we have tom come on from archive um which one should we hit uh how about this startup life is a life full of rejection no rejection no progress um what was your big rejection what uh what what what kind of cemented that realization for you well so i feel like there's a whole generation of entrepreneurs that watch the social network and was like this is a romantic basically job i like they basically the social network romanticized entrepreneurship for a whole generation of entrepreneurs like our generation and [Music] it's you know i think uh what i don't like about that movie is it kind of like you see him at harvard there's like a bit of struggle a little bit then all of a sudden he's in san francisco palo alto and like facebook is all of a sudden like big like it you know what scott belski calls the messy middle uh the middle of the startup isn't really there it's just like from small to really big what that doesn't capture is that like literally every day of a startup you're kind of like you check product times in the morning and you're just like i hope a big competitor didn't launch a competing product yeah and every founder is is has that experience of like oh my god google just launched this oh my god facebook just launched this oh my god they're gonna and then you get like 10 texts from your investors hey have you seen this yeah man of course what do you mean have i seen this like i'm literally crying inside you know yeah um so if you're not okay with adversity i just don't think that startup life is for you and [Music] you know i can tell a lot of stories about how like i've gotten rejected over the years but like i'm constantly getting rejected and it's just about being okay with it maybe it's from your dating life [Laughter] on that note uh i mean we do have we have a guest joining um for the latter half of this discussion who is a uh serial entrepreneur also a friend of yours who i think you go you go back a long way with and who's building something super super cool at the intersection of like in real life and web 3. um so it relates to a lot of what we talked about you know the through line of this whole conversation so why don't we go ahead and bring uh bring tom in and uh and we can uh jam with him what's up everybody what's up man hey nice hat i love that i need one now i've got i got my black dad hat i gotta get an archive black dad hat dude when i tell you i've got i've got a lot of dad hats i've also got a lot of logo hats from prior companies i've got i've got walls of uh historical shots on goal [Laughter] well we were just talking actually right before you came on about how uh the ability to like handle rejection is a key trait of successful startup entrepreneurs um any uh any thoughts on that i mean handle rejection is certainly part of it uh i think you almost have to compartmentalize rejection into just like you know a bad conversation you gotta kind of assume that that's going that way i think it's almost the uh i have this kind of thesis where it's kind of like a boxing thought process where most of the time being a founder is like trying to avoid getting punched in the face it's like you can take a lot of body blows so things like people saying no or rejection or you didn't meet the quarterlies or the app didn't show up like ship on time those are like oh you know it's like oh a kidney oh the lower back whatever but you're like probably not going to get knocked out by that but you're really trying to avoid the like like that one that really puts you on the map uh so i think that there's something about resilience there and like get back uppedness yeah i like that i like that analogy a lot like i've thought about this in the past how there's sort of two types of people there's like you know you encounter the like glancing blow in life right we're like you almost get knocked the [ __ ] out but you like somehow you know dodge it slightly like it just kind of is a glancing blow and there's two types of people coming away from that there's the person that is like oh good missed me like i'm good i'm cool and then there's the person who's like why did that happen why did i almost just get knocked out like what did i learn from that what how did i leave myself open to it and you gotta bet on that second person to win in the long run because you just learn so much more from those glancing blow situations if that's the approach you take versus just feeling fortunate for not getting knocked the hell out i mean it's like we're always just going through like repeats of childhood loops right and like if you never fell you probably never learned to walk efficiently if you never missed a shot you never got it became a better basketball player if you like find me the person who's never had has had just a streamlined like tailwind the entire time they're gonna fall hard whenever actual adversity shows up um i think there's something to be said for you know the advantage of having a tailwind for a while and how that probably sets you up for something but adversity isn't the thing it sets you up for so at some point you will be challenged and i think that's yeah that's a tough that's a tough yeah to swallow if you've never really been in that circle or never been in that we're in that ring if i'm going to keep the boxing metaphor rolling yeah yeah um oh hey greg thanks so much for joining man last time i saw you you were at my house at dinner um it was a while ago dude that was when you were uh uh what a gentrifying bay shore i mean that's one way to put it that's you know definitely basically here's here's the story style so i i got a house okay people like to go left i like to go right 100 i'm aware of that um you know i'd like to be alternative for a lot of reasons and i found this incredible house it was amazing it was like it was kind of legendary in san francisco it was in a neighborhood called bay view um which at the time this is 2015 was like no one in technology in our world tom was like spending time there and i kind of made this house like a destination for founders creators musicians artists to come and hang out whenever they wanted and we had some good times there definitely it was a good dinner so i didn't realize until like just before the episode that you guys had gone way back in the day i've like um you know tom i've been kind of following all of your your recent exploits which i want to get want to get deep into but i had no idea you know of all of your um you know your experience as an entrepreneur and all the different things you've done we have a common friend in nate boshard who was the first one who brought to my attention um what you're building with archive but um i mean you've had like a super long career as a founder um sort of uniquely long it feels like i mean you've done a bunch of different things had several experiences like i'm like is this shade i can't yeah no like i mean you've like you just continued to like roll out new ideas new things like what has been kind of the the common thread um through all of this that um you know that's kept you energized clearly masochism and self-flagellation at scale um no uh you know i think i'm i'm like perpetually curious and i think the one thing that's kind of like unique sounds like i'm tooting my own horn or whatever but i really haven't stuck to a genre i like get obsessed with sort of these different sectors so like my degree was audio engineering i started on the music side did like a record label years ago ended up in like you know doing a content management system for freelance web designers that was like a sas business ended up moving that into mobile you know like literally at the turn of mobile doing about 17 iphone apps then went full like operational logistics i ran 100 000 square foot warehouses with omni you know like physical objects on a grid moving bodies bifurcated workforce hourly employees hard tech problems on scale and logistics and now kind of jumping in with i actually think this is the most bullseye on all of those things so this one actually feels somewhat natural like i can track how the different things i've done in all those different places kind of aligns with with archive broadly um but yeah you know every time i get this moment where i kind of have this feeling where i could i could tap out at any time like i i've been around long enough that i could go i could probably join a fund i could probably go to a fang and you know get paid and chill like i you know i could i could manage someone's family office like there's a lot of things i could do if i just wanted to like double down on on like knowledge and capital as a way to you know expand my my time but then something hits someone someone says something in a conversation i'm like oh what if we and i just like i guess i'm doing it again like it and this like i i swear to y'all like i was not gonna do this again you know like you know omni we exited the coinbase right before the pandemic it was two years i'm bouncing around i'm doing a bunch of different things and i was just like huh i kind of get this life i can do this thing and then uh it's like got dragged back in dragged back in and it's like i i don't know i guess there's some like obsession with with doing it i think i have a chip on my shoulder i think i think any second or third time founders who did okay but didn't like crush didn't get the thing you're always like [Music] well i want to do i don't know i want to get there i want to feel that that other wind so i think those things are all a part of it too you know where you place your egos well i i will say like the thing you are doing now is one of the cooler uh startups that i've seen in recent memory and so i i want to get into it because it ties to so many things we've talked about on this on this podcast and more broadly around the entire like narrative and discussion around like actual use cases of web three that are interesting you know there's this like whole meme on the internet right like you have your packies and uh uh you know chris dixon's on one end um you know talking about web3 and writing about it and then you have your like i forget what the names of these guys are like zach weinberg um you know has kind of made a brand for himself as the like michael burry of crypto or like uh that guy leeron shapiro or something like that similarly and um it's like you know it's become this whole thing on twitter like the back and forth and like there's no real use cases etc archive which is what you're building um strikes me as like one of the most interesting use cases that i that i've seen because it combines some of the like super cool aspects of like in real life culture and community with web 3. um and just as context for people who are listening i'm going to have you talk about it but i want to read just really quickly one quote that i found cool from your kind of launch blog post which said quote museums have historically relied on curators collectors and benefactors to decide which artifacts are important and worthy of display as a result the history available for the public to experience is still largely determined by exclusion and not inclusion with that kind of as a backdrop tom can you just give us the um give us the overview on what archive is today's episode is brought to you by a company and product that has literally changed my life and one that i use every single day i started taking ag-1 in 2011 because i wanted to feel great it's been a staple of my morning routine ever since yeah that's 10 years and 99 compliant i met the ceo when we were training at the same strength training facility way back in the day he had been creating an early version of the product to battle his own gut health issues when he realized how challenging and expensive it was to create an optimal routine on your own i started taking it during those college baseball years and was completely hooked over the years it has kept me feeling on point physically and mentally the best part it fits into whatever lifestyle or diet i'm currently experimenting with from keto to paleo to vegan and more it's a tiny micro habit that you can execute daily that has large long-term and compounding benefits the product has over thousand five star reviews and is trusted by a long list of professional athletes and leading health experts i love it they do and i know you will too to make it easy athletic greens is going to give you a free one-year supply of immune supporting vitamin d and five free travel packs with your first purchase all you have to do is visit athleticgreens.com w-i-h again that is athleticgreens.com w-i-h to take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance you won't regret it yeah so i think i think the idea is that we're simply reversing the museum system right and and what does it look like if instead of going to a thing and experience what people are presenting to you you're participating in the experience of what gets presented to the world so you know you remove the confines of the physical walls you don't have to be in this specific space it doesn't have to match exactly where the what the location is you can maximize where objects are placed on a global scale to to to focus on impact um like you know so instead of it saying hey it's impactful because it's within the the confines of this uh this building you can say no it's impactful because it's out in the place where the artist most wanted it to be or representative body of that so if you're thinking it that way you can kind of change the narrative there and then in terms of the way it operates you're going down up instead of top down so you're saying hey i think thousands of individuals at some level have a deep uh it's called the genius of the commons have a deep seated understanding of many different things and when you put them together they actually can create uh with the same degree at some level of curatorial thought and education around why things are impactful and what does that look like if you do it how do you unlock the potential of the masses i've always had kind of an obsession with pop music broadly and this idea that you know like someone can sit in a studio for six hours and make something that a billion people listen to in multiple languages and or just resonate and and how there's always been this like well pop music isn't whatever and i'm like well that's kind of insane like you would like to make something that a billion people resonate with and i think we're kind of doing that we're kind of looking at it from the reverse like could you put something together that because a billion people find it interesting that drives the value and that drives the impact um yeah so that's the that's the overall vision is you know reverse the museum could you could you only because uh sahil brought up um what's his name zach weinberg could you do a zack weinberg take on an archive and can you do a packy mccormick take on archive like how does this succeed like what does this look like if it succeeds beyond your wildest imagination and what does it look like if you know how does it fail sure uh the the the detract so you want me to do my own detractor yeah i'm just curious on it if you want me to totally if you're doing your own detractor you would say by the way i find this hell i do this for all my projects i'm fine to do it yeah that's that's not the problem um if i was gonna be my own detractor i would probably go down this path of saying uh uh does the world need another museum this is just uh random crypto tech people showing up into a space that they've never been invited to on purpose and they're trying to change something that has existed for hundreds of years and then they're throwing a crypto layer on it because that sounds cool um and they want to financialize everything so uh the last thing we need is the financialization of museums uh they should be stand-alone democratized things controlled by uh people who are you know spend the time to do the educational research around them i think that's probably one way um that you could go after it and then you might go down a path of like could you do this with a database or something i think you can try to pull that card the could you do this with a database is the uh could amazon build this of like six years ago it's like anyone will ask you that question and the kind of conversation becomes well could it scale in the same way in different places i think it's probably the zack weinberg take the [ __ ] take is uh you know you open your phone anywhere in the world and it's pokemon go for culture you you you see art on a grid around you that you help participate and curate in the most impactful places at the major in in cities all over the world you now get to participate in increasing the cultural value of those locations as well as the objects themselves raising them to a position of permanence through decentralized voting and community curation and then you're also opening up a sustainable channel for maintaining provenance maintaining curation and maintaining the actual institution and items ability to exist because the financialization on the back end can support preservation and conservation of those things as well so you get to go faster than any building or any museum that was ever tied before and you get to go bigger wider and touch more people and that is what web 3 is all about put it back in the people and put it back out into the world as rapidly as possible i think that's probably the packy angle i thought that was really well done for what it's worth i mean i think the um the interesting thing to me i'm i'm sort of the i don't know if skeptic is the right word i'm like the you know observer the web 3 observer of this of this podcast greg is is more of the bull um and i think the interesting thing to me about this in particular is that it falls into the bucket for me of like how do you envision a world where more quote unquote regular people are onboarded into web3 um and is that possible and if the answer is it's not possible you're gonna have a lot of challenges with web3 because normal people like my parents need to understand it like people who aren't necessarily like techno optimists or or you know technologists and stuff like this um matches that for me where i just think like okay how do you reimagine the museum for the future like forget crypto don't even think about crypto for a minute just say like what does a museum look like if you remove the geographic bars from it if you're like hey i don't need to be in new york city to go to that i grew up going to the natural history museum so many of my like amazing memories yeah with my parents are like going and just staring at the t-rex there for however long that i did that and now you know i live in the new york area and so i'm fortunate that like we just have we have a young son and i'm so excited to get to take him and do that well if i was born in india um you know in bangalore or something and i didn't have access to that what would i do and if you can envision a world where you can like reimagine what a museum is in the context of the fact that we now have technology that enables you to experience these things all over the world and wherever they are it's pretty interesting to just like all of a sudden unshackle yourself from something that was uh you know previously a massive constraint and that's like crypto aside just a very noble mission in my in my view i'll tell you two two anecdotes around that one i'm from new jersey grew up going into the city all the time one of my oldest memories is going to the met and uh there's sort of an egypt room there with this giant slit like sloping glass you can look out and there's a cleopatra's needle and there's water in the room and i used to think this was the most amazing room in the world it was just i had never seen anything like it there was architecture there was historical art and i can visualize it stood with me for forever yeah it's like romantic it's literally i romanticized it in my head i i've drawn it like there's pictures from when i was a kid drawing that room um and that always stuck with me i've also learned uh over time that you know it's kind of odd in some cases that antiquities from other countries and places have been pulled into uh into institutions not where they're from right that a lot of times that is uh the spoils of war or the spoils of imperialism or all these other things there's a lot of nuance in the way museums actually function at scale a lot of times they're soft power representations of political power certainly a british museum for instance things like that so i think one we can we can start to look at it as we don't we aren't really forced to tell a narrative around a stance that is tied to like a government hegemony or something right so we can say if we curated a piece of art from benin it's probably going to go back to benin if we curate a frida kahlo let's put it in mexico city or zihuatanejo it doesn't have to be on display in seattle like just because we have it we can think about impact first at the at a global scale which i think one completely changes the the paradigm on that side and then to your statement around uh onboarding of uh just normal everyday you know people who would participate in anything consumers broadly i do think the first decade of crypto has been largely tied to what it's worth like back end tech which was the same thing with the internet you know you're building out tcp stacks and things like before you could get to aol you had to kind of get everything up and running for that and i would say i think there's two two sectors in that there are people that are that is the way crypto web 3 etc should be it is a purely enabling technology and everything needs to be done on chain completely and that is how it works and then there are people who are more on the side that i am which is i don't think the average person will care at all until it's tied to in person experiences access physical objects things that they can touch feel do like like involve themselves in and it provides actual reasons for being a part of a community or participating so i'm all in on that side um and i think the other one is always a part of it i'm not i don't disagree with the infrastructure but i'm all in on if we want to get your mom to care or someone randomly in bangalore that discovers they'd like to see that frida kahlo it's probably better to figure out how to participate in a large community that can get them there as opposed to just wishing on a star that they can you know go to the denver contemporary so so functionally um is the way that it works that you become sort of like a curator or a patron or what i'm curious what the terminology is that you're using but you become one and then effectively you're kind of like part of the community both in terms of voting on artworks where they are you know all of the governance around that pieces that are being acquired where they're being placed how they're being shown etc and then also that you know in the future call it 10 years in the future as this continues to build out i am on a trip with my family in florence italy and i pop open the archive app or whatever it is experience on my phone and i can see oh there is this piece of you know this old michelangelo work is being displayed at the original place where he created it um here and i can go with my family and say that i was a part of that experience of bringing this and acquiring this piece and it becomes this like much deeper connection that i have with with the with the artwork and with the culture around it i think you sum that up pretty well i think there's two layers on that there is this idea of uh when you tie impact it also can be just impact could simply be the most people possibly able to see it as opposed to a lot of items that you find or at least we're finding are in private collections or vaults or mountains in switzerland like there's a lot of this stuff is just hidden from the world so there's a world in which we're functionally repatriating it out into the planet so that's just going to private collectors saying hey this is a great way to get this out into the world your name can be a part of it you're forever etched in the blockchain as being the original last provenance owner of the item this is a great way to you know put that out there uh i think there is a layer where membership yep when you when the capital that raises from membership goes into the pot which we then vote on how the allocation is that's basically just swapping right so you're swapping ether usdc or however that you you know you you joined into a physical offline asset that has its own value tried to offline provenance and appraisals right so you have that side and then i think there is a pretty core part that we can unlock a lot of other value so we think of it almost as we're creating almost like a cultural perks card where every place one of those objects is we also have somewhat of a bd relationship right so it didn't just show up there if it uh we have a patent for the india computer we'd love that to live at the computer history museum in the bay area if it ends up there most likely we will also negotiate that any archive member gets five percent off at the gift shop for instance there's a lot of other things we can do by every piece of art becomes both a billboard to drive new membership so it's an it's an out of home virality strategy so if you see it and you're not a member scan the qr code tag the nfc this is how you can join and you could have been a part of the curation of this there's most likely a perk that's attached to the membership already from being in that space and you also get this somewhat ego boosting vanity good service feeling that you helped this happen and established there so when you're sitting there with your mom you can scan it and show your name just like you would uh you know the fisher family is all over the the moma sf you know it suddenly it'll have you know bloom right there as you know one of the people that helped to participate in in making this happen so i think there's a lot of good that happens on there it's a pretty virtuous circle and those places now get art like they get stuff that they didn't have to raise grant money for for instance and we don't have opex can you abstract all of the crypto complexity away from for people like that that's the thing that i find always holds back um you know my own understanding or like you know my willingness to really buy into the adoption of something is like ah there's just still so much complexity on the surface but like say you know you you say this vision of like a museum of the future what does it look like a lot of people's eyes light up you say you know here's the experience here's how it's going to be you can be a part of the kind of governance around what we acquire like a lot of people's eyes continue to light up then all of a sudden you say like okay now go send me some e through this wallet address and send it to here and you do this and you know exchange it with a bridge whatever and all of a sudden like you know 90 of the people that were lighting up are like glazed over at that point so how do you do that like how do you abstract that away is that part of the experience today are you planning to sort of abstract that complexity in the future um can you talk a little bit more about that i do think it's mostly abstracted right because the the reason that you're using it the reason that the the the the nft the crypto of it all on the membership side is for a couple reasons one uh it's it means that you can choose when you want to exit so if you no longer think that this is something that is providing value or community or working it's a it's a straight up we're gonna leave and i'm not i didn't invest i didn't i didn't lose this capital i can i can find someone else who's who is is excited about the direction so you can legitimately vote with your with your wallet as opposed to you know if you exited the soho house they're not giving you a refund right so you can determine that this is something i want to continue to participate in um uh and then if you're looking at it from a uh why do you do it in this manner period the art world broadly is unbelievably uh obtuse and opaque you can very the people are building very big businesses simply just trying to data mine what is going on at any time these are the values collections why things are happening in this case we're putting massive transparency on that so again this is abstracted out because all you need to care about is hi i'm sahil and uh i uh you know i'm a member and i voted to be a part of this etc but if someone was going down to look they can literally prove he he did this he voted for this piece he didn't vote for this he's been a member for six months uh here are the other people he knows here's like it's it's taking what's been going on behind closed doors and putting it permanently on chain uh which i think both increases the likelihood that provenance matters which is extremely important in in in art and collectibles and antiquities and it also maintains a steady database some of the way like the library of congress would for for books around why things are and where they're at and so that that changes the whole it sort of changes the whole reason as opposed to just like i've got my membership card and i can i get to scan things you know that's that's one silent the way the way i think about it is very similar to basically what tom's doing is making almost an interactive game in a lot of ways yeah and like when i think of like watching a film which is very like you go to the film you went to a movie theater you watch it and you have like thoughts in your head about the film versus passive experience passive experience versus you're playing fortnight and there or roblox and there's like robux that you're earning and there's this whole economy on top of it and there's other people and multiplayer uh what what what tom is doing and i'm curious your thoughts is uh almost fortnight fortnighting you know robloxing the museum space to make it way more community-owned and uh yeah interactive mean we we truly i mean i use the pokemon go reference a lot but we legitimately do feel like that and we mean that from multiple layers right so if you've ever played pokemon go right you you land in a new place you find out that there's something around you you go and scan it etc we're actually doing that so the act of scanning an item when you go there earns you internal points that increase your your voting weight etc it also functionally maintains the network so there's you have to have a network that shows that the items are where they are and functionally the same way that a validator would do that for verifying a transaction on blockchain you now have humans all over the world participating in the provability that the items are where they are so you can continue to to have functionally a trust network that is not incentivized negatively to prove that things are existing in the spaces and place they are and for that you get to continue to grow within the community and and reap more benefits so there is a whole sort of gamified museum layer there that allows for more interactivity you're really a part of it what are some of the other um projects that have gotten you excited tom um like i'm curious you're building something that strikes me is extremely exciting and um you know i think it like it also just bridges a lot of my interest like when i think about culture and i think about the community angle of what you're doing bringing people together and um the gamification of it as greg just pointed out like all of that gets me really excited and i'm going to message you afterwards because i want to figure out how to get involved personally um but like what are some of the other um what are some of the other projects you've seen or people that are building cool exciting things within within web 3 and in this same kind of vein so uh directly art related i think there's there's quite a few people who are just trying to tackle that problem so just this there's 4k there's a particle i think they renamed themselves today so i don't know their new name but uh there's americana there's a lot of folks coming at this just bringing physical assets online so you can start to to tap into that latent value utility shareability i think there will be an interesting kind of ar layer that comes out of that where people start to experience items in a different manner so all of those are pretty exciting kind of anything that's touching those spaces then uh this is not necessarily nft based there's a there's a company called alongside that's doing like cross network giant index funds i'm personally just a big index fund person like i i don't think i'm i don't have the patience to pick a winner like i'm not a day trader but the idea that you can get a on chain full basket of you know let's say at the top 100 cryptos but not not in a weird like literally provably backing a token and an asset seems like kind of a revolution so i'm um i'm super bullish on them um also candidly three of the founders worked at omni so so it's kind of like i'm backing my my former squad at some layer or people from my team or teams that i've been a part of so i find that super exciting um yeah i have one just like sorry this is gonna this might be like a really simple uh functional question but how does the actual um acquisition process work at archive for a new work like i'm on your website which i highly recommend people go to it's a-r-k-i-v-e.net archive.net um and i clicked into the like the eniac is it eniac or eniac yeah it's idiotic patent yes it's so i clicked into the patent yeah and um you know you've kind of like it's very cool like there's storytelling around each thing that you guys are requiring where you're kind of telling the story of the you know the item that's being acquired etc um but how does it actually work when you guys are acquiring one of these like functionally how is it how am i interacting with it if i'm a part of the community sure so we have kind of we have quite a few phases for how this is all rolling out phase one is what you're seeing right now which is we've brought on a pretty intense set of like vetted curatorial individuals that have access in these spaces so rare book collectors fine art collectors people who've worked at the guggenheim the whitney editors for cultured magazine and they kind of come together over what was agreed on early on in the community they voted on one year theme for the first theme and that theme was when technology was a game changer so every item that was proposed to the community in this this run is tied to this overarching curatorial theme right and so the genesis item there was the patent for the first computer this kind of makes sense if you're now building on a global supercomputer what's the genesis there when was the technology game changer the first major mainframe that could actually outbeat outpace humans at scale right and then every item that's come from that has has has been tied to that some different way so the lynn hirschman liesman lee sin photograph called seduction is looking at the intersection of the female form and objectification through the technology of television so it ties it to there the prototype for the mtv moon man was looking at the convergence of music onto television so playing off of tv again into music and then starting to look at sculpture uh and we're about to announce a new uh a new one that's at the intersection of like digital and and film and video and so that is presented in the community votes in phase two the current plan is that every one of these items that were presented in can now be forked by the community so the community can say i think an object that we should acquire because we now have the moon man is uh the the shoes that michael jackson wore the first time he did moonwalk because that was he won a mtv award for that it's tied to music that's an interesting item and you start to build collections now against the items and that's where so you set this sort of you set the intention at the top from people who are kind of focused on the actual overarching theme and then everyone gets to start forking and voting against that and that is budget allocation that's voted on by the community so we say cool that's great everyone comes together um and picks that out so that's kind of where we're moving into phase two is like extension against it just like you would fork a you know a github project you're going to start forking different things and then as they scale the idea is we we build out guilds so we're sort of mimicking the smithsonian where the the the dao operating side is kind of like the smithsonian institute we're creating content we're putting out the magazine we're doing podcasts we're doing we're finding the artists and putting out twitter spaces with them then the community is slowly forming the air and space museum the uh the portrait gallery etc over time the science museum at scale and then eventually you'll be able to choose to just be a member of one of those if you want or delegate your voting towards you know doubling down and growing those collections etc so we have kind of a strategy for rollout it's going to take probably about 36 months to get that in into a scale of something meaningful but that's basically you join items are presented to you that are kind of incredible you vote and then over time you get to choose what to vote on internally based off of those items in a tldr how do you how do you think about earning you know earning versus buying you know i feel like uh what some of the best projects are doing are having just really smart ways to allow anyone to earn tokens so that because obviously some people can't afford can't afford it so i'm curious your perspective on that yeah i think it's also really critical on our side specifically because a lot of the folks that are joining archive you know it's not like it's we you know they made a bunch of money flipping crypto punks like it's it's trad traditional art folks heavy duty collectors uh academics super curious people that just like love sports and memorabilia and watches but it's it's certainly not like everyone here has a lot of money to go buy art and so we're all coming together to buy art right so one of the things we've been thinking about we have an internal system we call archive points which are not tied to any value they're tied to engagement and interactivity so there's a bunch of things that you can do to earn more points through participation and functionally keeping up the engagement of the community broadly and bringing in great people and that can actually earn you a spot in terms of the ability to vote and participate it may not come with all of the perks of the membership these would be like discounts or anything that comes out of the long-term business relationships but it fully can get you a membership into the museum to help pet your say and to have a voice and to participate so that's one way that we're looking at doing that but i think there's a there's a long way to go on that there also be different tiers so we're thinking about there's a founding membership which is mapping similar to patronage at a museum where like this is the people who were there early their their names are on a brick and then over time they'll be slightly lower voting weight memberships that uh come in at lower price points to get more people in oh cool yeah i was going to ask exactly that and very very cool um so where can people you know like me yeah because i'm going to message you otherwise like where can people learn more about this and sort of um and find a way to get involved yeah so i mean archive.net apply right now um there's a kind of a crazy waiting list i think we're over 2000 people right now and we're only letting in like 30 a week um so it's it's a little backed up um but the idea there is we're being we're being like extremely careful about what it looks like to be a founding member and so there's a pretty like there's a full onboarding process there's a y there's a you know it probably takes five minutes to apply not like just an email we're asking some some like questions that we're interested in understanding what you collect or what you care about what you know where where do you where are you passionate those types of things so we can understand who's joining in um and so that's that's basically step one right now over the next six months there'll be about four more cure like curations on that first collection leading with uh most likely a mint uh for a membership in q1 2023 so that's that'll be you know pretty much an easier way to do it but most likely there'll be a white list based upon members already in the discord so you kind of want to apply now probably would be cool my first statement there well i'm super excited about it i mean i um i said it up front but i'm kind of the cautious observer on most of these things but the way it kind of brings together culture community you know my romantic visions of museums that have now you know been extended from my own childhood to my my son's childhood yeah um i'm really excited to just see you know this reimagination of these old institutions and to your point i had never really thought about you know the idea of where things exist and where they sit in the world being so important here and it really is i mean like it's like the history you know is written by the victors thing right like we can sort of um remap that in a lot of ways and like you know kind of tear down some of the walls of like um you know colonialism and imperialism that i think have largely informed where some of these works exist so um i'm super excited about what you're building man i really appreciate you uh you running us through it i'm excited to see it continue to grow and and hopefully be a part of it if i can make it through your 5 000 person waiting list here soon we'll work on that [Laughter] um well thank you so much man thank you guys i uh am really really excited for you so thanks thanks again for joining and uh look forward to cons to to uh having you on again soon once the uh once the vision gets further along yeah okay could people if you're listening to this could people watch this on youtube so you can see tom's sweetheart and also subscribe to our youtube also your sweetheart style yeah i got my dude i'm actually gonna i gotta sell a small batch of these intellectually curious dad hats that i got made so um i don't have them you know luckily they're drop ships i don't have like 5 000 of them sitting in my garage but um but i am going to sell a bunch of these i'm going to start giving them away to people that uh that refer enough people to my newsletter too see always an opportunity man

so i sat down and thought about it and did a lot of reading and i'm i had this moment where i started not being able to sleep because i realized with the nexus of the fastest pace of adoption of an enormous numbers of groundbreaking technologies at the same time so this is not early stage stuff that we hear about this is stuff actually happening right now that's going to go from you know 100 million people to 4 billion people in the next decade and a half and that i was like okay what are these and simply obviously cryptocurrencies one blockchain technology um artificial intelligence robotics space um ev um internet of things genetic sciences you know none of these are new until you realize they are all metcalfe's law models and when you add metcalfe's law on top of metcalfe's law you get reed's law which is even more truly exponential so then i realized okay humanity is going to go through the biggest change of technology and technological change because of exponent exponentiality we've ever gone through and it's already breaking the fabric of society [Music] what's going on it's been one of those days and it's only just started oh no i hate i think i was at my desk at 5 00 a.m this morning trying to clear why what's going on just busy just busy lots going on yeah we're gonna have to we're gonna have to get into that i'm uh i'm excited to see you man i feel like it's been a long time since we've uh when since we've caught up so if this is even just an excuse to get to chat and see your face yeah excited and see your lovely background yeah i will take that as a win so great too uh great to have you on the show man and um so much we were excited to dig into but uh very very thankful for your time i know i'm really excited this is gonna be fun so just for the listeners because i think this is funny background and greg i don't even know if you know this story um raoul and i uh go i i'm gonna say way back it's not technically way back but it feels like it's been ages and ages since this but you know i'm like sitting in my house in california stuck at home during lockdowns this is like call it july 2020. and i just started on twitter and i'm like you know writing a few threads and doing some like really like finance explainer stuff and i had a few thousand followers and i thought i was famous i had like i don't know 5 000 followers and i really thought i was famous and someone likes my thing that like has you know 150 or 200 000 followers and i was like holy who is that and i look and it's like this guy rao paul and i've been following him for a while and seeing you know he's putting up all this great finance content real vision i was a subscriber and i had um you know religiously read especially during all of the turbulence of covid was like just learning a lot from that environment and you know trading on some of it like it was just really fun and i was learning a ton and out of the blue uh rau reaches out to me we connect for a quick chat and he tweets out something like that sahil bloom is putting out some of the best educational content on finn twit you should follow him and my twitter i think i went from like 5 000 to 25 000 overnight from morale just recommending me and i still to this day credit him with like he was the jump off man like i needed that one kick uh because then i like i feel like i've taken that and uh and rode that wave for a while now so thank you sir uh for all that you've done for my life that's all about doing good for each other right we are a community after all if we treat each other well life is much easier yeah you put sahel on the map yeah exactly i'm sorry that's all i can apologize to everybody that's true we have to get these drunken whiskey tweets on a sunday and stuff that's true man there's probably some people like the thread haters out there are probably pissed man they're gonna be coming after you now we're all gonna have the the anonymous before we get into anything kyle i saw your last thread you got like what 70 plus thousand likes like a hundred hundred thousand man i've never seen that before in my life wow yeah and i didn't even do a single chrome extension or excel tip in it bro what was it which one was it um razors you wrote it i tweeted yeah yeah yeah why did it go so viral um i don't know man i mean like honestly it's kind of funny right like 75 of that was repurposed content that i'd written in the past so it wasn't like it was brand new um i don't know kind of a good hook and sometimes things catch on i don't i noticed recently that there are just things that i see on twitter that are way more viral than i've ever remembered things going like i saw someone that did an excel thread recently that had like 300 000 likes and i remember like back in the day on twitter if you got like a few thousand likes on something that was bananas like that was super viral but now i think i don't know whether the algorithms change or like what's getting prioritized but man it's um it feels different well i've never had 70 000 likes yeah you'll be all right i'm not worried about you um can we just start there's there's so much that i want to get into and a bunch of rabbit holes around the exponential age and your thesis there and web3 some of the cool you know new business stuff you're building there but can we start with just like your path because you have a really interesting story you know coming from not dissimilar to me like a traditional finance background you were at goldman sachs which is like as traditional as traditional finance comes um what led you to deciding to leave and sort of going down this path as an entrepreneur um you know at the time that you did so my first step of leaving goldman was realizing i didn't want to be at goldman is that you know i it's not me i love goldman sachs for many things probably the world's greatest network to be truthful and you're around some of the smartest people in the world but you're confined you're confined in how you are what you do in a way that you know i just knew that wasn't me i've always been quite individual i like to do things differently um and so i saw the recession coming in 2000 and i wanted to trade it you know i've been lucky i've been it's been like being taught acting by robert de niro and al pacino and whatever because i got to speak to the world's most famous hedge fund managers all day you know paul tudor jones and louis bacon and stan drucker miller and yeah you name it so i thought you know i want to give this a go and so i went to luckily you know one of my my biggest client in fact hired me which is glg partners which was a giant hedge fund firm in london time ended up turning into man group um and i started a macro book there and after about three months of doing well three six months doing well they said well listen why don't we start a macro fund um so i co-fou co-ran it with another guy called ben gill and we started that fund and and built that one up but over that period of time it was much more entrepreneurial glg was a great place i was losing my mojo with macro a i didn't have a great year in my last year there wasn't disaster it wasn't great but it's it's how the industry had changed it had gone from being this gunslingers high volatility long-term conviction world to asset gathering low volatility lower returns and that was the rise of the pension funds in insurance companies piling huge amounts of money in the space and they said we don't want 15 20 volatility and we're prepared to not have 30 plus returns in great years or or more what we actually want is to look more like a bond plus we want six percent volatility and we want eight percent returns and i'm like that's not my game it's just i don't enjoy that and i could see that was the death of the industry because it was forcing people to be sure to determine their time horizons so macro paul trudeau jones told me a great thing was what makes a great investor in his mind is somebody whose idea horizon matches his trade time horizon right a lot of people think oh the dollar's going up over the next six months or two years and they trade in and out of it or the opposite is true is they they're short-term traders by nature because they have to be at this monthly p l and every position basically gets reset every month because your investors go why did you screw up last month they don't look at where you bought something and where you sold it in the industry unlike vc in the hedge fund industry it's where you were marked last month yeah it's mark to market so it's crazy so what it means that everybody's time horizon is this two week to two month time horizon yet your idea horizon because it's macro is is in economic terms which is 18 months or so you know to go from peak economic cycle to trough recession that's a two and a half year thing and it gets interesting to trading for macro for about an 18 month period but you can't do it so i'm like this is useless so i kind of defiantly left and decided to opt out of the rat race and move to spain because quality of life was something that always mattered to me a lot because you were in london you were invited before okay yeah and i thought what's the whole game for if it's not for quality of life i mean money's just an output but the the real the real thing that you're actually working your balls off for is quality of life so um so i moved to spain and i realized that i've had a lot of experience in macro versus most and i had also learned how to write i was writing at goldman we had this group chat that was very early group chat days like an aol group chat thing that i used to run for the whole firm and became very well known for it so from the chairman down everybody read my stuff and then i wrote an article um after a business trip to china when i was at the hedge fund called the something wrong in paradise when i turned up to china to expect to see all this you know all the amazing stories i was reading and getting from analysts and turned up and there was just empty buildings after empty buildings and i'm like you and you and carson black and i'm like oh my god this is a disaster so i wrote it all up and i think stan drucker got seven copies and so i realized that if something like that could go viral and i knew how these guys spoke and i knew how they thought i should write research so i can stay in the markets myself and invest but also have my hand and so just by word of mouth global macro investor grew from goldman sachs and glg backing me saying yeah we'll definitely sign up to the world's most famous hedge fund managers family offices sovereign wealth funds and everybody else so that was the first stab at being entrepreneurial and do you think just to pause you there for a second i mean do you think um that insight that you had a unique ability to sort of abstract all of the complexity around these things that were happening um was that just was that um sort of practice like was that you know bruce lee like you know 10 000 practice kicks on a single kick or was it something you just had you feel like innately i'm a very visual person so i distill everything into imagery so which is why macro so appeal to me because macros is massive 3d always changing map of the world of all the asset classes how they're interrelated the economies and the news flow and i found i can hold it my head and i can kind of spin it around and look at it and take different component parts aside and and therefore you can simplify if you can if you can make a picture of it and so i just create that mental picture for others because most others struggle to see the connections to see how this could be people can think one step ahead but people don't think two and three and two and three is where i'm pretty good at which is longer term knock-on effects how this is going to play out that doesn't mean i get all of them right but i've been consistently pretty good at that over time and i can explain it to people in a way that they understand it and can grasp it whether they disagree or agree i mean again that's the beautiful thing about global macro investors i've had people who barely ever agree with me and they've been subscribers for 18 years do you think that the hedge fund industry i mean you mentioned a little bit of like the structural shift that you saw happening with people becoming asset aggregators rather than you know real investors or traders and um you know that coming from the pension funds or the insurance companies piling money and their preferences around volatility and time horizons etc um do you think that it is i mean super difficult to be truly long-term oriented as as a hedge fund today as a result of that change like do you think that most of the hedge funds out there today are just focused on the really short term and they have to have really short idea horizons for that reason i'll probably give you an exact number zero um i lie there's probably chris benodi there's there's like two or three basically that's why they turn into family offices because you can't play that game the best investors i ever saw the best investor i ever solved bar none was nick roditi who used to work for george soros and he was the you won't find much on the internet i can see you guys he is super secretive and i he came across my time horizon but in 1991 he was the highest paid man in england and everyone was like who the hell is this guy and he lives above a shop in hampstead high street which is a suburb of london and became legendary um and i got to meet him but he was legendary at goldman and other investment banks for how he traded i mean he was a polymath so he knew in depth about more things than you and i even know exist um and incredible and nick was an older gentleman from zimbabwe or rhodesia at the time he didn't have a bloomberg screen he used to read the ft there would be grandfather clock ticking when you go to his office he would throw out analysts who turned up who weren't prepared who didn't know their stuff in depth but when he took risk he took obscene risk obscene long-term positions um you know if you read anything by stan drucker miller um and george soros they're like no no nick's the guy because nick could see the world in ways that others couldn't see and have the conviction to have enormous leverage so nick was the guy who'd have the 300 up here but nick would be the guy who'd have the 40 down year but he was astonishing i never forget him calling up the the futures guys at goldman and said he bought a ridiculous position german bund futures super leveraged and he called up like four weeks later after putting the trade on he goes those bund things i bought where are they now and the guy goes well nick let me just check well they've kind of gone quite a lot against you he goes oh that's unfortunate i didn't realize that i tell you what let's just double up shall we puts the phone down i mean astonishing but the depth of his knowledge i went into talk i launched a hedge fund an agricultural hedge fund i went talking about agriculture and nick was is so amazing is firstly he's listening to my thesis and he goes oh that's interesting well because that reminds me of a paper that was sent to me i think in 66 let me just get i haven't seen it since then he remembers this paper he like takes it out dusts it off it's somebody's phd tape paper on crop yields i'm like wow and i said how are you interested he goes you know i'm not really interested in your fundraise because i've got these positions on myself he said you know it's really interesting because i took my wife and we we hired a plane and we flew across ukraine and all of the soviet breadbasket just to see what the fields look like the wheat fields where the borders lie he said i all then took my wife in a car and drove across the midwest because i wanted to see what the cornfields were like and the wheat fields and how it felt in the sky i'm like so so he would do this kind of work yeah how are you going to compete against that guy you come no chance it actually lends into a into a conversation that greg and i were having recently just around like really like investor psychology and really like psychology of trading and and investing and especially recently i mean greg it came up because one of our good good friends who i won't name who's very smart objectively um told us that he had sold all of his equities um like a couple weeks ago like the market had like it was literally the bottom like the local bottom well he you know he texted us on one day and was like i just sold everything um and kind of like played out his rationale which like you could convince yourself the logic was smart um but when i was looking at it i was like that's super dumb you know like you're outsmarting yourself on something so can you just talk a little bit about like what your observations have been from a career in this of investor psychology where people screw up you know avoiding fomo um how you've been handling the recent you know volatility in markets et cetera i wrote a whole piece on this this is the best instruction i gave firstly i advise everybody if you're trying to trade longer term which is where i think the alpha is the real outperformance is because everybody's time horizon is short you should be long and i i set up gmi to prove that and i've proven it over 17 and a half years i got a registered you know public track record for gmi members over 17 years that's basically proven that exact point so here's my example oh yeah so write it down and every time you're going to try and sell something or change your position ask yourself has something changed versus your thesis so a lot of people their thesis change they hold on to the position because they're emotionally attached we've all done that or the other one is you get spooked out of something and you forget your thesis in the first place and then you're like then it goes back and you're like sure i've missed it so let me tell you my crypto investments my bitcoin investment story because it highlights it the best because i just recently went through the maths of this and i kind of shocked myself so i first invested i first heard about bitcoin during the european crisis in 2012. i realized that this is solutions a lot of the global financial system and i wrote the first macro strategy piece on bitcoin probably ever published in global macro investor in 2013. and it was driven by a friend of mine emil woods who's um is very well known in space and chad cascarello who were global macro investor subscribers saying listen you need to look at bitcoin so i looked at it they happened to have started an exchange called it bit which is now paxos and i ended up um buying bitcoin and i stuck a decent size in because my analysis was it's at 200 now if i back out the analysis versus the stock to flow of gold this is worth a million dollars with the gold at these current prices therefore it's underpriced i hadn't figured out anything else about network effects but i kind of understood that this was potentially important and i assumed that it would go to zero so my downside was 200 my upside was 999 000. um you know blah blah blah and then i said i assume that i am a total idiot which i try and assume most of the time and therefore i'm 90 wrong so if the upside is a hundred thousand and it's 200 it's the best risk award any of us will ever come across in our entire lives and maybe one of the best wrist rewards of all time so i took that bet right macro thesis did the work said this is probably a 10-year play and i'm gonna hold it so first thing that happens i put the position on it goes up a hundred percent i'm sorry it goes up 100 a month and 500 in the next four months i'm like holy um i don't sell any because i've got a long-term thesis and it's fresh in my mind it then falls 85 but luckily back to my entry level so it gets back to 200. i don't do anything because i had a long-term thesis and then i kind of forgot about it and then 2017 it starts coming to life again and it's starting to scream higher and now it's at 2000 or 2200 and i'm like okay i'm up 10x which is good my thesis obviously was a lot more but i've forgotten that because now the forking wars had started and i suddenly thought is this existential is this the s curve moment uh where it fails so i sold it um it went up another 10x to 20 000. i didn't worry about that because i'd made 10x and it was okay it was a good trade and i was worried that it wasn't going to be able to play out my thesis because of these forking walls and then it fell 85 i wasn't in it and eventually i got in in april 2020 and i can't remember my average was call it 6800 or something and then i'm still long and then you know rotated into eath and i did other stuff but anyway so great trade the best trade of my life i went back and looked at if i just kept my initial investment at 200 bucks i would have done i can't remember that i'm five times better even though the size that i added in march 2020 was massively larger than the first size interesting still didn't work i'm like huh and then i thought okay if i'd actually followed my thesis which is when it gets very oversold and it gets to that kind of logarithmic the bottom the two standard deviations oversold of a logarithmic channel or whatever if i don't actually just doubled my position every time but not doubled it sorry just added the same amount as my initial seed investment i'd have done like 25x i'm like okay so what i thought was a great trade was actually a terrible trade because i didn't trade my plan and i didn't think about what i was trying to achieve so that's leading the question about okay the market sell off now i'm immensely comfortable because i see the network adoption i've got even more models to understand how this space works i see how broad and deep the talent the adoption the kind of conversations that greg and i have with people all the time you know it's like seeing the future so therefore the volatility now i've been adding as fast as i can scraping the sofa for coins anything to put more money in what's the optical effect that's actually quite hard is once you've had a big gain then it's you even though it's come off a lot it's still a reasonable amount of money and you don't have that much capital available to double it up and it doesn't feel like your position is getting much bigger and i'm struggling with this right now because you know i'm increasing like like 10 or 20 because i don't have the cash to to do that but if you're the benefit of having income by the way like you you and i've talked about this real is like having income and having a source of income around this is a big driver of allowing you know greg you and i have talked about this like it's great because your positions can be down but i can go dollar cost average into things at lower prices because i have income every month and if you don't if you're just a trader um and that's what you're doing day to day that's really hard to double up but what advice what advice do you have for for staying sober basically and what i mean by sober is yeah because i don't say sober a lot but you know what i mean not like getting you know doing substances but you know for example when everything starts you know when there's a drawdown there's a massive drawdown even if i have a you know this thesis that let's just say you know a very strong thesis it it feels like you know it's a sunny day and it's starting to get rainy and then if you think about it too much i find it's easy to have narratives in your head which is you know what you know this you know open c volume is down maybe you know ethereum isn't the play maybe i should move it to here like how do you how do you maintain your because i've got a big picture framework that is robust and tested and is deep i've done a lot of work on it so i feel comfortable with the probabilities now i love markets like anybody else so i've got on my screen the real time chart of eth daily weekly monthly and hourly i don't even trade eve i just buy it but i like the market and i look at the price action and what i do what i did the whole period was just didn't look at my p l so i have learned and this is a new thing for me how to disassociate myself with my p l because if not you're always thinking peak to draw down or look how much it's worth now as opposed to how far are we along in my thesis let the numbers take care of themselves over time it's i'm learning that because you know this is a hard one to learn on because the volatility is so high but you know i've done it similarly i mean i had a very strong view in 2012 about the us dollar and the euro i was living in europe's billing in euros you know gmi was based in euros i was living in spain and i thought based on a bunch of work that i'd done that the dollar was the euro was going to fall over a long period of time and it was going to fall to 85 cents 82 cents was my target and has been my target since then so i took all of my savings which was a reasonable amount at the time and stuck it all into dollars then to force myself not to trade it i bought a um i bought a couple of properties one in cayman and a small place in miami um in dollars so i couldn't therefore and i was now in the trade properly and i changed the billing of global macro investor in dollars and that was a phenomenal bet because that was at 148 and a half in the euro still hasn't got to my target but it was there you know so i've done it once but that was easier this one uh bitcoin's harder otherwise i don't tend to have run so many really long term massively volatile positions my positions are normally six months to two years do you think being where you are be it in the caymans being in spain basically not being in london in new york helps you massively everybody's got too much of an opinion the only opinion you need to listen to is yours you just you hear other people's opinions you test your thesis but so many people just flip flop around because somebody who sounds smart came with a opposing thesis and it scares them or makes them bullish we're all subjects that we're all humans but yeah getting out of london in new york is immensely useful that's a great point because i i have often felt this and i you know it's not as much a geography thing for me as it is like a circles of contact or friends thing where like like greg we have a group chat of a bunch of quote unquote smart you know tech oriented people um who are all generally invested in you know crypto tech growth stuff etc and the dumbest trades i've ever made the dumbest investments i have ever made objectively are things that i ended up getting like uh you know uh pressured into from that like smart group chat collectively we've lost millions collectively yeah i mean like yeah we've destroyed so much alpha in that group chat like it's sort of an ongoing joke in the group chat that like one of the qualifications for being in it is that you have to destroy alpha um you know like there was a time i actually didn't get into this one but there was like a whole long period in 2021 where everyone was like apping into zillow and every time it was down 10 someone would be like oh man this is the future of real estate i'm doubling up and then everyone would double up on it and then it would go down another 20 percent people are like i mean i think there are people in the group chat down 80 on zillow stuff and now here's the worst thing maybe their thesis is right yeah but most people will have got out of the trade or got bored because their hundred grand is now worth ten grand they'll care anymore it's so hard to trade your way out of that man i mean really really hard if you're gonna like then sell it and try to work your way back it's just not gonna happen but it is it's a great point on like i think of it of um i call it like the tragedy of expertise or something like that where um you almost outsmart yourself like the i actually looked recently at my portfolio um and like my five-year returns and the the um like smart investments i made like things where i thought i had edge or some sort of insight that was going to make it you know beat the market have underperformed the dumb dollar cost averaging i did into uh s p 500 bitcoin and eth um like dramatically underperformed all the smart things i did it was like me buying every monday into the like three you know a couple of things that i just know are gonna go up over the long term dramatically outperformed um and that is just like if if that's not a sign to me then i need to stop doing the smart things and just like be dumb and just enjoy it embrace it i don't know what else is yeah you know all you need there's a hack to all of this is all you need is a secular trend try not to be the smartest person in the room try to be dumb where is the obvious direction over time because the obvious direction over time is where you'll make the most money you can get smart around the bets there but the obvious direction of the adoption of crypto assets is that it's going higher now that adoption rate slows and speeds up over various periods of time so you've got a tailwind which is amazing right why does the s p 500 outperform um value in stock picking well because 86 million millennials a dollar cost averaging into a 401k so you don't need to start if you look at the global economy which is the most obvious global economy in the world that you want to be long or for the next 15 years 20 years it is without question india why because they've got 1.3 billion people an average age of 28. you haven't even hit the demographic sweet spot which is that 30 to 50 range right so all of these things are around everywhere i mean you know the bond market has been an amazing trade for me my entire career because it's been bloody obvious it's in one trend and i still don't think it's broken i know everyone's arguing but i've argued this for the last 12 15 years when people say yeah it's going to break and everything's changed i don't think it has because of debt and demographics these are secular trends trade the second trend is much easier than something else it's like you know is tesla the best car company in the world doesn't really matter but ev is where money is corralling and the rate of innovation and adoption of what he's doing is still high so you know esg that's going to be a mega trend it doesn't don't care if anybody agrees in the trend and the mandating of it but everybody's mandated to do it in europe so all of the money goes into to esg so there's another tailwind for you and that's going to go on until we get change the energy equation and the war with russia accelerates it i think it's it's in its trade it's trade secular trends and it's also built in secular trends correct um so for example i'm happy you brought up india i heard recently from biology actually on the tim ferriss podcast that he said that the majority of the english-speaking internet will be indian exactly that is on my evernote in front of me because we've just started real vision india um and it just struck me as something immensely powerful based exactly on the same demographic consequence of having what 300 300 million people are english-speaking of the middle classes in india that changes that changes the fabric of the internet fundamentally and once i i haven't been able to sleep since i've heard that basically because i was like this changes this changes everything i don't think enough people realize it and there's for me greg it struck me i'm not you know as you know i'm half indian i mean i i'm a huge india bull and i had not got that simple so this is somebody who's clarified a whole complexity i could speak for hours about india and what they're doing and the everything else he's distilled it into one point that is so prescient that it kept you up at night say it one more time just for clarity soon the majority of the english-speaking internet will be indian yeah so and he explains in apparent in a little bit after that is that the conversations you have online the highest probability is that they will be indians they will not be americans they'll not be english they'll be europeans they'll be indians and i'm like wow what he's saying is the future of the internet is indian and that's the indian diaspora both at home so sahil you're part of that as well uh the indian diaspora um at home and abroad and with india i think we can include um pakistan and bangladesh the indian subcontinent so i mean the diaspora in the us is taking over the bloody world and everyone's like wow why is there so many indians i mean virtually everybody wahara real vision is a bloody indian now it becomes a joke why because there's enormous numbers of indians i'm dwarfs everybody else you so this all reminds me like when you talk about secular trends you talk about these big picture things i think a lot about josh wolf who i think is a mutual friend of ours rowell as well and you know his whole thesis around directional arrows of progress and that's always really resonated with with me is like you don't need to pick the exact thing but just figure out what the directional arrow of progress is and trade invest in build in that um you wrote a piece recently for gmi about what you call the exponent exponential age um can you just talk about that like what does that mean to you what are those big secular trends that you're seeing that people should should be paying attention to yeah it's i mean after writing it i realized it wasn't quite so revolutionary because obviously people like kathy wood have been doing it and people like um the guys at scottish mortgage um trust that most people don't know of that probably the best heck managers in the world um have been doing and basically i i just stepped back and i was like okay i'd seen that if i divided various assets by the central bank balance sheet over the period we're having big monetary printing in 2021 um or 2020 i realized that there's only two things that outperform the fed balance sheet over the last since 2008 only two asset classes one was technology stocks and the other was crypto and that stopped in my tracks i'm like why technology stocks and then i i realized that these were also network adoption models so that got me thinking about okay here's a secular trend i i'm not i'm missing right because i was one of those people who think that all vcs are idiots this is a stupid over-hyped ridiculous thing and obviously clearly wrong but macro frameworks don't work very well because they tend to be mean reverting often some people got it stan dracula got it a while ago and a few people did so i sat down and thought about it and did a lot of reading and i'm i had this moment where i started not being able to sleep because i realized with the nexus of the fastest pace of adoption of an enormous numbers of groundbreaking technology at the same time so this is not early stage stuff that we hear about this is stuff actually happening right now that's going to go from you know 100 million people to four billion people in the next decade and a half and that i was like okay what are these and simply obviously cryptocurrencies one blockchain technology um artificial intelligence robotics space um ev um internet of things genetic sciences you know none of these are new until you realize they are all metcalfe's law models and when you add metcalfe's law on top of metcalfe's law you get reid's law which is even more truly exponential so then i realized okay humanity is going to go through the biggest change of technology and technological change because of exponent exponentiality we've ever gone through and it's already breaking the fabric of society right that's clear and just to make sure every listener understands um the point you just made there metcalfe's law is basically like the under uh uh the underpinning of network effects which just says um you know a network's value is uh i guess what it technically says is that a network's value is equal to the square of the number of users in the network but more simply more users equal more value more users and more interconnection between the users right because more users is not is not a network it's a pre it's a it's a potential network yeah yeah once you start building on top of the network you know what is the value that the mobile phone networks have actually created if you think about that not making phone calls but what got built on top of it you know this kind of stuff right and when you you know and mobile phones and that technology has been a reid's law example because you you have the in the uh mobile phone technology then the computing technology goes on top the software technology goes on top of that and before you know it the whole thing goes like ridiculous um so we're about to go to the largest change humanities ever gone through we're not dealing with the change already you can see it all over twitter there's people so distrusting of change and fear of change and you know moving away from good old my mustang and moving to a tesla that just seems like it's a political opinion now you know the whole thing is is is all about the fear of change so i thought about this and so i can say i know it's tearing society apart and it will continue to do so because humans don't deal with change at this speed that's all most species don't so i thought what do you do about that how do you change the mindset of this the obvious thing is to embrace it because then it goes from being something you fear to something you'd be excited about and if you understand network adoption models it means it should be incredibly lucrative to embrace it financially by investing in it so i started building a broad basket of stuff um that basically captures the direction yet directionality of these mega trends you know gaming metaverse they're all part of the same ludicrous change that none of us if we come back to this conversation in 15 years time well a we won't be doing overzoo you know i mean i i i can't even get my head around the changes much like none of us got the head around the changes when we first saw the internet and like yeah once you first saw something in about 96 no way we thought we'd be doing this 20 years later what do you think we're uh could you paint a vision of what internet metaverse might look like in 15 years look everything is converging it is converging on the singularity once you see all of this stuff there is no other outcome now whether that's man enhances machine or machine enhances man is going to be the big debate of 20 30 years time but everything is going to be digitized we're seeing it it's the mega trend right if you step back what is the megatrend everything and i explain this to people they don't get it but electricity is about to be digitized that is what this whole revolution is about the whole esg revolution is going from using these physical fossil fuels to using atoms or energy that exists and basically digitizing it so once you do that the cost of anything that gets digitized goes to zero it's one of the most powerful forces the world has ever seen so what does the world look like with near free electricity oh okay that means something different that we're not constrained by cost of energy so what possibilities does that allow for computing power what possibilities does it allow for travel what possibilities allow for technology i have no idea but it's coming whether that's 15 years time or 30 years time it is definitely coming so all i know that we will be living in a more and more digital world and the metaverse is just the expression of that like this i always explain on these calls this is a metaverse experience right this these are digital renditions of ourselves with digital renditions of our voices yeah all of this stuff this is basically the start of of what a metaverse is and it'll all come together but also on the flip side means that nature probably trades at a premium if you're living all over your life you know how difficult it's been for us all how incredibly productive and useful it's been to be able to operate on zoom and how it gives you a headache you're exhausted by the end of the day and all of that stuff because you're not interacting with nature the outside people and stuff like that so i think nature probably trades at a premium which is an interesting concept that um i've been kind of getting through my mind with this so the answer is i don't know what the world's gonna look like but i know that all of these things they're all going to one point like i used to say that crypto macro with these two tracks that we're going to meet at the next recession then it happened these tracks obviously meet at the singularity which is a horrifying terrifying concept you know and this is going to sound batshit crazy but i think you are the right people to float it with is and i'm not a elon musk you know fanboy although i'm incredibly amazed at what he's done he's going to mars if he can and everything he's doing is for that if you step back i've not i've not even written about this yet if you step back and look at all of the things he's doing they're all for the same thing i i actually think the boring company is not about digging tunnels under los angeles i don't think gives a i think it's because the only way of inhabiting mars is underground this is why we bring you onto the pod this thing you know spacex doge right people just don't understand his fascination with doge do you understand what he's doing and again this is not me elon musk the greatest man in the world he tells you this but nobody listens what is doge doge is likely to be his currency what does that mean it's still decentralizing some method not hugely so but yes he's a large stakeholder in it but i'm guessing he'll use it as streaming payments for his cars why would he not and i interviewed somebody from nasa a guy called leon alkali incredible guy he's now got a vc in space stuff i got him on real vision he blew me apart i had no idea how advanced space was he's like oh yeah well we're setting up server farms in space because we don't want to beam down the because it's too expensive to send down the data and back up again and we need a streaming payment system we need a streaming payment system in space now there's no sovereignty in space get your heads around that there is no sovereignty so you can have your own system of currency in space so then if you think about okay why the robots that he's building well somebody needs to go and do the work in mars to build why even and this is maybe wildly off track but look at the cyber truck if you can generate solar power from mars which i believe you can why would that so why would that cyber truck not be a perfect vehicle for moving around mars now i don't know about the uh the uh gravitational components but i think it's decent enough but i don't know but there's a lot of these things that i've looked at and then if you've seen the the the whatever the mind thing that you know that's singularity stuff the idea is maybe as humans you can't colonize miles on your own and you have to do it with the robots but and even if um even if i'm wrong on this the point being that you made before sahil i'm not directionally wrong ask josh wolfe ask the people at nasa ask anybody in the space industry i'm not directionally wrong it is um and it's coming faster than anybody thinks yeah it's uh it's one of those things um i forget dorne bush's law which is like it um you know it takes longer than you ever expect but then it happens faster than you ever thought it could have happened um once it starts and i feel like we're at the point now where it has started so um so here's the thing i didn't know again everyone should go to that real vision interview i think it's on my exponential age interview series with a guy called leon alkali it will completely blow your mind so he's like well do you understand that we're all fighting over who's gonna get the dark side of the moon and we're worried that the chinese have got there why do i care about the dark side of the moon he goes oh you don't get it do you i said no he said the gravitational pull of earth is massively reduced so we can launch rocket ships further into space i'm like oh and he goes oh we're also already sending up refueling stations into outer space so we can send rockets further i'm like really he's like oh yeah he goes i've got an app that i've invested in which is for a million bucks you can send a satellite up yourself from a phone from a phone app to like universities or anybody and he says and the costs are going to collapse it'll be 10 000 bucks for you know to send your own satellite up they're 10 square centimeters i'm not really and he's like oh also you know there is a race to build a base station on the moon i'm like why does anybody look at the moon it's uninhabitable he goes no it's because we can put um 3d printing on the moon to print rocket chip parts and again we lower the gravitational pull it's much more energy efficient i'm like oh wow okay i said how far are we away from having this he goes oh probably next 10 years we'll have a base on the moon and probably a private sector base he said we could think artemis we can then mine asteroids and we will be you know we're already looking at doing that and we're looking at i'm like you know we are so far behind in our narratives that we're arguing whether you know ev should be adopted meanwhile this shit's going on it's it's this is how fast it's happening i mean it goes to you said this earlier rallies um you know like when the constraints change or dramatically reduced it unlocks a massive field of potential and that's sort of what you're talking about with space which is like oh my god there's this entirely uh different set of constraints in space and if you can all of a sudden be in that environment lower gravitational pull whatever it might be what does that enable from a manufacturing standpoint from a you know cost reduction standpoint like all the things that that all of a sudden unlocks what is it what do you also mean about sovereignty again people haven't got their heads around this so let's say elon musk had bought twitter and that the servers were put in space there is no census by any government it cannot be prosecuted because it doesn't exist as a company you know and again whether that's legally doable or not it's possible the point being is what's going to come from space is very different than what comes from these confines of our nation-states that we live in which kind of plays in a bit to the bellagi thesis about the network the the network state which is something i've been speaking about for under six seven years that we're going to digital sovereign states and we'll live in multiple ones i think belarge is wrong that we will we will leave we necessarily leave the state we live in i think we live in multiple states we already do right we live in finn twin you know greg you live in florida until you live outside new york and i live in the cayman islands but we live in a community together which is intuit and crypto twit and you know stuff like that and you know it can be very deep and it can be very broad we've all met on there and yet we got to know each other and it's you know it's cool so anyway space changes the again it's space changes the possible in ways that we don't yet understand it's a lot to get people's heads around right with all these a lot to get your head around and it's it's completely insane when you think about i think it was tim urban had a tweet recently saying you know there have basically been four three or four kind of like giant leaps uh as a planet and one was like you know the first single cell organism the next one was like you know the single cell to multi-cell organism jump then the next one was like you know uh ocean to land or something like that and the next big giant leap is from single planet to multi-planetary species and the fact that we might be alive like the chances that we are alive during that one of the four or five giant leaps as a planet is pretty remarkable just on a cosmic time scale and like something to feel really uh amazed by i think yeah and you know elon musk would say it's because we need a plan b essentially for humanity on earth because we either destroy it or we destroy ourselves i don't think any of us really want to live on mars you know living underground or however it's it's not a great environment but as you say it's just like a virus you know humans we're all the same right we're biological creatures we're like a virus and what we try and do is survive and procreate and if the conditions are not good for us in one place to do it we'll find conditions for other places which is the history of humanity itself and the history of all biology yeah it's what it's also the challenge of our lifespans um it's very easy when you have your own survival mechanism to survive yourself but when you're talking about journeying out into space on time horizons that are going to be you know maybe you go do something that your great great great great grandchildren will benefit from it becomes a much more challenging calculus i think so i mean maybe part of the whole singularity and like digitizing our bodies is that our lifespans will be increased and it will it will it you know it won't have to be altruistic to go and venture and do those things no that's right um you know humans struggle with altruism generally because it's a matter of self-survival um but overall humans again i i've been i used to be more cynical with humans but i think i believe in that helical structure which is yes we are cyclical yes we make those mistakes but yes incrementally things change so before we wrap up um i want to get the download on what you guys are working on in web3 um and this new business venture that you've recently talked about and written about that was kind of actually the impetus for me reaching out saying hey we should come on and chat we've gotten into a super fascinating discussion on a bunch of different things but i do want to make sure we we chat about this so i know you guys are also collaborating in some way around it um what is the big opportunity here within web3 that you feel like you've identified and you want to go i've this is the biggest bet i've ever taken my life this whole web 3 bet and to me again when i visualize it i see it's pretty clear that all business models go that way so we're pivoting real vision around web three okay that makes total sense we've got amazing community to have utility token nfts to have all sorts of web three interactivity and also stuff great that's happening but the other two bets that i've got is a the entire financial system is going to pile capital into this space over time because of this the supermassive black hole that it is when you've got all these network effects going on and the fact that financial industry itself is going to pivot to blockchain technology so all the securities industry all the system of money everything right so that's almost everything we know so i set up an asset management business called exponential age asset management um and it's a fund of hedge funds that people can basically get broad exposure to space fire hedge funds why hedge funds are not vc vc space is crowded with 57 billion going in in the last 15 months hedge fund space the entire size of the hedge fund space four billion there is the secondary market in crypto's entirely staffed of capital so it's retail only plus a few trading firms of which one of them has just blown up um there's so that the amount of capital in the space is super small but i know it's coming because i don't have this rule but it's the secular trend so here's the second trend do that so that's one business i've set up and we'll be launching a whole bunch of initiatives around that the second one was obviously if i believe that community is the most powerful force of business models going forwards that um blockchain technology enables this in ways that we can't yet imagine and that i saw originally it all came to me down from a moment when i met rac the music artist and he explained to me because what he'd done with nfts and social tokens and this was three in a bit years ago and i just heard him sought in my head immediately is oh my god everybody's going this way and so i'd kick that around in the head and then just um was speaking to a friend i grew up with david pemsel he used to be the ceo of the guardian media group um he'd he'd um start a new business which was based around community kind of marketing around um putting together community technology and brands and that nexus and i said well you're missing tokens and so i got him down the rabbit hole over lockdown introduced him to kevin kelly from delphi and we decided to co-found a business called science magic studios uh so it's sciencemagicstudios.xyz and our basic theory is everybody is trying to tokenize from the ground up we're seeing in nfts you know you guys doing probably the best job of doing that um and they've gone from nfts into the social tokens which is my big thesis which is how this plays out because your digital sovereign state can have its own system of money and that's what the or system of value transfer and that's what the social tokens are and people haven't seen this yet but it's going to come at scale ftx was another one which has been immensely successful that's how it's still four and a half billion dollar value of a utility token or social token and apecoin being the other one um and so the idea is to tokenize the world's largest cultural communities so culture is the new asset class and cultures based around communities are generally speaking music fashion sports um sports movie tv and book franchises those are the big culture icons if you leave out religion that almost everybody plays a part in and those are going to become tokenized why because they're all intangibles on balance sheets and this i saw the number i can't remember who where it came from mckinsey or somebody that there was 63 trillion dollars of intangibles on global balance sheets how they get to that number i've known it but let's assume it's directionally right well probably 20 of that is going to get tokenized via what you're doing is essentially tokenizing the intangible of brand culture and community what is the value of disney their community and the culture of disney well it ain't the three hundred dollars this million dollars this billion dollars the stocks worth it's probably a couple of trillion it's probably one of the single most valuable communities on earth and once you start to see the world in this terms and how you share that network with the users as opposed to exploit the network so facebook is shareholders got rich we got utility and then got monetized but tokenization changes the equation because we all participate in the network you know bitcoin is essentially a digital sovereign state of which you can participate by owning a token and if the sovereign state succeeds over time then you will benefit from that in your society so it's this nexus between nft's metaverse social tokens that is going to take the entire corporate world the cultural world by storm and this is when brands are going to learn they've got no community and they've got no culture and others will learn they've got unbelievable amounts of community in culture they didn't realize and everybody's going to change what they're doing so that's what science magic studios does we're already speaking some of the biggest people in the music industry biggest people tv i mean we've been introduced to so many people because everybody is looking at this and meanwhile you know everyone's looking at what's the next fnft community that's going to take off i'm like guys there's space over there you know it's like there's mars let's go there two categories you you brought up religion as one and i that's that's just fascinating but two categories that i'm curious about um politics and religion do they ever tokenize yeah you know politics you're dead right i hadn't even thought about it but obviously and now that's the you know if you look at the us it's basically two sovereign states right now which is again a point balaji raises and everybody's living with and um why would you not you can tokenize i think you're tokenized municipalities as well we're also seeing like like there's some things that people don't realize how big they are and when was the constitution down yeah it didn't work but you coalesced what 40 something million in capital in about a day and a half in a dow around an idea i mean holy that changed politics forever people just don't know it yet um andrew yang is starting to see this already so he's i think got a doubt structure to do stuff but um yes politics could be tokenized because if you're a badge-wearing republican or a badge-wearing democrat or a progressive it's a self-identification of a community and those communities yes somewhat geographically separated but not always so there is a way of having your own system and then you become as ever missionaries for the network um but yeah i mean the us is struggling with that already what i actually like about crypto as an aside on politics um i think the largest right and wrong but um i think that what's so interesting about it is i can hang out and finance twitter and it's very political you know the people who who want to be long oil tend to be on the right and the people who want to buy tesla tend to be on the left why it's a political thing but it is right as opposed to an investment right we should be just thinking of everything neutral as an investment crypto is really interesting there's very little politics in crypto it's one thing we can fight over everything else but we don't fight about this and what it is is i think it's a purely capitalist system with extremely progressive values because it's a community so you kind of got both ends of the spectrum blended together if you're uh if your government listening reach out to rao and his team they're interested i mean at the very least government should be exploring what it could look like you know at the very least yes yeah i mean it seems like a way to get people more involved in the political process and invested in it more broadly it's also i mean the other reaction i had to everything you guys said there is um if you're a builder today and you're looking to start something um what better way to start something than starting with culture and community yeah uh at the at the heart of it and i know greg you've been you know screaming that from the rooftops for a number of years now but just listening to ral speak about what the opportunities look like there and like how you know the biggest brands who haven't built fervent communities are going to be disrupted and they're going to be torn down in the coming years by this if you're going to go try to disrupt what better way to do it than with a fervent culture and community think about what also what's so exciting about this is brands have been extractive but they've been extracted from by facebook and the advertising industry all sorts of middlemen the music industry is really obscene with it the book and tv industries really have seen in the end there's going to be this lovely sharing of the spoils of building a great network between the brand and the customer and there'll be a removal of middlemen and the power of changing that business model is enormous i mean trust me mark zuckerberg is not stupid he completely understands what is going on in web 3 and why they have to change as a business you know knowing many people at um at meta they get it because they won't exist otherwise totally yeah he's a wartime general man yeah people that hate on duck i'm like it's fine to hate on him it's like your point on elon musk it's like people hate on these guys i get it hate on them but zuck is a wartime general i don't i would not bet against that guy no no way and he's not jaded yet i mean i don't know how he's managed that but he's not jaded you know he he's gone and pivoted one of the world's biggest firms pivoted like that on a concept as a yeah as a founder you know and principal owner it's like he's in a cool position because he's not because he's not exposed to you know quarter to quarter marks etc can't be booted out you know he can think in it's like xi jinping and why i'm so scared of china frankly uh they have a 50-year plan and they can think on 50-year time scales while the us is sitting here bickering over you know two-year midterm elections well who's going to win that battle i would say you're long-term versus short-term it's scary as hell meeting with government here uh the other day with one of the ministers about crypto stuff um and what cayman islands is doing and stuff and he's like well he said it very clearly it was interesting he goes well you've got to understand i'm just a temp in my job he said you have you know at best four years at worst two years before i get booted out that's how i mean that's not a good system to establish long-term strategic goals with i mean it goes back to what you said at the very beginning i think it's actually it's a great place to close too i you said in the context i wrote it down here in the context of trading and investing um the alpha is long term everyone is short-term so you need to go long-term if you want to generate alpha and it's the exact same thing in politics and in strategy as a business owner or as a politician if you are ultra long-term oriented and you can think on 50 plus year time horizons and you're thinking about these secular trends and you're investing behind them building behind them etc you are going to generate so much more alpha than the person that's just going with the wins on a daily basis yeah or copying what somebody else is doing just it is again it's the directionality where's the secular trend live in the future imagine the future build that love that that's a great place to close um man what a conversation took me to places that i did not expect i was going to go uh today especially around the space stuff man um leo alkali yeah yeah we're looking forward to it and everyone they can find you you know on twitter um everyone should check out realvision i've been a very

all right we are live that's amazing okay cool is anyone in here do we know if this is working post in the chat if you're here so i know this is working hey okay unbelievable all right looks like we've got 16 people in here 15 people in here so far so seems to be working but i need people in the chat to tell me if it's working is it are we are we working all right luca all right give us a few minutes while we sort of let people come in and then we'll officially start this so we'll start this in about five minutes all right give me give me a few minutes and then we'll get we'll get officially started all right um so we'll officially start luca and people watching in a few minutes but uh while we're while we're waiting why don't you know people just sort of start throwing in questions that they might have for me could be really about anything um startups what three community what's on their mind maybe they need feedback on their startup i don't know but uh feel free to start entering in the comments and i'm just gonna go ahead and start answering hey came highly to nimitz i love mitch okay so i'm gonna officially start uh first ever episode of the room where it happens live on youtube we're here i'm here style isn't here today it's just me um but i'm here to answer all your questions literally about anything um building a startup is is obviously uh difficult and it's kind of lonely so um i thought i thought this would be fun so what i want you all to do is literally bombard me with questions in the comments and i'll answer them and i'm going to answer them like completely honestly um it's on the record but i'm going to be answering it kind of like on off the record and i want to hear your i want to hear your deepest and darkest questions so we are live first episode let's get into it um luca goes keeping momentum in the dow nft communities during this market or during this bear market or whatever we're calling it i think we're calling it a bear market because it is a bear market and um the truth is uh it's a very very good time to be building right now like there's just a lot of interesting uh opportunities and products that people are building but you're just seeing a lot less traction than you did for example november 2021 so how do you keep momentum i think it's just if you believe that you're adding value building a web3 product then you kind of just have to believe in it and even though it might be a bit slower than how it was in 2021 there's still tremendous opportunities happening right now so i'm sure you all have seen a couple days ago starbucks announced that they're launching a web3 product i saw today that polygon just hit 150 million wallets you know there is momentum in terms of usage of these projects i just think a lot of this speculation is going away so a lot of the speculators are going away a lot of the tourists are going away doesn't mean that there's not tremendous opportunities but it is you know if we're being real it's definitely harder uh to to build when you don't have as much momentum so uh wake wake up every day and just tell you know tell yourself and ask yourself don't even tell yourself ask yourself do i believe in what i'm building and if you believe in what you're building then you shouldn't have uh any issues building in a bear market thanks for the question luca jim rat currently building a fitness community and told you you're the guy to talk to okay so answer ask me a question ask me anything and i will answer it how do you go about building a solid team who can carry out the vision of your startup the vedic that's a great question finding a team obviously is one of the hardest things to do in a startup and i think you know it's especially hard if you don't live in like a major city uh especially a technology city like a san francisco or new york what i found really helpful is writing content so let's say you know you're the you're this guy in this common section gym rat you're building a fitness community and you want to hire maybe a cto maybe you want to hire a marketing person well one of the things that you can do is write about the fitness community or maybe you know fitness is pretty uh horizontal it's pretty wide i would actually like try to focus on maybe a sub a sub community so maybe you know maybe it's like the keto community um or maybe it's plant-based community and just write maybe it's on twitter you're gonna write two threads a week maybe it's on tick tock you're gonna post one tick tock a day and start just building and attracting an audience of people who are interested in that thing once you've built that audience then you have a lot of leverage then you have the leverage for you know going on twitter and being like hey you know i'm running this you know plant-based community i'd love for a head of marketing to join or cgo to join and now you have people who've already built affinity to you and uh a great example of that is literally one of the comments um someone was like hey um oh yeah gym rat currently building a fitness community and told you you were the guy to talk to this happens because i write and produce a lot of content on the internet so my advice to people is if you want to hire write content um most underrated strategies for growing a twitter following okay so i know a lot of people don't like threads and i know there's sort of this uh you know cringe nature of writing threads but the twitter algorithm favors threads so you know you you have to ask yourself when you're creating content you're for these platforms what what can you create that the algorithms are going to spread and they're going to spread threads and you know on twitter so i think what would i do like i'd create a thread once twice a week and just go and do that around my particular topic uh the trick with threads is the hook is the most important thing about the the thread so the hook is like the first sentence that you'll write in your initial tweet and why is it important is because the way the twitter algorithm works is if you if people actually click into the first tweet to see the following tweets it's saying to the twitter algorithm that this is interesting content show it to other people so if you can get a lot of people to click that first tweet to read the other tweets then it's more likely that your your your tweet is going to spread so i think it's uh you know a lot of people actually end up creating incredible threads and they ask themselves well why did i get a hundred a thousand impressions i thought you know i spent a day creating this well your hook wasn't captivating enough so uh once you write your hooks don't forget uh sorry once you write your threads just don't forget about your hugs okay tyrell johnson says i'm building a high-end subscription design service what advice do you have on landing clients i'm focused on creating valuable video content across all social channels on top of cold emails i saw this gary vee video today actually where he says i don't want to do convincing i thought was interesting i don't want to do convincing everyone focuses on convincing and i don't want to do con convincing and i think one of the reasons why he creates a lot of content is because he wants the ceo of pepsi the cmo of um you know ford to reach out to him and i think about it uh you know a similar way you know i run a design agency we've got fortune 100 clients we've never sent a cold email once in in we've never sent a cold email um clients come to us because either it's through referrals or you know they follow our content and they're interested in community-based products and supercharging their communities they want our lens on the world so i think how could you uh tyrell to answer your question and like how can you land clients i think the first thing you can do is do you know create a category or do something that's unique so for example with us we're the place where if you want a community lens on building a brand building a product uh incentivizing using web3 we're you know we're one of the first people to do it and the leaders in that category what can you do that shows that you're a category leader what is the category that you're going to be building and the second thing is uh you know the video content is really interesting but i think you know are your clients on tiktok as much as they are on twitter my advice to you would just be focus on one channel to begin with make sure that that's rocking and rolling i also think that people sleep on linkedin like i just recently started posting on linkedin over the last a few weeks and i've been getting you know over a hundred thousand impressions on each of my posts and i'm you know i didn't have you know a few weeks ago i didn't have any followers on linkedin still getting a hundred thousand impressions so pick your channel and go deep on it and then uh obviously you want a landing page to capture those leads um and it's as simple as that fun guy rose asks you share some of your experience with taking on venture and deciding not to now there seems to be a rise of founders with ptsd from raising going into lifestyle biz afterwards thoughts yes there definitely is uh a lot of ptsd of second or third time founders around raising venture capital um i once met one of the one of the best investors in silicon valley and he told me something that'll always stick with me he said greg the best deals and the best deals that i've ever you know are fund the best uh sorry the worst deals obviously we lose a third of our deals go to zero those are our worst deals a third of our deals we get our money back so not a positive return and the third of our deals we get our money back to google times return he invested in google so that's why he said that so how you know how do you internalize that what he is saying that one of the best funds in the world two-thirds two-thirds of of his portfolio essentially fails founders teams don't see any money back because uh you know if if the investors get their money back chances are the team and founders don't see anything you have to ask yourself do you really want to play a game where two-thirds um you know are the odds of losing you might want to do it you might want to do it um but this is the best fund in the world so you know second tier third tier funds you're saying 90 95 97 uh of of the startups just not really going anywhere so um yeah i mean with with raising venture capital you know i definitely had some ptsd would i do it again maybe um but i think that you're going to see the rise of sort of um they call them lifestyle businesses but you know you could create a huge lifestyle business like is gary v you know uh vaynerx a lifestyle business like he does hundreds of millions in revenue i think uh to me hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue isn't exactly lifestyle business thank you for that question that was a really good one luca asks how do you keep from burning out on content creation the way i do content creation is i go out and i go out in the world i have like a notes i'm sure you all have notes on your ios phone if you have ios or on android and i just like something will come come to me and i'll just write it down so for example i don't know i i recently posted um today or sorry it was actually today i posted about how i think tick tock is a great uh basically if you want to start your company consumer company in 2022 you probably should start a tick tock build that audience first start with the tick tock then you can do an email newsletter then you can do a podcast then you could do a paid community and then you could do a paid product and that's where i believe you know if you're trying to build a company in 2022 that's kind of the framework for it that's not something that i like woke up at five in the morning and i was like okay like what can i tweet today not at all i was you know just thinking about it on a walk and i just written it down and then you know i came inside and i had a cup of coffee and i just wrote it down so how do i keep myself from burning out of content creation is it's just ideas that i have that i've written out and you know i probably spend an hour or some amount of time depending on the week just taking and organizing my thoughts so it's uh so it's friendly to the internet like that's a big part of of taking your ideas and how do you make it friendly the internet we talked about hooks and threads before how to create a good hook and i think you know i'll do a bit of that but i won't burn out because um i always have ideas and i like writing them down and uh yeah i'm always gonna have ideas luca says i've sustained it for two quarters at a time but it eventually burned out lost motivation due to low growth okay so i think um you have to look at building an audience not from like a two quarters thing but more of like a four to eight quarters thing like a one to two years thing i literally was screaming about community on twitter for 10 years and not no one paid attention like like no one paid attention covet hits and all of a sudden my account starts blowing up because people finally start talking about community um so you know some people would say i was at the right place at the right moment but i had actually spent so many years kind of screaming at no one for so long so don't give up luca toca says what should your ideal capital raise be amount of years runway needed versus your times yearly burn rate how do you justify capital needed for startups in the idea phase the rule of thumb is you should raise 18 months of capital i think the rule of thumb for 2022 should be you should raise at least 24 months of capital because there's so much uncertainty with the current economic downturn i personally wouldn't feel comfortable raising 18 months because that 18 months maybe you have um maybe it turns into nine months very quickly like you have some unforeseen costs that come in or you want to make a bet and that requires a few extra months of runway so i think yeah if you can i would raise 24 months of runway um and how do you justify capital needed for startups in the idea phase i mean i still think about it the same way if i was starting you know with islands that you know that i i did tweet thread on that last week i talked about my whole story and i talked about i raised two million dollars on an idea and the justification for it was hey like give us you know our you know we're three people we want to get paid you know uh 8k a month of salary or something like that um that's going to be 24 a month and you know that translates into x amount of years of runway and i don't know when we're going to hire more people it's probably when we hit some amount of product market fit but that's the thinking start you know pay yourself something i think that's a mistake a lot of founders make is they make themselves so uncomfortable um that they'd be they don't make great decisions you want to be comfort somewhat comfortable so you can definitely justify capital in the idf phase the vatic asks how do you go about raising money to fund a community-based product can you use your own money or is it necessary to have investors if i was starting a community-based product right now and we are we use our own money um you know we constantly use our own money and the reason why is because uh first of all it's way easier to start something um you know and by the way your own money doesn't need to be a lot of money it could be a thousand dollars five thousand dollars uh it doesn't need to be a hundred grand a million dollars etc so um yeah i think we're constantly doing it and once you have some level of product market fit your leverage with vcs just goes like through the roof and your valuation goes up and it also becomes way easier to sell investors because um you know we talked one of the questions before was around like cold calling and and selling potential clients um you know your vcs your venture capitalists are like clients um so you definitely the more leverage you have with them the easier it is and the faster you can get it done and i know someone who has started many companies two which were in the from founder created two billion dollar companies two in the billions and he he said something to me that will always stick which is it's never fun to raise capital and this is first from someone who you know raises a lot of capital and continues to raise capital he told me this while he was fundraising so fundraising is never fun so the more leverage you have the better any luca asks any specific twitter followers websites are res resources for good thread hook inspo um yes actually there's a app called black magic it's a twitter extension maybe someone can put in the comments in the on youtube and it definitely gives you some inspiration around what good hooks come and the other one is thread hunter i think um yeah i think it's thread hunter um but it's another if you google like threads um chrome extensions there's different places where you can you know i think thread hunter and blackmagic which will show you what are popular threads and you can kind of reverse engineer some of those threads um great great question and any specific twitter followers answer question um you know my co-host sahil bloom obviously is the master at it jim rat says question nimish has helped us build a new community-based platform that allows users to meet local fitness friends with the same interest i love it that's a cool very cool idea uh matthew karen says did anyone build on the home concierge service idea i think some people were exploring it so you know matthew's talking about an idea that we had on one of our first episodes and basically was someone to manage your home for about 500 a month all the little things exterminators gardeners housekeepers that sort of thing basically what you would get out of a hotel or a high-end condo and i still think there's an opportunity there i think some people were trying but i haven't heard i haven't heard back um all right alex pranks how would you get your first customers in an fv reddit group so one of the things i talk a lot about is unbundling of facebook unbundling of our facebook groups and unbundling of reddit subreddits um unbundling of discords and what i mean by that really is is just focusing on a particular niche and getting those people uh creating a product for those people creating a community for those people and one of the ways you can do it is you create a shiny object for those people so you know let's say you're creating something for let's say the fire community financial independence retire early for those who don't know popular movement it's very popular subreddit what can you create for the that group of people who are trying to retire early and are trying to hit a goal you know maybe it's a net worth calculator things like that where you can what are things that you can create that they can get really excited about capture their email and then bring them on to a platform your own platform maybe it's your own facebook group maybe it's your own sort of vertical social network maybe it's your own discord maybe it's as simple as a whatsapp group some of the biggest uh communities i think could start from something as simple as a as a what's up group so that's a that's a great question thank you for that and if anyone has any more questions about unbundling or community-based products feel free to ask jim rat says when trying to bring people together what is the best way to bring more traffic to gym rat plus um i'd have to you know spend more time thinking about gym rat um but i think about building community-based products like this i see it as a funnel at the top you have an audience then you have a community and then you have a community-based product so i would start by building attention at the top build your top of funnel build your audience uh right now how do you do that the best way to the best ways to do it right now are twitter tick tock and linkedin if you're b2b why why those platforms because those platforms want you oh and i should add instagram reels those platforms want you to uh and those formats want you um to come to the front page so tick tock is obviously the best then i would say twitter and then i would say instagram reels how can you create content for those platforms that just starts spreading so it's just about reverse engineering for those platforms uh easier said than done of course um but i think yeah if i were you i'd probably there's i would probably start with tick tock probably start with tick tock i spoke to someone yesterday who who started an account 30 days ago and got to 500 000 followers in her niche um in 45 days and tick tock is the place with the most amount of uh people with more than a million followers and it's because it's easiest to get followers on that platform so um people are still sleeping on in uh tiktok because they think you know they think it's a platform for um young people gen z and and you know the stereotype around oh it's just like kids dancing on it well no i think like it you know 30 year olds and 18 to 35 is probably their fastest growing segment um so that's my answer on that one uh alex pranks asks how would you build a billion dollar business without raising if i were building a billion dollar business without raising i would probably probably just focus on building a highly profitable business um in a growing space um that you know i'd probably i'd probably honestly start like the easiest way i think to build a billion dollar business right now without raising is building like an agency type business with good margins growing in a new space [Music] i think that's the easiest way i mean you know accenturism is a big bit a big business and you know granted you know it took uh you know when you compare like apple you know which is you know trillion dollar company into accenture what's the market cap of accenture let's check 195 billion so when you compare that um and you know accenture started like 100 years ago or something like super old business definitely takes longer but i think it's your clearest path to getting to a billion dollar business without raising ragav asked should i create a community for customers who aren't able to pay um i first fitnessed community for gen z okay it's called peak pals so it's the first fitness community for gen z in india and he and should i create a community for customers who aren't able to pay i mean ultimately you want to create a sustainable business and to create a sustainable business you're going to need someone to pay it's okay to build your community first and have them utilize it but i think you should definitely think about what what are some services that i can start adding to um to make this a sustainable business so you're not completely reliant on venture capital so that would be my advice there [Music] i would also say that it takes longer than people think to figure out ways to monetize so the mistake a lot of people make here is they create this for example social network for fitness community seems like we have a lot of that here uh in the chat and [Music] they hyper index on just creating the most incredible free product um but i think they should also think about what is something that i can charge for because that might not be your first idea my your first idea for what people will pay for might not be the thing that people actually pay for it might be a flop basically is what i'm saying so uh it might take 12 18 24 months for you to actually iterate on some monetization ideas before one thing hits so think about it as if you're doing two concurrent paths you're creating a product roadmap for you know your free customers and you're iterating on that and hitting product market fit there and then you're also experimenting with monetization features over here [Music] for the customers you're going to pay so it's almost like you have two customers the vatic asks what kind of business entity is best to set your web3 community up as does this depend on the product service the community is offering um i don't know i'm not a lawyer um and and i think it does depend so uh not 100 sure and don't want to give advice on that the vatic also asks can you explain product market fit yeah product market fit is you know it when you're gonna see it your numbers are all up into the up and to the right uh product market fit basically means when your product and your market are just one it's working it's working you're growing every month if you do nothing you're still going to grow you don't have a retention problem meaning people aren't leaving your product retention is good engagement is good and people are spreading your product chris asks oh i lost chris's question hold on here it is what are some of the kpis that you care most about when building community first products incredible question for me it's uh retention and and engagement why retention and i would start with retention so retention basically means people are coming back to your product ideally on a daily basis if you create something that people are coming back to daily that is showing there's tons of value they wouldn't come back if if uh if if it wasn't valuable so um i would i would say if i had to pick one metric i would say retention is the most important thing to focus on if i had to pick two metrics i would say engagement engagement meaning how you know yes they're on the product they're on the website they're on the app they're in the experience but what's the you know frequency engagement how deeply are they using it so for example if it's a messaging app for the fitness community are they sending 100 messages a day or they're sending one thanks for the question chris salman asks thank you greg as an investor what are the top two to three ways in which you try to help founders um when i invest in founders because i'm i'm a one-trick pony and i focus on community-based products i just uh i just say like hey i can help you in community-based product stuff i can help you in um helping you think about designing habits rituals to to create this experience to have people come back to and also creating a beautiful experience that speaks to these people and that's where i can add the most amount of value fernantology asks can you talk more on your thoughts around community design how a solo preneur can start down that path specifically i have a community of three thousand but engagement is sleepy so i actually threaded about community designers uh last week and how i think it's going to be you know community designers is going to be like the hit job of 2023 and 2024. and what is a community designer community designer is is kind of like part product manager product part designer part community manager it's it's it's not someone who's managing the community but it's someone who's designing the community so i'll give you an example let's say you know okay friends with benefits actually is a great example for those who don't know friends with benefits it's a tokenized community where you need to buy a certain amount of tokens and you get access to this discord they also have irl events they think they're throwing like a music festival an arts festival right now and when you look at you know their their private community um it's really just well set up you know you can see like fwb california you can see like fwb memes you could see these like you can you can see that someone put a lot of thought into what can i create that brings people back on a daily basis and that's what a community designer does a community designer would set up all those channels listen to the community iterate on those channels create bots that you know bring people back create email flows that bring people back create a product a web-based product that brings people back that's what a great community designer does now with friends with benefits fwb i wouldn't be surprised if they move off discord completely and i think you know a great community designer is already thinking about that it's thinking about how okay i've learned that this is how people are interacting with discord currently and it's you know writes down here's what's great about it here's what isn't great about it and then thinking about how can i create an experience on our web-based platform that is way more enriching immersive compelling that's what a great community designer does jay asks where do you think dao's web 3 will be in 10 years best guesses where will web3 be in 10 years i think when you look at all the charts for you know we talked about i think polygon hitting 150 million wallet addresses today you know the arrow of progress is definitely um upwards now we're gonna have years where we're gonna have years months quarters whatever that are gonna be down but i think that overall you're gonna see um you're gonna you're just gonna see more adoption for web 3 products i think right now it feels very fringe and it feels like you know people make fun of it and you know copy and paste this jpeg like i get it um but i i don't think people are going to be laughing in 10 years um natalie asks hey greg sorry you missed my question ask it again so i can see it if anyone has more questions i'm just like i'm just like going through all these questions first live episode room where it happens hope you're enjoying spread this with your friends tweet it out get it out let's get people here to ask questions and i'm just gonna answer answer answer all right jimrat says what is the best tiktok marketing strategy to get more people to download the app um i mean that's the thing like you you don't have like there's no one-size-fits-all marketing strategy for tick-tock um there's no one-size-fits-all marketing strategy for twitter it's about your particular niche how are people servicing it today and what is something that someone's going to be swiping through their tic toc feed and they're going to see a video and they're going to stop because they are interested in that niche but also because it's unlike anything that they've seen before that's how you should be reverse engineering your content strategy tokimov asks is asking for 36 runway reasonable or would you see raise 24 runway 24 months runway and use series a to extend runway depending on kpis being success successful or not um i think 36 months runway is definitely reasonable i think you can you know when i when i raised two million dollars for islands i had 50 months of runway i think it's totally totally reasonable um and uh so yeah i think totally um 24 months is also reasonable ryan gamble asks what if any is your take on jobs to be done lens thinking framework and building a business today um yeah draw i mean it's a great the jobs to be done framework is is a great way of thinking about how to build products so um you know asking yourself what are the jobs to be done in a particular community or a particular product and then thinking about what are the product features to support that is a helpful exercise for any product product manager to do diego cortez question says what do you think of token gated commerce shopify seems to think it's going to be big i couldn't agree more with shopify i think that uh over the next few years e-commerce merchants and merchants in general are going to reward customers with tokens and those tokens should be able to do cool stuff you know if web3 is going to work it needs to be valuable so i think having these uh private you know reward only sections of websites and irl experiences um is the future of nfts and i think uh i think it's to be huge fun guy ross asked you mentioned entrepreneurship is lonely and the focus on community have you attended any formal masterminds paid and unpaid um i have i've um sean poury used to host masterminds sean poury from my first million used and the milk road used to host masterminds at his office and it was a great place where you know four five six entrepreneurs would come together and we just kind of talk about what we're working through and people would give feedback and it was totally off the record and it was a really really good experience the other thing i did when i was in my early 20s mid-20s um was me and my buddy daario rented a big house in los angeles and we invited the five or six or seven or eight biggest uh entrepreneurs investors that we knew actually entrepreneurs that we knew and we hired a moderator this guy antonio nebs and we would come up we basically gave everyone like an hour or two hours to like pitch an idea and we'd all get feedback and it was a two or three day um session uh event and it was amazing and a lot of big companies came out of that um a company called breather.com came out of it they raised like 250 million dollars a company called flow water came out of it it's a publicly traded company in canada um so it was a great way to um get feedback from people so i think like one of the cool ones one one thing i think that if you want to get feedback on your startup find like a really cool place pick an island um you know something like that and rent a cool house and reach out to people on twitter and be like hey i'm throwing this like mastermind in costa rica or something and you should come and this guy is you know moderating it and it's only going to cost a thousand dollars and you end up getting awesome feedback and and also you get to meet potentially people who you're going to be friends with for the rest of your life um you know sean poury i met at one of those a lot of interesting people i met at these at this thing that we did in los angeles yearly salman asks what are the top execution challenges you hear from founders at seed in series a stage attrition retention outages strategy i think the biggest the biggest challenge i hear is retention retention is really hard to solve for um because you know you can't hide from it you can't hide from attention and i think it's you know it's it's your if you solve for retention chances are you can figure out product market fit jim red asks in regards to tick tock is it optimal to have a business account is it always a pay-to-play kind of thing when it comes to boosts and paid promos you don't need a business account to to go viral on tick-tock at all so don't worry about that just get started uh sarah's lavell hey sarah asks when do you think web3 will become really mainstream do you build a community first then lead them to the metaverse nfts et cetera serge i think uh that's a great question i think the best mvp the best minimal viable product for a web 3 product is in fact a web 2 product so meaning if you want to go and create a tokenized community or an nft project i think the best thing you can do is you know let's start a whatsapp group with a bunch of people um start that and see if you can get validation from these people in this particular niche and then from that i think uh i think you can extend that so start with start with a web 2 product and then build a web3 product thank you for the question uh reason asks what do you see missing in web3 at the moment i think there needs to i i'm very i've been talking about this for eight months already but free to mint is the most interesting thing in the nft space right now in web3 just you know projects like uh goblin town i think are interesting where people don't you know it's freedom in does it cost you know just the gas views um i also saw a project yesterday which was i forget what it's called but the point is it's pay what you feel and it reminds me of 2004 um or something like that in rainbows and i don't know if you all remember but it was an album by radiohead and it was you know they released it and they said pay what you feel basically and later they did a analysis on what people paid and turns out that like people paid more than what they would actually pay for the album so it was a great like sociology psychology lesson around um your whales or your power users your power customers that will end up supporting you regardless so i think that's really cool i think we're going to see more of that in web 3. my dad asks is phil's nsf still the best coffee you have ever tasted in all the places you have lived exo mom and dad um well mom and dad i do think and there were some tweets about phil's saying it wasn't good from someone but no it's phil's i think his incredible coffee and i think they might have one in new york i think i might have seen that um so uh love phils i think it's awesome um ishida says what are your thoughts on the metaverse i think the metaverse is a loaded term with a lot of baggage but i think that this the idea behind the metaverse is real and what is that what is that idea the idea that we're spending more and more time digitally it's the experiences are more and more immersive and they're more more interoperable um i think is the direct direction of the arrow of progress so that's what i think about it but definitely a loaded term uh toca tocavnav says what are your favorite questions for founders when investing in the early days i mean my favorite question i would say honestly like why are you doing this like what what what part of your life led you to this point that you're the best person to go after this particular problem um aleister macmillan says my dad's the largest stockholder in the johnson and johnson vaccine and he's more or less forcing me to get into that as as work do you think i should work elsewhere or with my dad i mean i think that if you can you should do whatever whatever speaks to you and [Music] people should shouldn't really work on you know obviously you need to make money so um i think people should go work with where their heart is telling them if they can that's ideal the vatic says do you believe in running ads on major platforms and building an audience or is creating content and letting those reside with find and engage with a better method in building a solid audience i've never spent a dollar on um i've never spent a dollar on promoting like doing twitter ads for myself or linkedin ads um so and and i've sold millions of dollars of of uh client work on our agency and and other businesses so i wouldn't recommend paying for ads it doesn't really make sense um grant lannier says starting a non-profit web 3 charity guivocity and having trouble gaining steam what is the best way to get people to take you seriously when you only have 57 followers on twitter seems like a catch 22. um one of the quickest ways to get your first 1000 followers is just to reply to well-known accounts with really thoughtful uh replies so setting up uh twitter notifications for let's say sahel bloom or myself and who have like hundreds of thousands of followers and replying with really well thought out answers really quickly like within one two three four five minutes and you're gonna get five ten followers per day just by doing that so i think that's my that's what i would do if i were you uh lucas asks do you see potential for brands on shopify to incorporate token gated commerce in retail stores as well my drink brand will be present in a physical and e-commerce setting i think i'm almost more interested in token gated irl experiences than i am in token gated digital experiences so um a hundred percent um and lucas says that he'll get me those drinks when we're ready thank you um i appreciate it matt gold says what's your favorite place to live that's a tough question i think i've lived in for those of you who don't know me i've lived in montreal i lived in san francisco where i spent a lot of time in la as well um and i lived in miami and i also have a house in a small town called senegal in quebec which is basically forests and mountains and lakes my i loved my time in san francisco because i was getting into tech and i was trying to meet the smartest people as possible and there's just a high density of those people and at the time it was amazing but i did feel like it was a law of diminishing returns like at a certain point i felt like i knew a lot of the people and so you know i wanted out oh oh and i forgot i also lived in new york but very very shortly you know not for a very long amount of time um los angeles is is is really cool and there's a lot of creatives there but it's so spread out and so i i don't know i think yeah i think i wouldn't live in los angeles new york was way too busy for me and got me like i was honestly like anxious just being there um miami has been great i've been living there since covid um my favorite place to live all things considered has been miami why miami because um i like the weather the weather is really good it's on the east coast i like the east coast i like being a part of like a place that feels like it's growing um so like that just feels good and and and with all like the laws and stuff it feels like i'm swimming downstream versus swimming upstream whereas when i was in montreal i felt like i was swimming upstream um natalie mass do you see my questions i've asked three times and no response i haven't seen your questions actually um so i'm scrolling up and maybe there's a oh there it is oh no i see hey greg sorry i missed your question okay i'm looking for your question natalie and no i don't see your question so can you post it again and i will try to answer it i don't know if you're trolling me or not maybe you're just trolling me i just see you asking twice if you see him uh my question that's amazing if you are trolling me that is awesome can you emeron says can you elaborate on token gated irl totally so first of all you should google like the doodle shopify experience at south by southwest it was like amazing and so just google that that's one thing you should do but what is it it's basically like if you own a token let's say you own a doodles you would get access to the south by southwest doodles activation where maybe you get a free stuffed animal or maybe you get a free copy so owning the token gives you irl unlocks here's what we're talking about um salman asks what would be a decent career path trajectory for a community designer at a growing company is your thread essentially advising a brand new career ladder leading up to chief community officer yes i believe that a community designer could become a chief community officer or even chief product officer if it becomes a community-based product matt cramer asks do you think there is room for charity fundraising type nft meds example fundraising for humanitarian aid in ukraine or is that too limiting ps where is sahil changing a diaper he actually is um i think he's busy with his kid um so it's just me um yes uh what we saw with ukraine obviously it was you know in a short amount of time 50 million dollars of ethereum was raised um i expect like people are not talking about how amazing web 3 is for raising funds for non-profits or social justice things so i expect a lot of that to happen soon the vatic asks how important is engaging with your audience responding to comments explaining the dms etc really important you have to do it you have to have to do it and uh that's you know why do you have to do it because you're building friendships with people and you're building relationships with people and you kind of have to put in the work kevin asked who's uh who works at late checkout who is your favorite late checkout employee unfortunately kevin i can't answer that i don't play favorites i love our team they're amazing um natalie mass says lolo k i'm not trolling haha but natalie you still haven't asked the question so i don't know if you're actually not trolling me or not so uh please ask the question diego asks what about token git and merge or token gated digital goods i think tokengate and merch is going to be huge you're starting to see a little bit of that uh the atom bomb squad has that uh which is the hundreds project and i think it's really smart token gated digital goods like software makes a lot of sense i also think nfts as subscriptions for software is also of interest um crucial that's josh fabian says thanks for letting me borrow your lambo the other day greg i've been telling everyone about how you save those kittens from a burning building the other day um so that didn't happen but thank you josh that was awesome natalie mass says i've posted it four times why can anyone see my comments can anyone see my comments no natalie we still can't see it um you are a a plus troller um oh natalie mask going for question number five are you guys ready are you guys ready to see this so far we got nothing so nothing from natalie um jason asked what are your thoughts on play to earn economies do you see any coming out of the future that are not ponzi's i think i think that unfortunately the 2021-2022 era ushered a ton of basically ponzi schemes and uh [Music] i've started to see a few projects that haven't launched yet that are really really interesting that aren't so i think uh we're gonna see 2023 uh two to three big play to earn uh play to earn play to learn economies come out so don't give up on on played earn just yet uh anthony carlson's have you ventured into the boring business landscape like cody sanchez for additional revenue streams are you solely focused on late checkout and web 3. solely focus on late checkout although we uh are in the business of looking to acquire um businesses um so stay tuned for that but we we would only acquire community-based product businesses because our whole thesis is that community-based products outperform non-community-based products and we're trying to build the berkshire hathaway of community-based products oh my god everyone natalie mass has asked her question i see it and i'm gonna read it out to everyone here it is we are building a preview experience to gain knowledge around viability basically high fidelity figma screens hosted on azure is this something investors are interested in i don't know why you're asking me if this is something investors are interested in um i also don't even understand what that means um so go pitch some investors natalie and they will tell you uh if they're interested um matthew says if you are forced to make 10k in 30 30 days what would you do can't use your network rep recurrent assets i would start a instagram real slash tick tock [Music] agency and i would um for you know 100 200 300 cut clips for influencers i'd reach out to them um there's a huge need for that let's take a few more questions we're just about an hour actually into this this has been super fun i'm gonna take a few more questions and and then i'm gonna you know then i'm out and i'll probably have some dinner um all right do you think more behind the scenes mechanisms mechanism web3 project products will pop up now instead of such upfront products nfts etc thank you nadine um yes i do i do think so troy says i'm in a web 3 ugc open social gaming platform dab that's in the alpha phase what are some ways that we can attract new 3d creators collabs or partnerships with large nft projects i mean the first thing is join the project so like uh like go and join club cpg like go go and actually join some of these big projects and actually be a part of it and and ask them how can we make your lives easier what can we do can we throw an event together i think it's joining the communities and obviously you know a crypto punk or a 48 might be too expensive to join but there's tons of projects where you know it might not be too cost prohibitive to join and you could easily uh start to get to know people and easily just like pitch them on yeah just pitch them on on cool ways that you can be supportive think about it less of like how you can subtract to their experience and think about how you can add to their experience thanks for the question diego asked are there any plans for a late checkout discord um or any other places to hang out with you we actually have a like check out discord it's uh you can check it it's somewhere on our website like checkout.studio what are your fav the vatic asks what are your favorite features on each specific social media platform for building a community um facebook slash ig tiktok youtube snap for building a community um i mean ig isn't very good at all facebook groups is like underrated tick tock doesn't have much for building a community realistically it's just more of an audience play youtube also is more broadcast than anything snap just you know snap groups isn't isn't isn't yet isn't there yet i think my favorite features if i had to rank them would be our favorite platform would be facebook groups discord is kind of a mess but it's still decent um [Music] and of course of course reddit um she just says where can you find great community designers really really difficult um that's why we hire them at late checkout and and we we're in the agency business naturally clever ask hey greg what do you mainly what do you do mainly for work outside this podcast i run an agency in studio called late checkout uh what subreddits do you spend a lot of time on um it's a mix um it's anything from you know i talked about the fire community a little bit uh the volvo subreddit um because i drive a volvo um and you know different cities and games and then yeah that's about it um all right now tell me if people had fun enjoying this like right in the chat if you want me to do this again you want me and sahel to to do this again this has been really fun i've loved um i've loved love love answering all your questions um this has been really cool um okay i'll answer one last question how many hours does late checkout take to run weekly and how do you get clients i work pretty hard [Music] when i you know i probably only work 40 hours a week but even when i'm not working i'm kind of just thinking about it too in the back of my mind so i'm constantly thinking about it i really they check out is is really much my baby so thank you so much for uh being here please subscribe to our youtube channel the where it happens youtube channel we have like a ridiculously low amount of subscriptions um but you know thanks for asking your question getting getting to getting to know me a bit better and if you like this again subscribe um join our email list uh tr iwh.com and uh and tweet at me at gregeisenberg and tell me what you think it's been real thanks everyone

only invest in companies that have products in market and have revenue for your first 20 investments as an angel so when you even see if i'm getting frisk and i'm investing in a pre-revenue company don't do it wait just invest in all revenue generating companies for your first 20 investments and then put the smallest amount you can in if the minimum is 5k ask if you can do two or ask if you can do one i have people do that all the time to me like hey your minimum is 4k on this deal because it's 250 slots that's a million dollar allocation can i do one and i'm like sure do one i've had people ask to put 500 and they're in credit investors i'm like okay you know if we have room sure and i encourage them to like take their time and to learn how to do it [Music] did you know that one of the top reasons startups fail is bad hiring decisions people can be unpredictable and developers can be unpredictable as well let lemon.io take care of hiring your software engineers why lemon.io they

minimum bureaucracy maximum efficiency that's a win-win combination for developers and clients so hire high quality verified vetted engineers from europe with lemon.io and be stronger than 90 of startups on the market go to lemon.io room and get 15 off for the first four weeks get there before your competitors will check out lemon.io today jump right in man cold open cold open uh i do want to i do want to start there actually it was actually what i wanted to ask about because about about a month ago or so you tweeted something out you said um vcs having a liquidity path for crypto with retail investors is problematic um you know and you talked about what you talked about on the odd lot podcast like this general idea that vcs were pouring money into uh you know these liquid tokens or semi-liquid tokens um and then basically dumping that um very very shortly on retail at these massive markups and then retail was left holding the bag um i kind of pushed back because i was under the impression that a lot of these vcs were being asked to sign up to like you know two-year vesting schedules or something on these and maybe it's just like my own naivete but i'm curious to just like get your general perspective on that as a starting point of like what are you seeing out there that's happening um you know and what do you see happening in terms of the regulatory and legal landscape around that next yeah so uh i'd start with we don't know what the vcs are doing and to be clear i'm not talking about any one vc firm any one law firm or any one coin so a lot of people are like you're talking about andreessen you're talking about solana you're talking about this you're talking about that i've been talking about crypto uh for over 10 years on the podcast i was one of the first people to cover bitcoin i booked bitcoin at like two or three dollars and then again at 100 and 200 so i've been og crypto for a long time um i understand the space i'm not a coder or a developer but um you know i i generally understand what's going on here and i've invested in 350 companies so that's sort of where i'm coming from and i also run it's the largest syndicate in the world with 11 000 accredited investors and i've done over 260 deals so i understand the the nuances and i've learned this you know through a lot of hard work how to deal with you know basically managing a large group of investors and i have had to only work with accredited investors because and i don't think that's the way the world should work i think anybody should be able to with a a basic uh license like a driver's license if you think about like that become accredited so i don't think accredited should be based or accredited accreditation in the united states should not be based on your net worth because you could be uh a trust fund kid and be considered qualified you know accredited and you could be like and have an mba in economics and have written the book and teach it at nyu and be under 200 000 a year in income so it makes the absurdity of it too by the way like around accreditation that i just find hilarious is like i can't if i'm not accredited in america i can't invest in like my buddy's startup that he's creating but i'm allowed to go invest in like a triple x levered you know mortgage etn through my brokerage account with no questions asked and that's absurd like the risk profile of those is pretty different i would argue the intent is great we want to protect people from losing their money it's you know it's talking about like decades-old laws like you know going on 100 years here you know when these laws were formed so they obviously have to be reformed and they are being reformed you know now you have a lot of exceptions that have been made if you work at a venture firm you can become sophisticated if you have a series 67 i think or something you can be i don't know all the the nuances of it but people are starting to get themselves accredited it should be much simpler i teach a course angel university i've done it 30 times i give all the money to charity and that would be a perfect proxy for people um and i would do it for free uh to help people get accredited because i do want to see people participate so there's a long way of saying i am 100 pro uh a sophisticated investor class emerging with a simple driver's license test the driver's license test is not easy but it's also not hard if you put 10 hours into it or patty's scuba diving i don't know if you guys are paddy certified i'm paddy certified you got to read a book you got to take five exams you got to do four open water dives seems reasonable to me it might cost you 100 200 bucks that would be enough friction for people to be sophisticated and then they could invest in very speculative specs or tokens or startups all of these things are speculative right now we just tell them go gamble in vegas so let's put all that aside so you just understand where i'm coming from because there seems to be you know have you seen matt levine's i'm an idiot test that he's written about in the past no not levine the bloomberg writer his like his idea around accreditation is uh basically you should just have to every everyone can be accredited and all you have to do is you just have to sign a form that says i know i'm being an idiot by making this investment perfect just sign it and it's like same general principle you're like okay you're gonna invest in something speculative you just have to say i know i'm being an idiot i'm probably gonna lose all my money on this totally fine it's tongue-in-cheek but you know to be honest i think that's sub-optimal i know some people are radical it's your money do what you want with it the reason i wouldn't be in favor of that is because with this much money at stake and with a global market with no friction i.e crypto these are all good things about crypto um you know people could lose a lot of money very fast and they could be a lot of people who get harmed and people could be duped and then you have situations where people are front-running markets and doing all kinds of crazy things and people are not diversified and they're making one bet etc so let's pause we'll put all that aside but so i just want people to understand where i'm coming from i am not a crypto hater i think there's some interesting technologies there but i do think 99 of the icos and crypto projects have never materialized into anything reasonable and i think a significant portion of them have been built by either grifters incompetent people or some combination of both um you know same could be said for some startups as well right but in startups we give you the money after you've proven something not based on you know some incredible idea and we give you 100 million dollars on an idea and so what's happened in crypto is i think a lot of vcs and investors um and law firms have talked themselves into and you know i'm no legal expert so we'll see if they're right or wrong it seems like i'm probably a little more right than they are at this point based on the sec's actions but they basically convince themselves that these tokens are not securities the sec seems to think they are the sec obviously could do a better job of making this clearer but i think the sec's position i don't speak for them but i'm just guessing here is well you've been a venture investor for 10 years 20 years 30 years you've deployed a billion dollars you've played by the rules this entire time in terms of who you take money from and how you deploy capital and all the legal work you do and now you're paying a hundred times the legal bill to construct a foundation in panama and then buy some tokens ahead of time and then get them listed on some markets and then sell them before the company has uh reached product market fit but you wouldn't take these companies public that have product don't have product market fit and in fact you told uber and airbnb to stay private until year 10 so that they were really ready to go public so they basically figured out a public market if you want to call it a strategy some might call it a scheme some might call it grift you know depending on how cynical you want to be to clear out those positions now we don't know to your point if people have cleared them out but we do know that the bag holders are retail and largely retail and that they bought these things you know like buying lottery tickets and you know now you have the reality of a lot of people have lost their money we knew that would happen everybody saw it coming uh and those people have a free option now they they made these bets there was a murky legal environment people convinced themselves that they paid a million dollars to get some legal opinion or to structure something in panama or some caribbean island that this would all be fine why did they spend a hundred times the price to raise this money and create these structures than they did for the ones that they were doing before why would they do that why would you spend a million dollars setting this stuff up legally well you'd only set that up i think the cynical view of it would be you set up these structures you paid all this legal money because you knew you were going to dump you knew you were going to clear these positions and you knew it was going to be lucrative that's why you went through the expense instead of just raising money they could have done all these tokens could have just been sold to accredited investors only that would suck but you know what that's what i do i write a deal memo i syndicate a 500 000 allocation in com.com to a couple of hundred angels now over 10 000 and if they want to invest they invest on average back in the day it was three or four thousand now it's probably six or seven so i could have 25 times the number of people participating in my syndicate if they were not accredited but i don't do that because i want to play by the rules would i like to have you know my mom or my cousins who are not accredited be able to participate yes but they can't so i play by the rules and i think that's what's going to happen now now that it's all come apart just like we're seeing you know in the in the global economy stocks nfts crypto you know any alternatives real estate pick the market when the market collapses everything gets stress tested and i think this stress test is going to result in countless and i mean countless lawsuits hundreds of lawsuits because i saw this with the dot-com era i'm i'm not some like uh you know clairvoyant here predicting the future you know i'm not nostradamus here i've seen markets collapse stockholm era there were lawsuits for years what's your what's your optimistic take you know five ten years from now for web three i think you've you've spoken a lot about you know the faults of web3 and there's tons but i'm curious you know what what does web3 look like in five to ten years all right so web3 is a collection of assets right people include blockchain in there they include smart contracts in there distributed computing is in there permissionless you know trustless serverless peer-to-peer all that is part of this um you know technology stack so you're really asking like what are what are these 17 what's the future of these 17 technologies i'll tell you like there are two things i think that are super promising uh or maybe three that i think could have legs uh i think nfts uh are a very interesting technology when certain rights are attached to them so if i were to buy my soho house membership or the battery or my golf club membership and it was an nft and then i could take my golf club membership or whatever it was and under some sort of smart contract rules i if i paid twenty five thousand dollars to become part of my local golf club or five thousand dollars to be part of sole house i would have the right to sell it to somebody else um and i could get back up to 100 of my original investment then 50 of any gain and then the solo house or the golf club got the other 50 and the golf club had to approve the person and i had to approve the person so both things had to be true or i didn't need their approval if it was over this amount whatever it is and so you could see that being like a very interesting way to do it where the golf club is saying hey by investing in this it's your right to do this and in fact we invested in a company and we bought two nfts from afterparty which is doing this essentially making music festivals with this concept right and every time with my two nfts i get four tickets to their music festivals i was like oh wow like i'm a rich it's almost like i'm an original patron of um sundance or an original patron of coachella like if you're a sundance patron which is a non-profit the film institute you get you know like nice tickets and you get to go see movies and go to parties so that's kind of interesting right did you know that one of the top reasons startups fail is bad hiring decisions people can be unpredictable and developers can be unpredictable as well let lemon.io take care of hiring your software engineers why lemon.io they test an interview every single specialist before offering them to clients unlike many other sites offering remote software developers lemon.io is sure they offer you experienced and verified devs it's like hiring someone after your best friend's recommendation but even better why because even the best friend can't offer you a replacement of the candidate in 48 hours or less if something goes wrong but lemon.io can you'll be working with hand-picked software engineers from europe they'll be a part of your team lemon.io staff never intrudes on your communications unless you ask them to minimum bureaucracy maximum efficiency that's a win-win combination for developers and clients so hire high quality verified vetted engineers from europe with lemon.io and be stronger than 90 of startups on the market go to lemon.io room and get 15 off for the first four weeks get there before your competitors will check out lemon.io today all right and so the other thing i find pretty interesting is like it's dowse of interesting for a group of people in an llc to make decisions together but have it be programmed into it at the start and just have it running in the cloud so as an example it's a company called picasa which takes a home we'll turn it into eight shares we could all buy this home in tuscany they would provide uh all of the uh furnishings they would manage when we each got our weeks and if we all both wanted christmas they kind of have an algorithm to manage that so it's fair for the premium weeks yada yada they charge you an expense they get a little bit of a vig but you actually own it right so now imagine that same scenario but without a company we buy this same beautiful you know farm in tuscany and we each own you know roughly 33 shares in a hundred unit llc each two shares in the yellows in this dow equal a week at the place and each one has a cost of i don't know two thousand dollars in maintenance a year right so then i decide i'll sell four of them to a friend or a family member they get two weeks there but they also have to pick up the cost you two get first writer refusal on those shares or you get first friday refusal over 10 days for half of my share so if i want to sell before i have to share you four other ones whatever we come up with as our concept here i mean it all just happens programmatically and you saw some promising stuff where a lot of people would love to throw in some money to achieve some goal and so that goal could be for us to have you know a farm in italy it could also be for us to buy the knicks it could be also for us to buy twitter it could be for us to um save the wells or buy acreage to you know deal with the rain forest or a non-profit instead of giving our money to some scholarship fund we could say we're going to put money into this to provide stem education to disadvantaged students they apply we all vote on each application and you have 10 days to vote on each application to give scholarships to people right and then you don't need to have this whole non-profit running the scholarship program it's done through this dow that everybody agreed to so i do think there are promising things there the things that i don't think are particularly promising or maybe overhyped is the blockchain as a database sucks um you know everybody knows that it's slow and it's never going to get super fast at least not when compared to you know uh you know modern-day technology that doesn't have to you know be immutable and distributed so it's always going to run behind now at some point moore's law will be so great that maybe any modern function would be fine on there uh but this idea that there are no there's no central authority is another thing that most people don't want so most people who you know uh you know are buying into crypto would very much like to have their trans their transaction reversed if it was hacked um now other people see that as a feature like haha you made a mistake you you did it wrong you lost your nft or you got hacked hey it's on you i think that the majority of consumers don't want that so there might be some consumers who do there might be reasons for wanting it i'm sure but i think most people do like to have some central authority so a lot of the stuff is overblown and i think the main problem as an ecosystem crypto has is it got co-opted the original true believers and the technology had very good ideas i met a lot of them i had them on the program this week in startups but a lot of them um got you know kind of diminished in their voice in this whole crypto ecosystem as people came in just trying to secure bags and flip things and that's really the the tragedy of this just like the dot com era a lot of the people who we were building the dot com movement we were building websites we were doing it because we were enthusiastic about what it could do for society in the 90s we wanted to see people have a voice and be able to publish things without permission like that that was what it was about you know and to be able to communicate with people across borders and then people came in and said hey this is a quick way to take a company public and secure a bag so i think that's um what's happened to crypto now i i was waiting for this crash a lot of people i know encrypted were waiting for this crash so hopefully it flushes out 70 80 percent of people and then some regulation occurs and then the people who are left are people who actually can ship product there's been very little shipping of product i also think the gaming space is kind of interesting i like to gamble i like to wager uh i like uh prediction markets uh and stuff like that so i do think there are some wagering and interesting things there you and i want to bet on the i don't know a knicks game where we want to play online poker we put our tokens in we put our bitcoin at we stake our bitcoin whatever and you know if we lose a hand the money just gets transferred and there's no intermediary this kind of stuff is interesting right and so um where you and i want to make a trade on you know i don't know what the price of oil will be at the end of the year and you know here is our oracle we both agree that this website or this data service is going to be the proxy for the oil price and we just make that bet and it doesn't cost us anything right one thing that's problematic why isn't it all free like weren't we supposed to save money on this like the gas phase and stuff like that is just ridiculous like if you're gonna make this competitive it should be ten times cheaper than whatever the best deal is so if stripes three percent this thing's gotta be like point three thirty basis points like it's gotta be really competitive with what's out there and it should be but again back to securing the bag it seems like some people love to get these gas fees and yeah that's problematic as well it just seems like you know decentralization became this like dogmatic buzzword and to your point you know there's the real aficionados out there that say oh yeah you lost your money you got fraud you know scammed your platform got hacked whatever like oh too bad you know that sort of the the price you pay and that's that's how it works you know not your keys not your not your coins um and i just like why has that turned out to be true huh yeah but but like my thing that i keep coming back to on all of this is that um centralization is good in times of crisis and like i think that across decision-making authority too and so when you talk about dows like i think a lot of the use cases you talked about are interesting in the in the context of a dao where you have like um you know governance across a bunch of people for like you know um investing behind causes and uh or homes or things like that but if you're talking about a company like there was this whole thing of like every company is going to be a dow and community governance of everything and my whole thing with that is like that sounds fine when everything is up and to the right and times are good but when [ __ ] hits the fan like there needs to be a general that is able to go make quick decisions really fast and i just don't think you can rely on a community uh you know distributed decision making uh in times of war default decentralized and you know default immutable default you know smart contracts probably not what most use cases uh should be so i think there was this like drunken you know uh fever about these coins because they kept going up to the right so people were like well if i'm making all this money this has to be the winning strategy the problem was the strategy was never executed so we actually don't know we don't know at scale if you know uh a crypto version of airbnb where you know there is no central authority you know making sure your house doesn't get robbed or trashed if that would be better or not because you would take out all those fees uh you know happy to see somebody try uh but i don't think you know a marketplace like you know ebay or a financial service like paypal or stripe or you know airbnb like i actually don't think they work better i don't think most consumers would pick the decentralized crypto version over the centralized trusted brand people are underestimating central i also think we saw a lot of bad actors in the nft space so that the 10 000 the 10 000 pfp collection cookie cutter um that that cycle from 2021 to early 2022 and just that rinse and repeat that people were doing where nfts like we often forget but nfts don't actually need a you don't need to sell nfts at all so for example i'm happy to see a lot of freedom mint nft projects take off like the 100 thieves did a project where you know they're a popular uh gaming community you know they had seven hundred thousand people meant for free these nfts uh to celebrate their championship that's awesome we don't need to sell you know we don't we don't need to sell it uh so i'm excited to see more freedom mint uh into yeah i mean it was like it was like arbitrage right like it was the same exact vein as what jason was saying early on of like some of these vcs just taking advantage of an opportunity to make a quick buck and like these guys came in and it was like yeah you could go make eight i mean there there was a point in time where this had to be the best way if you were like somewhat smart and you had very low morals uh it was probably the best way to make like five million dollars style you wanna tell that story we had that we were you wanna tell that story about our friends yeah i mean we we had yeah we had a group of friends who basically had this idea where it was like um hey let's go we have large platforms on on twitter and social and let's go like you know this is a great time we can go create some amazing artwork and we'll build this cool universe and we'll go like create a project and we originally like greg and i originally started working on it thinking like okay yeah we can go create like this cool velvet rope thing it'll be a cool community we'll have like this type of utility around it yeah and then pretty quickly it became clear to both of us that uh our friends that were kind of you know wanting to do it were really just like there was no road map it was just like makeup here's how much we're gonna make in the mint and then let's move on and so greg and i both like pulled the plug on it and just walked away from doing it and it never came through because i was like look i also i mean i have a small fund greg has a rolling fund it's like totally unclear to me um and honestly probably likely that like two years from now a lot of these people get sued or that yes it comes after you and i don't want to get banned from you know for doing something stupid like that it was like it was ludicrous to me that that could possibly be worth the money but i think a lot of people viewed it that way you could just i mean you could literally make five million dollars in like a month um if you had low morals i think any time um you i've been introduced to some sort of investing space um you know if you look at the tactics being used with the new entrants that can tell you a lot so if you come to a poker game somebody's a fish you're gonna get invited to a lot of poker games all of a sudden you're like wow i'm so popular i got invited since one poker game and then two people that poker game invited me to these two other poker games and when i was in la and i was just starting to play poker i was getting invited to all these games like wow i'm super popular and i was like no it's just bad at poker now these are 200 poker games it was like nothing so people were just like oh he's a whale he's he doesn't care and yeah we can charge him you know 200 every night to learn how to play poker and in fact that's how i looked at it i was like yeah i'm going to learn how to play poker i'm just going to go to the hollywood park casino and buy into a tournament for 35 bucks and i know i'm going to lose but i'll learn great um the problem is you wouldn't want to take that technique to the high stakes poker games and buy in for 25 000 knowing you're in learning mode you could literally learn for a thousandth of that equally well so um then you look at angel investing people want an angel invested me they have to be accredited i tell them to take the course i tell them to read the book the course is free i mean you pay 300 bucks but we give the proceeds to charity so we just do that so people don't burn the seats your first investment's gonna be four or five thousand dollars so it's nothing it's literally giving a tiny donation to charity as an accredited investor and then the book is essentially free i mean books are 10 bucks or 20 bucks like i literally tell people only invest in companies that have products in market and have revenue for your first 20 investments as an angel so when you even see if i'm getting frisk and i'm investing in a pre-revenue company don't do it wait just invest in all revenue generating companies for your first 20 investments and then put the smallest amount you can in if the minimum is 5k ask if you can do two or ask if you can do one i have people do that all the time to me like hey your minimum is 4k on this deal because it's 250 slots that's a million dollar allocation can i do one and i'm like sure do one i've had people ask to put 500 and they're in credit investors i'm like okay you know if we have room sure and i encourage them to like take their time and to learn how to do it now let's look at crypto so in poker community like they're trying to get more fishes and whales at the game and you know what i saw crypto very similar have fun being poor you don't get it okay boomer not gonna make it gonna make it you know all this peer pressure i would say something like you know listen bitcoin is a great technology it's been proven uh pretty robustly over a decade but it will be replaced by a better technology um all technology is replaced eventually by a better technology and man the bitcoin maximalists and then the toxic bitcoin bros went crazy and i was like well please describe another technology that after a 10 or 20 year run wasn't replaced oh http okay sort of maybe but we do have amp and other you know you know extensions to it but yeah sure maybe yeah it happens once in a while uh please name another you know and like it's pretty hard to name right uh maybe email but a lot of the email communication has moved to chat and other places so it's very hard to imagine that bitcoin doesn't get replaced at some point but that doesn't mean it can't have a 10 to 50 year run but even saying that man it pissed people off and i said listen bitcoin zero is a possibility what if it gets hacked what if it gets compromised what if it gets banned what if there's some denial of service style attack that we can't anticipate here a black swan event all kinds of things can happen right these things do happen and oh you don't get it you're you're being taught you're you're have fun bluetooth and i'm like listen i've made seven figures on bitcoin so far and i'm saying this i'm being intellectually honest so i probably have a bigger bitcoin position than the people who were in my replies yet they're telling me i don't get it i'm like well i bought it at three and a hundred and two hundred now i lost the three dollar shares because i didn't have the keys and the website got compromised you know but i mean it's just like being honest about upside and downside around these things and people during times of uh overwhelming optimism no one likes the person that is saying those things like two years ago i mean i just saw this on twitter today i think but like a few years ago you made the prediction that um there was going to be something that happened over the coming couple of years that was going to you know destroy a lot of these startups that hadn't been thinking you know about what could go wrong and they were only thinking about a world where number numbers go up right it's like the crypto saying numbers only go up um and that's i mean it's just an important thing right like you need to envision the possibility of failure and then joe from odd lots said like this is the stupidest prediction ever and and then david sacks back in the day and when i had written this in like i think it was december of 2018 and i said listen here's your captain speaking things can get a little rough here i've never seen a bull market this long just make sure that you have a path to profitability you got some good cash in the account and you're raising money at the top of the market all pretty you know in hindsight great advice but it's it's ba it's i don't give myself any credit for it it's kind of simple advice right um kind of 101 to be honest and sure enough i was off by one year or 18 months yeah nobody can time it but i was trying to i was seeing exuberance that made no sense like people putting 100 million giving a hundred million dollar valuation to a company with no revenue and you know four thousand vcs using the product and you're like okay i think clubhouse is cool too but there's four thousand people in here and it's worth a hundred million that doesn't make much sense okay now it's worth a billion it has no revenue now it's worth 4 billion it's like really i does this make any sense and it obviously did not make any sense and in hindsight you know they're going to have to go down to a 250 million valuation and build back up but they did all the bags so you got to give them credit it also kind of points to your earlier the whole discussion around like you know crypto tokens and coins and how the like who was holding the bag on all that and how the vcs were doing that the other group that was holding the bag on this that i don't think it's talked about a lot was large lps like a lot of these pension funds endowments insurance companies etc are like implicitly holding the bag on this crypto stuff because these funds a lot of the funds that when did that then marked up you know massively their initial investments and went and raised insane funds with huge fees like you know go and raise a billion dollar fund to go invest more with a two and a half percent fee at the top of a bull market and now all of those pension funds you know who are like investing firefighter and policemen and teacher money are paying two and a half percent like exorbitant fees on you know investments that are going to be massively underwater or investing you know the one caveat garbage market is these are the most sophisticated investors in the world so you know i i look at the stack and i say how sophisticated how long have these people been doing it like these lps have these funds venture is but you know five percent or less in some cases it's ballooned up to 20 25 when venture is you know got big markups it can get bigger but intentionally they put it at five percent sometimes ten percent depending on the aggressiveness of the fund and uh they kind of know what they're buying into they know it's cyclical they know there's boom bust cycles they know they can you know have a 20x fund and they could lose 50 percent of the fund and they're kind of protected in their diversification they yeah maybe they pay too many fees but they don't have to they have other places they can put their money and they're choosing venture over private equity choosing crypto venture over venture traditional venture over private equity over real estate over bonds over commodities or whatever so like i i don't really worry about them too much it really is like the consumers and then the unfairness of the trades that i think is what's going to result in the most lawsuits because what happens is and i you know i hate to be like the spoiler here but just i always try to keep it a hundred as the kids say like be totally candid there are a bunch of district attorneys they all are running for some next office or keeping their current office if they're elected not appointed um and they all have a lot of pride in protecting their citizens so selfishly they want to stay elected or they want to you know aspire to be governor or something and you know being a d.a uh is a stepping stone it's prestigious well what's the most prestigious thing you can do so take down martha stewart it's to stop the mafia it's to stop some crypto kids who absconded with the money so you have to be a little bit uh self-aware here that if you screw over a bunch of people you know in some city in idaho or florida there's going to be some da who's going to be like what seven people in my jurisdiction got screwed by you know bit connect or you know whatever well connect yeah okay so we're going to come at you and we're not going to stop and if i get that pelt and put it on my wall i'm going to be able to say when i run for governor yeah and you know all your friends who lost money in crypto i was able to prosecute 17 people just like you know somebody else running forever oh you know i stopped online poker you know i stopped the mob you know rudy giuliani ran on you know having stopped the mafia in new york for a long time right so that's what's going to happen here now and it could be unfair too they went after people on wall street after uh you know henry blodgett famously was banned from ever you know working in securities for life because of a couple of emails you know where he was like yeah i think this company's a dog but we have a buy rating on it and you know uh i don't understand you know like i was like okay you know that's kind of the modern day uh and henry's a delightful great person probably learned from that i'm sure i'm sure he did uh and i'm fond of henry as a writer and thinker but is he the head of insider yeah which used to be silicon alley insider and you offered me five percent of it because i had silicone reporter magazine and i said no you know just keep it that was a stupid mistake on my part it probably in a couple million bucks do you on all of this stuff i there's this one area i've been wanting to ask someone about i feel like you're a good person to opine on it um this whole like trend of people on twitter newsletters podcasts whatever being like saying a bunch of stuff about some idea you know like recommendation thing they're investing in and then saying like not financial advice do your own research i think it's absurd because like like i read you know there's like the crypto newsletters right like i'll read it and they'll do like a bowl case on some crypto token and then at the bottom in tiny font it'll be like not financial advice you know do your own research i'm like that's fine you said it like okay maybe you're like covering yourself but everyone considered that their research like they read that that was their research and then people that go and then yeah and the number of people that go and buy the thing and then lose i mean like luna you know people recommending luna to buy as like oh this super interesting thing the number of people that lost money and like millions of dollars obviously is that imploded off of like millions you know twitter newsletter or whatever um i mean that to me is like an area that regulators need to look at i think a lot of people are probably deleting a lot of posts right now a lot of people deleting it they're like maybe i shouldn't have put that in an email and sent it to a million people sitting in people's email boxes i think about that i write deal memos you know and we do diligence on companies we can you know and we're upfront about this like founders could lie to us founders could take the money and go to vegas like they could go on a bender they could be incompetent like really you know uh invest the least you can and i tell people in my deal memos the bet and i use the term the bet because i want people to understand this is a bet you know and i say here's how i'm making my bet you sh just so you understand uh and i frame it as that because we are making bets here and so you know i just started j trading uh you know i we came up with a funny name for day trading so i think it's a unique opportunity to buy public equities i've never played in the public equity space i've always just bought index funds and i had a barbell strategy i have index funds from vanguard over here wealth front whatever super conservative low fee and real estate and then over here i have my really high um you know highly variable startup investing and then i was like you know what i think the market's really low i cover technology companies all the time companies i picked seem to have done well over time i'm going to jump in so i just you know earmarked a couple million bucks and i'm now on this weekend startups doing a j trade uh twice a week i'm using the hashtag j trading um and people are like oh my god are you giving investment advice i'm like no i'm actually looking for investment advice um and i'm telling people like okay i'm buying stitch fix like my first trade was buying stitch fix and i'm like here's my thesis i saw bill gurley buy a million shares i know bill gurley he's really smart he's been with the company forever bill gurley's buying a million shares sure i'll buy my about 5000 shares um then i was like you know what i think disney is going to get to a billion subscribers i think that between disney hulu espn plus they're going to get to a billion subscribers we've never seen a billion subscribers that sounds to me a lot like an iphone franchise if they get to a billion subscribers paying money that's going to be like that's going to turn disney into like apple i think in terms of revenue generation just a thesis i have tell me if you think i'm wrong because somebody's going to get to a billion subs and i don't think it's netflix i think it's like some it's either disney or hbo max you know they're bundles or whatever so i'm gonna buy some disney then i see netflix screwing up again and i'm like amazon is the seventh best uh amazon prime is the seventh thing on you know amazon's plate you know like aws you know amazon prime there's a million things they're working on that are more important probably than prime and they're better than netflix huh and then they just bought one medical and they got rid of they're getting rid of amazon basics so they can remove that attack vector for um the um you know regulators regulators doing everything right and i've always wanted to own amazon so i bought some amazon live on the air and so i keep doing these like j trades and i'm telling people my plan is to hold these for 10 years i'm going to make it public every time i do a trade i'll make a website eventually when i get to 10 or 20 trades and you can just watch it and yeah maybe i'll lose 25 percent of my money maybe i'll be you know 50 better than market but i like learning different disciplines so i think i'm going to try to get to 20 different stocks maybe a million or 2 million dollars and then i'm going to try to narrow down my 20 down to the seven best ideas i don't know what you think of that strategy but i always wanted to learn how public market investing works that's kind of cool this week in startups every day so i'll get all this stuff in the gauntlet it's like being in the arena with it is the best way to do it funny story about stitch fix by the way i um i pitched uh so i was like considering going uh into like the crossover investing or hedge fund world before i like ended up you know building my own stuff this is like early 2021 stitch fix was trading at like oh god no like 55 60 a share and uh the case study i had to do for this one hedge fund was uh stitch fix and i had a week to like put together a whole thing on it and i pitched stitch fix as a buy at like 55 dollars a share and you know now it's sitting at six and i gotta return my blender but i didn't didn't get the job uh needless to say but uh every like maybe like once every three months i send a text to the partner who i'm still close with from that firm with a screenshot of the stitch fix price just saying like it's a good thing you didn't hire me wow but here it is just cratered i mean this is what i think is great about what you're doing is um there's a concept of like super forecasting not just forecasting but there's a book super forecasting and understanding why you made a bet and why you didn't make a bet and then doing a little debrief on those will make you better so my thesis on investing is it's about process so all i do is just try to refine my process based on what's changed in the market and what i'm seeing and then just being better myself and so i have 11 i think 10 or 11 people on the investment team at launch now we do about 70 meetings a week probably 50 60 of them are introductory meetings and we invest in two companies a week on average and one of them tends to be a follow-on one tends to be a new so you know we're you know getting down from you know 10 or 20 000 pitches to us and thousands of meetings you know down to 50 companies wow um yeah it's pretty crazy when you think about it uh you know and even then i have questions about the investments i'm making and really try to challenge myself and i have been you know writing the book was one way for me to clarify my thinking and maybe have a better practice because people did tell me hey dummy this is wrong in the book or i think this is wrong um and then um investing in public like i'm doing with j trading and then writing my deal memos all these things kind of keep me accountable to myself and my own thinking when i make a bet and i really liked that and uh annie duke coached me on poker one time and uh she's like okay just we're gonna play with the cards uh i'm gonna have you turn over your cards why are you playing a10 and i'm like well it's suited she's like yeah but you're under the gun and being suited gives you like a four percent advantage uh and there are these other players coming after you if any many hands are going to be better than a10 are you going to defend this if somebody raises or if there's a re-raise or if somebody shoves it all in i'm like no she's like okay so you're going to lose that blind why not take the three hands under the gun off those are the hands after the blinds first people to act they're at a disadvantage and then the last people died and said if you want to get cute and play a 10 suited when you're the button okay maybe you only have two more people to act after you the small and the little blind so maybe tighten your range and don't play out of position and just like made those little two adjustments my game all of a sudden i went from losing in you know let's say three out of four games and uh playing in these like underground or home games in la to winning three out of four and i was like wow just that little tweak and now everybody else is doing that so then there's a whole nother series of things you have to figure out about the game but just those two little tweaks changed my game forever and i always wonder like when i'm investing are there other little things i can do like that to just be a better investor and i base all of my private market investing on the team the product and the customers now you can become really inspired by a founder and they're they've been trained on how to be charismatic now they've kind of unpacked what charisma is uh and how to sort of fake it so it's quite theatrical at times but you can't fake a great product you can't fake delighted customers so i've now over time leaned into those two things but in the beginning i was just you know well this guy travis i know him for a while and yeah this uber idea is great product is so signed okay the customers are over the moon about it um oh this guy com you know alex from com oh yeah nobody will invest in this it's a four and a half million dollar evaluation they have ten thousand dollars in revenue and this guy created the million dollar home page but the product's beautiful and i talked to the people running the ucla meditation uh mindfulness center and they told me they trained kobe bryant shaquille o'neal and phil um on how to when the lakers were meditating and that's when they won all the championships and i was like okay i believe that meditation could be bigger than it is today when people go to like three different places in la to pay 20 bucks as a donation and i made that bet on com which people that was stupid that so i you know i really looked at the customer base and the product now and but i've i've deprecated the charismatic founder because it's so easy to fake now right and so and maybe someday you'll be able to make a beautiful app just by talking to dolly you know and you're like dolly make me a gorgeous app that looks as good as robin hood but for you know uh pick up basketball games and every app will look stunningly beautiful uh so then i'll have yeah but then sam sam altman will own it so i don't know if we want to do that actually i think yeah they made that clear now you own your stuff and then somebody i i think i got an email from reid hoffman that he was using dolly to create nfts and i'm like rita you thought that was a bad dream is this read that's real i was like reed are you a burning man did somebody give you some plant medicine at burning man are you guys buying stock um in snap at this cratered valuation i just i have to ask because it's going to look good tell me your investment 40 today what is the revenue i would look at the revenue and then the price to sales ratio and then i would look at user growth because if the users are still growing and i don't know if they are or not and the price of sales ratio is just collapsed that means somebody could buy it and i think evan spiegel is a product genius like he truly is if you think about the things zuckerberg copied from him ephemeral messaging lenses stories i mean and glasses yeah revenue's still growing user base is still growing i gotta understand the revenue growth revenue is like 4.5 billion um what's the market cap market cap is now at let's see 16 billion so they're trading at four times yep and down i mean you know it's down four yeah but they're they're user growth if you look at the five their user growth is i don't know the number but it's like you know not huge cheek and revenue is going to potentially go down 87 from the peak yeah but this but if we go back the last time they were ten dollars looks like 2020 and they were trading in that you know six uh four dollars to ten dollar range for many years it kind of just round tripped the you know the covid round trip that a lot of people did you know like peloton did the same thing it's like it's kind of taking that round trip the next piece of data i would need to know to make a j trade here would be cash in the bank how much cash do they have and are they losing cash etc so if they're growing and they're four times revenue um and they have they're not losing money enough cash this could be a non-consensus bet they've got about i think five billion in cash see this is what's amazing about these companies if you took the 5 billion out of the 16 billion market cap yeah right so like if if you were to buy the company for 16 billion right now it would include the 5 billion in the treasury so you paid 11 billion 11 billion if they're making four and a half times four and a half billion in revenue is 2x 2.5 x i guess or somewhere around yeah so they're trading at two and a half times their uh top line now if they showed a 20 margin that would be 900 million 900 million into 11 billion they'd be trading at like 11 times earnings so pe would be well under 15. so that's what i'm looking at i'm trying to back into if they could if they could sustain a 20 margin if they cut a bunch of staff they probably could but i mean it's kind of hard to make four and a half billion dollars in the advertising world i bet you microsoft wants to buy this i could see google buying it too yeah kind of charging yourself into a snap trade here should i just do a j trip yeah i know i was going to say man if you make this trade you gotta you got to cite your source i got another one for you guys what do you guys think of buzzfeed but okay i talked about this on this week in startups buzzfeed is making three or four hundred million a year on their run rate they only have 200 million in cash last time i checked and they were trading at um 300 280 markets 250 now okay so buzzfeed is um a disaster their market cap is 250. i think they have 100 or 200 million in cash they're losing like 50 or 100 million a quarter so this has the risk of ruin they could run out of money yeah that is the key issue here so you don't want to drop you don't want to catch the falling knife in the middle of your palm right and so um this is going to get worse and worse and they'll get bought but if you took out a hundred million you can't even take the hundred million cash because they're probably gonna burn that but their pa ratio is 3.6 so did they show a profit the last quarter i thought they were losing money or maybe they're losing money with stock compensation so this is an unmitigated disaster think about it this company was privately valued at two and a half billion i think or three million so it's 10 of that you know you'd you'd be looking at is somebody going to buy this now what value and who's the buyer there was talk of disney wanting to own this or whatever but it would be more like my guy jim bank off who bought web blogs inc for me would buy it put it as part of vox or he could buy it and then put vox into it but yeah i don't know who wants to buy this journalism is a terrible business there's no path to viral growth here every time you grow in order to grow their top line they're going to have expense so if you want to get more paid views you're going to have to hire more expensive entitled writers as part of the buzzfeed union it's a disaster of a business um yeah this could go to zero so why would you put money into this as opposed to snap which is run by a product visionary which has viral ability right so if we start comparing the two it feels like i would much rather own snap or peloton peloton is a love product with millions of subscribers um and yeah i i think i would even go peloton above buzzfeed but i do like this like bottom feeding i think it's kind of an interesting thing to do especially right now i mean there's just like it's just even just as a learning opportunity as you said it's like you know learning in public around these things that you're doing it's a pretty cool time and opportunity to sit around and learn about these things just given how much stuff is pulled back it's like pretty pretty interesting um although i still agree with you that like if you're trying to just make money and if you want to like become worth you know 10 million dollars in the long run buying index funds uh like vanguard index funds at the prices that they're currently at is probably your best bet just like dollar cost average into index funds i would advise people to just get wealthfront i had shares in wealthfront as an advisor and it's really the best product out there and you can just set on a dial one to ten i put all my family members on it they all love it they're all like automatically setting like a 500 deposit or a thousand dollar deposit every month and it's a much better strategy for people like because you don't have to do what we're doing here like not everybody is in the middle of the tech industry with a bunch of smart friends who are making bets all the time and who talk about tech every day and have been in the tech industry for 20 or 30 years like you have to do these things when you have an advantage now i have an advantage in private markets i have an advantage at poker i don't have an advantage of crypto and i'm trying to gain an advantage in public markets um if i wanted to go if i wanted to be in crypto i would stop investing in everything else and i would start a crypto startup and i would invest in crypto on the side so that i was in the thick of it i'd have 10 crypto developers and architects working for me telling me which projects were coming that's the only way i would be involved in is if i could have an edge i only want to bet money on things where i have an edge and the way i'm looking at the million or two million dollars i'm going to put into jay trading is that's to get me the edge that's my that's my mba that's me paying for an mba it's cost of admission that's my training now i can't imagine in 10 years i'll be down and if i'm plus or minus 25 of the index it has no impact on my life so it really is me doing this as a sport and it's an education much like if you bought i don't know if you bought a condo you know in san diego because you love going there on vacation and you put it in the airbnb pool if you plus or minus the indexes or you could have optimized the the apartment money better for your condo but if you got to use it and you love san diego that's kind of how i'm looking at the stocks it's entertaining for my audience it's educational for me [ __ ] it i'm in yeah and by the way on wealthfront shout out wealthfront because i think they're actually the sponsor for this episode uh i mean it's [ __ ] great use the promo code to get ten percent get your first five thousand free i'm hijacking your uh promo code that's good it's good love it dueling problem so do you read your own yeah what's that do you read your own ads on the show yeah yeah i do the ad reads i have to read tennis after this for next week's show because i'm gonna oh man um so i want to ask you before we lose you um a bunch of we we sent out a tweet asking questions juicy questions yeah a lot of good questions i think one of the ones that kept coming up was like this whole thing of like starting businesses with friends and you know the the pluses and the minuses of doing that and like you guys have obviously had uh you know an interesting um you know conflict recently with with the all-in crew and um you know have built one of the most impressive franchises in the world within the podcasting space and something really durable and interesting can you just talk about um you know what what went wrong like what what are the lessons around um you know around doing business with friends and and what you would advise young people that are going out and doing that yeah i mean i think it's great to start business with your friends and projects um i think you looking at all in it's a very unique situation you have four alphas uh who are at the top of their industries uh and who are the you know god kings of their realms so it's kind of like game of thrones you know like i'm like well i have dragons and the brother's like well i have all the money and i got the big city and you know ah i'm protecting the north like these are four formidable individuals with opinions and so you know chamoth asked me to do he said hey i want to do a podcast with you i was like all right come on the swing starts and i want to do a unique one then we brought the two davids on and it clicked and it became magical um and i really enjoyed doing it and that's another area where like i really focused on being instead of the host being like a really good moderator and challenging people interrupting people forcing them to explain the terms they're using you know and obviously i'm funny and i make a joke here and again and so you know i'm the funniest friend of the group who likes to break chops and you know the other guys are pretty funny too on the margins and so it's just got a great you know spirit to it then uh we're like we should do an event we should meet the fans and we're getting contacted by all the you know media companies whenever something breaks out like it did it you know became like you know top 20 podcasts some weekends you know and we're regularly the top 30 episodes in the world it's pretty nuts when you think about it um and so we got a lot of offers but nobody can offer us money that would change any of our lives and so we were just declined all that nobody wanted to do ads i would i was like let me read two ads i could get 50k per ad it's 100k it's 5 million a year and i'm the one producing all of this and you know this is all built off of my company like i came up with the name i came up with the format uh you know i do all the editing i mean i do all the work basically so then we did the event and i said listen with the event um are we all going to do the work they're like no let's do the event but you do all the work and then freebird was like i don't want you to get paid more money than me and you know freebird was complaining constantly yadda yadda um and i was like okay this is getting really annoying now i regret doing the all-in summit now the oil and summit then turns out people lose their mind over it it sells out it makes a couple million bucks you know a couple hundred thousand dollars in profit it could have made millions in profit but we gave half the tickets to the fans at a loss like we the gift bag was 600 so we just spent all the money basically like drunken sailors on these parties and it turned out to be amazing obviously um so then there was this talk of like hey we'll make it into a media company we'll do more events we'll you know build it up i said okay great if we're gonna do that and we were public about this on the show um then i think i deserve just a fraction of more equity and chamath said hey what what do you think that is i said i don't know how about like two extra points uh so i'll get 31 points you guys all get 23. i'll be the ceo you guys show up i'll do all the work and i you know i have a 20-person team and half of them you know i've got people event people already so when we did this event production i took 20 people on my staff and i put them on this for the last two weeks and you know i had three or four people working on it so i basically took my team off of investing to do this so anyway uh nothing like so then you have four different opinions of what we should do sax is like let's just do the podcast every week that's it chamav has ambitions i have ambitions freeberg has anxiety the whole thing was just causing chaos and then we just decided [ __ ] it we'll just make it a podcast every week no more events none of this [ __ ] and we'll just own it 25 each but you know we were negotiating and then everybody started losing their mind and uh you know band almost broke up but we realized like the audience really we we all came to the same conclusion one we love doing it together two the audience loves it and three we think we're actually doing something important in the world um and that really that third part i think is the key for me and i know it's the key uh for saks chamoth and friedberg i can speak for all of them that we think what has clicked with people is that we're having better conversations and more intellectually honest conversations and first principle discussions and we disagree with each other but we keep the podcast going and the friendships going fr sax is like one of my best friends in the world people think that we hate each other we just you know have a difference of opinion about trump versus biden republican tactics you know overturning roe v wade but if you look at the majority of things and actually this episode 88 that came out i took the political discussion which is very challenging because half the audience gets pissed off when we don't talk about january 6th and the other half gets pissed off when we talk about roe v wade so we're in this kind of like conundrum where you know people like stick to your lane do markets do startups do tech do science but then you know like we want to have discussions about other things too and so we're intellectually curious so i basically broke down very um intentionally this week instead of tribally talking about biden versus trump and desantis and all this [ __ ] i just let's talk about first principles like what do we all agree on do we believe we should be fiscally conservative and that the government should stay out of our personal lives like yes okay so there's a starting point where that's about 80 percent of political decisions less government you want to be gay you want to be trans you know you want to have an abortion you don't like it should be all your decision okay gun control do we do any of us have a position what should the position be like and then what when this always breaks down is well how horrible is trump how tara how senile is biden how terrible is the sanchez it all becomes tribal and then you start like losing the script and so what i'm trying to do as the moderator uh is really get us to talk about the first principle stuff and i think the podcast is really important um but it's i was going to put some more energy into the events and podcasts like i had i had an idea for another two or three podcasts that could have been offshoots of all in but they don't want to make it into a business so i'm just going to do those independently so i'm launching two more podcasts um oh cool in september one of them's gonna be called foundry university it's gonna be one time a week where we teach a founder scale that we're already teaching our three portfolio companies but we're just going to make it into a podcast so it's going to be very simple podcast format 15-minute lesson on how to grow your podcast and i got a second one that's going to be a roundtable format but not with the original cast of besties so think of it as like another superhero team um because we have all these people in our orbit who want to come on all in they want to come on this week in startups but this week in startups it's about startups it's not about you know crypto or politics or roe v wade and then we have all these people who would love to sit in like brad gerstner or you know elon or whoever you know who have been on the pod uh draymond you know there's just this whole people in the orbit of all in and the orbit of this week in startups and who are our other besties but they can't be on this all-in podcast because we show up every week so i'm going to do another round table where i'm the point guard again i really like that position and i'm really trying to be the best at it uh you know essentially what i do is i try to add a new skill and be really good at it you know i don't have to be the best but 70 80 90 you know be in the top 10 percentile of any skill which is what i'm trying to do a public market investing and what i'm trying to do as a moderator and you know it's getting noticed i got a bunch of tv deals in the works where people like you're really good at moderating you're not just a good guest would you like to do something on these other network streaming whatever and what would that look like and so i'm considering other opportunities and all in will just be you know this one little thing i wanted to make all in to something bigger but the boys uh and i decided we'll just keep it one thing what motivates you like you have so much on your plate you have a lot of things going on you have all these different businesses you sound you seem super curious still and excited about all this new stuff you're learning like are you are you financially motivated to do all this stuff and you want to make you know billions of dollars or are you i've never been financially i've never i've always wanted to be a millionaire and like not have to worry about money like anybody probably wants but i've never been like i need this incremental you know amount of money um i am playing for fun and joy um and like the love of the game and so when my friend dave goldberg died tragically goldie who would play poker with every else every week i really reassessed my life a bit and then when tony shea died two years ago the day after my birthday two months ago on november 27th uh that was a real gut punch for me as well um because we were good friends and played poker and i would stay with him and i was in vegas and stuff like that and that was very tragic as well and i just reassessed like okay let's just what do i like doing and uh i like talking and doing podcasting i like performing i like writing i like investing in companies i like building products and it turned out i also liked doing certain activities which i never really did because i was so busy working so i turned out i liked skiing a lot i was talking to a friend and everything i described to them of what i liked doing was in service of other people and he's like you realize like none of this is like for you and your joy and i was like yeah that's kind of interesting i do the pod i get joy out of it but really a lot of other people get joy out of it keeps people employed i do investing i do get joy out of it i love building gummies but it's for helping other people and my friend was like what do you actually really love yourself and i was like i love hanging out with my friends playing cards i love skiing uh and so last year i bought a ski house and i skied 40 days which was more than i skied in the last 10 years and i was like you know i kind of interested in this mountain biking thing so i just bought like a thousand dollar specialized nice e-bike and i went four times this last two weeks up here in tahoe and it's incredible and so i'm trying i can hook you up with some some mountain biking gear if you're if you're interested i'm on the board of fox racing which is like one of the biggest mountain biking uh brands i just bought their knee pads and gloves i think oh man i can hook you up if you want anything i don't know i don't take freebies i i always like to buy stuff i hate taking free you can pay you can pay full i'll just get you no i just i like to pay but anyway so that's really what motivates me um i really like i've come to the conclusion that at the end of your life it's a bunch of memories of like these peak experiences victories failures whatever and as best i can tell that's what makes a good life is like these collections of these peak experiences that you laugh about when you're friends and so i'm just trying to actually manufacture more of those incredible peak moments with my kids with my wife with my friends with my business colleagues and just with everybody you know and i'm also trying to figure out like how to spend money to increase my joy which has a poor kid from brooklyn who grew up irish catholic was like really against everything i'm about so like buying this nine thousand dollar specialized bike um or buying the ski house that i bought like if it was five years ago or six years ago i would have suffered immensely about making those purchases um even though i could easily afford them and now i don't suffer over them like i just told my chief of staff go test rob he's a jock and i was like just test drive all the bikes whatever the best one is figure out the consensus and just bring it up to the ski house and uh find me an instructor and boom here i am i got an instructor i'm going to start going on lessons i did a couple of rides on my own and yeah great and talk about peak experiences i came around to turn on a trail that's i went out with my friend ryan block who was one of the editors uh and i consider my co-founder of engadget um and i he took down this like great trail in tahoe i decided i'll go do the same trail i go out at twilight i come around to turn 20 feet in front of me a giant mountain lion i slam on the brakes mountain lion turns around stares at me for five seconds and then walks off indifferently oh my god i can tell you it's one of the peak experiences of my life peak experience has been the i've had some scary experiences in my life uh you know having grown up in brooklyn and been in some pretty crazy bar fights and whatnot um scary moments um this was probably top three most terrorized terrifying moments of my life the the blood came out of my body to have a predator stare at you for five seconds is like nothing i've experienced in my life it never had a predator stare at me for five seconds and i it was beautiful and gave me the you know brain chemistry rush i don't know what got released in my brain but i just thought this is how it ends i'm literally going to spend my final minute or two on the planet my final moments will be trying to survive an attack from a mountain lion it was you know you know pretty terrifying exhilarating and freeing in many ways because i've been contemplating my own mortality because i'm 51 now and two of my friends died in their 40s tragically and you know you start thinking about like what do i want to get out of the last 20 30 minutes days years weeks quarters i don't know what i got left now when you're 20 or 30 you're kind of on adrenaline you're not thinking about that but when you get to 51 and you you start to have a couple of your friends go then you're like man how old are your children i gotta squeeze some juice out of every single orange and i got to enjoy every sandwich like every sandwich counts like just every bite you take just enjoy it it's a blessing it's a mitzvah how old are your children jason so you have two six-year-old twins and a 12 year old all girls and it is the greatest joy and most fun you can imagine so when i'm up here in tahoe i you know i get this window where i take them for every day or almost every day and i don't let people book stuff on my calendar and i've been just taking him to the beach or on a hike or for a walk to dinner and ice cream i give my wife a little time off so she can work on some of her projects and it's just been incredible bonding it's like been this like dream summer that i never had as a kid my parents had to work because we were barely middle class and always behind the april in terms of finances so you know my summer was leave the house at 8 am you're not allowed to come back till 5 or 6 keep yourself entertained on the streets of brooklyn or whatever other borough you can get to on 20 with your true brother so we had a pretty raucous childhood um but that's just been delightful i'm like i'm living some crazy fantasy where i'm by a lake and then getting ice cream cones and walking our bulldogs with these three wonderful children who are laughing and joyful and falling asleep in the car with ice cream on their shirts i'm like i have to chocolate for sure i know i really wanted this childhood but i'm living it now so it's great i have a two-month-old um our first uh little boy have felt that exact thing of like every morning even more interesting yeah and from like nine to ten we go out on a walk in the neighborhood my wife um our son roman and i and i was walking around one day and i was like it was sunny it was like 75 degrees and i was just like this holy [ __ ] you know life doesn't get much better than this moment right here um you know and you don't need more money you don't need any anything else it's like in that moment everything is enough um it's a pretty amazing and it gets more interesting it's a boy so yeah i haven't i grew up with brother so it's i understand the fun of that what's great is you just sort of click into this wonderful um you click into this wonderful um moment where uh you get to relive your childhood and experience everything again so my wife's like oh this house i bought this was like the reason i bought it i'm in a movie theater right now and like i love movies and i take i was taking my 12 year old to the movies every friday it was kind of our tradition and i've just been a fan of cinema my whole life i wanted to be a director or run a movie studio in another life and i was like you know uh my wife was like can you pick a move tonight i'm like yeah i'm just going through all the great movies of my child whatever and i was like what about bob you know i love like that's an incredible movie or you know anything bill murray's in is great so now my kids are old enough and we watch what about bob if you haven't seen that it's like the perfect summer movie because it takes place on an island in the summer bill murray richard dreif is hilarious um and so you get to experience all those things again so with your two-year-old you'll at some point be like hey uh you want to read the hobbit or watch lord of the rings or can i introduce you to star wars or jurassic park and all of a sudden you just get this incredible or can i teach you how to ride a bike or you know let me teach you how to cook and you know all these things start happening that you get to relive for yourself and it's like something very primal and joyful about it i'm enjoying it tremendously absolutely be present as much as you can i think that's a great place to uh to wrap up you've been so so generous with your time of course i really really appreciate it and uh a lot to chew on and a lot too a lot to continue learning i mean if anything except yeah yeah i mean just keep being curious man your curiosity really shines through so super excited to see all the stuff that you continue to build next and uh and we'll be following along with whatever it is so thank you so much appreciate it thanks boys thanks boys let's do it again thanks so much for listening to today's episode if you have any questions that you want featured in a future

Title: Betting Big on Web3 with Li Jin
Published: 2022-07-21 10:00:32 UTC
Description:
Crypto is still the future, are you in or out? Today we discuss why the crypto market needed a reset, explain how to hack back your creativity, and divulge the secret to picking investments in a down market. Hosts Greg Isenberg and Sahil Bloom are joined by guest Li Jin, the mastermind behind the “passion economy,” the co-founder of Variant, and a fundraising savant, who was able to raise her first fund during the onset of the pandemic. Li shares the lesson investors (hopefully) learned from the fall of 3 Arrows Capital, Sahil depicts why creators must have passion for the products they build, and Greg shares the pitch story that is every founder's worst nightmare.

huge fanboy from afar of all of your writings for a long time um and uh and most recently was was excited to read your ownership economy 2022 piece which was it feels like forever ago now i guess it was like late april i think when it came out um and the world has obviously changed a lot around a lot of these things at least prices have maybe the world hasn't which is one thing we're excited to dig into with you but um excited to have you on so thanks for taking the time amidst all your travel yeah thanks so much for having me big fan of you guys as well um greg i feel like you're one of my few irl friends in tech since so many people i now know only virtually um but yeah no it's so nice to be here thank you it's kind of one of the one of the nice features of um of this like new postcovid world you know there's like a lot of negatives obviously that came out of it but the the reach of our friendships i feel like has dramatically expanded over the last couple of years i mean it truly feels like you have friends all over the world and it's not weird like it's no longer weird to say oh yeah most of my close friends i met on twitter or i met in discords or whatever it is that's like a really normal thing that you run into in conversations with people now totally i mean i grew up that way most of my friends were online friends that i met through neopets but i realized that that was not a cool thing when i was a child we need to we need to dig into that now hang on so so wait first off what is neopets i feel like i remember that from when i was a kid like was that like like tamagotchi and stuff like that uh and neopets was that in the same category neopets was this like online game phenomenon in i want to say like late 90s early 2000s um where you basically had a virtual pet you would play games you would earn neo points there was this whole in in-game economy and in addition to that there was a social element which took the form of forums on the neopets site and i would spend all day on the forums talking to people and you know then like going over to aim adding friends and that's that's like my my ages 9 to 11 i have no memories aside from being on neopets that's this is usually where i spent all of my waking hours um i was very neopets popular on the help forum um i knew i recognized you i couldn't greg was definitely under a pseudonym and i pretended to be like 18 years old this is so cool like i just so i just pulled this up i mean this is like there's so many of these things like i feel like we've had this same conversation um greg with like alexis ohanian or even like with gabby a few weeks ago um gabby goldbergly who you probably know from the from the web 3 world of like these um the like predecessors to all of these web 3 things that we now talk about and obsess over like play to earn games and actually infinity and all this stuff like i'm looking at neopets and it literally looks like you know you can just trace back a lot of these things we're talking about today to neopets or to some of these other games that people were playing at a young age 100 neopets was the metaverse but on a dial-up internet connection it looks so cool i like i want to go back i have this um i guess a lot of people probably do but i have this like obsession with kind of like retro things that i did when i was a kid and going back and interacting with them and like experiencing it with the benefit now of new things that i've seen um i've been doing it recently with reading books that i loved as a kid i don't know if you guys have ever done that but like i just went back and read hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy which is amazing if you go and elon musk says it's the most impactful book he's ever read so i was like i'm gonna read it again because i loved it it's incredible but like i've gone back now and i'm on a kick i'm like reading a wrinkle in time i'm reading uh you know i read a hitchhiker's got the galaxy i want to go back and read lord of the rings again and the hobbit again um but there's something about the like nostalgia retro aspect of going back and engaging with these things from our childhood that's so fun yeah i really really agree um this is random but i've basically i've taken about a like ten year break from reading fiction and i just recently got back into uh well two reasons one is i was a little bit burned out of reading fiction from taking so many english literature classes in college and having to read thousands of pages like per month um it was just so it was so much and i remember like pulling multiple all-nighters to try and like finish a book that it just sacked a lot of the joy out of reading for me um and so i was i was kind of like feeling quite exhausted honestly from reading so much fiction um because basically from my entire life up to that point up to college and including college i only read fiction i never touched non-fiction i just thought fiction was so much better i thought it was amazing that you could basically experience the world as someone else like really get into their brains which no other media type allows you to do um but then after graduation i was like okay now i'm a working person i'm an adult i should actually use my free time in a way that is productive and like teaches me something that i can apply to my work um so i started reading exclusively non-fiction and i've been doing that for a long time uh and and then i just recently i recently picked up jane eyre again by charlotte bronte which is one of my favorite novels that i read when i was a teenager and the pros just it like it was like um opening a window after you've closed the room to a very musty room and the air is very stale and you open the window and it's like you know it's just after the rain and it smells amazing that's what reading the first page of jane eyre was like like i forgot writing could be like this it's a beautiful um it's a beautiful way of thinking about it it's a beautiful imagery um so i can see that you've read a lot of fiction in your life because the way you said that was like a very novel-esque way of a way of describing that i so it's interesting the way the way that you characterize your arc of like you read so much fiction because that was what you were studying and you got sick of it and you needed to um you know go towards like business and like you know productive type reading quote unquote um i feel like that's the opposite of most people like my experience was literally the inverse where i read so much you know economics and like non-fiction you know business biographies all of that and i was the like hustle culture guy of you know like listen on 2x speed so that i could get through 100 books a year and like flex on you know how many books i read to people and like that was me and then maybe two years ago like right around when covid started i started just reading fiction for pleasure and like a lot of sci-fi and i feel like it's made me much more intelligent because now all of a sudden like i engage with tons of business content from like newsletters i read your stuff you know other people's things like that's what i read all day so then at night when i read things that are like novels or sci-fi or whatever it is i feel like the sort of amalgamation or like the maelstrom of all these types of information actually allows your brain to expand in new and unique ways yeah you're gonna be uh if you read fiction you're just gonna be more creative period like you're not gonna come up with the idea for neopets after reading zero to one by peter thiel like you're not gonna be like oh my god i just had this amazing creativity like insight and i wanna go and create you know i'm constantly reading fiction um trying to you know interact with creative uh mediums video games comics like you name it to like basically connect pieces in my brain to create creative insights because like my job is to like build things like neopets for ourselves and for clients so like i i kind of need like that's my hack my hack is like how do i how do i bring the most creative mediums to me so those connections happen and one i wonder uh if you agree or disagree yeah well i mean i i i think that all sounds right i don't have the counterfactual i don't know what i would be like if i hadn't spent my entire childhood and adolescence reading nonfiction instead but i think um people often tell me like i write very differently from other people i think i speak very differently than other people i speak like a character in a novel um or um i mean the way you said that about the room and the window opening and the fresh air and the smell outside like the way you described that situation it was described in a way of like someone that i would imagine has read a lot of fiction in their life because you described it with a lot of imagery that in my mind i was like oh i can picture that that entire scene i can picture that versus you know i think someone that had read a lot of nonfiction their entire life yeah probably would have been a lot more like direct and to the point of exactly that and it wouldn't have presented that same imagery so i would guess the counter factual exists there i think yeah the first order effect is it's definitely influenced the way that i write and speak and communicate the second order effect is probably a lot of what you had described greg in terms of um like more creativity maybe more empathy for users and like just tons of different types of users because that is the exercise of reading fiction is like deeply empathizing with various characters um yeah it's interesting to think about yeah i also just the last point to this before we dive into actual you know business business related stuff is like i also have this perception that um the entire like nonfiction book industry um you know business books self-help books like all of that stuff the vast majority of those things are like 200 pages but could have been said in a like two-page or five-page article absolutely and so that troubles me like i don't think you could condense a beautiful novel into two or three pages because the character development and like the whole scenery and the world that's being built cannot be condensed but most of those books are like you read the first five pages and i get it i understand your thesis i understand like your key point of evidence that you just brought up to hook people in and now i can probably leave and so i actually think the newsletter industry and like you know people like you and people like mario at the generalist and you know he and [ __ ] write super long pieces and so i can't even read theirs because they're too long sometimes i need to like listen right there needs to be a newsletter to summarize the newsletter yeah totally and i think there's like a million dollar opportunity in doing that actually just summarizing all the great business newsletters um which is a topic for another day but um i do think that like the newsletter industry and the blogging industry has disrupted um fundamentally non-fiction book writing uh yes because it's just completely agree i think well i think it's a different motivation set on the part of author i think people write books for lots of different reasons not just i want exactly they want to i mean it's it's very much a like kind of life goals like bucket list kind of thing to do um but yeah i agree with you i mean that's why nonfiction has spawned industries that summarize books like blinkist or um like i feel like tldrs were invented for for non-fiction books yeah so i i do want to dive into a dive into some stuff outside of this book topic which i thought was a fascinating opening that i wasn't anticipating um lee can you just give really quickly and it's for my own benefit too because i'm not quite as familiar with with your background prior to variant um you know you mentioned that you had studied english literature and um you know were were very into into reading uh fiction your whole life like what did you study where where did you kind of end up in school how did you get started in the venture industry how did you break into that um and then i want to dive into like you kind of founded the uh the creator economy you're like you were kind of the first writer that i remember reading talking about it and i think he coined the term probably so i'd love to get there but maybe we can just set the stage with a little bit on your background for sure so starting from the very beginning i'm from beijing i grew up there for the first six years of my life then my family and i moved to pittsburgh pennsylvania when i was six years old why pittsburgh my dad was doing his phd in pittsburgh at carnegie mellon at pet at the university that was my dad's first job was at carnegie mellon so that's why i was asking my parents in pittsburgh for many years yeah well the back story was really that my mother was in love with america and american values and freedom and and all of that and really really wanted us to move to america and back then in the 90s really the only way to immigrate legally from china to america was through education and so the phd was like a stepping stone for us to come here um but anyways so then we moved here didn't speak a word in english learned it in school um really yep saw every like every layer of american society because when we moved here we were living in you know the inner city of pittsburgh i went to public school didn't know english learned it through esl and then gradually we moved out of the city into the suburbs where i went to high school and then i went to college at harvard i like to say that harvard plucked me out of obscurity from southwestern pennsylvania um and really brought me into this environment that was really life-changing and transformative for me and initially when i when i first got there i thought i wanted to be a writer of some sort either of books and novels or to be a journalist so i threw myself into that i spent 40 hours a week writing for the harvard crimson um i was an english literature major um and then and then gradually i was made aware that um well actually what happened was was that my mother called me one day and she was like you know it's very hard to make a living as a writer you should study something else she said this much more harshly but that was the sentiment she meant well this is like the immigrant mother thing my mom does the same thing like she still thinks it's ridiculous that i didn't go to medical school and become a doctor like my indian mother you know indian immigrant mother it's like it's definitely an immigrant parent thing it definitely she was like if you look at the job postings on a newspaper where do you see the listings for author there is none like there are no jobs for for you so please study please study something else where you can support yourself um like financial matters were very top of mind given their backgrounds so anyways um long story short i then decided to study statistics and that is what i graduated with so i pivoted 180 degrees um and then years later i found myself in silicon valley working at a startup that built mobile apps that were tailored towards retailers and brands and rewarded users for walking into physical retail stores um and then that company got acquired and then i went to go work at andreessen horowitz so that was my entree into the venture world and i really didn't know that much about venture when i joined i actually cold applied to andres and horowitz on the website as a last-ditch attempt to not have to go to business school which is a whole other story um i i didn't want to go to business school but i had applied and i i didn't i felt like at that age at that point of my life you know that i ought to um basically move on from from my previous job but i wasn't sure what to do and so i applied this to business school but i didn't really want to go i didn't want to take myself out of the workforce so i just think that's most people by the way i think like business school is like the um it's like the uncertainty pick where like people aren't willing to uh to tolerate the like uncertainty of what comes next at that first pivot point in their career and business school is like the easy uh the easy answer like there's some people obviously that really want to go to business school and there's a specific reason but it's a very like reputable thing that your parents will never get met no one will ever like dig you for going it's like a socially acceptable way to wander around in the wilderness and figure that's a good way of putting it um yeah so that's that's how i felt at the time and then and then i just i called applied to andreessen which by the way is like not the not how you're supposed to go about getting i didn't know you could i didn't know that there was other ways of getting jobs this was how naive and innocent i was in my early 20s i thought that people just applied to jobs and that's how they got them i didn't know about warm introductions and referrals and all of that so anyways to my surprise someone actually writes me back this is frank chen who um is is one of the people who works at a16c still and he writes me back and he's like hey you should um you should come in and like come chat with me so i drive over to their office which is very close to where i'm living at the time and have a conversation with him and that kicks off a seven month long process in which i basically go over to their office every week have a conversation meet with other people and finally finally after seven months i get the i get the job and i join the consumer investment team and this is fall of 2016. um i ended up staying for four years um much longer than i had anticipated i thought that i would stay for one or two years go back to product um well after a seven month after a seven month recruiting process you gotta stay for two you're like for at least two years is that there's gotta be something raised now i think they i think they hire anyone that just says crypto in their twitter sorry if you're listening it was a joke greg didn't you pitch andreessen once and like someone fell asleep or something do i remember that story greg or is that not andreessen so that's i i don't know i don't think lee i've ever told you this story maybe i have you pitched me yes i did not fall asleep no we definitely didn't fall asleep i'll tell this you gotta name drop the person okay i'll name drop the person sorry sorry but not sorry so lee we met in 2018 uh andrew chen introduced us right and [Music] you know i was doing islands which was a sort of discord for communities and colleges were were using it and uh you told me you liked what we were doing and you said hey like it's gotten to the point where you know you can pitch mark mark and mark andreessen and and some of the other partners which is if you're an entrepreneur this is kind of like the final stage this is the super bowl of of uh of pitching your startup right here exactly and as someone who [Music] you know i grew up reading about mark andreessen like he's he's kind of a hero in terms of the tech landscape he's created so much of the infrastructure for technology um i was like wow this is really really cool like i'm in it i'm really in it so i'm very excited i show up uh to it's on sand hill road which is like where all these vc firms are and i'm i show up and lee's there and andrew chen's there and mark andreessen is there and benedict evans is there and i'm going through you know i'm having this sort of pinch me moment right because like this is incredible i'm like pitching and i think we had like a 90 minute or two hour conversation i'm getting direct product feedback from mark andreessen like what a legend and in the corner of my eye i see someone sleeping in the middle so i'm like oh i must be like uh you know it's probably a sign greg yeah no it can't it can't be it can't be so i'm like i'm looking mark mark was sitting right across from me so i'm just like i'm gonna focus on mark and talk to mark a minute later i look in the corner of my eye and that same person is still asleep this person was not me no it was not legal this person was benedict evans benedict fell asleep oh no during my my pitch you should have that on your twitter bio greg [Laughter] [Music] yeah yeah that's an amazing story because um i don't know he kind of looks like i guess he looks like he might fall asleep in a pitch um he's an amazing writer i mean i i subscribe i think i pay and subscribe to his weekly newsletter which is amazing and it's like probably one of the best things that i read every week he kind of like it's a it's a for people that don't have it it's like a combination of sort of insights plus curation um once a week and it like basically if you only read one thing a week on the tech landscape it sort of gives you like everything you need um in one swoop but that's hysterical greg everything you need in one sleep to be i don't have any recollection of someone falling asleep thought that is maybe it was greg's like subconscious maybe greg was like nervous about someone falling asleep and so his subconscious showed him benedict evans asleep so i even i actually glanced i think at andrew chen and i think he might have seen it um because i was like we should bring we should bring benedict evans on the show greg and and ask him about this because like he actually he strikes me as a very um honest and like direct person and he might just say like yeah it was super boring bro uh he would definitely tell it like it is i i am going to just take the i'm gonna apologize on behalf of ben evans he's he's a really nice person and i'm to chalk it up maybe to jet lag he he was probably coming back from england and jet lagged or something like that very tired but as the entrepreneur i was kind of thinking like okay do i say something like do i like tap him on the shoulder and be like dude like you okay um like i also was worried about his health yeah i was like is this guy like should we i don't even know it's like should we should we help him like and i was like there was too much stimulation for me between mark and this whole long table between our company being like out of cash in three months or something like there was too much going on you know if it's probably just like to take away from this for me is like if you're a startup founder and you're pitching the partners of a firm uh and one of them's asleep it's probably not gonna work out you might wanna go ahead and walk out of there and i know greg you ended up you ended up just fine and your business got acquired uh shortly thereafter so things worked out for you uh and here we are today but man that is a great uh that is a great graveyard story from the vc trail that was such a quintessentially like pre-covered uh silicon valley vc kind of story um so yeah to continue the story like that was my life sand hill road every single day from 2016 through 2020 basically through until covet happened um and then and then in early 2020 i decided to leave and to start my own fund at that time to invest in the future of online work and that included the creator economy um or what i call the passion economy basically platforms that enabled consumers to monetize their passions and their individuality um so in early 2020 i left i started that fund called atelier ventures which i then subsequently ended up deploying a large portion of into crypto and web sorry to interrupt you was that before covet hit like did you leave and raise that in q1 of 2020 or was that post it was basically in the midst of coven so i i think i started raising in april of 2020 when the whole world was falling apart um yeah that was that was a whole journey like i learned so much that's amazing it's an amazing example of seeing into the future though right like the clearly you started to think about you know the second order effects of some of the things that were happening and i think it was at a time you know when a lot of people were just like oh this guy's following the world's gonna end and you were kind of looking out and seeing like oh wow this unlocks an entire new economy and a ton of people to go and monetize in a way that didn't exist prior totally everyone everyone that i spoke to i remember this clearly in april 2020 told me not to fundraise than in there they told me don't don't raise a fund right now like just chill out wait six months maybe nine months 12 months who knows how long this can last but like this is the worst time possible to to try to raise a new fund um like emerging managers told me this angels told me this lps told me this everyone told me this and i just did it anyway and it was it was definitely really hard i think it's one of those things like where being i mean similar to being a founder you need a degree of kind of exuberance and like irrational confidence and almost naivete to go ahead with it because in retrospect knowing how hard it was it actually does seem kind of crazy to me now that i actually did that um but going into it i was like yeah well no it's gonna be a piece of cake like i can raise like a fund like i'm coming from andreessen ultimately that was not the case like it was so hard and i got told no like 900 times um but anyways the fund like got raised eventually and then i deployed it into a bunch of um yeah like new consumer platforms that enabled people to pursue entirely new like internet based forms of work um so i invested in companies like patreon and sub stack a bunch of early stage companies like stir and pair pop and then i invested a lot into web3 as well so that included um projects like syndicate foundation field guild games um mirror and many others um really because i saw like crypto was this new way for people to earn an income online and not only could they earn an income they were actually earning ownership in the projects that they were participating in uh which i thought was so interesting and something that had never been possible before before crypto um and so i began spending more and more of my time in the web 3 world and ultimately looked up one day and felt like this was the most dynamic and interesting part of the consumer software universe and i wanted to spend a hundred percent of my time there so long story short i decided to join forces with my friend and former colleague jesse walden um over at variant we ended up merging raise fund two together um last fall and are now yeah a partnership of three um myself jesse and then um one other partner named spencer and we've built out this whole team and we're entirely focused on web3 investing across the full stack it's a really amazing story and you know i think it has a lot of parallels to today as well like what you said about the timing of when you went out and raised it and you know the environment at the time and you know the naysayers etc i think it's probably pretty similar to what web 3 founders and potential emerging managers are experiencing now um you know we have this like the pendulum swings right like you go from way like overreaching optimism and like unbounded optimism to it swings the other way and suddenly we're in this environment where personally i feel like we're at like really unbounded pessimism and everyone's like oh everything's dead nothing's gonna ever work again you know the vc's private markets are dead all of that you know pessimism and the reality is it's gonna swing back and it'll be somewhere in the middle but for founders today there's a lesson in there of like you know your your kind of message of you know slight irrationality like you know throwing caution to the wind a little bit as you uh you know if you if you do have that level of belief in what you're building and doing well i think uh so one thing that lee isn't saying because she's quite humble is that she what she was known as you know really the passion economy leader one of the leaders here in the space and i remember when you started fundraising lee for atelier and they checked out put a mini you know small check in and the reason why we put it in was because even though the world was falling apart like if anyone's going to figure it out in the space it's gonna be lee and if you believe in that space um so those are the two things and you have capital i guess those are the three things um the same was true you know i invested in variant fund one um with jesse you know i think was april 2020 or something like that um because jesse what you know he was i believe one of the best crypto managers and he wrote the first thesis on ownership economy um and published that popular blog post and i think the lesson is in in you know sahel you speak about this all the time but like the lesson is really like how do you become the community guy or the frameworks you know girl or the passion economy person or whatever it is and build that audience so that when you do need and ask when you need that ask like you only need a few people to say yes to your fund or a few people you know you only need andreessen to to to fund your company right you only need a couple yeses to create to create momentum yeah i'm looking i mean the way you said that greg i thought was perfect like you know lee um i'm on your website uh you know leadashgen.com and i'm at the bottom and i'm looking at your top posts and all i see is like i'm looking at the dates of these posts and when you were putting out this writing and you know you say that it kind of came together the reality is like you were putting out these amazing posts on this stuff on the topic of you know 100 true fans came out in february 2020 before all this you wrote about ways to measure network effects you wrote about startups on consumer platforms like tick tock etc all of that stuff it was like you know the the 10 years to become an overnight success with these things and so to greg's point um you know i think naval calls this like type four luck which is um you become an expert at something and you build an audience around this expertise and then luck comes to you you know luck comes to you quote unquote um in the sense that like people seek you out for that and suddenly you know you've been putting out amazing content around this you're sharing in public which is a great way to get lucky because you sort of cast these like idea magnets out into the world around all this stuff and now suddenly you know you are the passion economy person and you've built a reputation for that you've shared unique um you know individual ideas around it you're not just kind of like tailing on the back of other people and a lot is possible on the back of that when you do that today's episode is brought to you by element a tasty electrolyte drink mix with everything you need and

four luck which is just genuine passion for the topic like you have to have a genuine like intellectual um curiosity and passion for whatever it is that you're studying in order to have those like novel ideas that you then translate into a blog post but you know like even starting from when my childhood like i i grew up very online i was always on these consumer platforms these ugc platforms creating content on the internet i was vlogging throughout my pre-teen and teenage years and throughout college i had multiple tumblrs and live journals and all of that like i had been primed to think about consumer software and the future of like content creation on the internet from such a young age and i was just genuinely so passionate about it because i saw myself in it and i really really wanted to find a way for people to monetize that passion so i think yeah just like it sounds cheesy but like i just advise people to follow their passions and to have this like intuitive sense of of always thinking about what gives them energy because if they're working on something that gives them energy and that they're truly in love with that they feel like is their life's work they are going to excel at that and they're going to have insights beyond what other people can have you know the way i always think about this is so the whole like you know follow your passion for all your energy i i always personally found it as like it felt abstract to me and i didn't really know what that meant and the what the thing when it clicked for me was the idea of um what feels easy to you like when you're doing it what just feels so easy and like you're in flow and for you that was engaging in these digital communities it was playing games like neopets it was writing it was you know all those things you were doing they felt very easy and so you did them you built a passion around them um and you did the sort of like janky early version of your later things that you were exceptional at throughout your whole life and like i i found that to be a common thread by the way among extremely successful people they like built the you know version 1.0 of their thing accidentally prior to doing the real one like tim urban i had on um the podcast a couple months ago he writes wait but why which is like arguably the most popular blog in the world and before he launched that he had this like weird email thing that he would send to like a hundred friends that basically said what he did during the course of the day and he did it for years like he would just say oh yeah here's what i did today and it was like a few bullets um and it just struck me that like everyone that goes and does something exceptional had the like kind of yucky uh skeleton type version of that just because it felt easy to them and natural um so i do think it's like a call to arms for a lot of people out there if you just if you're trying to figure out what your thing is think about what feels fluid like what just feels effortless to you when you're doing it maybe that's playing video games by the way like and and for you like neopets maybe that felt effortless and there is in this new world that we live in a path within any of those worlds for you to go and monetize and make money and do things yeah plus one i agree with all of that and consistency like yeah like how many threads have you written since 2020 consistently too many weeks right like two newsletters a week for two years i mean a year and a half now we have a friend uh justin welsh and he had a tweet that went viral the other day which i thought was really good and he wrote my social media strategy tweets two times per day threads one time per week linkedin post two times per day weekly newsletter one time per week then each day i spend about 45 minutes interacting with my audience do this for six months and watch what happens wow yeah this is like so so i think there's two sides to this by the way like i love justin i think it's amazing i think there's like the tactician um which is that like i think justin's a tactician i think he's amazing and he's like doing a great job of building a life and you know career and businesses for himself around the internet by doing this by like having that consistency and just like he basically has a blueprint and he follows it he knows it works and he'll replicate it then you have the like uh i don't know the the artist which is like the person like a tim urban frankly who just like writes you know he might write one blog post every three months but you know when it comes out it's going to be like it's going to change your world because he just sits around thinking and writing all the time and like his business model is very different um i don't i wouldn't say one is better or worse um but it's interesting to see like these different kind of ends of the spectrum of doing this um especially i mean it's all it all ties to the passion economy right it all ties to the stuff that that you've been writing and talking about but it is fascinating like the intensity model versus the consistency model and then kind of where they blend in the middle of the hybrid um yeah i'm definitely more on the tim urban side of the spectrum like yeah i'm not consistent at all um i call my newsletter and aspirationally weekly newsletter or maybe it's aspirationally monday monthly i don't even know what what cadence i said i wanted to do but it basically comes out whenever whenever i have some insight or something to share that crosses a bar that's very hard yeah i mean greg you do the same thing and like i think it's very hard julian shapiro our friend greg um who lee you may have read some of his stuff before um also an awesome internet writer and thinker um he's talked about this in the past like it's really hard to send an insight rich newsletter once a week um and the people that do it like ben thompson i like bowed down to the fact that that guy can every single day turn out an insight rich piece of piece of writing is insane to me like [ __ ] once a week you know mario same thing like it's pretty remarkable i think and those are like unicorns in my mind i think most of us um can't really do that uh it's it's just very very difficult so it's interesting to like see those different models of of what works within this within this economy and world um before we lose you because we've got about 20 minutes left um i want to talk about your piece i want to talk about web3 um because a lot has changed since that piece came out although i think the principle is in the body of it still really holds but we've had you know over really over like may and june abroad kind of reset or destruction of of um you know crypto asset prices i'll separate that from like the fundamentals of the crypto world which i'm curious to get your guys perspectives on um but we'd love to just like start out by kind of just getting your thoughts on what has transpired and you know like general perspective on the space and what you're seeing you know in terms of as an investor uh founders going and doing and building and just a general vibe check like vibe check you know quick vibe check lee how are you doing and [Music] and and are you feeling more bullish you know as bullish you know less you know more barriers like asking yeah like how are you doing you know that's very kind well i just got better from kovitz so i'm already doing better than that's great was that an nft week kovid it was yeah yeah man everyone got everyone got it before but i was basically out for like nftmc i didn't see anyone i didn't make it to our own parties um hope everyone had fun at our parties but i wasn't there because i had coven um but yeah anyway so i'm i'm doing pretty well i think to answer your question i think i'm a really strange creature in web3 uh i'm i'm kind of like an aberration in the landscape because i got into web3 for really ideological reasons um so when i was talking about my backstory and how i was i was investing out of this fund that was scoped to the future of online work and and consumer tech like i think one thing that i didn't mention was i had always felt this tension between um the platforms that i was investing in and like the professed vision of enabling anyone to achieve financial stability and economic freedom through their working on these platforms versus what was happening in reality which is that a lot of the value came from the equity value of these companies and that accrued to a very very small group of people investors founders early employees executives etc and notably who's missing from that is the participants on the platforms themselves so i was really drawn to web3 as a way to alleviate that tension and imbalance that i perceived in the platform world wherein i felt like there were huge swaths of people who were actually contributing the value to these platforms but left out of the ownership of them um and so i got into web3 from a mission perspective of how do we make that situation much more equitable how do we make the internet more fair and architect new platforms that actually share ownership much more broadly um and i i say that i'm kind of like an aberration in crypto because i feel like for the last year or so for maybe the last two years of the bull market i felt like that message was oftentimes drowned out by a lot of the price action that was happening or a lot of like you know projects that would launch to a huge fanfare and then like kind of displayed into nothingness there were just a lot of distractions happening over the last few years that i felt like the mission element of crypto sort of got lost in all of that noise and i actually find it refreshing now where we are at this moment because i think a lot of the noise is finally settling down and we can actually focus on what the long-term mission of crypto is like why we're all here in the first place like what are we actually trying to build our mission as investors is nothing short of building a more equitable internet that is why we are in crypto as variant funds like we think crypto can be the basis of a more equitable fair internet that actually enables people to own wealth building assets for the first time ever um and so we're we're still really deeply committed to that vision and that mission and i think finally um like we're we're finally in a market environment in which we can cut through the noise and there's less of like the wild speculation that's happening that i think detracts from that long-term mission do you um do you know like cape cod you were in the boston area for a while you know cape cod yeah um i keep thinking of this as like cape cod i've talked to our friend sean poury about this in the past as well it's like um cape cod you know in the summer it's like everyone goes to cape cod those places are packed it's like the hot place you know all these like uh vacationers come in and rent all the houses all the prices go through the roof everything's insane uh you know and then come labor day weekend it's crazy and like starting in september it starts getting real quiet in cape cod and like all of those people leave and they go back to wherever they live and the people that stay in cape cod and that live there are the locals um and you know they're like the true cape cod lovers and believers and the prices come down and it's like it's the place where they love to live and i keep thinking about that i mean with asset markets in general but like crypto um there were a lot of tourists that were in it not because they understood you know underlying fundamentals or they understood the vision of of you know a kind of a a truly equitable internet as you as you laid it out um but because you know they thought they could make a quick buck or like it was the get-rich-quick scheme of the day and a lot of those people have left um you know and i know a lot of those people and there's nothing wrong with it actually um you know it's sort of a tail as old as time for humans to to chase after those things um but the real builders of the space if it does end up being and fulfilling the promise of you know what a lot of people think or hope um are the ones that are more excited now than they were um because now you know i like it for you guys first off like prices are hopefully going to reset to some extent in the private markets too and you're going to be able to invest in things at a you know a more reasonable price point and generate better returns for your investors which creates a feedback loop of more money flowing into the space um and allows more projects to be built so actually you know in the aggregate that should be good for founders as well um but there's a lot i mean it is a lot to unpack just because of all of the speculative fever that had to get drained out in a short period of time i mean all like the unwinding of three arrows capital and you know the impact that's had on block fi and some some of these other things that you've seen that are more publicized um it really i think it had to happen and it had to happen in tech broadly like the whole tech bubble has sort of pulled back um to get just some of this like crazy speculation out of the markets i agree did you guys see this like i mentioned it just in passing there but did you guys see and follow like the whole block fi ftx uh a little bit yeah i just thought it was so interesting um i mean the whole like story of it is actually not super complicated because basically you know they were uh taking in money from from clients and you know they were loaning it out into what is a super attractive loaning market for crypto assets and so they were generating a great return on that and they were basically passing through a high return to their to their customers and most of it was like over collateralized loans meaning there was um a lot of collateral in the form of bitcoin or other crypto assets um for every dollar of a loan and that's great actually um the challenge is these are super volatile assets over collateralized is good until something drops 60 percent and all of a sudden the over collateralization is not super helpful and so you know generally speaking what happened was there was you know a couple of these hedge funds that got liquidated and collapsed like three arrows capital and these places like block fire like voyager has been another big one got smoked by losses and and had to you know take pretty dramatic actions to avoid you know being completely bankrupt and losing client funds um but you know the thing that i found so interesting was like so that business was valued at what like four billion dollars or something last year ftx is now you know under a definitive agreement to acquire block five for like i i don't really care how you know the ceo positioned it you know with the with the revolving line of credit that's not really enterprise value it's not like buying the equity but like basically for up to 240 million or something like that um it had been reported that it was for 25 million which i imagine is like the low end of what it could possibly be if everything goes to hell but it's pretty remarkable um that you can have a business you know raise money at a four billion dollar valuation and all that you know frankly like the employees who came on and got equity at that valuation and have it literally be worth you know basically nothing right like pennies on the dollar um from that deal it's just like it's a little bit shocking just on the surface of it yeah i i totally agree and i think um i mean there's there's just like so many lessons and implications from all of this um like one thing that i'll call out is like i think i think it all gets conflated together in the news media and in the minds of like the broader like retail investor market but i would distinguish between these like centralized companies like blockbuy um that are um built on top of crypto assets but really like kind of building a proprietary business around that where it's you know lending money to actors and institutions that aren't super transparent to the end users and so on and so forth and exposing themselves to a lot of risk um i would distinguish between that versus like the world of decentralized finance or defy wherein things are very much transparent it's all on chain all the smart contracts are auditable um users know that is a very important that's a very important point that you made because i think someone i saw it on twitter somewhere you guys might have seen it but like so you know block fi is like centralized finance uh voyager is the same way um there's like a single point of failure in those systems right and like the equity that you know the value that was lost from 4.6 billion or whatever it was to the you know the deal pennies on the dollar that's like you know tiger global and bain capital like it's not you know people um and client funds are actually going to be protected in this deal with ftx which is fantastic but the the point you made about defy like i think that the biggest protocols like compound or maker dow they actually didn't experience any of these massive issues in this rundown they actually operated and functioned quite effectively with this massive drawdown um which is an important point what for people that question d5 and the merits of it i think there's plenty of reasons to question it but this probably isn't one actually because it seemed to function well in what was a massive drawdown exactly exactly all of the d5 protocols are still working they've been incredibly resilient during this period of broader turmoil and i think it's really important to note that because in those instances in in the d5 world users know exactly what is happening with their funds how it's being pulled um what's going to happen once they deposit their funds into a lending pull etc versus for something like block fi when users deposited their funds i think they were just messaged the interest rate and they probably had no idea that it was you know ultimately being you know sent to 3ac or whomever else like there is a very clear distinction between those two worlds of centralized i think it's called cd5 like centralized d5 versus actual d5 so i would i would be very clear in drawing that distinction g5 is still working as expected and continues to like come along i think unfortunately like it does get conflated together in the minds of general consumers and i think in the short term this is going to represent a headwind to broader consumer adoption unfortunately because i think broadly speaking like most normal americans are gonna look at what's happening right now and just think oh my god like crypto is imploding like all of crypto under this umbrella of crypto is like not doing well and and things are um you know getting marked down significantly and people are losing money um i think that that is definitely going to be an impact of it and then i think what this also exposes is that is the need for more consumer protections and disclosure of who is um representing certain projects in a certain way when people have exposure financially to a certain project success having to disclose that just like they do in the securities world or just as they do for advertising purposes on social media like i think there were a lot of instances over the last year where people promoted you know not just lock by but a whole range of different projects didn't disclose that they were actually being compensated for that or that they were investors and ultimately like you know obviously have an incentive to talk about it in a certain way that's really positive and yeah retail investors um ultimately were harmed in those situations and i think that's really sad um let me ask you on that because because i think that's a really important point it's one that's not often talked about um you know one of the things that i've seen people criticize about the crypto industry and web 3 in general is like this idea that vcs are like dumping their bags quote unquote on retail um and that you know they're basically like buying into a token and in the pre-sale uh marking it up with a follow-on investment and then as soon as it starts being liquid and tradable they're exiting it at a huge markup to retail who you know is then kind of caught holding the bag quote unquote for you know for any drops in price my experience personally you know i haven't done a ton of like out of my fund or personally i haven't done a lot of like pre-sale investing but i've always seen there be like lockups investing periods for at least like the most reputable projects like the ones that i see big vcs getting into i've always seen them having like 12 to 24 month lockups basically to prevent from this happening like the same way your startup equity gets you know vests over a certain period of years is that like is that a real problem do you see people that are actually able to do that or do most of these projects have those type of lockups so usually um i i would say in the deals that i've been a part of lockups are very very common if not just universally present and furthermore those lock-ups are really long um like multi-year lock-ups and for venture firms i mean venture firms are structured as usually 10-year funds where we have a 10-year time horizon to achieve our fund returns and so people are not investing for a quick flip or to invest on a short time short time horizon i think obviously there's lots of different capital allocators out there there's not just the venture firms there's trading firms there's hedge funds investing in crypto so i'm not entirely sure if um you know all of them are stipulating that there's going to be a lock up or perhaps people are negotiating differently but i think lock-ups are really really important to create that long-term alignment yeah yeah i completely agree i gotta ask you before selfishly before we leave um what does a web 3 version of neopets look like and can you describe it um yeah that's a that's a really really good question um i haven't thought about this i think neopets was essentially a play to earn game before the term player actually existed so there was an in-game currency called neopoints that you would earn by taking various actions you could earn it through investing in their virtual stock market you can earn it by selling items in your shop or by playing games but that in-game currency was just that it was an in-game currency that had no connectivity to like us dollars there was no way to like actually take that near point and like convert it to any any fiat currency um and furthermore like neopoints were subject to whatever like you know economy they designed like it could be inflated they could create so many more neopoints etc there was no transparency into that so i think the web 3 version of neopoints there's probably lots of lessons to be learned around designing play to earn economies i i think someone's gonna crack this actually like so far um the play to earn games that we've seen take off haven't had exactly sustainable tokenomics but i think in this next cycle someone is going to crack that and design a game economy that is actually sustainable and functions and neopets was really really amazing because there were both um ample ways to earn um earned neo points but there were also a ton of different ways to spend your meal points so you could spend them on items you can spend it like upping the attractiveness of your pet painting it into different colors etc buying furniture for your virtual home like it was really this very expansive virtual world and economy and i think that holds a lot of lessons for game designers to both like create the mechanisms mechanisms for earning but also to make sure that people have ways to continue to spend and therefore demand the token on a long-term basis yeah i have two cut through the noise like i know nothing about plate iron outside of you know my like general uh reading and and what not like i've never built anything in the space but i have two like simple rules that i think need to exist for someone to build a thriving play to earn game number one um people have to get utility from playing not just from making money like there has to be people who play because they love it like you have neopets and number two i think there needs to be outside dollars coming into the system not from gamers and the way that i think that happens is like neopets oh maybe my guy can wear nike shoes in neopets and so nike is excited to like put their brand in this and there's like all of a sudden brand dollars or outside dollars and ecosystem dollars coming into this environment and i think the combination of those two creates a much more sustainable environment because now i don't just rely on you know effectively ponzi economics of like you know new dollars coming in to fund returns to old money um i have like a truly like self-replicating system that exists so um that's my like thing if i'm looking at them that's what i'm looking for so a slight edit on the second the second characteristic that you mentioned so i i do agree the first one needs to be in place which is that the game actually needs to be fun it actually needs to be played and users want to be there for like intrinsic reasons not just to earn and that ties in um well to the second characteristic that it needs to have which is that there needs to be players who are net like putting in money into the game versus extracting out from the game there needs to be people who have like net inflows versus net outflows like all the net outflows are the people who are earning um but there needs to be another contingent of players which does exist in most games it's the whales who are spending more money than they earn out and that is the only way that the economy of the game can be imbalanced without necessarily relying on the ponzinomics of new players depositing money in therefore like earlier players can cash out and so it needs to perpetually grow otherwise it collapses so it needs to get those players like that segment of whale users in the game paying um to enhance their experience and being happy to pay like on a net basis um depositing money into the game's economy for it to work lee do you think the winner of the this play to earn ecosystem is gonna look primitive like a neopets like when you went to neopets it like felt pretty primitive web-based um or do you think it's going to be from a triple a game studio like is it going to look more like fortnite or is it going to look more like neopets there's a good closing question greg i have an answer i have an answer but i'm curious lee's perspective i think you can do a lot with a really primitive game i i don't think a game needs to be so visually fancy to compel the two characteristics that we just mentioned i think you can get there with pretty simple game dynamics um like what neopets had neopets was literally playable on a dial-up modem um and so i think those are the games that are going to figure it out first in advance of the aaa games that probably will take five years to come out i like it greg i think the i'm with you lee i think the [Music] the vibe i'm hearing from a lot of game developers right now and game designers is it needs to be this aaa crazy metaverse 3d let's go take three years and raise a hundred million dollars and build this crazy ecosystem i think it's gonna look way more like neopets than it is fortnite initially all right i'll take the other side of this bet just because i don't want to have three people agree with it i think it's going to come from a triple a game developer but do you believe that yeah i do i just think that um i think that the game experience and like absolutely having an immersive insane game experience is going to be really important but we can argue it more when you say aaa game developer what do you mean do you mean like coming like from the makers of like epic or yeah i think they're gonna have to create like a um you know like a separate entity that kind of allows it to be more free ownership um and it'll come from one of those big studios not i actually don't think it'll be a new studio that raises money here's why i think you're wrong so [Music] if you look at what happened with ubisoft ubisoft created was going to do some nft [Music] dynamics in one of their games they used the most green block chain tezos which basically is super green and they had such a big backlash that it sent a ripple effect to all major game studios that if you are gonna do play to earn if you're gonna do nfts you can't really do it from your there's just so much of a backlash you can't really do it from uh the mothership uh it has to be like an independent game studio yeah it has to be like and i take that point yeah i think that's true like the there's a big uh there's a big uh hold up like around the terminology and the gaming community doesn't love it um so i i hear you i i'm happy to debate this further i think it'll be interesting to see maybe they'll set up a separate entity that's like you know a shell company exactly people are creative that's what's gonna happen thank you so much this was awesome um super super excited to release this you're amazing and um people can find you on on twitter and you're writing and they should check out variant fund as well

Matthew ball uh you know a complete legend in the in the writing uh in the technology world you know I first encountered your work basically while I was like sitting around by myself during covid and I think probably there were a lot of people who have a similar experience as I do which is um you know covet started suddenly there were a lot of changes in the world um probably uh underselling it in that regard and we were all looking for things to do and things to learn about and for me one of those things was trying to understand where technology was going there was this like massive shift in the technological ecosystem and you were one of the people that had this unique ability to distill all of this insane complexity that was happening happening in that ecosystem and deliver these amazing insights um and you know I dug into your work and started learning more about you and as it turned out that wasn't the beginning of your journey uh as a writer you had been doing it for many years prior um but I want to talk and maybe start before we get into all the specifics of your book and some of the things you're doing today with like your journey um because I think this you know this book is the culmination of a long journey for you and one that you've been on for for a while as a writer and also just as a person and developing your own patterns of thinking so maybe we can just start there like what is your um your map of reality uh Matt like how did you kind of form that map of reality where are you from what is your background and uh let's see where that takes us well first of all thank you for the really kind words it's it's such a treat and honor to be told that I'm great at distilling complex information because that is of course what you do on a day-to-day basis and so I'm hearing that from an expert thank you my background so I'm Canadian my OU's will give me away you're talking about spending time during the pandemic I've lived in the states for more than a decade most of my Canadian accent had subsided and then I spent most of 2020 in Canada and a lot of it has returned but so I grew up in Canada from a fairly liberal family my parents both worked in government my father was a speechwriter so we get a little bit of the sense around the genes for writing and my mother was a policy advisor and so they had always really instilled a love of learning reading was a very important part of my upbringing intellectual curiosity was key and my specific path to writing really reflected that I was working at Accenture as a corporate strategy consultant in their technology media and Telecommunications practice and I was learning a ton that's the incredible thing about management consulting but you usually don't have an opportunity to express it your Junior the partners lead the delivery even if you disagree on the thesis and so I started writing for myself really because there was no audience what I thought where I thought things were going and I slowly started to pick up I remember when slate picked up and wrote about one of my essays I remember when Reuters did I have the screen caps on my computer still because I was stunned and I've kept them ever since what year is that I think that was 2012. oh late 2011. okay because I was going back like I was on your site poking around at some of your earliest works and earliest essays I'm fascinated and we've talked about it on several episodes I talked about it with Tim Urban who you must know from wait but why like all of these people that I consider these uh Titans Now of um of really like of idea creation and like the intellectual Gauntlet as it were they all started with some like kind of janky version of whatever it is they're doing today and they were doing some like really simple version of it before becoming who they were and it's not dissimilar to like you know someone starting a small company and it was you know small for a really long time it takes 10 years to become an overnight success it's a short way of saying it um but you know your earliest pieces on your website I can find her like in 2015-ish time range and like already starting to talk about you can see when you read them the seeds of these ideas that have now grown and grown and grown over time so it doesn't surprise me when you say that you know you were starting to hammer these things out in 2012 and that people were starting to notice totally and whenever I'm asked about how I write or how long I write the answer is usually I get really inspired and obsessed with sharing something I'm either frustrated by The Narrative or feel like I have a different perspective to add and I write over a month and a half most of my essays but that's always a limited perspective because I've always found that my most successful essays are by far those that I've taken a second pass at usually a year year and a half later if you go through my website you'll see the tick in the talk every time my first big metaverse essay was the second time I took a crack at that thesis last year I wrote a nine part series the metaverse primer that was the backbone for this book and is you know I hope 20 times better and the result of a hundred times more writing and so I think that looking at the decade-long success in edification and learning process is key but also just remembering most of them were my second at bats the ones that really connect with the ball yeah ball pun intended I'm gonna have to make that punt over and over again unfortunately you're the baseball player yeah I'm holding a baseball too it's like my fidget toy um so when did you I mean when did you actually start to get obsessed with technology like we you mentioned you loved reading growing up you're intellectually curious were you a Sci-Fi lover or were you reading like business type books no sci-fi and fantasy for sure okay I remember going through the Dragon Ball phase in the early 90s but I owned a business or you know quote unquote owned I had a business in the early 2000s flipping blackberries on Craigslist huh I had a really good sense of what the value of these different devices were and it was weird at the time if you remember there were blackberries that had Wi-Fi but no GPS there were blackberries that had GPS but no Wi-fi then there were the zero zero zero models that had neither and it was also this weird point in time where we were still getting a 600 device for 99 and so when someone wanted to sell those devices second hand there was no real price Discovery people just said I paid 99 bucks for it and I can get 300 bucks on Craigslist I'll take it but I was sitting there saying no the market price for this is 600 bucks so I would just go around Toronto at the time buying up all of these devices and then flipping them usually to people who worked at a bank didn't care about the extra 50 bucks just wanted the device now and so that was helpful for you when you were doing that you know old enough that I wasn't letting my mother know that I was doing cash deals in a subway station which I chose because there were cameras above but I think I started doing that when I was 12 or 13. wow maybe I love these stories as a side note of like uh you know people I admire today like their childhood hustles like those little things that people do you know the like lemonade stands that a lot of these people had you know and a lot of them for people that are now technologists did revolve around some form of technology and like you know um jailbreaking iPhones and doing things like that you know it was um it is definitely a Common Thread that you find today it's almost like if you could invest in an index fund of all of the kids that are doing stuff like that today I bet you'd turn out pretty well you know uh 10 15 20 years in the future um okay so you were a Sci-Fi lover you loved fantasy um I'm in the same boat by the way like all of that stuff I'm actually going back now and on a big kick over reading some of the Sci-Fi stuff that I loved as a kid like which probably a lot of it resonates with the stuff you're interested in today and that you're writing about you know like Ender's Game and um some of those but I don't know like uh Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy which Elon Musk often talks about as being one of his favorite books like that stuff is just so so good and it's so great to reread because you find these common threads um that somehow like tie to the reality that then has happened and not just in the technology sense which I think a lot of people think about but even like The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has things in it where you're like it feels like it predicted Donald Trump being elected president in some of the ways where they're talking about things early on so it's quite quite amazing um I want to talk about that concept of like threads through reality it's something I think about a lot as like a general framework especially around technology where um you have these ideas that have the seeds planted a long long time ago and that continues to grow and that thread continues to run throughout history and now suddenly it becomes very real and you can see the kind of um you know the blooming of that plant and I feel like that is a really good framework for thinking about this concept of the metaverse and and what you're writing about today because you talk about it in your book and I don't want to give away too much the book is absolutely fantastic and we'll put in the show notes all of the information for where people can get it but you talk in the early part of the book about some of those threads and I'd love to just have you walk through a few of those like where did those seeds of this metaverse idea start and how are you kind of tracking them over time to where they are today so this is a really fun place to start because we're situated in this point where the narrative around the metaverse is either hyper acute we're talking about Facebook's vision of the metaverse or we're talking about the metaverse as a buzzword in 2022. but of course if you widen the aperture a little bit we know that the term comes from 1992 and so we start to look at this as a three decade exercise many of the leaders in the space epic games Nvidia the seventh largest company globally were founded in the early 90s for this era but in fact as you're teeing up you can go back to the 1930s and that's where we really start to see science fiction through popular Works describe these ideas not in the term metaverse that comes decades later but in idea these virtual playgrounds AI nurseries using holography and 3D TVs VR goggles and then parallel to that is the development of the Technologies which produce virtual experiences they start in the 1940s mainframes emerge in the 1950s the first really 2D based metaverse experiences 2D text versions of Roblox emerge in the 1960s and 70s and so we have these two parallel paths that bring us to today where the technology to realize the long considered Vision starts to feel like a practical business opportunity a practical product rather than just a Fantastical one it's so interesting the way you said that I thought was very clarifying for me of like um how it stops feeling like a Fantastical one as you as you kind of progress through time because you know you always hear that quote of um you know like the the things of the future or feel like um the toys of today or something like that I don't know if it's Chris Dixon who originally said it but someone in that General realm uh it's Dixon yeah and that's how I think about a lot of these things like in your book you talk about Stanley winebaum and I think it was like Pygmalion spectacles uh cite something very specific but he had like VR like goggles or Philip K dick and um the world creation device and these science fiction authors were writing about and kind of crafting something that felt like a toy and I imagine when you were reading it back then it was like this childlike curiosity and wonder that you would have with learning about those things and now you fast forward to today and there are people building those exact things as part of this future as the infrastructure of this future that were that we're envisioning so it is I mean it is quite amazing the one other thing that jumps out to me and I'd love to hear your perspectives on it is so much of uh the the metaverse of what we had read in kind of Science Fiction over all of those decades was very dystopian you know like whether it's Stanley winebaum or whether it's snow crash or whether it's ready player one which is like my favorite example of it candidly just I love that love that book and my wife still makes fun of me um for loving the movie because I think the book was actually much better than the movie for what it's worth yeah um but you know a lot of them are very dystopian it's like oh the world has gone to [ __ ] and so uh here is this alternate world that is created where people spend their time because it's so much better than the reality even the Matrix right it's like the same kind of General principle why do you think that is or like and do you think that that has had a negative effect on societal perceptions of the metaverse and what it means for you know our Collective future great question does it have a negative effect absolutely and certainly if you are suffering from some form of confirmation bias it reiterates that confirmation or that bias there's an understandable hesitation about enlarging big texts involvement in our lives and it's actually very easy to look at the big Tech obsession with the metaverse for decades and to say it's techno feudalist capitalist trying to enslave us or put us to work in yet another plane of existence and of course the fact that as you've described the metaverse in snow crash The Matrix in Neuromancer The Matrix in the Matrix or dystopic doesn't help but we should keep in mind that at the root of most fiction is drama and human drama tends to be the most potent form of drama put another way there's a reason why most novels aren't set in Utopias they're not very interesting except when they go wrong and so I look beyond that and of course I use all these lines throughout the Book of Neil Stevenson trying to warn us away from a too literal read he says keep in mind I was just making [ __ ] up as I go along but with that in mind I think it is more helpful to look Beyond a fictional representation from even a string of influential authors to the experiences Second Life the text-based worlds of the 60s and 70s roadblocks fortnite they are not designed on subjugation but self-expression collaboration creation kids who are in these adults who are in these environments talk about how they feel good how they connect more with individuals that doesn't mean that technology can't be used for ill but I would say stress the experiences that have been in development and experienced by billions at this point rather than a string of authors writing a Sci-Fi novel yeah you hit on several really important points that I want to double down on first off Neil Stevenson correct me if I'm wrong author of snow crash which is kind of like the first book that talked about the metaverse he you know it was dystopic um but he had a outsized impact on the future in terms of his involvement in technology right like he was uh early on with uh blue origin with with Jeff he was the first employee yeah first employee of blue origin so he wasn't just some like sci-fi author that did nothing else right like he ended up becoming part of blue origin um I think he's still a senior advisor to it it's like you know the second most important um uh uh space technology company in the world um I think like the early creators of um Google Earth like Keyhole were um uh relying on and like learning a lot from him magic leap um you know VR company uh that raised a ton of money uh was also you know tied to him in in a lot of ways so he he had an outsized impact from an actual technology standpoint as well well and then the other point you made is a a really interesting one because I feel like I've heard this over and over again on this show and more broadly and talking to um sort of like this next generation of leaders in the technology landscape that their most formative experiences growing up were in Virtual Worlds and whether that virtual world was like an aim chat room or whether it was Minecraft or whether it was Roblox for some of the younger uh younger kids it's really amazing and a lot of them say like look we were kind of nerdy we didn't really feel like we had that sense of community in the real world um and with kids at school we didn't fit in in the way that we were supposed to into that like nice neat um you know square into a square and so these worlds were our way of self-expression and like we had um Gabby Goldberg on who's a I mean she's amazing 23 year old investor at tcg crypto you should meet for sure and she was like um telling us that she she was selectively mute which um effectively meant she didn't speak for like a four year period of her life and her Escape was in chat rooms like she was in these digital worlds engaging and that was where she made her friends and expressed herself and so she says that it's now so logical for her to engage in this new kind of crypto economy and in discords and interact with people that are pseudonymous um it's really quite amazing the unlock it can have for people's mental health and you know and and helping kids feel like they have communities and that they can be a part of something that doesn't just rely on being normal quote unquote that's that's totally right I think of two stories one comes from the Shopify founder and CEO Toby Luca and he talks about the fact that Starcraft was more important than anything that he ever learned in school and he talks about it because it's resource allocation it is fitting in with a team it is understanding when what you're best at is not necessarily what you should contribute to the team relative to its needs and he talks cheekily about learning that the best strategy is sometimes doing things to distract your competitors rather than to fortify your own kind of overt offense at the end of the day we're talking about this as a tool set and what you're discussing with Gabby and with others is providing them with an increasingly fertile environment to build to try to test to learn and to co-experience one of the best things that we've experienced recently in gaming has actually been input devices supporting those with different abilities if you're not familiar you should look up Xbox's accessibility controller it's so clear that there is not a traditional business case for this type of device it's designed for those who have no limb Mobility those who are constrained in it those who frankly can just speak or just move using a straw and their mouth and the premise is that Virtual Worlds which require very different physical abilities should be the single place in which we have the most people able to participate most often with the greatest range and if you believe in network effects one of the most potent discoveries of the digital era you believe actually we may not have a direct business case for producing and distributing this device relative to what they can pay us and what we can charge for but the value that comes from bringing more people into the network which enriches everyone else's experience gets us there that's inspiring yeah extremely expiring I would encourage everyone to look this up by the way the Xbox adaptive controller um it it does look quite amazing they have a video on the on the home page of it that is um you know really inspiring and and heartwarming I actually it reminds me of a conversation I had I'm gonna name drop so I apologize in advance um conversation I had with Tim Cook who's been a mentor and friend for for many years um and he was talking about this exact thing it was at an Apple annual shareholder meeting and someone you know there's always a few people who kind of ask the like gotcha question at those things right like they're trying to trip up the executive and someone asked him um will you commit that Apple will never make a decision that is not Roi positive for the company like directly Roi positive for the company um and he responded uh and basically said no um he said no I will not say that and I'll give you an example and the example he gave was something like this he said um apple has a commitment to accessibility we create you know accessible content for people that are blind and there is absolutely no business case I can make to you that all the resources that we need to develop that are going to be Roi positive in terms of the additional sales and margin that it creates us as a company but it's the right thing to do and it is core to the values that we are trying to create as a company and love them or hate them as a company and I know people say all sorts of things about about Apple you know detractors Etc I thought that that really resonated and I thought it was really interesting and clearly you know Xbox similar similar set of values around that but it is that principle of the internet and the founding principle of the internet and of Technology of accessibility and opening up these worlds and being like truly positive some right of like creating a bigger a bigger pie for everyone um I would hope holds true as we think about this next era of the internet and the metaverse um I feel like that does lead us to um a natural point in this conversation where I do want to talk very specifically about the metaverse we've been winding around it a lot talking about and honestly Society and the media has wound around this a lot over the last two years you've been writing about it and talking about it for much longer than anyone else um you know several years probably five plus years before it became Facebook's uh name um you were writing about it uh you became as a result of all of your writing on it I think the like leading Authority on this topic rightfully so as you would just spent more hours thinking about it and and kind of battle testing all of your Frameworks and thinking um maybe we just start with uh the fact that your book is really the first time I've seen a comprehensive definition that feels understandable of what the hell is the metaverse when people talk about it what does that mean um would you mind just giving us the like fine points of that sort of at the high level what does the metaverse mean to you sure so one of the fun things about this is we get to differentiate between a technical definition and a description and what that actually means experientially and by that I mean go to Wikipedia and read the definition of the internet the technical definition is an Internet working standard TCP or the Internet Protocol Suite it's a little bit more helpful to describe the internet it talks about a network of networks supporting the World Wide Web email Communications file sharing and so forth and that does not get very close to describing what the internet does today what applications were built on it and how it changes the world and I don't mean that as a hedge I mean this because I'm going to describe the metaverse not Define it and that is a massively scaled and interoperable network of 3D rendered real-time Virtual Worlds which can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of people each with an individual sense of presence that's how I describe it because it allows me to hit on all of the keywords synchronous persistent sense of presence but experientially we are talking about a parallel plane a virtual plane that we can all access at the same time individually and that's living that remembers what we've done what's fascinating about that is first of all the technology to even have this sort of discussion is pretty new talking about operating something we can all access you and I can often struggle to connect to a zoom reliably and that's just a video feed on a half second delay but secondly the technical complexity involves building for things that we never have to think of in the real world we never say there are too many people in Idaho for Idaho to exist we never say you can't carve your name into that tree because the Earth doesn't have the processing power to remember the carving and so those keywords are designed to express what we need for us all to be able to access the same live modifiable copy of a parallel plane so there's so much here that I want to that I want to dig into um so first off you know I remember reading on this last point of like these random things that you don't think about about the technology that needs to be developed and that is is being developed presumably um to enable this one of them that jumps out to me from one of your prior pieces is this idea of everyone actually existing in the same plane at the same time and I remember it in the context of your um it was your piece on the Travis Scott concert that happened in fortnite and I forget what the number was but it was some like 20 million people like it was some absurd number of people yeah 28 million people break it down I'll bring it down for you yes please I love this I find it really fun I'm excited that you share that perspective so 28 million people participated in the quote-unquote live Travis Scott concert yeah let's start from the perspective Travis Scott wasn't live he was broadcast live but everything that he was doing the animations the vocal track that had all been done previously but there weren't actually 28 million people participating in that concert there were over 250 000 simultaneous simulations of that concert none of which were precisely in synchronization I mean some of them probably were but think of them as being 20 50 80 milliseconds separated a minute separated and each of those simulations was split into groups of 50 to 100. and that's because we don't have the technology required for even 200 people really to be in what we call a richly rendered virtual environment when you play fortnite fortnite has a hundred players in it it kind of cheats through game design to get you there why because the map is two and a half kilometers by two and a half kilometers and so for all intents and purposes most of the players don't exist by the time you come to one another most people have been purged and so even when we think of these experiences having dozens of people it's only through brilliant game design that we pull it off that's so interesting okay so now you're kind of sending me down a rabbit hole on this so in these game worlds it it works because we're spread out as individual as players within this game like if 500 people were to try to operate in a very tightly confined space Within These worlds within a fortnight game it would actually like reduce the latency of the game because it would start struggling with it well think of it as a simple way to think about it is the number of operations that can be processed per second and those are scarce now how can we manage that you can have a lot of people able to do very little or you can have few people able to do a lot so one of the ways that the Travis Scott concert actually manages is they turn off lots of functionality right you can't build for example you can't equip any weapon in many concerts they actually take away your dance moves you get to pick from Two and so what they do is their scarce resources for computing power and the question is how do you allocate them more people fewer things more things fewer people got it got it okay so you kind of have like a fixed pie and it needs to be allocated in a certain way in order for this to operate and function what is the actual just from a technology standpoint as you think about that like so so that is a fundamental constraint on us getting to um the you know the end state that you're in Ready Player One everyone yeah yeah exactly of us getting to that end State what is the actual technological constraint there like what would need to be true uh for seven billion people to be able to operate in a you know persistent environment together so the basic answer is computing power more of it okay Chris Dixon has this line that says we've always run out of computing power because as more is made available we go after harder problems the number of people we can render in a virtual environment is a good example when we can put more in we put more in and therefore run out of what's spare there are two ways to answer that that is more power in your device or more power in a remote data center the challenge with the latter is as we know the internet is not reliable it often spikes we can struggle to have a high quality video conference and therefore we should think of this adage that has kind of fallen out of usage that comes from the 1990s from Sun Microsystems the computer is the network and so when we're thinking about the metaverse a virtual persistent network of simulations we want to think about the Network's combined computing power not just that of your device how we're going to solve for that is not yet clear some talk about decentralization not just in the blockchain sense but in the idea that think of the solar panel model if your house has solar panels up top and you have Excess power generation or capture you can lend it out to your neighbor rather than needing to take it far away from the grid but in strict technical terms the general consensus advocated by Folks at Intel and meta is a thousand Factor increase in computing power wow we are up about a hundred since two thousand so we need a thousand on top of that wow although I guess you know if you if you map out the way technology tends to accelerate um maybe a thousand X is not quite as crazy as it's you know it's not linear right like if it's been 20 years to go 100x you know it's it it maybe stands to reason that there are these step function improvements that make that faster than you might otherwise assume yeah and look the the field of quantum Computing is one of those other areas where we think in terms of Fantastical ideas this is a Jetsons thing it's not a human thing but there's increasing consensus that that technological problem will solve within our lifetime in which case we're no longer talking about Moore's Law traditionally defined that chartable predictable increase in computing power we're talking about you know the discovery of electricity versus the use of the flame for light competition for great talent is more brutal than ever almost every startup I know struggles to hire fast enough to keep up with demand to be able to hire better and faster you need a trusted source of pre-vetted candidates lemon.io is a place like that they have a network of Engineers from Europe and Latin America and every candidate has already been tested and interviewed by their team you'll ask me how it's different from hiring on your own you can have an engineer start working on your project within a week instead of within months you don't waste your time on candidates that aren't qualified you'll have easy access to Global Talent without having to go through dozens of job boards and finally it's more affordable than hiring local talent so if you need to expand your engineering team or just delegate some of your work use lemon.io you can also claim a special discount for where it happens podcast fans visit lemon.io room to receive a 15 discount for the first four weeks of work with a developer you won't regret it it's me it's a little mind-bending for me like when I start to think about this this does the same thing to my head as you know a conversation with Tim Urban on the immensity of space and like the cosmic calendar uh you know and thinking about those massive uh leaps forward as a society this is like it's it is a bit mind-bending for me the the other thing you know you hit on uh decentralization one thing when I read your definition that I keep thinking about is this whole idea that there needs to be a standardized Ledger across seven billion people or however many people are operating in this world of what has happened right like there has to be some way of if I go in and do something it's somewhere stored like that I did that thing whatever it was whether I transact or whether I died or I gained points killed someone whatever and then I leave and I come back in that needs to have been stored somewhere within some open Ledger that is accessible no so a bunch of different ideas there right there's a question of does it need to be open not necessarily right open as in readable to anyone and in fact one can certainly imagine many instances in which we don't want that information to be provided can you use a blockchain to store your 23andMe results yes do you necessarily want that to be on an open Ledger not necessarily but we do have these fundamental questions of where is the record stored and right now we actually have this privilege of the fact that were mostly expressing our physical existence in digital space not virtual ones right Facebook is not your life even if two young girl or boy it feels like their life but you're expressing it right it's a photo of what you did you didn't do it there your assets and your wealth exist in the real world not in the virtual world when you come into these questions about the reverse that you work inside a virtual plane you don't just use your iPhone to work through the internet when you have virtual assets of extreme importance what's the governance model who has you know to use a buzzword custody of them do you want to trust someone of that importance or do you want to trust no one and therefore use Consensus These are some of the open questions but there are alternative opinions so for example epic games which makes fortnite the Unreal Engine a Pioneer in the space has this perspective that they haven't stated but I might observe of solving for decentralization through democracy right democracy is a form of decentralized governance we all have input and then we have centralized authorities who make the decision on our account they are doing something fascinating which is consistently relinquishing their rights over things they have rights to to hand them over to the judicial process and that is kind of a perspective which is we may store Matt's record and virtual objects we may store Jim's virtual business but we are giving up the right to shut it down to take it to move it that is up to the court process if we want to shut you down an injunction is required huh the same rights that a landlord would need to lock you out of your home a virtual platform owner requires in a virtual space and is that in an effort to uh set a precedent for other companies um or operators to follow like what what is your perspective on the reason they're doing that if they don't have to you can think of three different potential answers number one is to pass the buck on the problem right moderation virtual rights are hard there's a more optimistic perspective which is really the same but less cynical which is this is hard we shouldn't be the ones who decided Society should and then the third is a recognition and again these are all different skus of the same thing a recognition that we actually have pretty good systems for this and this is where you get into the blockchain movement of how much is actually a technical requirement versus replicating the things we already have right so I'll give you an example we talk about the importance of trust on the blockchain to manage who owns what well we do have that system for example it's Deeds you don't worry I don't I don't know if you own your house or a condo it looks like a house but like you don't worry about the fact that your deed might be in a bank safety deposit box it's written into a public record and so it's partly I think these companies saying the enormity of what we want to build requires extraordinary trust in the system extraordinary investment and we actually have these Frameworks we need not reinvent we can iterate on but even there if we should Pioneer on the 3D tools not the societal governance and Provisions it also just strikes me as like maybe it's partially your first um rationale but like play the games that you're uniquely well suited to win and leave the other ones to other people and like for epic I mean the Unreal Engine when you see the new video like the the new iterations of the Unreal Engine it is it's scary uh when you watch some of the promo videos they put out for how incredible that technology is um truly truly remarkable stuff when you when you see it and you see it in action um you know one of the other things that strikes me as we walk through your your vision for this is that maybe there's some sort of like it's probably actually true it's almost like a program people talk about Progressive decentralization like the path towards Dao's that was a big thing within web3 it was like you don't just become decentralized overnight you kind of have Progressive decentralization my analog here is like do we have sort of progressive metaverse metaversation where you know we we have what the current form is and over time you kind of make steady technological uh progress towards this end-state vision of what you believe is kind of this true form of of the metaverse um because it does seem like some of these technical hurdles are you know 10 20 30 years um of building away like the ability to have seven billion people in this simultaneously in the same world that seems like a huge daunting task some of these other ones it seems like you can kind of build workarounds right like the fortnite thing what they did with Travis Scott you can start to Envision ways where well the seven billion people aren't going to be in the same place all at once right so can you create these you know sort of simultaneous worlds that are that are operating probably and you can kind of work your way towards that end State progressively absolutely let me provide a three-part framework the first is precedent the second takes a look at societal changes and then the third talks about step function changes so if we take a look at the mobile and Cloud era we're in right now you can ask the question when did it arrive and there isn't really a specific answer because there's no switch that flips in 1973 we have the First Mobile Cellular call we wouldn't say that the mobile era was here but that was clearly a start an important First Step 1991 we have the first 2G network in Norway that's a wireless digital Network required for data 1992 we have IBM's for smartphone by the end of the 90s we have the Blackberry the wireless application protocol you probably remember growing up you'd access A Primitive version of the web with a white background blue purple and red links and that was it then we start to get the first consumer smartphones like the BlackBerry Pearl and curve the first direct Digital Media Services primarily in Japan building for the mobile web and then we get the iPhone 3G the first iPhone which was still 2G somewhere along that Spectrum we start to mature into the mobile internet era so that's one which is to recognize that these are multi-decade transformations the second is to understand generational change and here's where I also use a three-point hitch the first is when the technology is available the second is when you have a generation that grows up with that technology and is native to it in much the same way Millennials were native to YouTube and they consumed content very differently just like gen Z and gen Alpha are growing up with Roblox three quarters of those between 9 and 12 use roadblocks regularly social media to them is 3D avatar based and so Step One is when the technology is available to create a new generation step two is about when they start to use that content and then step three is the entrepreneur era and that's where we're still early in 3D Zuckerberg creates Facebook in his dorms in his early twenties in the 2003-2004 Evan Spiegel another child of the early mobile internet era in his early 20s creates Snapchat 2011. that third event is when that generation born of the new wave goes through the period of consuming content created by those which preceded that that era and then goes on to make it themselves and the last part of this three-point framework is recognizing that while that's a Continuum there's no sudden moment where you hit a new point there are technological bursts and breakthroughs we know that 3G and the iPhone were singular achievements that all of a sudden took us off the old trajectory that will be the same thing here do you think you're able to spot those in real time or is it only possible with the benefit of hindsight like I often feel when I when I read you know technology writers and I'm a huge fan of all these writers but you know the Ben Thompson and Benedict Evans and some of these people who I admire greatly I feel like okay with the benefit of hindsight you're able to analyze and say oh this was a you know world changing event this was when everything changed Etc but in the moment it's often very hard or even in advance it's very hard do you feel like it's going to be possible with this or are we going to be kind of left looking in hindsight as well it kind of varies in the sense that sometimes you need to look back over multiple different years to understand that critical threshold in other times we start to figure it out pretty quickly so we were talking earlier about how many people are in a shared environment it was really around 2014 to 2016 that we had graphical processing units gpus that were powerful enough and widely deployed enough into standard consumer Hardware to support what we call High concurrency games that's large numbers of people in the same shared simulation it's no coincidence that around 2016-17 is when all of the major battle royale games came out battle Royals were not a new idea but they were newly technologically possible and by 2018 they were blowing the doors off of every precedent for what a game can do cultural impact Revenue generation but more importantly reach the entire traditional gaming industry has about 250 to 300 million people in it and yet the top five battle royales were reaching several hundred million people per day many of whom had never participated and so it didn't take long to look at these and say no we reached a critical threshold maybe going from a hundred people to 200 people or 100 to 500 is not that meaningful but somewhere between a dozen or 16 that's what I remember for the Wii Mario card if you remember all of a sudden you could go to 16 different humans yeah somewhere between 16 and 100 we hit a critical breaking point and we understood that pretty quickly it's um it's making me want to ask you you know like what are the in your mind um what are going to be those like oh [ __ ] moments like when you see X you're gonna your eyes are gonna light up and be like oh my God this is coming or um it's gonna trigger you to think about you know oh we're actually making a real step function Improvement here in regard to the metaverse so there have been some recently I think when you look at Unreal Engine 5 which you mentioned and the meta-humans Creator and they have something called live link face that allows you to take your standard iPhone put it in front of you you create this realistic human and then it mimics you live yeah you look at that and have we passed out of The Uncanny Valley does it look exactly like a human no but you realize that this is free pocket size instantaneous technology and you say holy crap there's this Tech demo that unreal released called The Matrix awakens and by the way if you haven't downloaded you guys have to download it now because it's coming off the store shortly and it's this extraordinarily large procedurally generated City there's 64 000 cars that you can drive and crucially you can change all the settings so that you can see basically the developer mode so that you can see all of the polygons you can see how light refracts and you start to look at this and you say it's a fully immersive Dynamic populated city where you can turn off the people drive any car that you see and see and feel how it's alive that to me is where you start to say what used to be hard is now easy and we have always learned that when that happens the world changes you everyone everyone has to go on the websites like go to unrealengine.com and just spend an hour because it's like a total nerd Rabbit Hole going through these things the thing that got me about some of these videos is you can see the like vibration in rocks or in the road in certain cases on things like that's how realistic it feels uh when you're experiencing it like you can actually see the vibration of rocks as like rocks fall down around the main character around things it's truly remarkable to uh to experience and to your point um that is one of the things that feels like the oh [ __ ] moment of uh where things are headed um you know so I do want to transition I know we've got about 10 minutes left uh you're also an investor um and you've spent much of the last five years I imagine investing in a lot of the technology companies and trends that you're writing about and that you're passionate and deep on what are like for an investor so kind of putting our putting our head our investor hats on you know I have a small fund um many of our listeners invest you know personal or institutional Capital what are some of the most exciting Entre entrepreneurial opportunities um that you see out there within this kind of broader ecosystem like is it infrastructure that's being developed is it application layer stuff that's being developed um what are some of the things you're looking for that you're super excited about great question I look right across infrastructure is really difficult why because the technical bottlenecks right now are so severe that while there's a lot of potential value in unlocking them they need to be unlocked for developers to then deploy them to then monetize them to then figure them out so that they're highly monetizable and that ends up being a bit of a chicken in the egg problem where especially because of infrastructure it's Capital intensive but not quick to deploy and where the actual value capture is uncertain so that ends up being a tough problem yeah so sorry to interrupt you is the is the infrastructure if I were to characterize it is it like the infrastructure problem right now is in like the research phase where many of the solutions are literally being developed at academic institutions by like researchers mathematicians people you know computer scientists that are really trying to Envision and jam against these incredibly hard problems and they're still years away from taking those you know with anticipated Solutions and then battle testing them in the kind of entrepreneurial Gauntlet is that a fair characterization yes and I think if that's why if you take a look at many companies like Roblox like Roblox keeps hiring Advanced technologists and PhD students who are coming out of the especially UC system and that's actually really fun because what we're starting to talk about is this field that has been built for quite a while that now has some of the widest and most scaled testing environments right tens of millions hundreds of billions of people with billions of dollars of infrastructure behind I get really excited in the book I talk a lot about how it's weird that the metaphor seems to be coming from a relatively small part of the consumer Leisure economy and yet gaming companies have always been Pioneers at some of the most sophisticated simulation exercises you might remember early in the 2000s PlayStation 2s were placed on export limitations because Japan believed that if they release their signature product it would be used for terrorism late last decade the 25th most powerful computer owned by the U.S military was 1700 PlayStation 3s and by the way they said that by using PlayStation 3's interconnected de-shelled they used 95 percent less energy to operate it and spent 10 percent of the alternative use and so I know it sounds crazy to talk about like these Advanced Technologies trying to solve brutally heart problems but like it's really really well encapsulated here and so when you take a look at these companies like epic and Roblox and unity they're attracting some of the world's most Brilliant Minds because they actually have a place to apply it like semantic recognition not actually that fun for Skype but you're talking about a virtual world where you're also trying to map that live to facial recognitions you're also able to tap into Apple's AR sensors it's fun yeah it reminds me of like Bell Labs like you're creating these modern day Bell Labs so for people that aren't familiar is like you know it was a t before ATT right and it was like um you know it's like the original Skunk Works yeah exactly it was like basically they brought together some of the smartest PhD scientists in the world and what came out of there is completely remarkable when you look at the early technologies that were built and that you know were seated within that place that became you know like the future of semiconductors and the future of all of these industries was really created at Bell Labs you can trace their their lineage back to that but you're kind of thinking about a world where some of these companies and I imagine meta or Facebook is probably doing something similar where they're starting to amass a a talent War chest of just Brilliant Minds to start thinking about and envisioning these extremely technical Futures that need to be built so that's on the infrastructure side I cut you off um on the application side what's getting you excited about investing so I've kind of two things there number one is we have this ongoing lesson that trying to build the next big platform in Computing especially on the consumer side less so on the Enterprise side you shouldn't seek to do it and by that I mean there's this classic example of we've always known that a quote-unquote Federated identity system in the internet would be super useful Microsoft tried twice in the 90s you might remember the older listeners the.net framework and it didn't work because like no one wanted to sign up to have an account or identity system and they didn't want to proliferate it it was scary and Microsoft is scary what ended up being the way that four billion people would get a single identity system the answer was it started as a college hot or not and then turned into a photo sharing and messaging platform epic has been focused on the metaverse for decades but its onboard experience was a battle royale that was itself a pivot from a quasi you know necessarily a failed game but a strong single light double and so the ongoing lesson is trying to produce a really compelling fun social product at least for me I'm not a SAS or enterprise software investor that in particular takes advantage of new technologies that's the big one here Snapchat didn't design itself to be an AR camera and spectacles company it started on ephemeral messaging primarily for sexting and so I'm really excited about that and entrepreneurs are the other side my favorite entrepreneur are those who have spent a decade trying to solve these problems with a lot of backing but a company that was never going to see it through because they come away with it firstly having basically financed one of the world's rarest experiences on the corporate dollar secondly they've learned a lot they've built up a network of people with shared Acumen and expertise and a working relationship and third pretty pissed they haven't solved it yet and so they come out of that system they know exactly what to do they know exactly what not to do they know who they want to work with and good Heavens are they going to commit their life to solving it I love the uh I love both of those um you also hit on something that was a thread to the very beginning of this conversation when you talked about some of your best works of writing being your second at-bat and you referenced you know just now with epic games fortnite you know it was sort of like a second at-bat at that game or it was like a single or double and now it's become you know I I mean it's it's really become what a lot of people point to as an early version of what the metaverse is and you know the way that people operate within it so it's um it's a great framework actually for thinking about these things that second at-bat I really really like that where does um if at all where does web3 fit into all of this you know I've been having and we have just as pre-text a lot of debates on this show I'm sort of the uh Curious Observer kind of skeptic um Greg my co-host is a lot more optimistic on the future of web3 I would say and um you know what I struggle with here as I think about it is these Technologies are um you sort of have this Confluence of factors right where the technology required to make this work is extraordinary in terms of compute power speed all of these things that frankly like decentralization really struggles with it's very very difficult to do this in a centralized way let alone a decentralized way from a governance standpoint from a technology standpoint Etc and so I struggle to understand how we can do this or how web3 really fits into this at least at the like biggest infrastructure level of it maybe there are sort of applications that end up feeling like web3 or they're token enabled and there's kind of components of web3 economies that fit into it but I struggle to see it at like the broadest level of all of it I think you and I are quite aligned here I think there's enough that we do know to believe that elements of these systems are going to be important partly because the enormity of the task requires us to tap into all available resources secondly we don't just want to technologically realized metaverse we want one that we're happy exists the principles of web3 are admirable yeah the idea that we need to contend with multi-trillion dollar corporations this is ready player one this is snow crash well the best defense of that is decentralized coordinated action right the idea that who's richer than Apple all of us combine many times over and so some of the technological problems we do believe decentralization is required for in some instances we know that the philosophy is relevant in other instances it's not about tapping into our Technical Resources it's our energy our individual capital and collaborate is blockchain the best system for that not necessarily but I like to highlight you know one of the perspectives of Tim Sweeney the founder and CEO of epic games where he says it's scams or the whole field is currently caught up with an intractable mix of scams interesting decentralization and scams but he's very clear saying that while we're surrounded with either overt misrepresentation which I think is an important element right there are many people who over promise what can be solved by these Technologies and I think that that's not because they're necessarily wrong it's just they're mistaking what's a human problem versus what's a technological problem but a fundamental belief there's something really interesting here and so that is to say in a simpler sense I'm not one of the revisionists that believes that we're going to strip out tcpip and replace it with web3 but I do believe and am quite optimistic that parts of our future are going to be supplemented by these Technologies but I do think it's still a little hard to see exactly where when and why yeah it's I think that's the right way it's it's the exact way that I think about it too where like the dogmatic perspective that it has to be web3 or web 2 and there's not a blend of the two or a blurred line seems silly to me like even with desktop and mobile right like I'm sitting here on a desktop talking to you mobile exists and has proliferated obviously and changed the world but they're still desktop it didn't just completely disappear and get ripped off the face of the Earth and I think about that similarly here I mean will nfts digital ownership some of these components you know tokenization uh Community governance like some of these things will they be components of this future I can totally see and make a case where that is you know where that is true um but at the infrastructure level I would you know Color Me skeptical I suppose um for the ability to do this at a grand scale and maybe there will be some Innovation that completely changes that and I get completely wiped off and I'm notoriously bad at making those long-term predictions so um I look forward to be proving wrong in that regard um I want to close with just two questions for you um as we as we wrap up first um what do you think are the greatest risks to this future um like if you were to be scared or be kept up at Night by something uh about this future that you're writing about and envisioning what would that be connects to the web 3 movement I think that the web 3 movement is really powered by this dissatisfaction with the last 15 years and I think that for a long time we tried to lull our sense into the idea that it was a good trajectory because we received really high quality products for free and yet the fact that I'm not trying to make a specific Facebook point but as an example we got Instagram which was incredible for free doesn't mean that the value exchange was just the fact that Google Maps was stunning back in the day and still is for free the fact that there's two sides of that transaction doesn't mean that the trade was right and I think many people have woken up in 20 20 21 22 and said I don't like the Arc of Technology it is not advantaging me it is having deleterious effects on society and we don't know how to manage it I think that's powering the web 3 movement at large and perhaps an over correction to no centralization and this connects to your question more directly I think we can fairly look at the state of the internet today and identify many problems Miss and disinformation radicalization toxicity harassment abuse data rights data security data literacy platform Power Platform regulation and we can understand how every one of them will be exacerbated by the metaverse because it means that the importance of what we do online increases and the amount of society that goes online increases and frankly we're 15 years in and we haven't gotten great at solving any of those questions that's a reason to be up at night it's also a reason why many people are worried that the tech Titans are focused on what's next without having solved what is and yet I also find this inspiring because every platform shift the current crop seems infallible there was no way to look at Microsoft in the late 1990s and believe that witty would be in a future where none of us use Windows on our phone and that our PCS would be a minority share of it that Internet Explorer wouldn't exist that Bing wouldn't be a thing and so I get inspired by the idea that we as users consumers voters developers governments have real agency over that future and if we don't like what happens now we don't need web3 but the spirit of it and action allows us to change the powers that be extremely well said you know I um I think there's this pervasive false narrative around digital worlds um that they need to be or should be or will be perfect um and if they're not oh my God you know awful we need to reprimand everyone we need to you know regulate do all of these things right and it strikes me as it's nonsensical because why would we assume that our digital worlds will be perfect in utopian if our Real Worlds are not that um we're like creating this false standard it's the same thing that has um applied to like autonomous vehicles right when you have um an accident where like a robot kills a human we've decided that uh n over zero is completely intolerable when really it should be you know whatever uh T like the number of deaths from human on human accidents minus one should mean that we would go with autonomous vehicles but we create this false standard that technology needs to be perfect completely idealistic for it to exist otherwise it's intolerable and I think we're doing that now as a society as we think about the development of these digital worlds and of the metaverse so it'll be interesting to follow that thread I think through time as things progress last question before I lose you predictions for the future so we've talked a lot about the future impossible to predict always and very funny to even ask you to do this I'm just going to try to frame it in a simple way what will happen first uh a man will walk on the face of Mars or we will be able to exist in a world that looks like Ready Player One the latter because I think we're gonna spoof most of it and so it looks like ready player one but isn't okay it's a good answer and spoofing most of it I I think it would be an amazing amazing uh world to be able to do that I mean I am hopeful that I'm going to be able to operate in in Worlds like this in the next you know one or two decades and that my son will be able to experience them as he gets um you know as he comes into his teenage years so I hope you're right but I do think that the to not cheat the answer and by the way one of the most fun Parts about this book was spending time with game developers who explain exactly how they cheat physics but with a view to how you can't beat physics going to Mars you have to collaborate with it I think to not cheat your answer I think we'll hit Mars first and I certainly hope that's the case it is a giant leap for uh for Humanity in both regards both on the you know technological side to live in a world where we do have something like a Ready Player one but also reaching Mars as as a you know to become an interplanetary species would certainly be something very cool I mean I saw Tim Urban tweeted something about this the other day that what a cool thing that we're going to get to be hopefully fingers crossed alive during the time when Humanity makes one of its great you know three or four leaps uh in the history of of the world that we get to be alive during that is a pretty cool thing um Matt thank you so much for taking the time to do this uh everyone seriously everyone should go online or go to your local bookstore and buy this book it I read it over the weekend prior to having this conversation with you and was completely immersed in it uh you know like I have a newborn son at home and my wife was staring daggers at me because I was sitting out by the pool and just completely locked in and obsessed with what you had written the book is called the metaverse and how it will revolutionize everything it will be released on July 19th globally is that correct and I'm sure you're

i think it's it's going to be work regardless so just find that the work that you actually want to spend time on versus i think if you're young just chase a bunch of [ __ ] and get in the reps just like in any sport but then try to find the the path like for you guys i think creating content is like so obvious how good you guys are like you guys are doing it naturally [Music] noah welcome to the show yeah well it's good to be here guys it's good to be here noah and i were just talking before we started recording before you came on greg about how i had to bail on this like awesome boat event that he and appsumo were throwing in new york and my excuse was that i was literally having my baby you know during the like two day window when i like i think you did that on may 15th like the kid was my son was born on may 16th like it was like right the next day but we were talking about how you know there are these like trump card excuses of getting out of things like being pregnant or like having a baby that you can basically get out of anything uh and use it as an excuse and noah said like why aren't we just honest about things and just say like yo i don't want to go to that so i don't know what is it greg why why aren't we just honest as human beings when we don't want to do things i think people don't want to let other people down i think like making people generally want to make other people feel good and like when you let someone down it doesn't feel good so i think it's difficult to be honest but yeah i agree with you i feel like we should we should all be more honest i'm trying to be more honest like i think we uh like in general when you think about your calendar like i think this relates to a lot of things you think about your calendar and how many like emails in your inbox you put off replying to just because you don't want to say no but really you're just going to say no you're just delaying it and it's like someone was just talking to me about this rich handler is his name he's the ceo of jeffrey's you know big big financial institution he was saying like the reason people don't reply to their emails right away is because they're delaying the pain of just saying they don't want to do something and so he's like i replied right away and i either say like yes let's do this right now or no i'm not going to do that and it's like a much more efficient way of just getting through the things and i realized when i thought about it after i went home when he said it of like yeah that's totally what my email inbox looks like the reason i'm not always at inbox zero is because i have 25 emails sitting in there that are things where i just don't want to reply to the person to say no do you owe them a reply just hit archive what do you owe them yeah i guess that's true step father you know like i guess like i think um it's just having standard protocols makes things easier like hey i'm only focusing on these three things so i'm not doing extra meetings right now really really standard makes it easier it's uh like or i'm phone phobic people love the phone yeah like hey i'm just phone phobic like it's actually a phobia i have i can't take this this you know i'm scared i'm scared i i actually do like the um you know hey i'm not doing call you know not doing zoom calls love to do it in real life if you make it out to new york um you know type thing because i do just like i i will meet almost anyone in person because i just so prefer that um but man doing zoom calls like my threshold now is so high relative to what it was a year ago um anyway i feel like we're on a long tangent no but i think the thing you're calling out is a really great point and just being honest with yourself and like how do you get more alignment in your life right and the alignment what's interesting is like when you had a baby it was easy to be like i really don't want to do this but you're using the baby as a nice buffer to that or i'm you know pregnant or covet or whatever these types of excuses are covets pretty they're all legit but i it's like what if you could do if you could just live honestly like i have two friends recently like i don't want to go to these weddings of my other friend how do i say no and i was like you say no but i think it's also helpful if you're like hey i really want to go i you don't want to lie to him hey your wedding sounds promising i just have a lot going on you can't make it yeah i do think that like you you brought it up a couple minutes ago of like hey these are the three things i'm focusing on right now so i can't take this on is a great way of thinking about it i mean it all ties into like people feel these inherent like sunk costs almost um to going and doing things like oh you know i already i've always thought about it with like oh i booked flights i i had this last year like i booked flights to go to this wedding and then the wedding was coming up and i was swamped with other stuff and i was literally dreading it but in my mind i was like oh man i paid for the flights already so i gotta go and the reality was i was just gonna go make myself incrementally more miserable by going to this thing and so then i ended up bailing because i was like oh it's actually just a sunk cost i need to think about this clearly and rationally and just pass on it um but we have all these like embedded reasons for doing things um that i do think if you just reset yourself you can you can step away from i think a lot of it is energy like kind of i think greg was kind of highlighting it a bit which is just like is this increasing your energy and clarity or is it decreasing and so a lot of times in my week like i was meeting with our head of marketing at appsumo yesterday and i was like who do you i'm not going to call i'm not going to call it people but i was like who do you meet with during the week that you're like excited about and you're like wow i have more energy and like i feel productive and who do you not and there's probably either the meeting is bad or the person is bad and so on my sundays and like when i do calendaring on fridays and sundays i'm like what am i really looking forward to and is is there stuff that i'm just not looking forward to and there's probably some connection that i don't want to do it and like doing that maybe in all regards yeah i love that it's like who who energizes your battery and who depletes it today's episode is brought to you by element a tasty electrolyte drink mix with everything you need and nothing you don't that means lots

fundrise.com room again that's f-u-n-d-r-i-s-e dot com slash room to get started today you know i used to do that with my calendar this is like this is one of my favorite frameworks actually i um i started energy color coding my calendar in real time after the meetings and it completely changed i mean this is like six months ago greg it was actually as a result of a conversation i had with you about like how my calendar was too full um and so i literally would like at the end of a day go to my calendar and color code things green when i felt like they created energy for me um kind of like orange if it was neutral and then red if it was like um you know i felt drained after doing it and it forced me to visually see how many of the things i was taking on during the week were draining energy from me and so i basically just said okay i'm going to eliminate or delegate all of those and that was the first step and it was like okay now my calendar looks all green and neutral and then the next step was like what can you kind of trim out of the neutral and make it mostly green and now i feel like my calendar is mostly green and it completely repositioned it just by like having this visual cue and signal dude i love that i've been trying for the past two years like a week in review at the end of the week so i have like a survey that i give myself in google forms and you can kind of see trends for like was it for me it's really related to appsumo it's like was i consistent how was my leadership did i move the business forward and then the last thing is like were there any blockers from this week or meetings that sucked that i want to adjust and it really does make most of the weeks get subsequently better i feel like feedback and like regular feedback just in all aspects is how we improve life that's a pretty cool idea actually just like for a business so you know you have um you know you have like a do you wear a whoop band or like any of the healthy tracker ring at night when i go to sleep yes me too so like the beauty of those things is that it gives you like a trend line over time right like you know you can see what it looks like you know what your different metrics rem sleep whatever over over longer periods it becomes really interesting um it's kind of a cool idea to like take something and apply that to you know your your kind of personal uh productivity energy etc like what you're jerry-rigging um you know and like jangly putting together with a google form or with a google server and sending to yourself there's probably a business to just be built around that like the personal energy survey or something um where you create a nice ui ux and basically overlay it on top of data that is effectively a google form that you get every week dude i love that i i think that's great here's the idea because you know sometimes with these things like we get baseline information and we're like okay if i go to sleep early it's good if i don't drink it's good it's like there's not really that much deltas of change it's more just like some level baseline to move forward so i think it's just like how do you get more consistent iterations and improvement i think i think the idea is like have you seen those emails where at the bottom of the email it's like hey yeah how was this good bad okay yeah and so it's basically after the email after the meeting you get an email it starts like getting data points was a good bad whatever and it starts adding those data points until it knows enough about you that it's just like hey you have a meeting coming up in an hour what's that hell and you like hate meeting with sahil or you or you know so we're gonna go ahead and like cancel that or you know you love meeting with sahel we're gonna when you're going to schedule it it tells you to cancel it actually yeah just like don't schedule this because we already know i actually think there's something really interesting to be built like a simple tool around this because like they all exist and there's like a massive multi-billion dollar industry around like app tracking stuff on your computer or on your phone that like tells you there's something called like rise productivity i think it's called that's like a computer app that like yeah actually i got it on appsumo noah um it was like one of your deals of the week um at one point like last year and um it like tells you you know it gives you all these metrics and data at the end of every week of like what apps you spent your time on where you were productive where you got drained et cetera but doing that but for like your personal energy and um sort of like using it as like a week in review type template that gives you data behind all of that and maybe it's self-reported but it's still you know actual data that tracks over time and putting a ui ux on top of it i feel like it would actually be pretty productive kind of like it yeah let's do it yeah uh so well i want to come back to that actually because there's something interesting to be built there so we will talk about that but noah you know it's been super excited to have you on it's it's taken longer than we should have um to uh to do this recording so i'm happy that we're finally getting to do it um and a handful of stuff that we wanted to just dive into with you but i thought maybe we could just set the stage for a little bit with like hearing a little bit more about who you are in your background because i also just personally feel like i don't know enough about your background and and um you know some of what has gotten you to where you are today and obviously you're a you know amazing entrepreneur and you're also an amazing creator and so i want to dig in to uh dig into a bunch of that but would love to just hear you know what has kind of like created your map of reality um over your life like where have you kind of come from and and how did you end up where you are today dude i have no idea i was on a date like a year ago and she's like who are you i was like what i was like could i just order my dinner at chick-fil-a and call it a night like it was a fancy date man yeah your sports are the best that's why i'm probably still single at 40. i just i just checked my gmail i just put your name in my gmail and i think i slept in your bed dude awesome we we should have opened with that yeah you guys having a sauna party 2016 matt galligan was like hey like my buddy has his apartment up for rent or something like that and i think we might have stayed at your place dude awesome i love hosting i love like i'm uh well that's a whole money thing we can talk about um they're short of who i am i don't know man like i'm trying to figure it out uh i try to follow you know i try to follow what what really like what i'm listening to my body you could say like what really is calling me i definitely get distracted with shiny objects but i think my my career and my life has been like what feels right uh and then trying just a [ __ ] ton of things out and most of them not working and some of them working and then really surrounding myself with just like epic people i've been very i think some of my talent is talent i'm just like a talent like you know those metal detectors for pennies and nickels like i kind of like that a little bit with people um and professionally yeah uh i was born into like tech i don't know how my brother became my brother's a doctor but i was born like a few miles from apple and i love tech i love the computer stuff i love like all this internet stuff i love the app stuff i love the crypto stuff i just think it's it's really interesting how it's evolving society and then appsumo you know professionally was a culmination of just a lot of rejection uh a lot of soul searching a lot of like experiments and then finally in trying a lot of companies out to finally figuring out how do i work with people i really like where i don't feel so insecure working on something i really like was promoting things and talking about these things um you know and being able to live the kind of lifestyle i want and so that that's coming together and creating content i've been doing blogging for a long time uh more hardcore lately on youtube for the past little about two and a half years specifically around like you know starting a business making money overcoming fear so you you were born and raised in silicon yeah valley yeah my and i was kind which was i feel very lucky because my dad is a sales guy he was like from israel he didn't know english he just started selling things and then my stepfather's an engineer so it's just really cool to to get that mix of personalities and then i was i was just it's all luck it's all i was very mostly lucky um to be born there and then all of my friends are in silicon valley are just like extreme high achievers like my lowest friend is like a senior engineer at fitbit like that's the worst off person i know and like not bragging i'm just like i was lucky to be born with that type of you know uh expectations i think something about success is people like it's a network it's not where it's not network it's who are who's around you and what's their ambition levels and i just had really high ambition people around me and it's really inspiring and there's a balance of that of you have to figure out your own ambition like do i want this or am i just competitive or comparative but that was inspiring to be like oh cool there's a lot of things i can do out there so do you feel like i mean you mentioned the ambition point i've never really thought about it much but do you feel like you're kind everyone always uses that phrase of like you know you're the average of the five people you spend your most time with do you feel like that's about ambition that like you're really the average of their ambition level like if you're around a bunch of people and you come up around a bunch of people who have tremendous ambition it's hard not to have that same level of ambition and you know and spend time with them i think it you know i think it sets the bar of what what things could be like if you don't know what x if you don't know what excellent food tastes like like how do you know what excellence looks like so i had a chance to be like hey i worked around zuckerberg i worked around you know mark pincus and like you know peter thiel and like the elite and they're elite for a reason because they're they're excellent and then i think there's also some just internal motivation like i'm just naturally moving i'm naturally active and that's that's a little bit just i was born with that i think people want to imitate like the people that generally speaking like you know if you're i think you know that's why okay i was reading a study late late late a few nights ago about how people who have friends who are overweight generally eat more than the average person um and and and then they become overweight and i think it's it speaks to this point which is like you probably grew up with a lot of people who were exceptional or tried to be exceptional and because of that like you know it might it might just you know it might have been in you but it also might have just been yeah yeah manifestation yeah manifestation yeah yeah i do think parallel oh sorry the real example of that is like i'm in a text group called like single guys in austin and it's like all these guys it's like my three other best friends and it's always like dude i'm out of this date look at this check this out like you know it's a safe space for for a single gentleman but then one day i'm like dude if i'm just surrounded by these bozos talking about hooking up all the time like of course that's why i'm single you know and it's not that necessary being single is a bad thing but it's just like if you're around a bunch of healthy people to greg's point and like you'll probably be more healthy and um i think people are probably aren't as intentional as i i'm not a brag i think i'm very intentional who i surround myself with and besides these bozo single guys who i love i'm around a lot of very like intentional people not just in making money it's not only about that it's just like an integrity and follow-through character um and just like they inspire me in different capacities and i have there's it's honestly kind of like amazing it's probably the best parts of my life it's it's sort of um it's interesting like i have a few thoughts on this so one is that these kind of things cut both ways um you know like i often think about uh i have friends who don't make a lot of money totally fine you know they're successful but don't make a lot of money and yet they they roll in a circle of people who do make a lot of money and who spend a lot of money and those friends of mine um that role in that circle then are constantly in trouble and stressed because they basically are like living at the means of somebody who spends a lot and who makes a ton of money when they don't have that and it's like they've kind of grown accustomed to living in this way by just like i don't know like osmosis or something like that and it creates a lot of issues for them as a result um because you do kind of like naturally blend into your surroundings for better or for worse um so i've often thought that was it was it's just like an interesting fact of humans that we tend to just like chameleon into our surroundings one way or another yeah is it can you tell us a little bit about like the insight with appsumo like what actually led to the business creation i mean you mentioned it as kind of like failure rejection things that had gone wrong and led to it but like the actual insight around what it is um what was it that sparked that for you how did you decide to go build it and you know then i kind of would love to just hear a little bit more about the business today sure um i think it was it was a culmination of all of my failure package did in one day what was your failure like you said you know you say that but like what was the failure i mean the failure was like intel 14 months facebook nine months mint nine months kickflip ten months which was funded by naval ravicon and then i did gambit which did really well and then facebook sued us and we got banned by another company and then it was just like i'm 30 years old and i'm just like wow i this is it's not bad i thought i'd be like super rich and like i don't know i thought you'd just get money magically in your bank account and so it doesn't happen that way or i thought i'd have a wife that should just like show up at the house they don't they don't you have to actually go out and make it happen um and so i think all those different experiences in my life of what i didn't enjoy and what made me feel good and bad led to be like all right well i really want to work with people that i don't know are humble and i felt facebook in silicon valley was just like this level of arrogance i didn't enjoy being around there's a little confidence and intelligence but the arrogance is too much so i knew i wanted to be with great people which i didn't really experience i knew i liked promoting things i think it's like for all of us there's some skill we enjoy and we're doing for free and so just find the thing you want to do for free and make that your job there's debates that i just found that for myself where i'm going to be promoting things like whether there's appsumo or not like i'm still doing this youtube thing i'm still doing my newsletter at you know okdor.com i'm doing these things and so i was like i want to keep promoting things and then through some of these businesses i realized like you talked about this one idea sahil earlier you said we should help people track uh their their work stuff and i think especially now during a recession this is where a lot of this is where like some of the best innovations gonna come out of i'm really excited to see who's gonna be creative here like who's gonna win someone's gonna win winning is all subjective but who's gonna come out and create something special that they'll enjoy and so uh i think for me i was like man i like promoting i don't like doing this payment stuff uh i like software and i love deals and i saw like mac heist which was around for a br do you guys remember that yep oh wow i saw matt kaise and i was like oh that's kind of cool that like enables you to get people customers promote cool stuff i don't have there's not a lot of pressure and i to be candid and i think most people don't quit your day jobs when you're starting a side hustle and be clear on your vision be clear on your fan i like calling it a fantasy like what if you could live a fantasy like how cool is that and my fantasy was like make a few thousand bucks just doing it like all these things i had bad partners all this different stuff it's like just doing it the way i wanted it wasn't like the aspiration and this is something that someone called out that i thought was interesting most aspiration of billionaires or millionaires or multi-millionaires was not always that case like mark didn't start facebook i'm a big billionaire i was like man let me see if i can meet some chicks online if we're honest right i worked for him so i know that stuff it wasn't like i'm gonna go create this world eventually it evolved so your vision evolves but i think being clear on what you want in your fantasy and vision was really helpful so for me it was like can i do this thing and make a few thousand bucks promoting and getting basically deals i want on products and that's more or less how it was for the first year and and i think the thing i've got to highlight for people out there uh for starting businesses specifically and that's what i'm known a little bit for it's kind of twofold one i just picked a really great industry that's not because i'm that smart like i'm above average smart i'm not like excellent i'm like a b-plus kind of smart that's what i aim for you know i get almost the good thing but i don't do all the work and i think one thing is like software just grew so much and i guess i kind of assumed it would but like what's going to get even bigger like is youtube going to get bigger or smaller way bigger tick-tock bigger twitter probably bigger so go find the categories that are going to get bigger so that's one and then i think with that secondly i got very lucky and i think the other thing is when people are building these companies like that tracking thing we talked about especially during a recession are you building something a must-have like i can't live without it like right now go to your credit card bills what can you not cut that's a must-have what can you cut like even employee wise those are nice to haves unless they're must-haves and i think with appsumo there's two two components which is everybody wants more customers in this world we live in you guys want more listeners so he'll you want more twitter followers i want more youtube subscribers like those are just kind of what we're interested in so i thought if i can give people customers that's literally the most important thing i can do on earth for these people and then secondly i think we got very lucky with our business model which was we don't have to create anything we don't have to hold any inventory on anything and we promote a thing you created someone else created in some software creator we get the money up front and then we pay them 60 days later and there's a reason for that like we had to put up all this money and all this you know experience and time to get the audience and and the community but the model just was was epic like we don't need a big office like we can really do a 60-day cash conversion cycle that way like so you're like you're getting just generating cash as you grow but like negative working capital basically is it negative or positive so we get the money up front and then we pay our partners 60 days later yeah negative working capital a positive working capital is like a like a you know apparel business where you have to pay your vendors and then you receive money you know in 30 days and that's a pain in the ass to grow because you're having to fund all the inventory growth negative working capital is the other way where like they give you the cash and now as you're growing you have this float of a bunch of cash that you can be using to invest in things because you don't have to pay your partners for 60 days it's a pretty incredible business model when you make it work yeah ours has gotten really lucky i would say with all those things and i mean it's a pretty i think find a business that you just really enjoy doing like we promote like our job is literally to find cool software products get a deal and then tell people about it and that's how like the money just comes down and then we give the partners money the people get a good deal i think more businesses aren't figuring out like triple win there's like win lose like you gave me some money but you're getting screwed and i think there's like mint was a perfect example of that it was like free plus like the plus like these partners get money and it was just like a really cool like everyone's winning there but i think some businesses it does feel like win lose yeah can you talk a little more about like the first year of appsumo because i imagine like now it must be easy you know you have this massive audience people know appsumo um but like the first year i can imagine which dude oh my god oh my god oh dude it gets harder i thought it you know there's a what's his name jim roth jim rome quote it's like yeah it doesn't get it doesn't get uh easier you just get better and i like that a lot because it doesn't get easier just your problems get harder and you get better at it um the first to be in look our narratives of our mind are all liars like our like how we reminisce some things is total lies like we just totally change the history to serve whatever purpose and whatever moment we're in um but the way i recall it to the best of my ability and i looked at revenue of it recently and it's been 12 years so our first year revenue was 300 000. and that was me truthfully just by myself i really wanted a business where i was like i don't want to have a developer i'll do it myself don't have support i don't have anybody to [ __ ] depend on initially now i can't do without these this team and it was just like kind of where i think one of the key things that that people miss in business in general is they're not working backwards from their customer very specifically so with appsumo i literally just once a month i didn't do a lot of work i probably worked about like 10 20 hours a month i would be like all right i want to reach y combinator audience what are the products that i could get deals on that i know that would get it would get upvoted on hacker news it was like oh well let me get those so i got optimizely i got mixpanel um then i was like how do i get on lifehacker that's an audience i want well i looked up all of life hackers top uh top reviewed software they've ever talked about and i got a deal on that and i emailed them and said hey if i get deals on this can you promote it and they're like yeah maybe they did and so it was a very intentional approach of uh you know customer first is how i like to label it and working backwards in that and i treated it very casually greg i wasn't very like this is going to be a big-ass company i was like i make you know a few thousand bucks every month or so for not too much work and i think one thing that people need to be clear on especially or whatever you're on your career i lived so cheap that i didn't have to make a lot of money i didn't even have like i was doing consulting for speeddate.com they were paying me 5 000 bucks a month and i didn't really do much for them but they loved me i was like dude that's awesome i was like a product manager for them as a consultant but i had the 5000 i lived crazy cheap and it gave me the flexibility to really find stuff i enjoyed and i did it very comfortably until probably around a year in i hired you know i had a i found a developer named chad who's still my business partner and that's an amazing story and then andrew chen who's one of my best friends was like no you got it why don't you take it seriously and he you know he tiger bombed me he's like you're gonna try to be rich and you're gonna grow this big and i was like dude i'm just chilling man just let me chill dude he's like no make something of your life and so we switched up the model we went from bundles to single deals and we went from single deals to like tremendous amounts of advertising and giveaways and different things and the business went from 300 000 to 3 million the next year and it was that's not normal and uh and so the way i think of the first year greg it was it was enjoyable it was um i wouldn't say professional in the sense it was very hobby and i think this is a very clear difference as a baseball player and as a professional in sports or as a professional in business or a professional in a hobby is that are you treating it like a hobby are you training like a professional and we had a lot of we eventually people copied us and we're just very professional like i worked at these very impressive companies i have a very it's not bragging but i have a a like we got blocked by paypal and then i literally emailed or texted the vp at paypal and got unblocked within like 30 minutes that's just it was just luck because i have that network from being in silicon valley and stuff and so i think that gave us an edge over other people as we started professionalizing the business and you know 20 to what you're in 2022 i mean it's [ __ ] hard man i used to think ceo so i hired the ceo his name is amy abdullah you should check him out on twitter and i had i hired eamon he ran the company for five years and i basically just like got pretty rich during that time period and i really didn't do do a lot of work and i was like this is this is very unsatisfying getting a lot of money is satisfying i will not deny that but like not working is pretty unfulfilling and i just thought he didn't do [ __ ] all day i was like this [ __ ] guy dude like he makes good money i don't want to i can't say his numbers i'm like this guy's making all this money and like what does he do ceo ceo do nothing he sits around has everybody else do all this work and then he quit last year and i was like oh [ __ ] man i guess i'll try to do it myself and it's it's it's not like a boohoo story for me but it's like oh wow there's until you're in someone else's experience and really understanding it um it was hard to really grasp like how challenging it is day to day and like the level of responsibility he had and so i definitely empathize more with him and anyone leading a team and being responsible for jobs and you know running a business did you did you raise money or or has it been bootstrapped it's been bootstrapped it's so cool to um you know it ties back to the working capital point that we were making earlier but like you know the inherent feature of the business model you built is that you're kind of being just funded by customers along the way so you know most most venture-backed business models they're like gross margin negative from the get-go or you know or you're having to you know fund a bunch of upfront technology build out and it's you know you're you need a tremendous amount of money up front in order to build that so that you can hopefully get to the point where like you're kind of at the uh you know the benefit point of like the marginal cost of zero of the deployment of the technology but the reality is then you have to raise a bunch of vc capital and dilute yourself in order to get there with your business model negative working capital you're like you know pulling in cash and you don't have to pay for a while you're able to actually fund all of that growth and all the growth initiatives with customer money and so like you don't really need to raise money uh along the way and you can maintain that ownership so it's a pretty cool um it's a cool thing to see how it actually played out and flowed that way yeah i can't say is that i'm not smart about it i think more with raising money we never really had a good use for it because we did have capital we were profitable from day one and i think more businesses can be i don't think we're unique in that i think people get uh deceived i think the other thing that's interesting is the advantage we have we've talked about going public like you know our revenues are in eight you know very high eight figures and um i don't know i just don't want to be at the mercy of other people i like being at the mercy of our customers like if they like us and we like them and we try to do our best they buy and give us money and we can live our lives and hopefully they benefit the partners we promote get a bunch of money for us from other stuff um i like the idea that and not having it is good to have adult supervision like we have a board um they can't fire me which is you know good and bad but i think having a board of advisors in general like i'm seeing one of them tomorrow because i'm having a bunch of issues is uh is critical as in the personal life is i have a council of wise men is what i call it uh but also in your professional life yeah it's um it's interesting i mean you bring that up right now like you know not everyone needs to raise money and there's a lot of businesses that could be profitable from the get-go i just think that there's been this i mean it's probably just a relic of the fact that we've been in this raging 10-year bull market where like money was free and you could go raise at a billion dollars after a year of existing and you know i think in general people have created this storyline that they're going to follow as entrepreneurs and it's like here's what i'm supposed to do quote unquote and what i'm supposed to do as an ambitious founder is i'm supposed to start this business i'm supposed to raise money from andreessen horowitz at this valuation and then i'm supposed to be a unicorn by a year from now and get my forbes article written about me uh you know then i'm supposed to go public and it's like okay but take a step back zoom out and as you said i mean and greg would definitely agree with this it's like why do you actually want to do that is that going to make you happy are you going to be incrementally happier from going and running a public company and like in your case what does that entail running a public company it's like now i have to get on quarterly uh you know earnings calls with a bunch of analysts and have a bunch of people grilling me and have news articles written about me every time i do something you know there's just a bunch of headaches that come with the traditional path that everyone thinks they're supposed to follow and so i think like one of the great things that hopefully comes out of this you know bear market if we're in it is that people actually reassess and take a much more first principles approach to thinking about what they really want to do when it comes to building companies yeah yeah yeah i would encourage anyone just to get started like especially if you have a day job like you know i was talking with a buddy of mine named sam from financial samurai and it was like if you have a day job number one kiss your boss's ass a lot right now a lot it's a good time to kiss ass it's a [ __ ] great time to build your network because you know when people are looking to cut costs they're like well who who's who's who's showing up or who's calling it in right and the people showing up generally we'll have a higher chance and then also build the network right there as well uh for those times i think we're going to see a lot of profitable products being created right now just because all that vc money is drying up and you know i think it's just gonna we're gonna see uh over the next 18 months just some profitable businesses come out like you remember groupon like groupon was like a 30 billion dollar company at its peak like that came out of the gray financial crisis and i think we're gonna we're gonna see a lot of businesses kind of like appsumo where people are gonna want deals on one side and companies are going to want customers on the other side and entrepreneurs are not going to want to raise money not because it's impossible to raise money but just because it's like difficult and and annoying right now to raise money i felt like is that true though because sometimes i'm like if you're good looking you're always going to get hit on like i would say i was on a date a few days ago and she's like i have 6 thousand guys to choose from and i was like i'm one in six thousand she's like you are one of the last ones it's like that's fine but it's you know i think if you have if you're an air table or a you know figma or a notion and there and you're you have a model that works i i still think you can raise like stupid easy uh i think the challenge and you know i think that's what you're saying so is like if it's like uh yeah we're gonna have to do a lot of stuff and there's a lot of uncertainty it's gonna probably be a lot more challenging experience when you're doing zero to one like pre-seed seed that's where it's going to be more difficult to raise but yeah once you have product market fit and you have something that's working like there's always money yeah it's a flight to quality at that point too i mean it's like all the same money is going to pour at the ones that are working and doing well um you hit on i i do want to greg i want to talk google chrome extensions um for sure but before i do that there were like three frameworks that noah hit on in the context of um in the context of his business building that i thought were awesome to reiterate for for any entrepreneurs or builders listening one was to go like just think about what industry is going to be growing a ton in the years ahead and like that is a great place to go and build if you know that like you know for you software was going to be much bigger and you can go and build in front of that trend that's a great place to start um the whole like must-haves versus nice to haves framework that you dropped i thought was really interesting i've always thought of it as like um painkillers versus vitamins is the way i always like thinking about that where you're just like vitamins are nice to have they might make you feel okay and good painkillers like you need to position if you're going to be selling well you need to position what you're selling as a painkiller because people are way more willing to pay and they if you make it feel urgent and then that final one was triple win businesses which i loved like try to create a business model that is a win-win-win where you have like the companies winning customers are waiting the partners are winning in it and when you can do that uh you know it becomes much more effective and it's a much easier sell from the early days of it so a bunch of stuff that you hit on that i thought was just um that was just gold uh greg can i pass it over to you to kick off this um little bit of ideation around the google chrome extensions because i absolutely loved uh loved the writing you did on that so i invested in a company in 2012 called vid iq and the founders this guy named rob sandy he raised like a million dollars from mark cuban and gary vaynerchuk and all these guys to go build uh the hootsuite but for youtube or the buddy media for youtube so a platform that gives you analytics on on youtube he did like the pure silicon valley approach like he got like an awesome office he hired like all these like well-known people he was burning money like crazy he was down to his last dollars this is like 2014 2015. and he basically got rid of everyone except a few people he went remote when remote wasn't a thing and basically was surfing every day living in santa cruz kind of like to your point noah like almost like the first year of your business he was just kind of like what can i create that generate some revenue and that would be fun to create he ends up taking vidiq and turning it into a chrome extension that when you're on youtube you go on youtube and let's say i'm you know at the you know let's say you're on our our channel right the where it happens channel which by the way you should subscribe we have like a crazy low amount of subscribers on it so go subscribe we got to get on noah's we got to get on noah's level man and you're there it'll say you know when you're on this video let's say it'll say the vid iq score is 92 the average um you know views per hour is 2.1 um you know here's the ratio of likes here's like the engagement it basically gives you deeper analytics for people who are interested in getting a leg up on uh on other creators and then he started he so he created that for free and then he started charging for it today fast forward to today you know he's doing millions of dollars of revenue a year his team is like 50 people um the chrome extension has two plus million users it's now no longer just youtube uh they're on tick tock too and it's also a web app and it's an incredible story of a business that like you know pivoted did their own thing passionate guy and use chrome chrome extensions as a great way to get an initial group of users and then just charge for it so that inspired me to write a tweet thread um around chrome extension extensions which i'll just pull up really quickly here i basically said people sleep on google chrome extensions but it's secretly a gold mine grammarly loom metamask and honey are companies that started as chrome extensions and created billions of value and then here's why it works people barely uninstall extensions the barrier to install is low extensions are quote unquote always on so people are daily active users of it and then people pay for many of them so noah and sahil i want to get your perspective as to what do you think about chrome extensions as a place to be building i love it um i texted you as soon as i saw this because i um so i invested in this bit it was the first time i'd ever really encountered chrome extensions and this is kind of embarrassing but like i had just never really used google chrome um and so i was like completely unfamiliar with the chrome ecosystem and then i started using it and basically had gotten approached right around that time by this founder who was building a chrome extension that allowed you to um split payments across multiple credit cards so like you know how you know if you go to a store and you're buying like a big purchase you know like a laundry machine or a fridge or whatever you can like take two credit cards and be like hey split it across these two and they'll do it for you like at walmart or sears or wherever you were um you can't do that online incidentally like it literally didn't exist um you can go and you put in one credit card you have to spend it and that's challenging for big purchases it also presents an issue where like you know if you want to manage your credit you don't want to over extend within one credit card and then also you might want to optimize across points and rewards across different credit cards and so this guy invented this chrome extension that basically creates a kind of an instant card that splits it however you want across multiple credit cards and i had no understanding of like chrome extensions or how he was going to go to market with it anyway now fast forward like three months after initial launch and they're doing you know 10 plus million of gmb through this thing um without having a single dollar of marketing expense yet um have not spent a dollar it's been all completely organic and like product like growth of people sharing this stuff and so that was what opened my eyes to the power of these things of like just how much you can do with them especially because they're cross-internet like you just have it plugged in you can use it wherever across the internet now on different transaction sites for this honey was the same way i imagined in the early days so i am i think it's super interesting there has to be a lot of cool stuff to be built here that business is called kashish by the way k-a-s-h-e-e-s-h like cash jeezy well then work on they should work on their name [Laughter] they need to put a little zhu on that sahil i i think uh my just two comments and you know maybe you don't want him i'll shut the hell up but i i think you know two observations here one is i think it's wrong to look at where necessarily the biggest size of audiences and be like i need to build a business there versus like what's the actual problem and then what's the best way to resolve it and i think this is where people get trapped like a lot of entrepreneurs are like i need recurring revenue what's the best way to get people to give me money every month i'm like well make something they want to give you money for every month but i think that that line of thinking needs to be reversed generally which is working backwards from the customer's problems that they're excited like i think that's the thing without sooner was like they were i've tried a lot of other businesses since then and before then it was like this person was like they're like please let me give you money i was like damn this is cool and the second thing is that um i do think google chrome is big uh i've bought google chrome and i've ran google chrome business it's called leo.io and things always seem easier or cooler or bigger than when you when you actually do it and you're like damn this is hard and so we tried to monetize it didn't work we tried to drive ads to it didn't drive ads from it didn't work the growth loops wouldn't work that hard and then a lot of people if you try to buy a google chrome app are actually pretty premium priced but i think you guys are on to something that there's there's a lot of people here they're probably actually rich like wealthy for internet standards because they're on chrome right versus probably like maybe other browsers or they're maybe on android i guess android would be chrome but i think they're definitely having more money um i i think what you're seeing so it's also is interesting is like you could study the ones that are doing well like rocket reach i think is a huge one that no one talks about um i think there's a lot of these ones but i would try to work backwards on the customers and then not assume that this one thing is going to be easy because it almost never it sometimes is but we bought it i spent 25 000 i paid a dollar for every active user and then two years later now it's just like collecting dust and getting emails from people wanting to monetize it in some scammy way i agree with you know i think like the trap the trap that entrepreneurs make are like okay there's a lot of action here in chrome extension now i need to like build a chrome extension like rob sandy from vid iq like when he was surfing in santa cruz he was like he was a yout he was he actually created a youtube competitor called biddler in 2005 around when youtube came out in 2005. like he he was he under like he's og day one youtube video creator so you know to your point around your earlier point around passion and you know two things that you basically have a competitive edge on like he understood it and then he was like okay the the tool is gonna be on an extension because it's just way easier for creators when they're on youtube to have this extension and use it and it'll be ten times quicker um he wasn't he wasn't like oh yeah like uh i i you know this is a huge opportunity i need subscription revenue um at all it just came once yeah i fell in love with it i think you're calling out the right thing though which is like what are industries or categories that are getting bigger and then where is it being underserved i do think sometimes though as an entrepreneur i always think my the other thing is going to be so much easier than mine i'm like dude i'll do chrome finally it'll be so cake i'm going to get i'm going to finally get super rich and then i do it i'm like ah i thought it was like i read greg's tweets i thought supposed to be super easy i think it's it's going to be work regardless so just find that the work that you actually want to spend time on versus i think if you're young just chase a bunch of [ __ ] and get in the reps just like in any sport but then try to find the the path like for you guys i think creating content is like so obvious how good you guys are like you guys are doing it naturally naturally now after putting it in but it's kind of like uh lubricant versus friction so i try to find the areas that i'm like i like korean content i like sending emails like that's kind of what appsumo does why do you do all the content like you've built a massive youtube presence you do a ton of videos they're great by the way like you go i see you like knocking on doors talking to talking to people oh [ __ ] [ __ ] dude on the internet a few weeks ago for for suggesting um but uh yeah no like just what uh what has um what has led to that like why are you why are you excited about creating content probably insecurities and ego if we're all honest you know some form of legacy like i hope people remember me or think i'm like smart or special do you think that's a thing like do you i think anyone will remember any of us no not at all yeah no one's even no elon musk that guy's [ __ ] gone yeah lame like not lame in a bad way but like in like a hundred years maybe remember maybe and people today's like god here fine no problem like thanks for building this cool stuff but i think we're overly fixated on the reality that like there's almost none of it like any like building i always said about this colleges like you get a building dude they're gonna rename that [ __ ] in 50 years if it still exists sayonora i think i wrote about this recently like i just i think it's like i think it's such a false pursuit i just think it's like an unfortunate false pursuit actually the whole idea of legacy because the reality is in like i like you said 100 years i was going to say a thousand like no matter what in a thousand years you're all forgotten like we don't even know what half thousand years ago yeah like we don't remember [ __ ] like you know like socrates and like a few random p you know jesus whatever like there's a few people out there that we remember but the is the only guy that we know from 2000 years ago and there's still debate if he's true well we're all jewish here right so like abraham isaac you know we got we got some other guys out there we got some other dudes out there hunter you had you're half indian half jew yeah i'm a hindu dude i've only i think you're the first ever i've only heard about you yeah well i heard about 2000 years ago you're in the bible yeah yeah like mostly like when i tell people i'm jewish most people because they see me they think i'm sephardic like they think yeah just because of my brown skin but yeah no my mom is indian hindu um yeah my dad's white jewish from the bronx okay let's ask that i think that's a little bit why do i like doing this [ __ ] because one i like marketing and it's really a marketing problem it's like who is the audience i call them underdogs they're 18 to 35 year old men that want to start a side hustle or a business or solopreneur and they don't know what to do and they want inspiration and i make content that inspires them uh i do it because i like making the content i like seeing what goes viral i like looking at the metrics and then tweaking it and then i personally i get a lot of joy engaging in the comments i really like responding to almost all the comments myself um and so there's that i think the question i was curious though is like what's with jews it's always fun when you start with that what's with g what's with jews and all of us is that the end of the question no no no why do we love broadcasting like all the jews like comedians twitterians like disproportionately like there's a lot of jewish people i don't know there's something interesting about our culture goes back to the bible it goes back what happened in the bible so it goes back i've never read the bible the golden calf and you know the story no go on okay so i mean this okay so basically the story is moses was in the desert with the israelites they flew they fled from egypt to go to israel and in the process of that walk i believe what happened was the israelites started worshiping pagan gods and symbols and uh that's when moses went up to mount sinai and got the ten commandments from god so to speak and i feel like moses broadcasted to all those people at the bottom of mount sinai to help them sort of see ba see back judaism and and give them the the ten commandments was that the first tweet would you say the ten commandments he's like here's a listicle i've gotta i've gotta i've gotta ten times to improve your life [Applause] i mean you know you guys both put out a lot of content that i think does that you know i mean it's it's it's a tried and true right like uh buzzfeed uh you know created a billion dollar business around that um you know just the numbers grab people you know you get the like um you know the cl the clear effect of like hooking people in i mean let's be real like youtube like every single platform the people that have built big presents like you you uh continue to lean into the things that are grabbing people like how many youtube videos say like how i bought eight lamborghinis in for 10 grand in a weekend like that's every video when you go to it because those are the things that are hooking people so it's like human nature in some way shape or form um you know these like neatly packaged things i mean it's the brilliance of the ten commandments it's like ten commandments i know like that encompasses my whole world it's like great marketing if jews believed in hell all of us are i'm definitely go i don't know if i'm going i think i'm doing my best to stay wherever the hell jews go i the other thing that's interesting so hell about that is um i think more people should do like calling the calling the right word which is like a pruning like i pruned really aggressively on all my content like on instagram i think i followed 20 people because it's just like attractive people and some watches i think youtube is like really i watch poker and squash and then my videos i don't like i see these other business guys they drive me crazy i'm like just block them then you know on twitter too like i go through seasons i'm like oh i really want to get this kind of content and then i'm like i don't know it's not certain i think people could be a little bit more intentional uh about the the inputs and then just get over get get like brainwashed with positive inputs right like if brainwash would take i don't i try to get addicted tick tock it's hard for me i just think it's so garbage it's a it's a relatively state-owned corporation that controls the data of a whole lot of american teenagers and that is scary what does that say though that the american seniors don't give a [ __ ] about it they're like i don't care and even teenagers there's a lot of adults even myself i put up on tick tock and i'm like they can have my garbage videos i think they're taking out my diarrhea and uh follow me it's just so abstract on a micro level it's so abstract it's like hard to it's one of those things where it's like for one person it's very hard to conceptualize what that means but in the aggregate if it means that you know in a hot or cold war with china they could make slight tweaks to the algorithm that completely influence what all of our teenagers are seeing and how they're thinking on a daily basis that's pretty scary but like for an individual i don't really know what that means for me i'm not gonna be skewed by whatever i see you immediately you know you have an arrogance around it so i think it's scary geopolitically i really do if you're anything like me your portfolio is a mix of the usual suspects stocks bonds and mutual funds maybe you've even dabbled in

no matter what happens to you you stay in the arena you're not always going to win but you're always going to try and so long as you get smarter you will have good things that happen to you even as good other good things pass you by and it's kind of like a mindset that you have to have if you're going to be in not even just in tech just in entrepreneurship probably [Music] all right greg to start this episode i'm gonna need a story on this hat if you're not watching on youtube uh greg has a very interesting hat selection for today's today's show greg i went to joshua tree with some of my closest friends and they made me a hat called what would greg do wwgd and i just remember wearing this hat blowing out the candles 30 30 candles on my birthday and just feeling like feeling like i've made it because if you have a hat that says ww oh oh julian's putting on a hat is that a wwjd greenhouse julian dew also a green hat i don't know if i have a green outline okay that's that's another hat that you can wear that you sort of made it if you're wearing a spreadsheets hat but greg's hat your hat has a avatar of you on there and that avatar always cracks me up because it's your old twitter picture and i remember like because of your avatar most people that were following you thought you were like a 55 year old man and when we launched this podcast in what was that like november of 2021 and we filmed our first episode and put it up like half of the replies we got to the first episode were literally commenting on the fact that they thought greg was 55 and it turned out pretty much a younger guy people thought i was like a you know mid 60s wall street journal journalist um so i really confuse people you kind of give off those vibes well look we're um julian so so excited to have you on today man this has been a long time coming julian smith um we're going to get into a lot of who you are so i don't want to like fail to do you justice by trying to define you with like a one-sentence blurb at the beginning so i'm gonna actually just refrain from doing that um but you are a you know personal friend to both of us um you know someone we both admire a lot as a as an entrepreneur and as a thinker more broadly and so super excited to have this discussion with you and get to share it with everyone so that we can spend a little time getting inside your head and just having a having a little bit of a jam session here yeah thanks for having me did you know that one of the top reasons startups fail is bad hiring decisions people can be unpredictable and developers

r i s e dot com slash room to get started today so i i was trying to think about like where to start on this conversation greg and i were chatting yesterday as we had done our research and we're thinking about like what's the right way to frame this up with julian because you are as i said many many things um and i think probably a lot of people know you for your entrepreneurial pursuits arguably more interesting than your entrepreneurial pursuits is um your path and kind of how you formed your map of reality to get there um and greg was the one that alerted me to this that you um and kind of sent me your website and some of your old blogs and the books you had written so can you just walk us through a little bit to kind of set the stage on like who is julian smith like you know you were you were born now you're here uh what happened in between yeah i i had to figure so regarding the map of reality uh it's important to state that i was brought up super working class my father was a a coach like an exact coach but really before that he was a teacher in a one-room school in saskatchewan canada and my mother was a secretary and so i i i think a lot of people in tech they were like quite well connected maybe at the very beginning or they went to some cool school or some other thing like that uh foundationally in my in my life i i'm an underdog which is which is someone that believes that no one is going to pay attention that uh no that i don't that like i'm never going to get a break that no one's ever going to offer me a job which is still really true actually even now and that i'm going to have to really really work hard for all of the things that i have to do now that said at the same time i'm also a person who has gotten super lucky very early on in my life greg and i share like a few things i don't know how much like i've been so there's a number of episodes of this i've listened to i don't know if greg has ever shared like for example things about affiliate marketing which i also share early on in my history which is like these weird breaks where like you know previous to our generation you couldn't have like some 20 year old kid that's like yeah i made a couple million dollars online kind of doing nothing and then i went on and did some other thing but i i was one of those people and um and and so just for people who don't understand that what what is that what is affiliate marketing like it's it's new to me relatively new as a concept so like what were you and greg doing in those early days you know the little montreal mafia of like 16 year old that were somehow making bank on the internet while i was like [ __ ] around doing god knows what at age 16. caught up so it's okay it's it's uh what greg and i mean i he he'd speak to his experience we didn't know each other then but in my my background where it came from is i was one of the first podcasters in the world that's not necessarily a thing you should be that proud of it's interesting but because of that there was no way to monetize podcasts back then except for coupon codes and as a result of coupon codes because you could say a coupon code on a podcast right the result of that which i've see i've heard you do is an ability to attribute a sale to a podcast and so i got really really really good at hustling coupon codes back in 2004 uh when i was uh 25 or 26 or 27 or something and that is how i switched from having like a real shitty job going back to the history like like no college degree dropped out like five six times working a customer service job to recording a podcast and all of a sudden i had an online income out of out of nowhere and and so to back to the map of reality is like it's kind of like i'm going to have to keep working hard but if i keep working hard i don't know where the breaks are going to come from but i'm going to get some right it's kind of like how i think about what i do yeah it's like the um it's like this whole idea of like creating luck um which i've written about and talked about a lot it's you know one and one form of that is i think noval has written about this in the past but you just like move around enough and create enough motion in your ecosystem that you're just bound to get lucky because you're like you're literally if you're like an atom entering an ecosystem and you're just like shooting around banging into things like shooting or you know crashing into stuff somehow some way there's going to be some lucky thing that happens to you as a result of all that motion you're creating and it's i always love that as like a generalized mental model around these things um especially for young people because i think it's like it's something that anyone can do um you know you don't have to be an expert at something yet you can just create a lot of emotion and figure out your expertise as you go that's true the the other side of that is it means that you're going to miss some you're going to you're going to you're going to go out and it's like one of the things that you used to take really take those things really personally it's just be like oh i came up with this thing and then like but a good early example is is is being very early in podcasting so early that i was obviously too early right and so it's like we used to talk about ah it's gonna kill radio and it was my first job i got hired my my podcast ended up on sirius satellite radio in 2000 i feel like sixth or something like oh my gosh that's a big break but it's such a big break in such a small ecosystem back then it turns out it doesn't [ __ ] matter and so being early is the same thing as being wrong right yeah exactly and so uh and so you're gonna you're gonna get some lucky breaks presuming you know the hamster wheel keeps going and you keep staying on it but at the same time you're gonna miss some and when you miss some you you have to just like take the l and move on yeah the question is how painful those misses are and like if they damage you or if they compound in the long run i've always thought you know there's like um something i've thought about recently is like you know if you're using like a fighter example if you're kind of a fighter and you take like a glancing blow you know someone like almost knocks you out but it like kind of slips off there's like two types of people there's the person that is like oh phew i'm good don't worry about it like he missed me and then there's the person that's like what did i do that exposed me to that like what did i learn from that situation right there why did i take that glancing on how do i avoid that in the future and the second person is obviously able to like compound on the positive experience from taking the glancing blow where the first person is just as likely to take a knockout blow on the next punch because they didn't learn from that first one um so it's an interesting thing i think like what you're talking about as you as you learn as you create that motion what are you doing to learn from those l's and actually build upon them rather than just have them be you know some l on your score card it's difficult because when you when you do this when you take them you also all of a sudden realize your own vulnerability like like i remember the first time i went out surfing way too far way too early and as a result of doing that like i almost drowned at least once right and so that's when you're out there and i remember this happened it's like a critical moment in my life i'll never forget it i was saved well i mean there were a lot of surfers around me so i probably wasn't going to drown but holy [ __ ] that i ever feel like i was going to drown and uh and so what it does is it it creates this kind of vague ptsd or maybe acute ptsd uh from from something that traumatizes you it could be a business failure or it could be very visceral like what i'm describing right now and and the hardest part as you get older and you have more like experience under your belt doing these things is to retain that kind of fearlessness right and and it's that's why peter thiel who by the way like all of these people who we used to like just quote without any repercussions now we quote them and we're afraid to do so because they're they've they've gone off the rails in some cases i don't agree with everything he says but i he would be like no no you don't want failure people in startups talk about failure and and and really embrace that to a degree that's true but at the same time the fearlessness is so incredibly valuable like breather i would never have started such an ambitious company as a second time company because it takes so much balls to be able to do that to do this crazy radical off off the wall thing that nobody had really even conceived of existing as a startup that's really hard right i was going to ask you guys this as like both of you you know are builders and you've tried tested failed succeeded with a variety of things over your careers and lives do you think that there is a common thread of like having that almost like irrational optimism or like degree of arrogance like the willingness to go out way deeper than you should have surfing and the version of that that is in work you know you mention it with breather like greg have you experienced that as a builder consumer social is like the ultimate example of that i think anyone that goes into consumer social to build has to have that type of like boundless irrational optimism to some extent or like i want to clarify the the you know sort of where we came from and how that impacts who we are and i think this is relevant to anyone not from new york and not from san francisco uh you know a lot of our friends that we grew up with and clarify if i'm wrong julian but they're not doing big things at all um a lot of them don't even work and they don't it's not like they're not working because they're on the beach they're just like barely working part-time jobs you know consulting one day a week chilling out and where we came from is high and there's a cost associated with that as well and because of that i think people like julian and i kind of like you know our role models were people and books and people that we watched on tv like there's a reason why julian was reading like a book a week or something like that and ended up writing you know new york times bestselling book and there was reasons why you know i was you know traveling a lot and and sort of spent a lot of time there the point is the the other thing is the cost the cost of like us failing was is you know felt i don't know it felt smaller um you know when when i could have gotten an apartment for 500 a month instead of 4 000 a month in san francisco or when all my friends you know when i started a company thought i was crazy um [Music] i don't know i felt like being from a place where there's less success stories you just feel a bit more fearless because you think that may be kind of invincible it's we have a lawyer that we collectively have shared in the past name his name oh they just say his first name adam is the name of the lawyer and he i i brought breather to him by the way like literally nobody thought that this was a good idea like and i mean it like literally no one maybe greg like i was like here you should like which does this and and maybe he was the closest thing to maybe accepting that this could be a company right and so and so uh we i bring the lawyer to breakfast in west mount some of you care about this most of you will not any and and the lawyer the lawyer brings a um a sort of real estate like management firm dude and both of them were like you should not like you have you have a successful thing going you like you got a new york times best-selling book like you're doing speaking gigs like don't do this with the general attitude of like don't [ __ ] up your life right and so it it's it we and that's one of the hard working ones in in general it's like you know i always think about this this paul graham thing about like a city is telling you something the city itself is not telling you something but the ethos of that city is saying things to you and in where we come from the city is just like yeah hang out like everything's cool you're gonna be all right you don't need to work that hard and and so it makes it it makes the cost of failure low because nobody cares anyway i versus let's say in new york where everyone is richer and cooler than you or whatever the hell else but the other downside of it is that you have no support and and when you have no support you become incredibly like galvanized against other people saying things that like they don't agree or and like like literally nobody like you know i remember being in the first ten thousand users on twitter in 2006 like as you know you just went through your my history of things and and you discover that i've been around for a long time and so i have and and just i would i would come back to like people around me and be like hey here's this thing meanwhile it was on oprah or whatever whatever was happening with twitter back then and everyone and everyone around me was like this is dumb you are dumb if i go back to high school it's just like there was a lot of that back then as well and this is when it really i started becoming galvanized against ultimately rejection it's just like like i had no choice but to kind of like rise out of the ashes of this [ __ ] like way of being was just like okay wait nobody agrees with me either i'm dumb but i don't think i am i feel like i got something maybe these people just don't understand me and you just get stronger and stronger and stronger as you do this right and so like that's like the thing about growing up up in this different type of ecosystem that that values different things it seems like there's also a common thread in what you guys are saying of just like realizing that the worst case isn't that bad um i've always like greg i've talked to you about this recently like i've had these deep-seated fears of certain things um one of my deep-seated fears is like people calling me an idiot like people people realizing that i'm an idiot you know like an imposter syndrome thing of like oh my god they're gonna figure out that i'm an idiot and that i don't belong here and like for the longest time i've just been like oh my god really careful about everything that i say everywhere because i was just worried about that and then i kind of got dragged on the internet for something that i said which you know was probably like not really well thought through um and probably naive fair but like a lot of people called me an idiot all at once and i texted greg and i was like you know there's sort of this funny feeling of like once it's happened you realize like oh i'm still here um like i got punched in the face a whole lot there over and over and over again by like my biggest fear like something i really deeply viscerally did not want to ever happen to me and i'm still standing here and we're still having this conversation i still have friends like people still care about me it's okay um and i think that there's like a common thread there as well of just like that realization with entrepreneurs that the worst case you know you fail like the thing you thought was gonna work is not and you kind of pick your pick yourself up and like american law has great bankruptcy laws and you can you know like make your way and re you know reset the clock and figure out how to go do your next thing and take another shot at it and there's plenty of case studies of people who have had that happen and then had their amazing success on turn three four or five that it's very true and at the same time you were always thinking because you're you're watching the media in not the media with capital m but you're watching various forms of like info that is being pushed pushed back at you and the media is driving this narrative of you're young probably you your parents are rich probably uh you have a reality show probably you're thin and successful and like all of these other things and you're like you look at yourself in the mirror whoever you are it doesn't really matter and you're like but i'm ugly and stupid and and so um uh and it doesn't matter how many successes you have on your belt there's still a part of you that still try to fight that i was listening to your josh wolfe thing the other day and i it was incredible the transparency of someone who's obviously done really well and who's well respected but who at the same time i get uh it it allowed him to be even more clear about what his weaknesses are and i really respect that because it takes even you know it's it takes a lot it especially takes a lot as an entrepreneur because as an entrepreneur it is especially like this this the culture of we're doing well i'm doing well is so consistent and pervasive but as a second time entrepreneur i will tell you something that i really learned in my first company venture back company i really was like we're doing well everything's going great i really i did this i trumpeted this attitude of positivity now what i do is is i say here's the things that are going well here's the things we need to work on and and i think that that that that understanding that there's still something to work on first of all it gives an impression to me that of me that people are like oh he actually knows what he's doing he's not just like relentlessly trumpeting optimism all the time and then the second one is i get to then like normalize the [ __ ] ups which is like yeah we don't know this yet and we don't understand this yet and we don't understand yet this yeah versus saying one thing and believing in other and and having that that difference between the outside world and the inside world uh cause you like [ __ ] have anxiety attacks or whatever it is yeah you talked about a lot of this in um one of your blog posts like when i was going through and reading some of your old blogs to get a better understanding of you prior to the episode um you're one of your like best blog posts is is called the complete guide to not giving a [ __ ] okay and it's so good like highly recommend people go and and read it because it's amazing and i just super super thoughtful um can you talk a little bit about that piece i mean like people know this concept because of a book that came out although i'm checking the date stamps on it your piece came out april 2011. that book came out in 2016. so i'm going to ask you about that as well and it's ironic that i was i was an author of book them like at that time when that piece was written at the same time right i hadn't started a company i i so so i don't really talk about this because i it's one of the things that i sort of move past but i'll talk about it here with all y'all because we know each other and so on and it's like whatever but but i definitely i don't want to be one of those people that is like but look at this thing before it because you know what happens in tech as all these people are like but i invented twitter before five years before and you're like no you [ __ ] didn't you [ __ ] invented a stupid thing and so here here is the story the story is in 2011 uh i guess i published this this blog post which you can look up and the reason it was so successful is because from an seo standpoint my website was excellent and my uh and my affiliate marketing business was based in seo and so when i wrote this piece all of a sudden i ranked number one for years for how to not give a [ __ ] for years and so 10 000 visits a day or some [ __ ] would go to my website with this idea of not giving a [ __ ] right if we should think about it as an incredible like a thing that lots of people want and so uh i i did write a book then which actually is which was extremely well read at that time and even today that that still i i get a message about called flinch which is about this idea of of uh making sure not to to um to to shirk away from things that you're afraid of and then i wrote another book which is portfolio penguin which is called the impact equation after those three books i went and i started breather but alongside that happening probably what happened is that and this is this is the part that i kind of try not to talk about because i i don't want it to seem like sour grapes well i asked about it so yeah i know i understand yeah typically i would not bring this up is this thing continued to rank number one for complete my guide to not giving a [ __ ] for literally forever and then along the lines some kind of thing happened and then it became a book and then i started seeing in bookstores and i'm not saying because i haven't read this book and by the way i have no intention of reading it ever but lots of people have read it i went to italy one time and i i saw somebody reading it on at that next to the pool and i was like man this is really weird and i and but i this is one of those things about staying in the arena you no matter what happens to you you stay in the arena you're not always going to win but you're always going to try and so long as you get smarter you will have good things that happen to you even as good other good things pass you by and it's kind of like a mindset that you have to have if you're going to be in not even just in tech just in entrepreneurship probably so i appreciate you sharing that because i know that it's not something you've you've shared publicly before i have read the book um i thought your blog post is better just for what it's worth don't don't tell the uh don't tell the author of the book um but uh no i i mean look it is um it's another example of like one of those you know one of those moments in your career that you know at the time feels damaging and and you wrestle with and you know you're like everyone talks about this is something i just think about a lot we all talk about like oh failure leads to growth or like dark times you know darkest before the dawn like there's all these cliches and adages and i'm just as uh you know responsible because i spout them on twitter all the time but the reality is that like dark times failures whatever they just [ __ ] suck and like no matter how much excuse my language like no matter how much you know you like read those things and say them to yourself whatever when you're in it it's just dark and sometimes it just stays dark and you're just like down and you don't know when it's gonna come out you don't see a path to it being good or green and you're just like it just sucks and there's no way around that you just have to kind of be in it and go through it um and this seems like one of those moments but on the other side of it obviously was a lot of uh what is what it encourages you to do is you get better at suffering which is a crazy thing to think about but it's like the first time that you suffer you're just like wow this is terrible but so long as you persevere and by the way we're talking about entrepreneurship we're not getting we're not talking about like torture right and we're not talking about war yeah we're not talking about real starvation we're talking about it you have a thing you're trying to make something of yourself you're some random person in a corner you're trying to build the world to a degree in your image more than it was before which was zero and so uh and so like so like just stay on the treadmill and just keep going regardless of what happens and then as those bad things happen you actually you become much better at handling them this is why i don't have to say like my actually my company is doing quite well thank you by the way you've both been uh a part of the last financing and that's awesome and thank you for that i i the um the even though my company is doing well i don't like overshoot it and assume oh and then we're gonna make and then the next financing is gonna be like this and then we're gonna have this much in in revenue and like i'm just like i work on today i work on today regardless of what happens whether that day is good or bad and it it's actually incredibly clarifying to do that and and it's like if you are working on projects like this whether it what it does is a little bit as if whether you are succeeding or failing kind of becomes beside the point it's and i will say like in entrepreneurship like because i coach ceos right because practice the company that we're talking about here is isn't it is a a software platform for coaches to run their businesses and so as a result of that i coach first-time ceos and when you see the inside of their business it's like it's not [ __ ] easy out there ma'am and so like to anyone that's listening to this is like these guys seem maybe they seem to have it figured out or something we truly do not like we're just we're just really doing our best one day at a time and and maybe we have a lot of suffering behind us so we've made it i love the we suffer less because i think that's so true i remember 2011 2012 coming from montreal to san francisco put all my money into this video discovery startup i was running called five by and i was literally like reaching out to anyone who would talk to me and i went for a hike with this entrepreneur and i was telling him what i was doing and he was like oh dude like that sounds exactly like insert famous consumer social app person uh is doing it sounds and i showed him the mock-ups he's like dude it's literally like pixel for pixel the same and i was like could you put me in touch with him and like you know that feeling like your heart sinks um that's how i felt yes put it put in you know we get in touch the next day we're having coffee um he shows me the platform and it's like a it's like not only is it pixel uh for pixel better or pixel perfect the same it's like 10x better and everything is just more thought out and uh he looks me in the eye and this is the craziest thing that you know it's such a crazy thing to say and he was like i wouldn't even sell my company for a billion dollars to google because he had sold his last company to google and i basically left that coffee meeting just like you know crying like honestly like i was just like this is this is done like but this is over before it's even begun and you're totally right like ever since then like every you know big suffering event has been like less and less and less um but if you're gonna sign up to entrepreneurship you are gonna suffer period if you're anything like me

real way um i want to talk a little bit about like that first kind of that first action like you know for julian for your first company like when you made the jump from um you know being an author speaking tour all you know to your point the lawyers told you like you have a great thing going why are you making this change what was it like what was the insight and what was your first action step when you were gonna jump into it i think a lot of people would benefit from hearing that because there's a lot of people who have the ideas and then don't take the action and it's like how do you combine the two what was your kind of moment and and how did you make that jump you know it's interesting i haven't thought about this in a long time but i was a big habit proponent back in the day and and um what i did was i was using a habit app uh and i wrote in it as one of my things work on secret project and it's and it's like remarkably simple right like i i knew i really cared about this thing i didn't know what it was at the time and actually it was like a shitty version of the idea probably back then but i i made an effort to work on it every single day yeah and and i mean that's how it started and it it sort of grew in seriousness it grew in series what did that mean to you like work on a project every single day like i just wanted to i just wanted to put i just want to push the ball forward in any way that i could i did not care what it was so long as i could check it off and i hadn't like you know i had a kind of intellectual honesty towards myself like i'm not gonna [ __ ] on myself about it and i said so long as i advance this i can see whether or not it was something and there came a stage where i just got an unbelievable crazy optimism and my like my crazy optimism was like nothing i'd ever had about anything and i was like i'm pretty sure not only did i believe that it was fundamentally gonna happen by the way i knew nothing about it i used to send greg emails about like i have no idea how to raise money i'm so like i have no idea what i'm doing these people seem so smart i'm so stupid i looked at these emails a few months ago it's ironic like when how it went since then right but like i i really believed that i knew nothing and that i had no path to doing it because i didn't know anybody like that like back to the network i had nobody in my world i don't even think i really even knew what entrepreneurship was but i i had a sense that if i could advance it just a little bit at a time every day it would become more real and then ultimately it did and that's how i learned to become a ceo and that's how i learned to raise all this money and and build a business and all of these cities and all these things as a result of just kind of taking and just for the listeners like this he was when he when julian's talking about raising all this money he's not talking about you know 500k or a million dollars you know he's just being a humble canadian here we're talking in the in the hundreds of millions of dollars lots of money in a short amount of time yeah yep about 200 million dollars so and this is a guy who literally didn't know anything about startups like i like like it's he literally did not and then like he was emailing me and i was like 22 at the time or something so and and we were kind of like going back and forth when we were in the arena together and just like sort of you know doing our best and seeing what julian had did from i want to say what like two when did you start breather 13 yeah so in a matter it's pretty inspirational because in a matter of a few years going from not knowing much about venture-backed startups to zero to one you know hundreds of employees hundreds of millions of dollars raised coming from a place that's you know he didn't graduate from harvard or whatever wasn't living in new york or san francisco had no existing network like he he bootstrapped it and he did it because he treated it like a job i i i'm looking at the emails right now and and i'm looking at them and it's literally me like kind of vaguely not like it's like an egalitarian relationship it's two people speaking equals but literally me going i have no idea what i'm doing do you know how to raise money because i don't and i don't know anybody that does and he sent me these shitty like decks from 2012 or whatever it is and i and i don't even know how i got over the hump to tell you the truth but i will say that we were lucky like like i was i was lucky because i would be able to for example i called gary vaynerchuk on the phone it was like a story i'll never forget on my life because i have the the some of the history that probably many people don't know is i have epilepsy i don't have a lot of seizures but i worry about seizures a lot and um and sleep really meaningfully affects whether i have them or not and so i'm sitting in the back of an uber back when they were just limos and i'm taking this call with gary vaynerchuk because i happen like we know each other from the book world right so i am kind of more networked at this point because i've written a couple books blah blah and so i i'm lying down like fearful of whether i'm gonna have a seizure or not which i don't obviously and uh and i'm like hey and i say to the dude like do you mind if i lie down in your thing in the back seat and i'll never forget what you say to me he says sir while you're in my car you are a king i was like wow i take the call from gary and and he he goes something like i don't have time to advise because i was just like i was like well he even like does he does he really know me that well is he and he's like yeah julian has been around a super long time uh yeah i'll definitely invest no problem and he just gives me my basically my first money right there so it's like we do have those advantages but at the same time like it required some happenstance for people to just give you a shot and that's the thing that i really never forget i and i remember talking to somebody about this recently it's like i will never forget people that give me a shout out greg to a degree as a person that gave me a shot really being willing to kind of like help me out and learning how to do this and as much as possible whenever i find smart people i'm just like i want to give them a shot yeah it's like you know the people that there's kind of two people that you never forget uh people that gave you a shot and people that were there for you in your darkest times um i like i always think about that like you can count on two hands the people in those categories for you and they are so so impactful and you never forget them like the person that is there for you i call them darkest hour friends but like the person that is there for you when [ __ ] is really bad um because it's just not convenient it's not cool it's not positive for them like everyone wants to be there when you raise a bunch of money and there's like the celebration of the round and everyone's going to be there for you julian we're going to be like yo this is sick let's go party we go to vegas you know you just raised 100 million awesome but like how many of those people are there when the [ __ ] goes belly up and it's not working and you know you're having to fire sail it like whatever it is like how many of those people are still there and it's it's very few unfortunately um but those people that are are the people that then come up over and over and over again in your life and that you want to be there with in the trenches with yeah and it's interesting because like i have to say i have these old friends of mine again from like back in the day that i stay friends with and i've been friends with them since high school or college but increasingly it's like you have your friends kind of have to be entrepreneurs it's not like universally true but they just like get you in a way that other people do not and there is this mutual understanding and again like i'm making these weird analogies it's like two people went to war we didn't we do not go to war not really but we have a set of unique experiences that are that really cannot be shared with other people that have never started companies before and have never like basically smashed their face up against the wall over and over and over again until like a brick fell out and then they were able to like squeeze their whole body through the brick somehow and make company out of that like those those people have done that yeah i'm i want to talk about this because and we we haven't talked about this you know privately at all so i'm just curious your perspective um i've actually over the last since covet basically have been spending way more of my time with the people i grew up with who are not entrepreneurs and increasingly spending more and more my time with those people and less and less time with entrepreneurs and and people like that and i've been i've been finding it to be really fulfilling because like these are the people these are your day ones and there's just something that's like wholesome and pure about it and i've really really i've been enjoying that uh experience that i've been having i felt with a family mostly like who you went to like elementary school with like i know you like in my mind i don't know if you want to talk about it but like you have this group of people that you you know share an experience with uh on a regular basis i don't know we can cut this out if you don't want to talk about like no no but what he's saying what what he's saying is he he he knows that i've been playing dungeons and dragons with the same people since i was about 10 to 15 years old that's what he's saying go ahead that's like stranger thing stuff i love that uh stranger things is the cool version this was way before that well i mean i actually really that's like what i respect about you one of the things i really respect about you julian is that you have both worlds like i feel like you spend time with people who um are are entrepreneurs who are building incredible things investors that sort of thing but you also even when you had raised all this money and you built this huge company or you're starting a new company practice and it's starting to scale you're still you're still making time for those day ones and that's really like i respect that and you you know that about me like too like i really resp like i don't i wouldn't want to lose that that wholesomeness and purity um i'm just curious your perspective on it yeah so i i mean i i agree with you i know that you have always been i don't know if the right phrase maybe it is family orientation actually i would say you're more family oriented than me but i have recently become more family oriented it just happened to be my father passed away like right before covet or thank god and uh and i was suddenly left with mostly my mother's side of the family and i found that i could bond with them in a new way which i've now begun to do and all of a sudden i feel like i'm part of the family almost like a like a clan in a way that i didn't think before but i was i distinguished that from these early long-standing friends of mine that i've had a really long time and they probably are the people that keep me grounded because otherwise my identity would have been too attached to i run a startup oh my god i'm you know like i'm the second coming and then when if the company is tanking then i'm tanking and i'm worthless but i had this kind of like separate ability to identify like i had a separate ego where i felt you know because of the fact that they never cared and even now i'm you know i'd be like oh yeah i raised like 25 million dollars and and uh seems to be going pretty well and i met warren buffett or whatever random thing they're just like i don't care i don't care it's incredibly comforting right because clearly around you yeah it's good to it's good to have people around you that just don't care at all about the thing that you know other people would be like wowed by it's just like it's grounding and humbling at all times you're totally right but but i think that to a degree people like us you kind of admitted it and i'm admitting it here like like we're trying to prove something to other people like maybe our own self-worth maybe we're trying to prove it to ourselves and so when someone doesn't acknowledge that then you're just like okay you like me for me like that's weird why i guess it depends on who on i guess it depends on who it is in your life like there are very few people that i think most people are willing to be 100 authentically themselves around and you can say that you are that way around your partner spouse etc i would argue that most people actually still aren't they're still like presenting a you know better version of themselves because it's very difficult to be like truly open yourself up in every way um i think maybe with like your parents uh you're that way or with your probably not with your children but maybe with your parents you're willing to be that way um but it's like a scary thing right like i remember the big moments of my life like big turning points of like going to you know going to school and going from being like big fish in a small pond to going you know i went out to stanford to play baseball and i was like really bad at baseball relative to most of the players on the team and not very smart compared to most of the students in my classes and that imposter syndrome that i felt and that insecurity that i felt was like highly motivating but also like quite disturbing at times i mean just like dark dark feelings of constantly being stressed and like you know it's like the duck syndrome of everything looks fine on the surface and you look and you're like oh everything's great with this person i think we constantly do that by the way with entrepreneurs um you know we look at these people that have made a billion dollars or made a hundred million dollars and we say like their life must be awesome man that like so cool uh they must be happy all the time they must be great and the reality is that a lot of these people could best be described as tortured um i think i heard like patrick oshognes he maybe say that or tweet that about amazing people he had talked to a lot of these people like there's real downsides to um you know having this unbelievable ambition and drive to go achieve more and more and more there's a darkness on the other end of it that comes as part of that kit quote-unquote that um is very very real yeah you um i i often refer back to this whole story about um [Music] the john rockefeller senior who was the richest man in the world at that time and who uh was an incredibly incredible family man but also super stingy even inside of his own family like totally terrorized people like john rockefeller jr we know as the person who built rockefeller center and who was a cutthroat monopolist but at the same time i was able due to his monopoly of oil to to stabilize the price of oil and as such enable stuff to be built on top of it which could not be done when you add all of these oil fields that some of which were being built and some of which were going bankrupt and all these other things instead he silently bought them all underneath right and so you've got and by the way later on like was able to revolution revolutionize medicine as a result of all of the funding that he was able to give it and turn it into a real science many people say so you've got these people that like we just have to give up on them being normal like the idea that they we should just be able to cart wash think of them as being successful and they're just great and if you meet them it's gonna go well like it's not like we are close to these people you know it's interesting i i was once having a conversation with um because i was funded by one of uh peter thiel's uh venture funds called velour that focused on investments outside the united states at the time and i was having conversations and i would be like yeah kind of which i don't even know i should be saying this but it's like i was like peter thiel money and i was like we were very candid with one another it was actually a pretty solid relationship and i was like i don't know it's not like the cleanest money in the world like he's kind of a weird dude and because i would just say anything and he was the the two guys that run this fund were like you should see what's out there man it's it's it's not clean out there either he's like this is pretty good and so i think if we like we separate completely and i know it's very difficult to do that we separate the acts of success and the things that they have built completely from the person that way we'd be like that's super cool that you built paypal and then this and then this and then this and this and uh maybe you do drink people's blood like it is possible at this point you know i don't know so the if we do that i think that we'll be able to normalize uh this idea that uh that people are uh that they're special instead we're able to say they're actually not special they just work exceptionally hard and it doesn't mean that they're like paragons of virtue and it doesn't mean we should worship them we build statues about them all these things they did a really good thing they did a really good thing doesn't really say anything about who they are at all and i think that that would be very psychologically healthy for a lot of people so before we get to the end of our time i do want to just get into the weeds a little bit on julian on what you're building now and sort of like the indirect and direct ties to what you had worked on before so breather you know for people that aren't familiar was like um you know unique spaces like you could um you know book spaces to get a breather which like by the way it might have been early for its time and maybe there were flaws in it which you can talk about separately um but it's like a great concept right like everyone wants a breather um the idea of it makes a ton of sense um and candidly like if you're in a city and you can find a space to actually just catch your breath and like meditate for a few minutes or do a call or just get away totally makes sense um you worked on that you mentioned earlier that you know there were things as a first-time entrepreneur that you really learned um and that you're applying and approaching differently with practice which is what you're building today can you talk about that um transition from being kind of a first-time entrepreneur to a second time and how it's informed your building process for what you're doing today so i i will say this like i'll what i'll do is i'll maybe compare it to the uh the book business right and so when you're in the book business what happens is you have hits and misses and hits and misses it's just like well that book did really well and then that book that i wrote thought it would do well and so i'm just gonna kind of keep writing them and uh it's kind of a crap shoot and there's much more of that kind of like picasso effect i don't know if you've ever read this book it's called young geniuses and old masters and the book is about the two paradigms for how to become better one of them is you have a game-changing thing that you do early in your life like picasso the second type is the type like matisse and matisse who's just endlessly doing landscapes up until he's 95 and he's doing the same landscapes and he's trying to make them better and better and better and better and so even though i have had these moments in my like kind of like earlier years where i was able to do these kind of vaguely kind of young genius moments i have settled into a state in which i'm just consistent just working on the process to improve and so one of the big changes for me is i learned how to become a ceo through in a much more of a pressure cooker way than most people most people start a company and it kind of like goes somewhere like sort of and i don't know i learned to be a ceo by raising 150 million dollars scaling a team from zero to 250 plus people in under like three four years maybe uh and uh building a category or let's say a category entrant out of scratch uh from scratch and no literally having kind of like not that much mentorship around me and so i had this crazy ride but now i actually know it's this weird thing that i've kind of come to grips with recently i actually know how to be a ceo and run companies and i actually like am good at it so it's it's a different thing i've like found my place people ask me often will you write another book again i wish you blogged like i just loved your podcast like all these different things i considered those projects in a lot of cases that i would do for two or three years or some other thing like that then i would maybe get burned out on them and i didn't want to do them anymore whereas being a ceo i actually am good at and i can keep good doing for a really long time and this is this kind of like weird chrysalis like awakening moment when i it emerged from the lotus blossom or whatever and i'm like oh wow like i actually am really good at this and this means that i can impact a lot of people you asked me a little bit about the thread i call it a red thread it's an expression i got from tamsen mcmahon who is another author and it's this this sort of through line through your life and this idea of this through line through your life is like that's been sort of the the thing that has you have valued all throughout it and for me going back to the sort of the beginning and feeling like an underdog i always want to give people individuals more empowerment than they have been than they've had and so i did that a breather and all my books are about that and practice is really intended to serve solar printers so it's kind of the same thread all throughout and and i really i i realized one of the things you realize when you start a company is you kind of only have a shot of a couple shots if it's going to work well and if you it is going to work well like you've had for example alexis ohanian on the show it's like you don't have like 50 shots you've got like probably five to really make a difference at something and i thought well what is it that i really care and i went back throughout my life and i said what are the things that i cared about today at my age but that when i was 20 i still cared about so those are the through lines and i went through them and there's not a lot of them and i said those are the things probably the only things that i can start businesses doing because it's the only thing else they'll care about in 10 years and one of those was this idea of individual empowerment and being able to help individuals and allowing them to like become better and to get higher leverage and be more successful with little and so that's why i started this business and that's for me probably that that that deep care that i have and that my team has today is probably one of the reasons we're successful do you still enjoy it like do you do you feel a lot of energy around when you when you wake up yeah but i had to set boundaries for myself a lot of people like out there are like why would you start another venture back company it's horrible right like because we we talk like a bunch of us that have raised money before are like i'm pretty sure though are you talking about me but i don't i'm not talking about you in this case i just think about somebody else but there's a lot of people who believe that and i actually like i know that i'm entering into a contract in which i get extremely high leverage as a result of some weird like category risk which you wouldn't get if you weren't taking venture back venture venture financing and i'm conscious of that risk and i really embrace it as a result of being able to accelerate because when you what happens in venture back companies like every anyone who's here who's who started one greg knows i definitely know is you get this density of talent that's just unbelievable and you meet people you're just like holy [ __ ] and by the way one of the people is someone that you referred to me dude is that literally we were looking for an onboarding specialist we hired somebody and they were someone who listened to maybe that would that followed y'all's uh twitter feeds and listened to the show and his name is rahul he's been on our team for three months and just now right before this we were talking to him we were talking about him we were like i can't believe this rando just showed up and is so excellent at this stuff you just find these people right other people maybe will be jealous on my team because i'm talking about one guy we have a great team of people but this is one that kind of came out of nowhere and i love finding undiscovered people i love making them more excellent when i can and i love being able to build something with small teams of people really feeling like a tribe i love that so i actually like it way more than last time but i needed to set boundaries in order to allow that to happen there's so much that i'm taking away from this conversation like personally and professionally i mean one of the things that's been a big takeaway for me is like this idea of the red thread that you just raised um you know and like the through line through your life and being really thoughtful and introspective about that through line um you know you just mentioned it like your ability to reflect on each stage what you picked up what the just like painful losses were that really did nothing and compounded in no way um but use everything in kind of every little lesson and learning along the way to um you know hopefully ultimately lead you to a place where you're deriving a ton of energy from the things you're working on and doing um i mean i i'm coming away feeling uh feeling quite inspired around all of that greg my big takeaway is be like be like matisse like i had never heard that before and although um a lot of people including myself might be envious of being a picasso it's just way more consistent to become a matisse i think anyone could become a matisse if they just put in the work and sort of focus um and uh yeah i mean also what would julian do wwjd i should swap my hat i should stop swap yeah by that domain name and my um my last my last takeaway for everybody that um i had written down as we went through was that secret project that idea you've had find a small way to work on it a little bit every single day um and i love that when you said that because it was like it takes the intimidation factor completely out of it if you just think of it as like i'm gonna do 15 minutes on this thing a day i have this like 30 for 30 idea where you just spend 30 minutes a day for 30 days and at the end of that you know you have 900 minutes of accumulated effort on something it's bound to make forward progress during that period and that can be anything cardio you know workouts whatever it is writing etc but like a secret project if you just find one small way to push the ball forward every single day it's pretty amazing what you can accomplish in a short period of time so that was my one final um takeaway to leave people with uh

so authentic is the most important for life in general because you don't have to show up ever thinking about being a different person like being authentic allows you to to free headspace to not have to worry about anything but how that relates to making more money is really simple is that in your authentic state you have an intuition that nobody else has like period and when you are in that creative intuitive state that is so 100 you it's like i can almost guarantee that you will find success now here's the kicker very few people reach that level of intuitive self truth [Music] greg's

won't regret it oh well i think it's a good jumping off point i like that it's a it's our first framework for the day greg is gotta bring the heat it's the guy to bring the heat framework no matter what you're doing you gotta go hard at it i i actually look i mean broadly speaking i completely agree with that too right like you uh you know you have a finite amount of energy and so pick and choose the things that you really care about that you want to be working on and when you're going to work on them work really freaking hard at those things and go dive in on them with a lot of that energy so i love it man it's a good jumping off point i think honestly man i've been great like greg alluded to like we've been we've known each other i like to think of it if if it was in a music scene right like let's say we were talking about a city's music scene but we we're talking about entrepreneurship but think about it through that framework right where a lot of musicians in a scene will get together and be amongst each other and see each other as they're trying to do their thing uh greg and i since like 16 years old have been hustling entrepreneurship i'm 33 so just i agree i don't even know how old you i think you're 33 too probably yeah same age so uh we've come up together in the same city we were under uh one of the same grand masters rory olson i always love shouting him out come from montreal and just wait just pause on that under the same grand master rory olsen is that the name yep what does that mean what is a grand master i i mean i'll give you my uh take on it i think you know greg could take you another uh can give you another take on it uh rory's just a really predominant entrepreneur out of montreal um has done over three [Music] nine figure exits over three uh took a cut and and was the founder of pay safe which i think is today still the largest third largest e-wallet in the world if i'm not mistaken um i mean this guy negotiated we were just it's funny greg he he says what's up we're out for dinner two weeks ago i know you guys speak a bunch too but he was talking about he negotiated with um why am i blanking out on this gentleman's name he is uh musk's partner at um paypal peter thiel peter tl yeah he had a pretty heavy negotiation or a restaurant we were out in montreal with peter thiel in the basement so i mean long story short rory is a g um after my dad died when i was uh my dad died when i was 10 he kind of took me under his wing from like 11 to 19. and just really gave me the ins and outs of the game i learned all my m a finance deal making stuff through him and so i call him a grand master because that that's what he was for my life and i know uh greg had a really intimate time with him too so it's just we we both came from the same ground master that's what i like to call it yeah i think uh so some you know similar experience that i had as a teenager i met him and he also took me under his wing and sort of showed me the ropes um so but you know it was it was also a different time back then like back then like there wasn't podcasts like this that the ropes were being shown you know so having someone like that i mean is is still today such an advantage but was back then like ten times or a hundred times even more uh because you know startups back then was completely demystified so having like someone like that who's the top of his game just sort of show you the abcs was was super valuable yeah one of the it's kind of one of the benefits i was going to say too like you guys are both from montreal or montreal as you guys as you guys say i need to get i need to get the accent down um being from like a non-you know it's not san francisco right like it wasn't the tech hub of the world and yet there was this thriving entrepreneurial community right like we've had harley on the show amazing entrepreneur from the area there's tons of you guys it's like you know the little montreal mafia and it's like one of the benefits of being from one of these sort of off the beaten path entrepreneurial communities is it becomes tight-knit as a result of it being off the beaten path and so these people that otherwise might be inaccessible to you in a large you know thriving tech hub become these mentors and want to see that community you know growing and thriving and i'm sure you guys are now doing that for young up-and-comers from the area the same way i know harley is ah i'm die hard munch i mean i speak with greg about this all the time die hard montreal i mean one of the main reasons why we chose to build midday squares here we were looking at toronto and la is just i always i have this you know vision of bringing the energy that nike brought to oregon to montreal um and that's something that's that's one of the main reasons why we chose it to even do it here but going back to what you're saying i think a lot of people don't understand how much wealth is in montreal i mean we have um we have this ridiculous amount of concentrated wealth from very very long histories of very powerful families in in a very small city like i'm telling you it's really small you can drive the entire perimeter of the island in one hour um and so like a lot of people don't know this but uh the demarae family which is from montreal owns one-third of adidas right that means they own one-third of the easiest deal they own you know they own some serious stuff and that's a montreal family um so yeah montreal is like low-key like really powerful and um and i think to your point you're better off sometimes being a huge fish in a small pond and that's that's kind of like what i've always loved doing i know greg went out there to san francisco and really chopped his teeth out there and did a hell of a job um but i never made that jump i think there's a benefit of both right like the big fish small pond um and then you know small fish in a big pond that people always present it as like an either or and you kind of got a pick but like greg's an example i think of someone who's done it both ways and you kind of benefit from it in different ways like i think um you know for me personally my own experience like i was kind of a big fish in a small pond growing up um yeah playing baseball in a small town i thought i was like legit it probably led to me getting some really cool development opportunities as a result of um being a bigger fish in a smaller pond and then i went out to school and all of a sudden i was like a tiny fish in a massive pond and i was horse [ __ ] at the things i thought i was really good at on a grander scale and you get the like humility um you know and the the grind that you have to develop in order to actually come up the curve when you're in that environment so i think actually i mean having a combination of both it's like the um greg i've talked to you about this uh i think it's jim collins has this idea of the genius of and and it's like the counterpoint to his tyranny of the ore which is these false dichotomies that we create where you're like you have to pick one or the other and the reality is you can do both and so it's like the genius of and um in these situations which i've always loved i feel the same way about so much stuff i just i think people over analyze a lot of things like all the way down to should you fundraise should you not fundraise it just doesn't [ __ ] matter all that matters is that you have a goal in mind and you have to get there and to get there is going to have you know whether you need to raise money or not is going to require some type of capital requirement to get to where you need to do and if you don't have enough money well then you need to fundraise and if you don't then you know continue doing what you got to do like it doesn't need to be so complicated all the time i think that you know 33 year old nick versus 20 year old nick it just oversimplifies everything it's the occam's razor man you gotta find like the simplest answer is often the best one simple is beautiful i completely agree with you it's actually a great place to start too because i do want to get into this amazing business you've built and some of the principles and like get a little bit tactical on some of the learnings that we can share with people we've never really gone greg into d to c and like true consumer on the show and so i'm really excited to kind of get and we are not i wanted to preface something we are not a d2c company and so i think i think i could give you a great um a great take on what it means to be a d2c company today because we operate in the d2c space but we do not operate as a d2c company can you clarify what you mean by that yeah so i think i think there was this movement in 2000 to 2020 that was like you had to build a business around direct to consumer and i think in that time a lot of people especially depending on what channel you're in but when it comes to consumer package goods i think people miscalculated the value proposition of the supply chain partners i.e distributors and retailers and so people went out and and took those margins because it's it's like a really nice story right hey you make a product a distributor takes anywhere from 18 to 25 percent then you give it to a retailer and they take another 30 to 40 percent right that's a nice story to say we're going to take that away and we're going to pass the savings on to the consumer what i think people forgot was how trained humans are in that buying cycle and how much more money it actually costed to scale than to actually just play within the distribution channels that exist um yeah i mean that's like the um i think toby another uh another canadian uh toby from from shopify he's canadian right where is he uh is he a german born in germany and moved to canada okay um he was commenting on this earlier especially too like when you think about the early days of that movement and the idea people had which is actually a fair insight as you point out um that was during a time when you could literally like um you know put in any keyword and have pretty little competition if you were like buying ads on facebook or social or google adwords whatever it was and he was joking that like now you can rub your face into your keyboard and probably run into like 100 people bidding against you on whatever that is like jumble of letters and so that i mean the rules of the game have just fundamentally changed as a result of that yeah which is always like i think i feel like i went my whole life to come back to square one i remember when i was 16 years old i was just like brand brand brand brand brand and then i went away from that and now i've come back to that like the worst place i think you could be to build a massive business is in commodities business and so um you know brand is everything and then you look at retail partnerships and how meaningful i'm telling you guys i've been in software retail wholesale revenue is as good as software it is like clockwork every 28 days if you have a product that repurchases meaning that that's the good sign right if people are coming back into their grocery habits or any of those like it's like clockwork i've never seen that so um that's what i mean by i really do see is just a component of of what we are but we are absolutely not a d2c business so we are manufacturing business that that runs a brand so in the like cpg space like who do you like what other brands are you seeing that are doing a really good job and what are you know how are you incorporating some of their stuff into midday squares if any because you know sometimes i look at what you all are doing and i'm kind of like you're just doing your own thing it feels like you're doing like a unique thing yeah but it's not even that unique greg it's fully stolen from the music industry that's what i love i love talking about this all the time is like it is um okay so let me let me really bring it down what was the initial strategy midday squares okay if you really so yes we're a manufacturer uh yes we're a cbg product but to really understand what we're doing from a marketing perspective is we're a media company and our patreon is our chocolate that is like the best way to describe what is happening and so um my partner jake really brought this idea to us is what he distilled the last 10 years of brand and like hardcore brand like stuff that really is moving the needle and i'll give you i'll give you some examples of like like i think uh figgs is doing a great job of just like being a d2c company you know i i think everybody can find their own playbook and just to clarify figs for those who don't know at uh uniforms basically for health care workers what yeah they they made they were in public too i mean they got huge lululemon vibe like brilliant brilliant play right boring uh unattended to industry of brand it was all commodity style players but there were some big players and they just brought some some style to it and really exploded i think for us was like if you really look at what was happening in fashion in the music industry and like the the convergence of those two it feels like every brand today that's successful has to be celebrity driven i don't know if you guys feel the same way but it's almost like hey if you're a celebrity you got to have a cpg product um and that's that's true to a certain extent but i think that the reverse is true too you can actually use the product if grade to celebritize yourself and then bring out an audience that's really committed to seeing your growth you can you can do it in reverse and so i think the kardashians shark tank and like elon musk's style of communication really uh resonated with jake and that's what he came like me and my wife are super introverted she's the third partner um and for everybody that's listening we make we make functional chocolate bars because we even touch on that but we manufacture them as well too um you own a factory did you like create a creative oh wow so you really own it it's fully vertically integrated got it yeah you can visit anytime you're in montreal like it's crazy that experience i'd love to even speak a little bit on on why i think manufacturing's so critical for the for the next steps of having success in brand um and there was a reason why we had to pursue it but that's a story of itself so the last piece to to the playbook was hey why is it that you know skims was able to come and really come after sarah blakely's spanx in a very very fast period of time and i think that's really because it's driven from a narrative people like to buy into stories and then the stories lead to the product but if you have that brand narrative sorry if you have a personal narrative you can convey it into a product line and so uh jake's idea was how do we create a product line that is about being in your face and bold kind of giving people permission to be themselves unapologetically and that led to this brainstorm which was like what if we conduct ourselves like a band hence sahil the picture you got before right you can you can really orchestrate how you show up in the world it's very it's very possible and uh musicians and and artists have been doing that forever and so we started conducting ourselves like a band everything the way we brand it talk about the product the way we do photo shoots like why do we do photo shoots every month just because right just because that's content to put on the gram to bring to life to show you in a light that seems larger than life that's what musicians do all the time um and and at the same time tell the story of entrepreneurship on the rise and that was like shark tank's numbers they were the num they were so high in the rating shark tank it didn't even make sense when i was seeing the data on that they were like the number one show by miles and so it was like so obvious that people wanted to watch this and we kind of just put together a mini reality television show on instagram um started really small started manufacturing in our condo and built that narrative and story and still have it today like we're trying to build super fans so get into the manufacturing piece of this because my perspective or my assumption rather generally is like when people think about creating a cpg brand they're like holy [ __ ] i don't want to touch manufacturing because that's where they go wrong yeah well and i want to get into why you think that because i think that's an interesting contrarian insight because like my instinct with when most people start one is like okay let me do this in the lightest touch way possible i'll pay a contract manufacturer um you know i'll hire an agency to handle all the ads i'll do like everything and it just your margin just keeps coming down and down in the quality because you're outsourcing to a contract manufacturer is just harder to control i imagine too and you can't iterate as quickly on things test learn etc so i'm curious for you just like what was the insight there how did you actually do it and act on creating that manufacturing side yeah so the i you know they tell you the more swings you have at entrepreneurship the better you're going to get like that is so true i've failed at so many different things and trying to bring them forward and i kind of have developed this like list of things not to do and one of the main things was to avoid china at all costs when creating products so that was uh the reason why is like i think early on you need to be able to have a competitive edge when it comes to uniqueness of a product and manufacturing if you play in that area of where things can be copied really quickly you're going to be you're going to be commoditized pretty quickly is is an insight i have on that end um and then two is i love massive markets massive massive markets that are saturated um because those are such proof points that a pond full of fish exists right so you have a [ __ ] pond full of ridiculous fish and so here's where the contrarian play comes in is the problem with saturation is that by definition saturation is an uninnovated market and to bring true innovation to market you you almost are never going to be able to show up to a co-manufacturer and have that happen regardless of what you're building so for us we went to go see 26 different co-manufacturers and again i want you to know it wasn't like there was some grand plan to go become a manufacturer it was in the event we could find a contract manufacturer we wanted to use it we absolutely wanted to use it problem is is that nobody wanted to make what we wanted to make and this is where i think especially in food food entrepreneurs go wrong because you show up to the contract manufacturer and they will take your product and turn it into the thing that already exists on the shelf and here's why and i know that because we're a manufacturer now it's if i'm running a manufacturing line and i want to have as little turnover as possible and you want to use an ingredient that i'm not storing in my warehouse okay what is my incentive for you to use that ingredient so i'm going to come to you i'm going to say hey we can do this at the minimum order quantities you want but you can't use cocoa butter you need to use palm kernel oil by the way you know how you want your chocolate to be one and a half inches can't be so we're gonna have to do it in robe chocolate you know you want it to be square it's got to be circular edges i mean we could go here forever and it's like so you leave that thing and now you have a product that looks like everything else on the market and guess what a manufacturer that knows how to make your secret sauce who the [ __ ] wants to give away their secret sauce like i you know in software you show up i want to take you guys through this okay just because i want you to laugh with me this is how whack it is i i don't think it doesn't hit a lot of people until i say it this way so imagine you show up into an investor's office and you're like all right guys i got the greatest [ __ ] idea everybody at the table is like okay we're ready for you we're gonna build the next google okay you have my ears what are you gonna do that's different than google you give your pitch yada yada yada all right who's your cto who's the team that's going to be building this guess what here it is asset lite we're exporting everything to an agency the agency is going to build google from scratch we're just going to sit here tell them what to do they're going to ship us the uh code when it's i mean you're gonna get laughed out of the room your core competency is being outsourced to another company like what the [ __ ] has happened and i know how it's happened having been here now it's because pepsi and coca-cola [ __ ] everything up back in the 80s and we're like hey we've created these big conglomerates we want to divest all of our asset heavy um you know manufacturing plants we're going to go on franchise models we're going to create cash for shareholders and they created this false ideology of this co-manufacturing being the holy grail to asset asset like cpg businesses and and i just don't think that's the way to build the next nike you might be able to build a company in five years and flip it to kellogg's or um you know nestle but you ain't building the next nike with uh co-men's yeah i mean i think so you hit on like 100 fascinating ideas here so i want to go run back through us through some of these to double down on them um shut the [ __ ] up no no there's too much gold in there man it's like too many cool ideas so so first off one of the things you said at the very outset there that i thought was great was like when you see a pond and there's a whole shitload of you know fishing boats in one area that's probably a good indication that there's a lot of fish in that area and actually that you might want to go there and so like that's really again contrarian advice because usually people like go fish where there isn't anybody but but if you go fish where there isn't anybody there might not be any fish there and that's why there isn't anyone sitting there um so i i mean i just i love that idea and it all kind of goes to um like a common thread in what you're saying which is like this this whole concept of playing different games which is something that i think about a lot it's like what what game do you want to be playing and how do you figure out a different way to play it that just doesn't doesn't look the same as the way everyone else is assuming you should and so you know you talk about like manufacturing as an example and as a use case of that i have this friend who you might have come across actually in the consumer world his name is chaz flexman uh yeah i started this business called all day flavors um and it's like alldayflavors.com it's actually my go-to like spices for i'm not an investor i have no affiliation um for what it's worth but it's amazing like low sodium spices basically but they've done something similar which is like rather than just taking the same approach of going to like random contract manufacturers and making the product that that company knows how to make that are optimizing that contract manufacturers margins or whatever they're like line utilization which is all they care about they've taken this like data first approach to producing cpg products where they're like doing small small test runs focus groups getting initial data where they have a high degree of certainty when they launch a new product that it is going to pop because they have the data and the insights from the get-go and they're able to iterate quickly change et cetera and the spices are amazing and like they haven't had a flop of a product because they're taking this very different approach to doing it um so i just like that was just really hitting in my mind as you were talking through all of that around the manufacturer and just like doing something differently taking a different approach to something that is very commonly done and then also unders i think the biggest part that people forget is to look at the world through the lens of playing a game you said that perfectly actually sale it's like the faster you figure out the game you're playing the more you can find areas of exploitation and it exists because unlike a board game real life is full of um full of conundrums full of false positives full of double-sided swords like nobody's thought about everything perfectly in our societal structure and business structure so these pockets present themselves so for instance there's this pocket that in cpg if you own a manufacturing plant the probability of you finding another competitor willing to put chips on the table under i know because i have some two really big buyers of companies at big cpg i won't name their names that that are in m a they won't even look at reproducing a manufacturing line internally unless they have proof points of 300 million dollars of year of revenue so like like right there i'm we're we're you know we're just trying to get to 20 this year we know that these guys are they won't even entertain the idea of making a midday squares manufacturing plant then you go into the internal uh smaller co-manufacturer i know when we were going through it people were willing to listen to how we would want to make it and they would say to us hey are you in billing are you willing to invest 3 million in our plan and your minimum water quantity has to be a million dollars so there's these pockets and that's why it's like four years now that midday squares has yet to see a competitor on the shelves i think it's coming eventually but it it creates a ridiculous moat because yeah it's a real mode in internal politics of where people just don't want to [ __ ] with investing that type of money yeah it's the narrative too right like the narrative around manufacturing is like oh [ __ ] sounds like a lot of headaches and i got to deal with this and that and i don't understand i got to hire people to deal with it and it's like it's this whole narrative that you build in your mind but sahil that's when i get i get excited when that gets presented to me that's actually my driving force in life that's part of my algorithm for decision making is is this something that most people say is a bad idea i saw this on your um so first off that's like a keith roboy thing that i've seen him say a lot is like his um barometer for uh his investing as a vc is like do half of my vc friends laugh at the investment that i'm making um i've always loved that like i thought it was just a good idea in terms of as an entrepreneur as an investor etc but i read this when i was doing my research for this episode and one of your like it was a blog post you were interviewed in where you said something like going after hard concepts is actually an easier way to succeed um and i thought that was really really well said i've had inheritedly the easiest time fundraising with this business my enjoyment level every day has been so much happier because it's attracting talents easier when you're going after really hard things raising money is easier when you're going after really hard things um it just makes everything so much easier it's like this epiphany i had it's like from now on going forward whether midday squares is successful or not everything i will touch must be in this realm of hardness complexity and magnitude because it has made my life 10x easier than the the the nickel and diming of that i used to do and when i talk about nickel and diming i'm going after businesses that could hit you know only 20 30 million a year of revenue i will say the one one piece you are missing um is i think authenticity because when i look at midday squares i see like it's not it's not just that you're doing hard things you're doing hard and authentic things to you jake and leslie the co-founders so for example like you know i saw a video of jake um who's this like highly energetic guy basically pumping up like i think it was like an air canada or some like company doing like dancing to the ymca and you just see him like going completely like bonkers and and if you know jake that's jake and if you know leslie that's leslie if you know nick that's that's nick so i think it's a good framework um to start thinking about is like do hard and do authentic yeah and and do so authentic is the most important for life in general because you don't have to show up ever thinking about being a different person like being authentic allows you to to free headspace to not have to worry about anything but how that relates to making more money is really simple is that in your authentic state you have an intuition that nobody else has like period and when you are in that creative intuitive state that is so 100 you it's like i can almost guarantee that you will find success now here's the kicker very few people reach that level of intuitive self truth and that's what i'm out there pitching which is you know go deep figure out what that thing is that makes you you and then triple quadruple down on that and that's it today's episode is brought to you by element a tasty electrolyte drink mix with everything you need and nothing

fundrise.com room again that's f u n d r i s e dot com slash room to get started today you also hit on this idea of like kind of complexity and like i always think of the um i think it's charlie songhurst the famous investor has this matrix that he draws of uh like complex on one vector and boringness like or sexiness on the other one and he talks about the fact that you want to be building businesses that are in this in the quadrant that is like complex and boring because complex and sexy you know that's like spacex or something and there's so much competition when you're building complex sexy things that everyone wants to build and so like when you talk about manufacturing i'm like holy [ __ ] that's boring you know that's like the boring stuff and it's super complicated to do and so you're building in this rarefied air where people don't want to be building there because it's not sexy and it is complicated and so now all of a sudden what's your competition look like you're building in a big space with less competition to your point five years people haven't been replicating it or doing it because it sits in that in that sector oh man oh man that is like it's it's number one in finding pockets of uh exploit what i will say is greg asked me to come up with some ideas for the show today and i thought about it and i have ideas but i i i i want to leave for sure an anecdote on this podcast which is i've gone after things just for money and have made money doing them and i know in for sure with 100 truth that the success lies in the thing that you want to do no matter what and usually if you do something for instance there's a huge keyword spread right now on hrefs right for plumbers local plumbers there's a huge opportunity to build a monster aggregator for plumbing the plumbing industry it's so clear how to make money in that industry would i do it tomorrow no even if i see it because i when the going gets tough in a business which it ultimately always will you want to quit and this is the first time ever because i'm excited about what we're doing i love chocolate i think literally in my graduation when i was in grade six i said char um a willy wonka in the charlie factory was my dream to to be one day i never want to quit i'm addicted to it and so you i don't ever discount that part and sometimes when you're doing unsexy things like for midday squares as unsexy it is in manufacturing is very sexy from a brand standpoint like people love wanting to build brands people love what comes with that aspect and i have and i'm um and i'm i i could tell you i've been chasing this since i'm 17. i've wanted to build nike since i'm 17 and i veered away from that for many years and now that i'm back i realize why i'm addicted to it and why did you veer away is it because you were chasing the chasing the money yeah i was chasing the money there was there's a million easier ways to make money than to build a brand it's it's i there really is i i don't care what anybody says like you know if you if you're trying to become a millionaire building a brand is not the fastest way to do it if if anything it's actually the least probabilistic way to do it the truth is yeah the truth is it's it's enormously difficult to build a brand and it's enormously difficult to build a startup like if you want to make a lot of money you know honestly just go work at facebook and google and get some stock and you'll probably make a lot of money like people who go into startups especially like cpg um or even hard things like consumer social like don't it's just not your odds are so low like you need to go in because like you want to make you know 16 year old nick proud basically yeah it's it's like iron man no i'm actually really i'm really open to sharing the why the why is i like doing things that and i know so even greg you both feel this way one i'm an ex-athlete greg we've been doing this since we're young i like knowing that i'm doing something that a very small percentage of the world is capable of doing that's that's what that's what that's what drives me it's it's my competitive force against myself i always have when i was playing hockey it wasn't about what was going on around i was like okay how far up the stats could i get myself how good of a goalie could i become and it's the same thing here is i love the idea that i don't know five two people in a hundred years three people in a hundred years get to make nike i don't know if we'll do it but that's the dream and that's why you know i if you hear me talk about this all the time is i'm always like we're doing this for 25 35 years again everybody i meet trying to build businesses for five years and flipping it do you think that we would have ever built a manufacturing plant if we had a five year business plan absolutely not you could not make the returns work and so again like a competitive advantage people think competitive advantage comes down to intelligence all the time how much experience you have in something sometimes it's as simple as saying hey i'm not going to play the game that the world wants to play i don't want to do this for just five years 30 years you're gonna you're gonna interact with your decision making like on a whole different level i saw a great tweet about that um exact point that you just made on like exp people think that experience and intelligence is um is like the most important thing around this um i think it was jack altman you know jack um greg he's the founder of lattice i think his brother is sam altman the one of the yc guys um jack tweeted one of the most surprising things in business is the degree to which an inexperienced person with the right mindset will outperform a highly experienced person without it um i thought that was so well said i was like the whole thing of experience is just like i just think it's overrated so overrated what it what it what it's not overrated on is um giving you the lay of the land that's it after that get get the [ __ ] out of the way like when it comes to experienced people they actually do more damage in their square-ness even like myself i will be that person when i'm 70 going back to a 20 year old i will be more destructive than i am positive to that person because i will have created all these false stop and goes when why or zed roads present itself simply because of timing luck my own skill sets right but what they are really good at is if we give the analogy of a formula one track they can tell you on turn two there's gonna be a pothole avoid that at all like they're really good at that and then after you've just you've distilled that like get them the [ __ ] out of the way they've gone through the um the idea maze like they've kind of been through it at least in some form in some way shape or form i do think that like sometimes you know those people have this like flawed map of the reality because it doesn't apply anymore and so they're like hey you're going to screw this up you know nick your manufacturing is going to be broken because of this this or this and like that was 10 years ago and things have fundamentally changed and there's some reason or new insight that you know they don't understand or fully fully appreciate but i agree with you i mean far from it like i i have i have an incredible board okay and i've spoken about this so i'm not throwing them under the bus at all this is really just a good example of it we were going through we just transitioned the whole business from a two square business to a one square business we needed to make these decision quick costs were rising we wanted to do a price increase we had data from the customer that they want to buy one square at a time not two squares so we said you know what let's do a one dollar price increase but to offset the feeling to the customer we're going to drop it to one square so now instead of selling two squares of 399 we're selling one square 249 okay that's the premise of it we presented to the board saying we're rolling this thing out and then everybody's like whoa whoa whoa like could we do a test market first and this i'm just looking at everybody i'm like what do you think this is [ __ ] l'oreal test market we we're barely surviving the water's filling up every day we have two people in qa we could barely scan the boxes in we could barely manage three flavors now you want me to manage three flavors and two skews which create which creates six different skew possibilities it's like no we have a gut feeling we're rolling with it this is where it's at and i get in ten years when we're a different company that we can be more calculated in our approach but sometimes you're just too far from it and you forget what it's like to be on the uh the army lines first of all i love that you're just like absolutely like absolutely not like i feel like a lot of i know a lot of founders who have conversations like this with their board and it's easy to you know it's your board and ultimately you're the ceo and you kind of work for the board um it's easy to be like all right fine let's go test it and sort of delay it but you know it was or was that hard was it hard to to speak to the board and basically be like i'm sorry we're go this is the direction we're going no and this is a piece that i think a lot of investors are going to hate me for saying on on this podcast is just i i m our board trusts us okay so that's one that's one piece i want to make sure that that nobody gets false representation of of what i'm saying what i'm about to say what i'm about to say is that you have to earn trust in life and how you earn trust is by delivering that being said founders need to start taking back not control but conviction that we are the people that are on the front lines doing the stuff we are the scarce ones monies of abundance investors are of abundance boards are of abundance that is not to be saying that you should show up like an arrogant prick because i think if you called my my my board they would say you know what he's he's reasonable he's very reasonable in the conversations but at the end of the day you get paid to make the convicted shots and you have to can you have to show up with that confidence to to lead you're leading them through war not them leading you through war and that's the piece we gotta flip because there's a huge there's this huge idea of like founders are just glorified employees and that is the furthest thing from the truth what's a really big decision that you made or you and and you know your co-founders made at midday squares where you it was a gut decision and you went with it um but deep down you're like oh my god i don't know if this is actually gonna work because i'm sure there's you know i'm sure you have some of those could i tell you honestly it's happening right now it is the one square decision and here's why i'm going to explain to you why i don't even have the answer yet we're actually right now in this part of the movie where the plane goes off the radar and nobody knows if it blew up or not and that's kind of where we are right now so here's why this was such a big deal if every customer right we were we were on fire in the u.s we beat perfect bar in the last 24 weeks as the number one bar in the u.s okay so that's like do not [ __ ] with anything right like don't [ __ ] with anything now the board was like guys if we're selling two squares for every customer and we now bring it down to one square package what's to say that every customer is going to continue to buy two squares we might actually go cut our revenue in half that is a factual statement and this is where gut overrode it it was i hear you loud and clear but if you just read the requests from the customers they want one square so badly at a fair price and there was no data in the world that could have made this presentation look like this was the right decision to make other than anecdotal evidence and so our bet is that no matter how much carnage it reeks on the p l that in the long term we will actually end up selling more squares per customer and we think that because now we're giving the customers what we want and that's what we have 100 conviction on is that they want the one square so even though it might hurt the company financially in the short term uh we we bet the farm on it in the long term and and and and that's where you know in september if we were wrong on this we put ourselves into a position of where we can potentially smash into a wall and have to raise uh you know way earlier than expected with revenues not hitting where they need to hit potentially creating a down round scenario if that all does come to fruition and that's where like that's where i love thinking about entrepreneurship like being a formula one driver sometimes you can't think you just have to act and um and what will be will be you know you live and die by the decisions you make and so we made a really we we made a really hard gut decision on this one there was no data to suggest that we should have done this i love that because it's just an example of a bold decision that you just you had to make and it's also the benefit of being a private company right like a public company the reason i think most public companies end up stalling out at some point you know in the long run and getting you know chipped away at by uh by innovators and by um you know new entrants to a market is for this reason right like a public company can't make that decision um because it's just like oh my god we can't shoot the golden goose like we can't give up revenue in order to go after the thing that might be correct in the long term because we have quarterly earnings reports and we have to read them out to investors and we told analysts what we were going to hit and we have to hit that or we have to be in the band whatever and so i mean it's also it applies to like when you think about the public companies that have really thrived like in the tech world especially the ones that have the founders still leading them still make those bold decisions because they aren't just some like executor that's come in to like operate for their 10-year stewardship and then move on and retire with their 30 million pay package they still care about it like it's their baby and so like you know and evan spiegel at snapchat or mark zuckerberg at facebook you know criticize them as much as you want but they're still making decisions as though it is their baby and it is they care about it so much over the long term because it's so much of their legacy is tied to it why i'm so bullish on so uh two other contrarian things well actually just one on that end but is we fundraise at lower valuations every single round to control the board and have uh complete voting control so we've taken 10 50 million dollar cuts from the valuation in order to have those provisions in the term sheets this is stuff that people need to continue to do now why am i so bullish on control and board people always ask this question is like why are you an egomaniac or no it goes back to your answer in software all of the top companies i think people just got excited by software yes they're great business models but in cpg there's not one founder-led top 10 company in the publicly traded ranks it's all like you know the guy who founded hershey's was a g back in the day that guy is dead now and it's you know like what happens when a founding team in cpg goes the distance doesn't sell the company retains ridiculous voting control at like the super voting rights of the zuckerbergs and is able to continue to make crazy bold decisions while bringing in a billion dollars of revenue what does that world look like that's what i think we're excited about and why we fight so hard for control i mean fight [ __ ] tooth and nail in the negotiations for that it's the classic uh name your price and i'll give you the terms something like right the the saying it's not about the price that you get um it's about the terms that are often way more important and that's actually how we start the fundraisers so what a trick that i've learned that i really like is we create the term sheet and i think other founders could use this too so you you go out you pay you pay a law firm to create an outline term sheet so you get you get rid of all the people that are going to waste your time and you show up and you're like here is the framework of the term sheet you no price just the framework of the voting control and all that if you are willing to do this deal you name your price knowing these provisions if not walk now and you could still bring your own term sheet i'm not saying you have to use our term sheet this is the outline so this way in 24 hours you scare away all the players that don't want to play nick you're on this podcast right now because literally no one talks like you at all in silicon valley or whatever like not only are you saying things that no one i know is doing you're telling other people about it in a public saying you're not afraid to tell and and that's why you're here like that's why i love you um and i love that about you is because you're not afraid to do your own thing and just kind of hey this is how other people are doing it this is how i think it's is reasonable let's go but because it comes down to my when my dad died my dad's out of ten my family really all mourned it separately so we all became alone for a very long period of time you know we were in a house together and i think that period of time of my life has really it really shaped me to to to having first principles thinking and unique thoughts and and because i was just so alone for so long even though i was amongst people that you start to really lean in and trust yourself when you are trying to figure out death it it creates this really amazing energy in you to have to figure out life fast quick who you are how you're going to react to it and that's why like i always say like the best thing that ever happened to me is my dad my dad passed away and i don't mean that and i wish that he passed away is that it really just shaped everything for me because it taught me to be a unique thinker because there was nobody to mourn with and the more i leaned into myself the more happy i was getting and that kind of translated into life outside of the morning uh part and then i just started to realize wow you know you i this is going to sound bleak but i don't mean it in this way you're born alone and you die alone and conduct yourself accordingly doesn't mean you're going to have a great journey on the planet but but really think for yourself so in our last couple minutes i just have like a prompt for you kind of i guess like pretty pretty open-ended prompt like say you were dropped um into a you know new place you have nothing on you you got you know no money um no connections you don't have your network any of that stuff um what would you do how would you because you strike me as the type of person that would figure out a way like i would go check on you in 10 years and you'd somehow be successful and have figured something out and you would have made friends and done stuff like what would be your moves like what would you go do if you were dropped into a new place and needed to you know needed to find your way i would i would really do do i get do i get to bring the skill sets that i have where am i of course no no no no you get all your skill sets all your knowledge in your brain whatever you guys and you know you have your baseline level of like you don't need to be stealing food at the outset to survive yeah i would find baseline family businesses um and go become the right hand person to the right person because that is a launch pad that like i mean putting yourself secondary to someone is always the best way how did i make my network in montreal it was uh i was at like this like thing where i had john biggs who was the editor of techcrunch and we were just eating dinner and i just was like a servant to him it was not about me and uh you know two months after that he hits me up he's like you want to host techcrunch in montreal and then i made somebody else the face of it lp maurice not me i just got to put my name with it and was a steward to him and he got to put his name on that and that changed my whole life just that one just that one little thing right is is be a steward to others and and uh it it's it's the hack so i i say it all the time you have no idea how many people come through midday squares and piss away their opportunity to be the right hand person to the next nike like they can't see it right and i'm always like why would that person want me to have a negative opinion of them like if they were smart and they were to make a bet even if it's unlikely but if we do succeed in our vision it's going to be pretty big wouldn't you want me to have a good opinion of you and these are the things that i think about it myself so i would i would be a steward uh to somebody that needs to and make sure that i i make them a boatload of cash or a boatload of notoriety or a boatload of fame and whatever the hell it is and my life would work out it's like the era of apprenticeship is not dead and if you can find a way to go be someone's apprentice and hustle your ass off to do it well and to learn and be a sponge when you're around that person and go improve upon it like that's kind of an old-fashioned way of making sure that you succeed and win in the long run oh my it's it's that i think that is the thing that will never change you know bezos always talks about what are the things that are never going to change that's one of them like being a steward to somebody will never change that's one of my favorite frameworks by the way the uh you know what will stay the same framework it's like bezos talked about how um you know for anyone that doesn't know this one like he talks about how it's really hard to predict the future like it's so hard so uncertain and so if you're trying to say like what's going to be different 15 years and let me try to plan around that to position us well it's really really hard to do sometimes people do it well but it's very difficult versus the flip side if you invert the problem and think about what's going to be the same in 15 years what do i know is not going to change and let me make sure i'm building for that so it's like customers are going to want things fast and they're going to want things seamlessly and check out easily like that is never going to change people always want less friction and so how do i build around less friction that's why we chose chocolate i mean 142 billion traded globally every country knows what chocolate is nobody requires education for it if i give you a piece of chocolate in a country where we don't speak the same language you will immediately know what i'm doing i'm showing you gratitude i'm giving you a little piece of good vibes um these frameworks are so powerful so that doesn't mean that they're going to be easy once you do them but that what is not going to change is a great place to start 100 100 greg any um any closing thoughts here as we uh as we hit the end of our time i feel like we hit on so much interesting stuff here how much nick how much are you sleeping like would you say you sleep a lot a little and i ask because a lot i ask cause especially with this bit this change from two squares to one square it must be like in your brain right now and uh yeah just curious your sleep habits and and how you're feeling just i'm you know mentally right now mentally i need always a week every so okay i'm plugging the podcast midday square's uncensored guys come come listen to it because it's jake les and i we talk about our journey and what we're going through so it's not it's not an interview show it's really about us like you get to be a fly on the wall as we just distill what we're going through um that's why that that brought it up but right now i'm a bit beat up but i've went all in with my life on this and so i really don't have much of a personal life and i mean that greg like i haven't seen any of my friends in three years um my family knows that i'm going to be very unpresent les and i who are married this is all we do and so the reason why i'm sleeping well is because i've eliminated everything from my life except midday squares um and so when i get home it's just home sleep back at it and every three months i need one full week off to sleep and that's how because because it's it's so hard manufacturing we just to give you guys uh a scope of the scale august 2018 we had max capacity per day of 60 000 bars and today we produced 46 000 bars a day uh fully automated and we're looking to double that and that that that i've had a teammate die on us at a company retreat i've had mold in the walls while investors were visiting i've i mean it's just been one thing after another there's no reason why we should still be alive and i attribute sleep to a big part of the success is that i'm sleeping really really well which allows me to be decently emotionally stable to deal with you know the onsets of depression that come on while you're going through it um which is you know something i've struggled with my whole life i mean we can get into that another time but yes it's been crazy hard but i prioritize sleep like crazy that's but again 30 year old nick versus 20 year old nick prioritize sleep i love it you uh you i feel like you opened my eyes to a bunch of new stuff here i'm gonna need to do like uh greg we're gonna need to do like a debrief um and uh and takeaways and stuff as like a follow-up post script to this when we uh when we released the episode because there was so much gold in it that um that i feel like i'm gonna need to go back and re-listen to it again to uh to uncover all of it so thank you nick for uh for taking the time to join us man this was awesome uh where can people find you uh and and your uh and your business yeah so um instagram midday squares um nick salto on twitter i love just you know

and someone i met on lunch club basically said you know all the stuff you do in your free time like meeting people and writing online and stuff like you would get paid to do that if you were in venture and his advice to me was to get on twitter he basically said like you pick an industry and you follow people all the smartest people in that given industry and then very quickly you get like an iv into the brain of like what the smartest people are reading writing who they hang out with how they spend their free time um and all all of this kind of stuff and then you get a really good bird's eye view of like what the ecosystem looks like and very shortly after getting on twitter is how i got my first job in venture [Music] gabby thank you so much for taking the time we're stoked to stoked to have you here it's super casual format um you know you might have heard some of them in the past it's like the furthest thing from an interview we're just gonna kind of i you know i sent over some topics obviously and some stuff that we want to jam through but basically just like open format talk about anything that you know you we etc find interesting um feel free to call call us idiots push back on things etc more than open to uh to being told we're wrong on on any and everything but have been have been really excited to have a chance to to have you on and to have this discussion for for a while now so i'm glad we're finally getting to do it yeah i'm excited i'm a long time listener long time listener first time caller yeah and you're a you're a fellow stanford grad so i'm uh i'm already like positively inclined towards you as a result of that um but uh can we just actually start with like very quickly um how you wound your way into or found your way rather into the um into the web three worlds like what had you kind of gone down the rabbit hole in college and then you know it was the natural place for you to jump into now you're obviously you know an investor at tcg you know the turning group at an amazing investment shop and doing a lot as a as a thought leader in the space on twitter and everywhere else but would love to just understand like what your kind of like uh idea maze or like your path into this all was yeah so how old are you i'm 22 for one more week okay oh there we go happy birthday well by the time this is released it'll you'll be 23 probably then okay amazing it's my birthday present i have i have like a a short answer and a long answer so the short answer is through college and basically during copit all of my smartest friends were quitting their jobs to work in crypto and that was kind of the diligence i needed to go down the rabbit hole myself and figure out what was going on the long answer and then i can kind of get to the shorter one is i actually grew up selectively mute which is like not many people know what it is and it's also interesting because i can't shut up now but basically when i was a kid for like five years i didn't say anything it's sort of like a manifestation of anxiety or something like that i actually have like how old like five to nine basically um and i don't have a ton of memory of like why it happened or what was going on but the collateral which is important to know and it's why i bring it up is because of that i spent a ton of my time online so i think i was kind of like early to the internet like spending a lot of time on runescape and minecraft and club penguin i had a tumblr blog i was actually talking to someone right before this and like was looking at the hits on my blog people are like still looking at it i think which is crazy and then i had like a music blog where i was writing about music and generally like from early on was always finding community in digital spaces because i think i couldn't find it otherwise so then when i got to stanford i studied symbolic systems which you know sawhill it sounds really cool it's actually like one of the most popular majors so it's not that interesting but it's kind of a combination of computer science philosophy linguistics and psychology and i was concentrating in human computer interaction thinking about things like social computing like how do you grow and moderate computing social computing systems anywhere from like wikipedia to facebook i was working in the virtual reality lab doing stuff like that so it all feels super similar to what i'm working on now but at the time like still wasn't really down the rabbit hole um i first bought crypto in 2017 for something that i can't say on the podcast because i was still a kid but honestly didn't do the work to learn about it silk road yeah so i i like wasn't doing the work to actually learn about like what was going on from a technical perspective it was purely financial so then when it crashed i like quite literally sold it all so it wasn't until early 2021 that i actually fell into the space by that time i was working at bessemer venture partners doing early stage consumer investing and so basically like looking across consumer social consumer marketplaces a bunch of creator tools like the creator economy was alive and well and i was looking at all these companies like the cameos and the kickstarters and the patreons of the world etc that basically all allowed us to build and operate and fund the products and services and people that we engage with every day but we didn't have any way to collectively own them and so i kind of felt a disconnect that way that paired with hanging out at the bright moments gallery in la when they had first launched and hanging out with a bunch of cool friends in crypto who i had met there um did kind of some soul searching and did some digging for a couple months and then i knew it was kind of time to dive in if i wanted to really catch up i had to do it full time did you know that one of the top reasons startups fail is bad hiring decisions people can be unpredictable and developers can be unpredictable as well let lemon.io take care of hiring your software engineers why lemon.io they test and interview every single specialist before offering them to clients unlike many other sites offering remote software developers lemon.io is sure they offer you experienced and verified devs it's like hiring someone after your best friend's recommendation but even better why because even the best friend can't offer you a replacement of the candidate in 48 hours or less if something goes wrong but lemon.io can you'll be working with hand-picked software engineers from europe they'll be a part of your team lemon.io staff never intrudes on your communications unless you ask them to minimum bureaucracy maximum efficiency that's a win-win combination for developers and clients so hire high quality verified vetted engineers from europe with lemon.io and be stronger than 90 of startups on the market go to lemon.io room and get 15 off for the first four weeks get there before your competitors will check out lemon.io today today's episode is brought to you by element a tasty electrolyte drink mix with everything you need and nothing you don't that means lots of salt with no sugar it contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio 1000 mg sodium 200 milligrams potassium and 60 milligrams of magnesium but none of the junk no sugar no coloring no artificial ingredients no gluten no fillers no bs i absolutely love it and how it's fit into my lifestyle whether you're keto low carb paleo or just want to feel better and more active element is the drink for you i drink it after an intense workout to replenish my electrolytes i also drink it after a few too many whiskeys late at night it totally helps with the hangovers when you sweat the primary electrolyte lost is sodium athletes can lose up to seven grams per day when sodium is not replaced it's common to experience muscle cramps and fatigue the same goes for after a big night out drinking element will fit into your lifestyle no matter who you are right now element is offering my listeners a free sample pack with any order that's eight single serving packets free with any element order it's a great way to try all eight flavors or share element with a salty friend get yours at drinkelement.com happens this deal is only available through my link you must go to d-r-i-n-k-l-m-n-t dot com slash happens to take advantage of this special offer try element you won't regret it so you hit on both in the short version and the long version a few really interesting things that i want to double down on one was just like this idea of following your smart friends i've written about this in the past like i think it was chris dixon first talked about it the weekend test um like figure out what are the weekend projects of your smartest friends and the smartest people in your circles because those are likely to be the things that everyone does in 10 years and i feel that with crypto like it was just i don't know in like 14 and 15 some of my smartest friends were starting to toy around with this stuff like when i was at stanford or just after stanford um and then you know during the bear markets like after the crashes a lot of my smart friends were starting to think about like and still working on projects in the space and so if i had been smart which i'm not i'm an idiot um i didn't go down to rapidol as much as i should have and it was actually when i finally said and convinced myself like after this most recent bull run i was like i'm never letting one of those opportunities pass me again where all of my smart friends are doing something or thinking about something and i'm somehow ignoring it and so now my new rule of thumb for what it's worth is if i have three smart friends tell me something i automatically make a bet on it even if it's like a small bet i just have a stock amount that i'll put into it so that i have some skin in the game that i can then go and like double down on if i want to learn more about it the other one on top of it is just like invest in your friends and i kind of got burned by not doing that multiple times this year smart friends either starting companies but kind of more specifically because i saw the turnaround of like my inaction starting nft projects like kind of during the bull run i wasn't sure how seriously i should take them but knowing my friends and how hard they work and how thoughtful they are some of the coolest projects and now i'm like shilling them on my twitter and i have no bags in them and i can't afford them anymore um so i totally agree yeah that the one guy yeah the one thing i want to add to that is you know a lot of people [Music] how do i say this a lot of people don't have smart friends um or don't have friends who are starting companies and stuff like that we you know we were talking about that um with julian smith um yesterday sahel i think the pod will be out by the time we we publish this which is um yeah it's just it's not uncommon that if you're not from a major city you don't you don't have that and i think the the way to sort of counterbalance that is you don't even need to have friends like your your friends quote-unquote could be like people that you follow on twitter podcasts you listen to which is what i love about the world we live in 2022 which is you know these are your like personal and i have talked about like your personal board of advisors like you don't need to be friends with sahil and i you know if you think we're smart and you can just like think about what would sahil do like what would you know what's a framework he would do to to to approach this problem this is also like sorry it's also like how i got into venture i was working abroad right before covid i just like candidly didn't know what i wanted to do with my life i was working at an hr sas startup in israel i just like wanted to learn the language i wanted to live on my own there um and i was using lunch club like that app to meet up with people who are like working in tech in your area and someone i met on lunch club basically said you know all the stuff you do in your free time like meeting people and writing online and stuff like you would get paid to do that if you were in venture and his advice to me was to get on twitter he basically said like you pick an industry and you follow people of all the smartest people in that given industry and then very quickly you get like an iv into the brain of like what the smartest people are reading writing who they hang out with how they spend their free time um and all all of this kind of stuff and then you get a really good bird's eye view of like what the ecosystem looks like and very shortly after getting on twitter is how i got my first job in venture yeah i mean these opportunities have been um decentralized like you no longer need to have gone to stanford or be at stanford in order to have smart friends i mean you even said it from earlier in your life like when you were dealing with that you know the adversity of um of what you mentioned when you were a kid you sought out online communities and that was like before the boom in online communities too that was like the early days of it but today i mean with the proliferation of the internet and cheap and free internet um a kid you know born on the streets in india has the opportunity to do that and participate in those communities and be in discords and learning and being around those quote unquote smart friends um you know in a pretty similar way and so there is like a an evening of the opportunity playing field globally that is simply amazing i think that has happened over the last five or so years um and will likely just continue to accelerate at an exponential pace hopefully so um pretty exciting to uh to hear that and walk through it i do want to um i want to transition to just talking about some web 3 ideas and things that are happening in the space while we have you because um the timing of filming this is actually pretty phenomenal like i'm glad we didn't film it two months ago or whenever we first started chatting about it because a lot has happened um you know in the space over the last couple of months a huge crash uh you know being one of them we've all seen the news on it every media you know mainstream media companies like dunking on crypto as though it's all everything's a scam you know uh web 3 versus web 2 is like the new hot debate on twitter and people are like fighting and doing podcasts debating it um which is just like fun as a casual observer to to just kind of like enjoy the roasts in both directions but a lot's going on um and you know the reality is always that there are shades of gray nothing's ever black and white at least in my opinion and so i'd love to just like pick a few ideas within web3 um you know trends ideas concepts etc and just um you know have a have an open discussion around them if uh if that works yeah let's do it so can we start on work to earn i want to uh i want to talk about um i want to talk about step-n is it called step in or step step and i don't know how you how you step in okay step up right so for people who aren't aware of this and um i wasn't prior to i don't know maybe a week ago or so this is kind of part of this whole um and you guys by the way are much closer to this so please correct me if i say anything stupid um this is part of this whole trend um within web 3 called work to earn so um you know basic idea being you can like provide some service or do some work or something and earn as a result of that sounds kind of funny as like a concept because that's what we've always done like i've gone to work and earned money and so like that's that's a general idea that people should understand um but there have been several companies actually who have been extraordinarily successful in doing this like helium is probably the one that comes to mind for me that was an early player in this helium provides what is it like wi-fi connectivity effectively um in a decentralized way which is a really cool use case actually and when i think about about helium you know you could go in the early days of it buy a helium hotspot and basically you would pay some upfront um you know capital to invest in one of these hotspots you'd put it somewhere and people could leverage the um the wi-fi capacity you were creating with your hotspot in order to and pay you basically to use the the bandwidth you were creating and so yeah sorry to interrupt like the other super interesting thing there is like helium wasn't always like a token based or kind of like crypto based company like they had this vision of a decentralized wireless network and they were doing it for a while and then i think it was in 2017 they basically went bankrupt and i think it was an engineer at the company who said hey what if we used these cryptographic tokens to incentivize people to buy and run the hotspots and they tried it out and like that's how helium became what it is today that's really i agree it's like my favorite case study i didn't know that it's very cool and it's very cool because it's um it's an industry like utilities are a massively staid industry right it's like a monopoly and it's it's like a sanctioned monopoly at the national level where there's just a few companies that are allowed to do this and the capital intensity of starting a new one is too high so no one can do it and so doing it in a decentralized way sort of makes sense helium has been extraordinarily successful greg you and i talked about um anthony lewandowski the uh the auto guy who got pardoned by trump had um uh started pollen mobile which is another one that's doing mobile um that i think is doing quite well actually and it's the same thing as helium basically but they're doing mobile hotspots that you can you can buy so there's this like general um space that's been developing and growing i think those are some really cool use cases but now um incomes this company step in uh which is a a sub segment of work to earn uh called i don't know move to earn or walk to earn um and the basic idea i think is you buy like an nft of a sneaker um and that's kind of like your caught your ticket to ticket to ride like your entry cost and then uh you digitally you know using wearables etc track your movement and you get paid uh in the tokens of the game for moving like for walking and so people in the early days of it were literally like you'd go walk and you'd earn tokens and as more and more people started to pick up on this you know on this game or on this community um the cost of the nfts was going up uh the minting cost for kind of getting a sneaker was going up and the value of the tokens was going up because more and more people were participating in finding value in it and so it was kind of driving it up so the people that were in early made like pretty astronomical sums of money i think um by literally just walking and and participating in this so with that as a preface i want to talk about this both in a specific case and then in a more general case but would love your guys's um thoughts on on this because i have very strong thoughts on it i want to i want to put it out first before i dive into mine yeah i have um maybe i'll start off with like a general statement and then kind of explaining how the token economy works and then i'll talk about the good parts of it and then i'll i'll get into the good stuff if that sounds good that sounds great i think generally the financial gamification of stuff like fitness is super interesting and it's sort of like how a lot of people in web 3 beg for a better strava there are a lot of these companies that in web 2 have a really strong online community you know in strava's case there's like a fitness first ethos or like take soundcloud it has a music versus ethos quote unquote permissionless in the sense that anybody can post and create on the platform right like anybody can use strava and kind of like build their own social network there but then like the most important part is the monetization model of these web 2 products is pretty weak and so there's like a huge opportunity for disruption in web 3. um so generally i think it's really interesting and i was really interested in stefan when it first came out i should have used it i like have had the app for a while and i love to run and i just like never got around to like actually using it which maybe is a good thing i probably like who knows but anyway um kind of how how the apps economy actually works is it's based on two tokens gst and gmt so gst is this unlimited token that you use inside the game and then the gmt token is like the governance token which is capped and it's deflationary so in the app you can get both i'm pretty sure you get gst on day one just by like every minute of walking and depending on how fast you're walking or what sneakers you have you'll get gst and then gmt i think you don't unlock until you reach a higher level it's like level 30 or something like that and then you can spend your gst to like repair your sneakers and mint new sneakers and level up and stuff like that um i think because of how the token economy works it's been pretty interesting because like you said established players can make money but it's still accessible and like price friendly for newer players the other thing that i think is super smart that stefan did that i wish i saw in more web 3d apps especially in games is they have their own wallet like when you think about it think about all these web 3d apps that are actually pretty consumer friendly like let's say you love electronic music like you can go on to any of these web 3 music sites and see like digital native web 3 native artists who are putting out amazing music and then the first step to get involved is connect wallet oh i don't have a wallet like immediate churn right why would i use it but with step in it's like you get on it's like oh interesting here's a financial incentive for me to try it out you don't have a wallet make one right here and i think it's a huge reason why it did so well um and i think it like really deserves props for that but i guess now the question everyone's asking is like how long until the music stops right like yeah how is this not a ponzi scheme that's like my question so i mean like to cut to the chase the in-game economy is not sustainable as it is steppen has a lot of time to figure it out so i'll kind of explain why it doesn't work and by no means am i like a game economy expert so this is very high level um but also just kind of like sidebar it's really funny literally yesterday someone on my team texted our group chat a picture of a literal nyc subway ad for a step in competitor called step walk to earn same thing it's crazy so it's already coming out and like at the end of the day like whichever one is the best token model is where consumers are gonna go right but basically um and credit to amanda young she wrote this really amazing mirror piece about step in and the in-game economy and like this was really helpful for me to understand yeah basically when we think about virtual game economies there has to be a balance between the faucets and sinks so it's a balance between the rate at which assets are issued into the game and the rate at which assets are consumed so you have like stuff in equals stuff out right like you have to have a balance so the problem we're seeing with step in today is the current sinks are net inflationary so the current sinks on stefan today are like repairing your sneakers leveling them up and what it does is it leads to increasing or restoring the emission rate of gst and gmt um i also read another piece from nat elias in i don't know if he's come on the podcast but he should come on not yet he's great though he's like a step in maxie maxier like he was using it a ton but he basically brought up that stefan has this runaway sneaker breeding problem because there's no burn mechanism in place for getting rid of all of the excess sneakers like people are minting and minting and minting and so eventually they're all going to become worthless or you're going to have way too many people getting top level sneakers with the highest earnings which would result in the token price falling so you're kind of at this standstill now and even if you go into dune analytics and check out the step in dashboards you'll see the amount people are minting new sneakers has slowed down and people have been withdrawing from the game for a few weeks now i think because they realize that like the music might stop so what can they do i think what they can do like i have this framework for consumer that i actually created when i was mostly investing in web 2 but i think it carries over and it's four questions that i ask why do people come why do people share why do people stay and why do people pay um and two of the questions are kind of related here i think when it comes to web3 people can certainly come for a financial incentive right like looks rare is another good example um their airdrop tokens and now you're incentivized to go check it out because you have a stake in the business i made bank on that by the way oh really yeah we talked about that on the pod at one point that was like my last foray into like speculative web 3 stuff yeah i mean we'll see it's super interesting but so people can come for a financial incentive but if they're staying for a financial incentive um i think that's a problem people should be staying especially if it's a game they should be staying for the love of the game so step in can make the user experience better right they can make it more social they can make it feel less about money and maybe also figure out a way to bring external cash into the business which i think is something they're trying to do maybe bring on like partnerships like they have basic partnership bring on like local vendors stuff like that yeah that's uh so first off i love that framework why do people come why do people share why do people stay why do people pay just to reiterate it i think that's like an amazingly uh like beautiful crisp simple way to think about these things so thank you for sharing that because i think that's awesome and it's a great one for people to remember and take away from this my whole thing with these models and i we talked about it with jiho from axiomfinity when we had him on um and it was before they had kind of their crash in the token a little bit as well and the hack and all that stuff so i'd love to actually have him back on for more of a discussion but my challenge with all of these models is like there has to be utility net of the money you can make from these things in order for it to be um like creating value long term like i i look at it and i just say like where is the money from the money is from new people buying into it and you're paying out rewards from new people buying in that to me i'm like that's the definition of a ponzi scheme when i look at it i'm like you know i i come in and i'm getting paid from the rewards of new people coming in and so it's like a pyramid that you're just creating where new new people need to keep great like it needs to keep growing and so when you mention partnerships when i was thinking about it like how do you fix this problem and create a sustainable ecosystem um the two that i came to were like community value and partnerships and so partnerships i think is really interesting because they have sneakers right like how much would nike pay to have you be able to pay extra to get like a nike branded sneaker within this game if this becomes this amazing thriving community and all of a sudden i can like pay more to have i mean it's basically like what fortnite has with dope skins in the game right like how much would i pay to have dope you know nike shoes in this game where now i'm like it's a digital flex in the same way that people like to flex in fortnite with their cool skins so now do you have like it's not just money from new users coming in now i have a partnership where there's net new dollars coming into the system that can be used to you know invest in growth in it build out new functionality you know track different activities foster the community host live events like there's all sorts of new things then and i think that that net external money coming in and partnerships would allow you to kind of like build out real community value where now you have people that are deriving value from this not just from the money they're earning from it but also from the camaraderie and the feeling of connectivity to other people who are step in users which like that's a huge thing right i mean i'm like you'd pay to be a part of communities where you feel a sense of connection with you know the people around you people pay for social clubs all the time could this become like a social club feeling where you're actually generating utility and feeling positive irrespective of whether or not you made money on it you just want to be a part of this community so that was where i was checking out on it was like it looks like a ponzi scheme to me um i feel like it's going to come crashing down but is there a path where you can kind of play with some of these things and it continues to grow to the point of viability probably i think the the smartest thing that step in did was make it invite only basically you need an access code to like gabby i don't even know if you'd be able to download it and and use it today i still think you need an access code and you know there's this uh i think andy warhol said or one of the founders of studio 54 said this great quote which i think applies to building social products and web3 products which is um studio 54 was a dictatorship at the door but a democracy on the dance floor yeah so funny you say that it's like my favorite quote ever yeah i mean it's it's a late check-out can you say it again greg yeah so uh studio 54 for those who don't know by the way like famous club in the 80s where like all the celebrities used to hang out is a studio 54 is a dictatorship at the door but a democracy on the dance floor i think that if steppen were to win they would need to basically to your point sahil be building that democracy on the dance floor be building that community be building that great experience or else uh or else there's nothing here yeah that's a cool i love that quote um that's really really cool i i agree with you it's like you create that feeling of exclusivity um and like it's sort of the same model that like but you know why it's a zero bond it's important because it gives the product team that step in the product cycles to be to basically be building in the background so they basically have the invite only cohort as let's get key insights to actually how people want to use this product and then let's go spend two six nine 12 months product cycles be building in the background to actually build um like the core experience i think the mistake that a lot of people make when they're building consumer products is they build something and they take ads out in the new york subway like step like that's a bearish signal to me um because i think that like um you know having 10 million users on step on day one is actually more chaos than they really need you really just need a small amount of chaos enough chaos to learn i love it i think i mean i think it's like super super interesting way to think about it you've framed it up for me in a different way so um more to come on this one we should definitely have nat and do a follow-up on this i just pulled up his piece and also you mentioned amanda young that's an awesome piece as well i had read that one actually um that was a great piece on mirror so shout out to both of them um we should do a follow-up on this yeah but we can have you back on it we can do a round table on this stuff and a deeper dive on it um let's um let's switch gears uh to a few other uh a few other ideas and things so one other one that i wanted to talk about and then i can open it up um insurance in the web3 space so this is like admittedly half-baked but one of the things that i've perceived as a roadblock for um you know the next billion users of crypto uh everyone talks about that like how do we on-ramp the next billion users right now you have like this tiny percentage of people who are sort of crypto native or like digitally native that have kind of played or understood the space and then you have you know my parents and like this next billion who who have no idea and also are just like inherently skeptical probably and a little bit scared because the media has you know created a narrative around all of this one of the things that i think jumps out as a reason for that is like constantly brought up to me is oh yeah but these accounts aren't like fdic insured um or you know you don't have insurance in the way that you do if you put money with bank of america people are like well if i have money with bank of america i know you know my money's not going to just disappear which if you talk to a bitcoin maxi you probably get a different answer you know they would tell you that your money might disappear and the government might just take it depending on what country you live in maybe that is true actually but um i've often wondered like whether there were opportunities and maybe people are already you know trying to go after this to just create more um like interesting insurance products that these platforms can leverage and acquire in order to provide more certainty or safety to on-ramp you know more skeptical users to the space um any thoughts on that in general yeah i mean i guess first to point to like why don't we see that or see a ton of it yet it's like pretty simple in the sense that insurance companies don't like ensuring volatile things right and so they're not going to move into the space but i think the big question of like how do we actually solve this problem is how do you assess the intrinsic value of a digital asset which is an entirely new asset class right you could argue that you could like abstract it all away and say an asset is worth exactly what someone is willing to pay for it um but clearly we've seen how that might fail right like is that really the case is the market price actually the price at which the asset should be insured so that's a good point i don't think that's a good point it's not like a diamond where you like hey i know that this two carat you know diamond with these properties is gonna be worth roughly this and so i can insure it at that level i saw a good uh tick tock last night warren buffett's first tv interview have you seen this no he basically he's like he's like i don't look at the prices of stocks like just because someone's willing to pay 70 a share doesn't mean i believe it's worth 70 dollars a share could be worth 20 a share it could be worth 150 dollars a share like that's basically the idea yeah if he's saying that for like coca-cola yeah then you know like i don't know yeah i don't know yeah i mean the counterpoint to this gabby in my mind is like insurance companies don't want to move into it the flip side of that is there's a price for every risk and so i imagine if you went to an insurance company and we're like hey i want to ensure every account that we have at this entire place and the reason it's super risky is because hacks happen and they have historically happened and you know [ __ ] happens right and and within crypto just given it's all pretty new we're in the like earliest days of something that is a broader you know secular movement shit's gonna happen and so the risk is much higher than like bank of america getting hacked and you're losing all your money probably and so the price of that risk is really high and so the platform would have to pay absurd premiums probably in deductibles in order to acquire that insurance what i wonder is whether someone should make the bet like a new platform should come along making the bet that boomers or older consumers who are skeptical will really value knowing that they are 100 or 110 percent covered by like you know fdic 2.0 insurance on x platform so like sahil's platform um you know it's like coinbase but it's sahil's coinbase is a hundred percent fdic 2.0 insured and i just happen to pay this like massive rate to an insurance company that will fully cover any losses that ever happen and so consumers that come to my platform know that they are 100 covered iron clad guaranteed by like geico or whoever the insurance company is um on my back end and i would have to figure out a way to make the economics work so that i could cover that you know i'd have like a lower margin than coinbase would because i'd be paying those insane premiums but do you make the bet that you can go and acquire a bunch of volume of deposits and a lot of trades from a massive new generation of people that are skeptical on this today's episode is brought to you by element a tasty electrolyte drink mix with everything you need and nothing you don't that means lots of salt with no sugar it contains a science-backed electrolyte

pretty interesting i mean i think generally the thesis that i like to follow and i don't think it's foolproof but you should build for web3 natives first and then when the mainstream comes into web 3 you're going to have the product there as opposed to trying to build for these outside consumers who are already very kind of like risk off so there are a couple companies doing interesting things in insurance or like tangentially related to insurance um and they're very like admittedly web through native now but i think it's because they kind of have to be to serve the user base that's actually ready for those products so cozy.finance provides insurance against smart contract risk and then the other two are specifically in regards to nfts and i think they're both super interesting disclaimer i haven't used either of them but um the first is called upshot and it uses machine learning and crowdsourced appraisals to value nfts i'm pretty sure the founder nick emmons worked in insurance before i'm not totally sure um but yeah basically uses these models to kind of like value nfts continuously and they have these massive data sets to do it almost immediately and then abacus does something similar but it's fully decentralized so it's like a web 3 native version of upshot and i guess generally they're both interesting because they help you find value in over or undervalued assets and then figure out where you want to make your bet um that's really cool i mean i'm just looking abacus.wtf yeah and cozy.finance and then i think or not xyz i think it's oh they're both it's the same thing only in crypto and yeah yeah could you have an insurance company with a top level domain as wtf literally yeah the um the nft opportunity is really interesting like i think about um like point-of-sale insurance for nfts would be really cool um i i imagine and uh like openc will work on this or will acquire a company that is going to do it the challenge of doing it internally at these platforms versus you know acquiring or partnering with a um you know embedded finance api type company that will do it for you is like it's a massive new set of core competencies because the the insurance side of this is like you have to go find re-insurers you have to have a panel you have to have like your commission rate it's like very complicated on the back end of making that work but it would be really cool if when you bought you know say i wanted to go buy a board ape on open c and it's like okay i'm going to spend 200 000 on a you know on this ape i want to know that i'm insured in the event of it being stolen in the event of a phishing attack in the event of a hack whatever something like it happened to seth green right like he you know he had that board ape yeah he had all these plans to um you know monetize the board ape via a tv show via all these things it got stolen he no longer owns the ip to the ape and it's like kind of a hilarious situation but he can't make the show anymore and so like he lost a lot of money probably on the back of that so point-of-sale like embedded insurance products for crypto purchases is kind of a cool idea i imagine there are people working on this it sounds like a pretty interesting space i love that i i love the idea i also just want to i want to comment on the seth green thing like if i was seth green i would try to get my ape stolen because this is my here's my hot take of the day and you think it's better for him to have it stolen and be able to go talk about it the mona lisa became popular when it was stolen and then it was brought back this is like the banksy theory of art right like it's worth more when you go like shred it in the gallery because it makes a story yeah exactly so let's see what happens with this ape i also think like generally it's pretty silly i mean i'm not a legal expert by any means but how i feel or like what i've kind of read on the topic is digital assets give you system powers but they don't give you legal rights right like a thief is not a purchaser or an owner per these legal terms and so i think it would be hard to argue that the thief actually has the rights to the stolen asset um and then i saw also saw an interesting threat on twitter about this i'm trying to remember the name of maybe i can share it after but basically if you actually read the board terms it says like i wrote down the quote when you purchase an nft you own the underlying board ape the art completely and the terms essentially suggest that ip rights are licensed and not assigned so um kind of how like the legal experts interpreted this is you could argue that nowhere in the board ape terms does the license actually have a termination provision and so maybe you could argue like once a licensee always a licensee you can't have it taken away from you um but it's kind of cool because it's like cases like these that will set the standard it's like totally open design space yeah it's i mean that's what i find fascinating about the space by the way like i'm the furthest thing from a you know uh like fully red pilled person in general um but i find it so fascinating intellectually to just see this like laboratory of ideas that's getting constantly like bashed by things from the outside broken you know remade figured out like i mean the dokon situation by the way like a funny story that i just feel like we need to talk about i had dm'd with doklan like he had followed me on twitter we were dming i had like scheduled a time to have him on the show um it was gonna be on like a thursday we were going to have him on the show for an interview it was going to be like you know huge he was pretty big he would have been a huge guest within crypto and literally that monday was the monday when tara went to zero you guys like maybe another time well no i didn't so i didn't hear anything we didn't hear anything like monday tuesday wednesday and i was like greg there's no way he's coming on the show right like this dude just lost 60 billion dollars of people's value like there's no way he's coming on tomorrow and we got an email from his assistant on like wednesday night being like dokwan will not be able to do this recording unfortunately at this time we look forward to like discussing in the future and i just replied and just said yeah i figured oh my god but like uh it was the timing of it i mean can you imagine i wish we had been able to record it because getting to release the episode x post would have been so unbelievable because i mean that guy was like he was you know he wasn't afraid he didn't shy away from uh you know from from words um yeah i do think i mean like it's just been interesting to see the the kind of the intellectual gauntlet around all of this stuff and like the number of smart people that are around it the number of smart people that are detractors of it too and that are like kind of forcing people to um you know to push and level up around all of it i i just find it really interesting i think being in crypto and also being in venture it requires you to have like a real opinion on things you can't like you can't be successful in venture if you're disagreeable right like it's the contrarian bets that that have outsized returns and so i think it's helpful to be in a space where there's so much controversy all the time because it requires me like on a daily basis to figure out like what do i stand for why am i in this ecosystem like what do i actually believe in and what are the companies that i want to push forward um and it requires you to have an opinion on like where you see the future going and i think it's a good thing yeah and one of the other cool features of this that i think people don't acknowledge enough is like it is uniquely um enabling young people and also you know minorities women etc to rise through the ranks and like be at the pinnacle of an industry at a very young age um and i find that like that is such a great thing for just breaking barriers that have always existed in these like you know very white collar like greenwich country club industries like vc frankly like the fact that um you know you know more about this stuff than anyone that's like a 40 year old vc just like point blank because you've been in it you like you've been in the trenches you've been working on all this stuff and you can at a young age um you know truly go shake up an industry that has been uh pretty stagnant for a really long time and that's cool because you're part of this like new class of people that are that are all going and doing that yeah i mean two things there i mean first of all like i have to give it all to my team i think tcg crypto is just one of the sickest teams ever definitely the coolest team well jared's amazing they're yeah jared is amazing john is amazing my whole team is amazing and like i don't think we would be able to do this especially as young people like we're relatively young team if we didn't have that kind of support but then also if there's young people listening to the podcast like selfishly when i was moving into this space i was kind of thinking about like okay i'm young my years in my 20s compound so much so i need to figure out like what do i want to do now so that i can be an expert you know once i've put in my 10 000 hours and i'm certainly like by no means an expert in crypto i came into the space full-time so i could catch up and hopefully get there but um kind of the way i thought about it is like i was in early stage consumer investing before just you know traditional web 2 consumer and there are decades of history that i missed right like i either wasn't alive or i was in elementary school or something like that like it would be incredibly hard for me to compete with people who backed these massive companies and had that type of experience and crypto was so new like the reason that i decided to actually enter the space i remember the day i had lunch with brian flynn who's the founder of rabbit hole um which is very full circle because we ended up co-leading their series day with greylock but i literally told brian i was like i'm going to buy you lunch every single day until i figure out like all these answers to my stupid questions so i brought a notebook and we had lunch and we put together a timeline of like big events that had happened in crypto starting from the creation of bitcoin to the eth ico to the ico boom to d5 summer where everyone made a ton of money and then spent all that money during nft summer and then everyone has a profile picture as their an nft as their profile picture and like all of these interesting things along the way too but then you kind of zoom out and you realize that the interesting things on the timeline and like the real foundational aspects that allow you to build interesting things for consumers happened on the second half of the graph so i saw that timeline and i was like okay we're actually way earlier than i thought and there's a massive sort of like arbitrage opportunity for young people to enter the space and actually become experts and so it's sort of selfish but like that was another decision that i made you hit on an amazing piece of advice in there that i think like is worth is worth reiterating for all young people that are listening i mean honestly not just young people anyone listening who is looking to kind of um do something new or make a change and now it's like this whole idea of playing games you are uniquely well suited to win um like don't go play a game that you're just you know predisposed to lose for whatever reason you talked about it in the context of like within consumer investing there's 30 years of history that you don't have the benefit of and you're never going to be able to come up the curve to like compete against someone that has done that i talked to um there's this investor in the in mostly public equities gavin baker who's an amazing investor and he's talked about it on a few podcasts of this idea that like he's one of the only people now that was around for like the dot-com uh boom bust and 0-809 and all the way through to the current tech trends and so he's just like it's very hard to compete with me because i've read the 10ks and 10 cues of every single technology company over a period of like 30 years or you know 20 years and you can't catch up to that like you're not going to build up that embedded um you know experience set that i've been able to accumulate over this long period of time and so when you think about crypto and you brought it up and you know in your in what you were saying there it's like that was a game you were uniquely well suited to uh you know make an attempt to win at least um because you can come up the curve and you can do those things and hustle in a way that gets you at least on the same playing field as anyone else that is possibly in it and then you know lucky breaks things happen you know your hustle your energy gets created etc um but at least you're on a playing field that you can win so i want to i want to comment and i first of all i totally agree with you and i i just want to say a few things actually so the first is like initially in this on this pod we started talking about how important twitter is in terms of getting insight and stuff like that you know twitter is where your best friends are it's also so it's helpful in getting sort of inspiration but it's also very noisy and sometimes for all the builders listening like sometimes you just kind of have to tune it all out and just create something that's interesting you and to sahil's point like you you're the uniquely you know suitable for this particular thing and just create something that you think is going to be interesting to others and [Music] on another pilot i'll talk about this but i've been obsessed with norm mcdonald recently who's a comedian and me and some friends have been just like sharing interviews and one of my friends said something interesting this morning where he we were talking about this interview and he says norm figured out the secret to most things thinking about what's interesting and then just making it funny certain people can have some amount of success thinking about business opportunities or careers or hobbies that seem quote-unquote good and then making them work but the people who really succeed figure out what's interesting to them and then make it interesting to other people and i think that's the key to building you you build something that you find interesting to you and some amount of people and you just evangelize it as much as possible i totally agree i mean i'm not a builder but i use that in my writing um i have the psychology of money from morgan housel on my bookshelf it's like seriously such a good book but i was listening i think it was the tim ferriss podcast and i was listening to his podcast and like tim was asking about how he writes and how he thinks about what to write about and all these things and his advice was very similar and he basically said write about what is interesting to you like the audience should be one person and it's you and you're not that special there's a non-zero chance that other people out there in the world will also find those things interesting and then what also happens is like you never really burn out because you're only writing about the things that are interesting to you and talking about topics that are new and innovative to you and then you also find your community that way and it's like very authentic i've heard morgan say so we had morgan on the show of i don't know maybe like a month after on the month after the tim show and it was great he's amazing um and we talked about something kind of directionally similar but one of the challenges that we talked about that that arises as well is like social platforms are engineered um to like force you to share the things that everyone wants to hear not the things that you want to write about sometimes and so you get this like vicious spiral you know and you see it on you i like i see it on youtube most clearly where like you know personal finance youtubers it's basically like how i bought 10 ferraris and you know for 100 last weekend or whatever you know it's just like garbage nonsense over and over again and it's not that the person has like bad intentions or that they want to share these things it's that that's the video that gets the most clicks and makes them the most money and so then they're like on this spiral of like crap i need to make a video that does just as well or gets me more and so you end up going back to the same stuff over and over again twitter's the same way and so people that i i think it's more rare than not that people are able to actually step away from like what works what gets clicks what gets shares and just think about what they want to write about and talk about and it's why someone like morgan is a bit of a unicorn in my mind because he has done that for such a long period of time so consistently and so well i find that with your writing by the way gabby i think like your writing is amazing and you do a great job with it um but it is something to watch out for for anybody as they continue to like especially as you grow your presence and as you're like following continues to grow and be built continue to write about things that you really care about and want to write about and share not just the things that you think people want to hear so i want to spend um we've got like five five ten minutes left gabby while we have you you know you're in the wheat you know as an investor and as you know participant in these communities like you're just in the weeds on a ton of cool stuff that's happening um in these spaces can you just share like what are the areas or things trends whatever like what's getting you most excited today um and what are some of your predictions for the future of where this stuff is going yeah i have one kind of like oddly specific one that i really want to write about or like i just can't stop thinking about and i really want to see a powerful consumer block explorer i think there's massive potential for a block explorer like etherscan for example is a popular block explorer to tell stories that aren't really leveraged by the existing ones today so i guess the way that i'll preface it is like i'm a vc so like i think about this all the time but like let's think about switching costs right like motes and switching costs are always top of mind for me in b2b sas switching costs are pretty high like if you're on a product it's like relatively difficult for you to move to another one then think about web 2 consumer switching costs are like drastically lower almost zero right like you don't have to use facebook but you know if you stopped using it it's like kind of annoying because you've signed in with facebook all over the web right and all this kind of stuff um but the switching cost of like moving from one consumer application to the other are drastically lower in web 3 switching costs are effectively zero right because you own your own data and you can port it over from one place to the next right like an example is smtp uh the protocol for email so for an email front end like i use gmail but if i wanted to use superhuman tomorrow or hotmail or protonmail or like self-hosted email i could do all of that and like the emails are mine those are just front ends right and i could take my data with me really easily so what's good about that is like these really low switching costs in web 3 and all of these open protocols end up resulting in a lot of pressure on companies to build products that just like point blank serve consumers better i think like from a venture perspective too like i think the best consumer products will come out of permissionless protocols for that reason so anyway that's the preface back to block explorers when we think about what a moat in a block explorer might look like basically like there's data on a public blockchain and if you go to etherscan or any other block explorer if you want to index or even if you want to you know index it yourself you can go and see what has been done on chain right like the information is public it's immutable it's like the same on all of them but from a consumer standpoint the data that you choose to leverage and like make more known on these consumer front ends is really interesting so these are some things that technically you could find yourself on etherscan but most consumers don't i think it'd be interesting to like really contextually and semantically tell the story of like your first day on chain right like my on-chain birthday like what was the thing that you did first when did you get your first wallet when did you become crypto native like facebook memories for crypto yeah or like what wallets do you interact with the most right like i'm always sending like 0.02 eth to my friends because they're like oh like i don't have gas can you send me something like that would be cool to know or like what do those relationships look like or like even these contextual things like let's say you sold your most expensive nft i want to know what you just did with that liquidity like could i think it must be everything can i dumb it down for our please yeah you know for for everyone actually for me for me greg can i dumb it down for zyle yeah etherscan is the craigslist of block explorers so if you go to ether scan it's like super i mean i think it was launched in 2015 um when crypto was a lot smaller and i can see that comparison it's like a white page it's true it's super ugly there's like text everywhere you know the reason you use it is for like really important transactions because you're you you know i'll send gaby you know some eth and i want to make sure it gets there but then all of a sudden i see like a hundred data points and it's like it's not like when you when you um you know you go and you buy like a sandwich from the store and it costs like twelve dollars it's not like you know and you get the receipt it's not like you see like a million data points you know what i mean you see like oh it was twelve dollars and it was approved like that's all i need to see so i think there's like two layers to this it's the first layer is what do i need to see like from a trust standpoint and then number two what would be really cool to see i.e like what gabby's suggesting like nostalgia and stuff like that and then number three it's just how do you package this all up in a non-craigsly cool way yeah i think like the general term for all of these companies working in this space is human readable web3 like making it make sense there's actually a consumer block explorer that i'm super excited about um uh like i have a friend building it but i don't think i can say the name yet but like another one that's sort of playing in a similar space is polyweave um which just launched recently and it's basically like a ether scan api and i'm pretty sure what it does is it just like makes your transactions more readable so you can actually see like oh you minted an nft on this date for this amount of money or you sent something to this ens address and it just makes it easier to understand you know the funny thing about these names of all these companies so i looked up polyweave because i wanted to find it and i literally just like twice it took me to like a protective fire retardant uh woven laminated sheeting website where i can like buy this for like building products so i need to i need to find like there needs to be a web 3 search engine where i only get web 3 results because it can be hard yeah that's true that's true this is cool i like the i mean the idea of like contextualizing and like giving me kind of curated um interesting insights from the blockchain on a given day too is just cool like there have been twitter accounts that have built massive followings off doing this right like even like whale activity or like nft whale activity that's kind of doing this right like they're just scanning the blockchain finding interesting insights that they can pull from it and delivering it in like a nice package that people want to consume and that like you can take those insights and use them for something like in in the nft space if you see a bunch of whales moving into some like lesser known project you might want to go and buy into that or have a bag there so yeah that is that's a pretty cool idea um i like that quite a bit um so predictions for the future give us one like five years from now um where do you think we're gonna be like do you think uh i don't know like what's the price of eth five years from now oh don't ask me that one i don't know if i can do prices right i have a general i have a general prediction well we can all give a prediction well i can also i can say i'm excited to buy and hold on to eth for five years okay okay so i think what about for 20 years i think i'll be holding on to it okay 20 years is a long time it is a long time all over again i know exactly it's crazy to think about but like you know when i the reason i ask the question is just because i and i've talked to greg about this like my investing strategy is buy and hold things forever like basically anything that i buy today i never want to sell and i want to borrow against it i want to like be able to you know until like bitcoin ethereum or i own some solana but like basically bitcoin ethereum mostly the only things i own and like i expect to just hold these things forever i hope they become a huge part of the ecosystem and there's a big thing around it and i want to borrow against it in the future in the same way that i can borrow against my you know s p 500 stocks in my brokerage account um until like when i think about these things i'm thinking generally like 10 plus your time horizons um it also makes you so much more purpose driven like when you see volatile price changes it's like if you're on a decades plus long time horizon it just doesn't matter yeah and it's like the local or tourist thing i've heard sean uh before you talk about this before like are you a local or are you a tourist um and when it comes to getting things like you know seasons change locals know that tourists you know run for the hills when it gets cold or rainy and so um you know just like long time horizons tend to make you operate more like a local with these things you you know you tend to be uh more resilient and frankly you view things as on sale when prices drop rather than being like oh my god i just lost money yeah um so it's just an interesting framing okay well give us one before we jump off then what's like give us one prediction for the future if you've got one yeah it's online credentialism like i think my hot take is like when i have kids a couple decades out i'm not sure if they're gonna go to college um back to web three like if there's an area of web 3 that's quite flawed it's your online identity and the way that you kind of credential identities online it's today it's very much about what you have like what's in your wallet how much capital is there how expensive is your pfp and it's it's very little about what you do even though people are doing really really interesting things on chain and so the problem is now it's putting this emphasis on exclusivity and capital and it's not how the ecosystem is going to scale and it's not how you're going to bring in high quality contributors so i think if we can move towards credentialing based on on-chain actions we're going to see like a more equitable ecosystem and it's going to have huge implications also for how people make money or learn online which goes back to the college thing um so a bunch of companies doing tangentially related stuff in that space like rabbit hole station layer three etc and i think it's just gonna have massive implications for you know how we value things online and it relates to the what we were talking about with um style what you were talking about with work to earn like i think the bigger sort of parent to work to earn is x to earn and then if it's basically like what actions are you gonna do on the web to earn some sort of digital asset that could be used for an online identity so for example rabbit hole which is an investor i'm also an angel and or actually no uh late checkout's an investor in in rabbit hole as well we um you know that what they do is like if you want to learn about uniswap like there's like education around that and you earn the uni token for learning about uniswap and all of a sudden like you're earning credentials and tokens um so then it makes sense that like if i want to hire someone who understands uniswap i would go and work with rabbit hole for that super cool it's a great place to uh to wrap up that's it leaves me with a lot to think about and go read about now too with some of these companies that you just mentioned gabby so um thank you so so much for taking the time to uh to come on and uh and jam with us we'll have to do this in person again are you are you out in new york at all this summer i just moved to la i'll be in new york for nftnyc and probably in and out because i moved at a terrible time so oh yeah well that's in a few weeks let's get together when uh when you're out in new york we'd love to love to get the gang together and i know i uh i'm overdue to catch up with jared dicker as well so we'll need to uh need to get the tcg gang together definitely awesome thank you so much thank you so much talk to you thanks so much for listening to today's episode if you have any questions that you want featured in

the other one i always think of that i think is just an untapped opportunity for i it's mostly like for um you know people that i think have a lot of ambition or like a hustler mentality is just the opportunity to be a scout for some of these like emerging managers that have come out um you know i think about like i think saha lavinia has like a scout program more formally which is great it's like a formal construct but this whole idea of like you know for people that don't know it it's like you're a scout like you kind of go out and search and hunt for deals and when you find one you kind of like bring the deal to some manager and if they do it you get economics in that deal i.e you know future profits if it goes really well a portion of the carry and things like angel list make it amazingly easy to do that on a deal-by-deal basis which is to your point earlier ryan on like what has changed um in an industry that enables some great thing to happen that is something that has changed 10 years ago it was super complex like you had to go hire lawyers and pay them 25 000 probably to like dock up some like simple thing like carrie um and splitting it on a deal-by-deal basis within a fund it would have been too hairy like as a manager i would have been like ooh no it doesn't make sense for me to do that now if a kid comes to me and says like hey i have this deal it's a close friend of mine he's starting this he's at you know mit is building this this and this uh precede you know like you split the carry with them in one click on angel list it's freaking amazing um and i don't think enough people are thinking about that as just like honestly like a little side hobby if you're just if you have networks um if you're you know getting out of school or you're a builder you're like in internet communities wherever and you have these networks of people that are building cool and you have a good eye for it and you have those ends you can go you can i mean if you sent me a blurb you sent 10 other people a blurb on these companies someone would probably take you up on the intros on the opportunities and all of a sudden you're like building carry in a bunch of interesting future companies that's kind of a um you know massive hack or unlock from a from a wealth creation standpoint when you don't have to raise any money to do it [Music] never let the world

cause i feel like i see you on instagram posting stories of you listening to a lot of podcasts i think you're referring to my uh so i have this this semi-new ritual so i've been lifting weights for a long time like that's been my like exercise that kind of activity and maybe a few months ago i was like i should do more cardio but i really don't like running and and so i got a recumbent bike not not like a peloton where you have to like sit up got a recumbent bike where you get a sit back and email and tweet and i have like my ipad set up here so i watch podcasts and so i think that's what you're seeing is my uh promotion of the recumbent bike multitasking podcast email there's a team there's a powerful learning in there by the way of like pairing behaviors um you know like pairing a behavior you dislike but you want to you know adopt with one that you like or find productive i've i've always done the same thing like whenever i need to try to get back into cardio i'm the same as you like i have always been a lifting nerd from back in the baseball days and so i'm still that way but then i neglect cardio for long periods of time and realize like hey i'm 30 i should probably you know take on more of this whatever and i've always paired it with listening to something watching some show i've been wanting to watch um you know like reading emails whatever it is something where i'm like oh okay i just unlocked 30 minutes a day make up the number of time that is now considered productive that i can like justify doing this thing that i generally hate yeah there's a i'll give you a shout out to the hubermann podcast i don't know if you've seen his stuff it's uh it's quite dense it definitely feels like i'm in a lecture like back in college uh but it's great i mean for those that don't know it he basically goes into the science of psychology around a number of different things like how dopamine works or um you know anxiety depression and he talks um he actually has one podcast on i forget the exact topic but he talks a lot about that that same thing and how he actually recommends not listening to podcasts or music if you enjoy it at the gym every single time because you start to essentially your um your brain starts to expect that and and um it doesn't get as much joy over time um and this is the unfortunate reality of like how dopamine works and i know very little about it to be honest but it's unfortunate that like what goes up must come down and um over time you start to acclimate it's kind of like hedonic kind of like treadmill that we're all on start to acclimate to those things so he sort of recommends that like actually don't don't always do all the things you enjoy maybe don't listen to podcasts at the gym just like enjoy the gym as it is and maybe the next time listen to your podcast that you enjoy and i find that i find that interesting um because i'm a very habitual person i do the same thing all the time i make this coffee in the morning i i'm very very routine but always listen to where it happens at the gym please he mentions that yeah i know he said something there's something about the where it happens podcast yeah i think he did recommend that he's actually i have him coming on the show this summer um i want to do like a kind of layman's version of his podcast like what are the 10 things that every person should try to adapt and you know adopt into their life to make them a healthier happier person and do like the takedown version of hubermann lab um on on our show so i've got him coming on this summer he's supposed to be in new york um a couple times so i'm going to try to try to get him live yeah i think that'd be great i do i would like a tldr uh yeah totally his podcast because i've listened to several of his i mean he's kind of the lex friedman um uh you know joe rogan like it's that length sometimes and density where like they'll do an episode on sleep that is you know unbelievable like with matthew matthew walker i think is that sleep scientist's name um but like you know i'm sitting there for three hours learning about sleep like i kind of want the you know what is the cliff notes version of this that will get me 80 of the way there with you know 10 of the thought yes yeah i i mean it's our it's our era of uh you know low attentions fans i'm actually amazed that people sit through and listen to really long podcasts but people do um you know those long episodes people love them yeah i actually like i like conversational podcasts i like joe rogan for the format in part because it's it's one of those things you can kind of dip in and out of you can multitask to um i don't watch all of them but there's sometimes an interesting guess and um i don't know it also feels like you're in the room with other people and i think you know i think more and more people are understanding that that format and and kind of adopting that format more and more but i don't know it's it's better than like the sterile like interview question answer back and forth format in my mind i agree i mean that was the original insight of where it happens too by the way it was like you know is the room where it happens it was like we know that these conversations are happening behind closed doors though and so like smart people or interesting people are having interesting conversations that generate insights that are then creating innovations in the future and changing the future and so how do we open the door to those type of conversations and basically just bring guests on you know super smart people that think about the future for a living like you and just jam on interesting things that are happening and and uh publicize that conversation and you know and and go put it out so that other people can hopefully benefit from it in some way so that's kind of the spirit of it in general as we've thought about it and selfishly you know both style and i have twitter twitter audiences and we were talking about like how can we build affinity basically with our audiences there's one thing about actually going and tweeting two hundred and two hundred and some odd characters but you know being in people's ears all the time um definitely build affinity i'm wondering how you know would you ever start a podcast why or why not and how do you think about that yeah so early product and days well i've listened to podcasts like probably you as well like for many years and i really enjoy them and i used to mow my parents lawn with um gun muffs on with my like old school like uh you know headphones uh underneath them um and listen to like stupid financial podcasts like i don't know i just would love to soak up like information and insight and perspectives and so um i've listened to a podcast forever and then production started and i was like shoot now i have an opportunity to actually start a podcast like it makes sense that we have an audience we have a brand you know it kind of wrote itself um the product podcast was actually very similar format to kind of this to some extent we bring on one or two people who are interesting maybe they're investors founder or someone in technology and we just talked about like what products do you love what's in your home screen like what things have you seen recently that you're excited about and um we did that for a while and then i stopped doing it just because it was it wasn't like the highest roi thing um we never really cracked the the growth thing for for the podcast like you know the people who are most engaged in product would listen to it but it wasn't anything that reached like hundreds of thousands of people let alone millions so the growth part of podcasting is the hardest part it's kind of like twitter itself twitter is really hard to grow your audience for most people it takes many many years in some cases to grow a sizable following and i feel like podcasts are bad but even harder because you don't really have built-in like social dynamics to grow it and get those feedbacks feedback loops that you kind of get from from social media um but i thought about starting a new podcast and i'm just hesitant to commit to anything right now i'm just like do i really want to do that right now can we get into the um what you hit on is like an interesting insight more broadly around building products and it's like driving and creating these like incentives and referral loops that kind of create growth and create community um and it strikes me that like product hunt was a great example of that in the early days like how you built this incredibly fervent community of product lovers and product minds you know i imagine and i don't know the whole story so i actually would love to hear it of like the earliest days of like planting that seed of growth that then sprouted and obviously has become something really massive globally um i would love to just hear a little bit more about that like how did you think about creating those in you know referral loops incentive loops getting people to share getting people to interact and build that you know community fire that you could then kind of pour gasoline on yeah well so i was talking to a founder yesterday um who's exploring some different social community ideas and uh so i'm gonna almost counter my own advice or experience um on one side he has a lot of really good ideas he's brilliant kind of designer product thinker and people like him um can be challenged with overthinking things because we like to think in systems we like to think in flywheels we like to think of like oh if we have this thing it unlocks this thing and unlocks that thing and that's important i think very valuable to like dissect and try to understand however you can also become paralyzed and like over engineer a product if you think if you think you're too if you're like too clever basically and what i mean by that is is um i've made mistakes in the past where we built new products within product that were like way too complicated like because i thought i was so smart i was so clever i was like oh we could do all these things and what about this feature in that feature and we ended up spending way more time on it to bring out like the v1 than we needed so going back to product in the very beginning um i wasn't actually trying to build a company or a product i just was like i like finding cool new products you know why do we have to like hunt for the link inside of techcrunch articles why isn't there just a simple list of here's what's cool that launched today and i was also kind of weird that was like brass in the app store like various countries and i was browsing angelus looking at new companies just to see what people were building basically and so the the initial idea was there was no systems thinking there was no like grand master plan it was just oh what if i started a newsletter because that's easy to do first of products that launched or products that people find interesting and that was sort of the spark that uh you know proved out that okay some people some other people not just me like this type of content and then it sort of naturally fell into okay well newsletter's a great start but obviously we don't have any place to like curate this you know at scale we have no place for comments there's there's so many things missing that can make this better and so a lot of the i would say like first 12 18 months of product but the road map sort of just like fell out it was just like almost obvious based on what people were doing the feedback we were receiving and then over time we started thinking more like systems sort of organically meaning i'll use an example um so initially when the product and website launched it was kind of like reddit we were like let's not reinvent the wheel let's have posts and comments and upvotes and keep it simple and what we found was makers the founders the people that built those products would increasingly come to the site and be like oh i made this thing in the comments like if you have any feedback if you have any like questions let me know and then it was like very obvious to us it was like okay why don't we actually productize that and make it clear that this person made the thing or these people made this thing so that people in the community could identify those people and now that might seem like obvious and kind of trivial but actually what that unlocked is you think about it like a system it unlocked a really interesting dynamic where okay people follow these people know these makers maybe they want to know what their friends launched or people that they follow launched so it led us to unlock sort of these engagement loops through email so like if greg launched you know his new like islands back in the day everyone that knows greg or follows greg on product hunt would now get notified and those would have really high open rates and engagement rates and then of course the next part of the system is oh now you can build a profile you can have this profile of things that you made and kind of show it off to other people and for a certain subset of people especially like indie makers or like young entrepreneurs they're like very proud of that and and so all those things sort of like unfolded sort of naturally um in the roadmap but but yeah if i tried to like think of all those things from day zero um in some ways it might have been like paralyzing because it's like okay we have all these ideas but like at the end of the day you have to just prove out like the core dynamic the core like value problem early on yeah two things you hit on that i want to double click into one you know you mentioned like overthinking and paralysis and i mean you guys are both builders and have built multiple different products and different things over your years i've always thought that like overthinking tends to come from inaction and it's not that you're like not acting and so you start over it's sort of like when you're not acting and when you're not um you know having that bias to just get things out test learn iterate et cetera that's when you find yourself prone to overthinking and over analysis because you're just you're sitting there and you're like i'm not gonna act let me just pause wait et cetera and so you get caught in that um and so i'm curious just for your guys perspectives on that like have you found in general that overthinking results from inaction so consumer social first of all is its own beast in my opinion and when you think about zero to one consumer social it's probably ninety percent are ten percent science now once you actually build uh some level of product market fit that changes over time and you know if you think about like facebook like you know they had instagram and then they're like they bought instagram they're like okay let's just sort of like bring what we learned on facebook and apply it and optimize it on instagram um so you then you end up just running experiments and it becomes 90 science 10 art so i think what ryan is saying um and correct me if i'm wrong but i think what you're saying in the early days it does feel a lot more organic when you're building community or social products and you kind of have to just uh go with your intuition a lot of the time if you have a unique insight in a particular you know field like you you understood um at the time like and i was there like sf tech products makers like you understood that and it was under it was underserved and you're and correct me if i'm wrong like the first time i heard of product hunt was i think i was invited to a brunch and [Music] we did use some branches yeah yeah yeah and some meetups yeah yeah and could and yeah i'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about in the early days the importance of you know the events and brunches um because when you think about building a tech product you know you don't really think about over easy eggs that much you go i don't know i think of over easy eggs immediately greg yeah that's a good avocado that's a good chapter title for your next book um yeah i mean so a lot of this was organic too um so even before product and i was actually doing some brunches and kind of meetups with like other founders and people and i was trying to build like you know relationships with people and learn and i was just basically trying to soak up as much as i could meeting people in person especially when you're in san francisco was enjoyable and so when production kind of like well when we hit some level product market fit we we had just it felt obvious to me like oh why don't we just meet up in person we've been like talking about this tech you know online and so we started our first meetups and then over time other people could be like hey can i do a meetup in bangalore i do a meetup in berlin so i don't know how many we've had but maybe over a thousand meetups across the world hosted by the community where you know we support but basically they run it all and and that's been just really effective in building more tight-knit community and it really is a almost like an irl version of what's happening on product 10 in in some ways where people want to connect with the people people want to learn about technology they want to geek out about this thing and there was kind of a you mentioned this earlier right there's sort of that was missing to some extent on the internet yeah there's subreddits for tech there's twitter but there wasn't sort of this destination for new products and like this optimism that we were trying to encourage so um i think this goes back to like to do things at a scale component like i think social products community products especially it's not like you need everybody on there you actually probably don't want everybody on there you just want like a really tight-knit group of people who are really excited about what you've built and then that kernel can grow into something much bigger do you think and this is a question for both of you guys i guess just from your product building experience do you think that the best products feel extremely obvious like you said that ryan in the early days of product not like you were just letting customers guide you and like every you know the product roadmap was informed by things that just felt obvious like oh we definitely like we obviously need to do this because all the customers are asking for it we had um a discussion with uh with greg's friend this uh guy nick salterelli from midday squares and he was like there was this change that i just had to make which made no sense on paper as like a financial move but it was just so abundantly obvious from the consumers and from the people that cared about the product that i needed to make this change and it started getting me thinking about this loop of like is a good heuristic to just say like the new rollouts need to be the things that just feel so obvious to you when you're going and doing them do you think that's an effective heuristic or do you need to um you know kind of be more dynamic than that i'm curious to get greg's take on this i mean i hindsight is always obvious is the challenge um right because if you look back at some ideas and you're like you know let's take snapchat you know it's in hindsight like oh it makes a lot of sense why you know kids were sending ephemeral photos um but in the moment you know most people didn't get it most people didn't realize that that opportunity so i think a lot of it is um there's another kind of like question to ask that's related to this in my mind which which we asked a lot on the investing side which is um you know what's changed like what is their regulatory shift is there a consumer behavior shift is there a technology shift what's changed in this world to enable this this new thing to emerge and going back to snapchat like i wasn't obviously like in the company and i don't know every all the details about snapchat but a big shift a big part of that was you know kids on you know facebook just didn't want their parents and their teachers to see their posts they were also concerned i think this is also the rise of like canceled culture kind of emerging and and other things like that and so the ephemerality um was very counter to like older generations who want to save everything and like go back to those things that's really not what that younger generation you know wanted um so i don't know i think a lot about that like what's changing especially in consumer products there's always even if you just take the generational shift like people that grow up in different times like grow up with smartphones have very different expectations and ways of speaking and engaging that that maybe don't um adapt or align with like today's modern day like giants like you know let's take facebook as an example facebook.com um so i find that really interesting i try to understand that when i'm speaking with founders it's almost like i guess the nuance or like the tweak i would make to what i said originally is like the initial insight if you want to build something huge world changing et cetera the initial insight has to be contrarian really i mean it has to be something that no one really agrees with you at the time and then everyone agrees with you later that it's like oh yeah snapchat you know you use that example it's a great example like at the time you're like probably no one agreed with it there's most people and because if everyone agreed with it someone else would have built it there would have been a thousand snapchats already and so it was like an initial insight that was novel and contrarian that in the future everyone agreed with and that's kind of as an investor or as a builder that's what you want you want to build things that everyone agrees with you on later um in the future there's some great kind of quote investing adage around that but maybe it's that that initial insight has to be contrarian and very different um but then as you get that flywheel going and like as product market fit exists you're able to be led by the customers into things that feel very obvious and so then like the next layer of rollouts the next product the road map starts to be informed in a way that feels really more obvious because your customers are kind of leading you directly there post pmf [Music] yeah i think uh the way people's brains work is uh everything seems audien obvious in in hindsight so people will say oh my god i obviously that product would fail because of xyz in hindsight or obviously that product would work because of xyz in hindsight and i think the truth is when you're building consumer product it's all about having some key insight in a particular niche and [Music] being like weird basically being weird and building a product that's weird and weird that's in a good way for the people in that niche and weird that the people outside that niche are kind of like well that's weird why would i ever use that and that basically buys you time to iterate on a product in that particular niche and really really serve them in a remarkable way and like snapchat you know snapchat was a product for los angeles high school students to send nudes basically um initially and it was for them like the best product in the world for a period of time and then they expanded that and expanded that and expanded that um so much to the point where now there's you know hundreds of millions of daily active users so um you know i'm not recommending you know create products that send nudes to people but what i am recommending is is going you know pick a niche go into that niche niche and serve them serve them well i mean nikita did this right like um with uh with tbh and with any like you know new stuff he's working on it's like he even if it's not some like amazing and you know insight about people it's like you know what high schoolers are already doing they're gossiping about each other they're talking about each other behind their backs they're saying things about each other and so like what is a product that you can build around that natural human instinct for gossip and there's there's a ton right there's just like um having a small insight or being willing to kind of like play to a natural human instinct or desire it can be a really powerful building inside if you're going to go create things and the truth is you need as a maker you need one small insight which could absolutely transform your life that's your point yeah like if you come up with one small insight in a particular niche it could literally literally change your life just like you know you can have one tweet that gets 100 000 likes or 500 000 likes and then all of a sudden you have this new audience and it might transform your life um so just changing gears a little bit because i do want to get into some like ideation stuff ryan what are you what are you working on now like i know you're not formally working on product hunt stuff anymore what's what's your focus day to day what are you uh what are you thinking about or getting excited about yeah um so i'm investing full-time now um and we're investing early stage pre-seed you know uh seed stage companies across everything um so we we do love weird consumer stuff uh we're investing in web3 stuff we're investing in boring sass stuff like really a lot of our through line there is like what is what is change what's the consumer behavior shift what's technology shift and part of that thinking is obviously startups are not private market startups are not 100 like efficient but they're getting more efficient because more and more people are building and trying new things so that's why we think so much about the why now like what's changed kind of question um on the investing side so um so vatican and i are working on on the fun side we're also constantly trying to experiment with different things i would say like we kind of break up the funding like one is um uh how do you say it um business as usual meaning you meet founders you evaluate founders you do diligence you support founders sort of like the table stakes of investing and then there's another thread which is like experimentation and we're always experimenting with different ideas um we've had i don't know how many experiments we've done but but basically we try to build things not necessarily products but build um different different products not in a software set so the most recent one is operator lps is what we're calling it i don't know if it's a great name but that's what we're calling it for now and the idea is we're seeing a lot of our friends a lot of people that we know raise funds and a lot of them of course like raising a fund from lps is very difficult for a lot of people furthermore we also have a strong belief that investing is increasingly customer driven community driven network driven and that's why we raised from 370 lps in our latest fund so we raised from tons of operators like some top designers data scientists engineers sales people we have hundreds and hundreds of lps who are financially invested in our success and therefore the portfolio success so we started this experiment called the operator lps basically like a gp demo day to connect operator lp so not necessarily the fund the funds the endowments but really these are people that might write 10k checks 100k checks into funds who are excited to get involved and back these these gps mostly smaller funds is what we focused on like mostly like sub 20 million dollar funds and our selfish goal is well our selfish goal is really to build a stronger network with lps and with gps to sort of help but we're not taking we're not charging for this we're not getting economics we're just experimenting to see kind of where this can play out and so far we've run two gp demo days with three people in each demo day first one went about 1.1 million dollars in interest um second one's 1.5 million dollars in interest so you know we're still kind of gathering data points to see like is this valuable to people like this um and sort of the next step is to figure out okay what does v2 look like how do we expand this to more gps to more lps just to really decrease the friction for from the fundraising side and what we really want to do is push push the industry forward towards a more collaborative more community investing beyond just the investor founder side but gp and lp side as well if you're anything like me your portfolio is a mix of the usual suspects stocks bonds and

d-r-i-n-k-l-m-n-t dot com slash happens to take advantage of this special offer try element you won't regret it so this is kind of a question for both of you that's um a branch off of that ryan because i think it's an amazing initiative you know i know more and more people are interested in investing you know want you know have some unique network or some unique angle value-add etc but don't have the lp relationships or don't really know how to go about like sourcing deals or deploying capital at scale like if you were for either one of you and i'm happy to weigh in on it as well if you were kind of like dropped with nothing um and wanted to begin angel investing or begin investing in earlier stage companies what what's some of the advice or what actions would you take in order to kind of establish yourself and start to execute against that i'll jump in real quick um so i'm going to speak on on vedica's behalf so her and i are the two on the fun met her over three years ago and she she was a product manager working at a company but she was writing fantasy memos is what she called them so she was looking at companies um like i remember retool was one of them way back in the day and writing up a memo as if she was investing almost like an analyst would like as if she was proposing an investment in this particular company and she wasn't sharing that with anyone it actually wasn't even online which maybe she should have shared it online but she wrote it for herself as like almost like practice like an exercise and anyone can do that today you don't need money you don't need connections you don't need any of that but what it will do is help you i think refine your thinking if you were to invest and furthermore it creates a paper trail when when i interviewed her for the role she just sent me these fantasy memos i was like oh my gosh you're basically doing the job already and i can see your work and can see how you think so i think that's an obvious like brilliant step and if you don't want to do that then maybe you shouldn't be investing like like that's the job to some extent at least that's part of it so um that's that's like a focus recommendation that's such a cool example too because there are real case studies of people doing that now like um you know in a very public setting like i think of both packy and mario at the generalist as like two examples of people who built a you know owned audience by their newsletters through writing and dissecting and deconstructing businesses and trends and principles um and then on the back of that are able to go and say like you know how i think about businesses like to lps or to people at scale you can go say like you know how i analyze businesses you know how i think about bowl cases bear cases et cetera because here look here are like the 10 cases where i've written about it in a in a specific context and so you can go on the back of that and like leverage the information you've generated at scale to go and raise capital and deploy it the other one i always think of that i think is just an untapped opportunity for i it's mostly like for um you know people that i think have a lot of ambition or like a hustler mentality is just the opportunity to be a scout for some of these like emerging managers that have come out um you know i think about like i think saha lavinia has like a scout program more formally which is great it's like a formal construct but this whole idea of like you know for people that don't know it it's like you're a scout like you kind of go out and search and hunt for deals and when you find one you kind of like bring the deal to some manager and if they do it you get economics in that deal i.e you know future profits if it goes really well a portion of the carry and things like angel list make it amazingly easy to do that on a deal-by-deal basis which is to your point earlier ryan on like what has changed um in an industry that enables some great thing to happen that is something that has changed 10 years ago it was super complex like you had to go hire lawyers and pay them 25 000 probably to like dock up some like simple thing like carry um and splitting it on a deal-by-deal basis within a fund it would have been too hairy like as a manager i would have been like ooh no it doesn't make sense for me to do that now if a kid comes to me and says like hey i have this deal it's a close friend of mine he's starting this he's at you know mit he's building this this and this uh precede you know like you split the carry with them in one click on angel list it's freaking amazing um and i don't think enough people are thinking about that as just like honestly like a little side hobby if you're just if you have networks um if you're you know getting out of school or you're a builder you're like in internet communities wherever and you have these networks of people that are building cool [ __ ] and you have a good eye for it and you have those ends you can go you can i mean if you sent me a blurb you sent 10 other people a blurb on these companies someone would probably take you up on the intros on the opportunities and all of a sudden you're like building carrie in a bunch of interesting future companies that's kind of a you know massive hack or unlock from a from a wealth creation standpoint when you don't have to raise any money to do it and a name for yourself you can say like i brought you know notion to to sahil or i brought this deal you know i think that that helps add a lot of credibility i think my biggest you know advice here would be to you know if you do want to get more into investing is to become the xyz person so you know for example like some people called me the community person or ryan you know the the product person and stuff like that and i think if you develop that niche then people just start coming to you um and you become the center of gravity for your vertical so i think is this like naval naval has that like uh what is it like type four luck or something like that greg have you seen this you were ryan like naval has this whole concept of like four kinds of luck um and i think it was like type four that was this exact thing greg where it's um you're just like the person in a given space and so people come to you like if you are the world's best i think he used the example of like scuba diver um like buried treasure diver then when there's some like weird buried treasure that gets found in some place like you're the person they have to call because you're known as that guy and so now you're getting lucky because you're getting a cut of certain things by just being the guy in that space yeah i think you know and i think with like twitter and stuff like that you know building the audience on those platforms but also like owning these email addresses so what i would be doing if i was put on an island is like picking picking a vertical being really different and weird um and just putting up content that uh is is unique in that space and then doing like um maybe weekly luma um video session so for those who don't know luma basically it allows you to rsvp to different events so you maybe you do a weekly like you know if it's me i'm doing like weekly community social web 3 stuff or whatever and then i get people's email addresses and then you know after i get 5000 i'm like okay everyone like big announcement like i'm launching a fund and you know that's what i did basically with you know the late checkout rolling fund like we raise seven figures yearly of a fund in a matter of days and i never even took one meeting and i've never raised a fund in my life and it was all through the magic of of of being weird and you know standing on the the shoulders of giants of platforms like angellist and twitter yeah i well i'll have one note on that actually or one comment um so that that's the similar advice in terms of like if you're starting to to invest you should probably just be like an expert in one thing and just like own it um ironically that's not what we do but uh like my dad says like do as do as i say not as i do um but i think that's the ideal advice however the only caveat like asterix all put on that is i think it's super important to figure out what what it is what you choose because let's take an example let's say you're like the chatbot guy from like 2016 you don't want to be the chat bot investor because once you brand yourself as that and then you know people realize oh this isn't a hot space it actually isn't as big of an opportunity as we thought you're now actually you know you're starting from behind the starting line basically you have to like rebrand yourself so i think i would choose something that you have extremely high conviction and that's authentic to you that's sustainable and that that can be hard to figure out like what is sustainable um yeah this will also do pivot to be fair like you could how many um this is one that i just crack up about still like every single vc in the world was a creator economy vc in 2020 and every single one of them is a web 3 investor in 2021 and it's like there was this hilarious meme i think it was josh baby and greg our friend from metaphy posted that was like the woody from toy story being thrown on the ground and it was like creator economy was woody and it was like i don't want to play with you no more throwing the crater economy on the ground but like i don't know i mean i i do think you can you know on the margins you can shift obviously to your example on chatbot it then becomes very difficult to not be branded as like oh that's the chatbot guy um but i yeah anyway just like one caveat to it yeah there's also one one small thing i'm trying to understand this better so this is like a um me kind of shower thought some of the people that have um in the investing world that have made the strongest name in this respect in terms of being known for this particular thing as an expert in this thing they actually create language around this thing usually they're emerging trends i would say like injuries and horus as a firm is probably maybe one of the most exceptional at this like chris dixon especially with with regards to web3 related things like there's there's certain words he has like skeuomorphism is being one like skeemorphism is is sort of reflecting back to like the steve job days and that this product is too much it's too much of a derivative of like a web 2 thing like web 3 social isn't maybe just like twitter on the blockchain for example and so the ability to create language that then everybody adopts is actually really powerful signal because now you become sort of indirectly known as the person who's like pushing the language forward which pushes thought forward and an industry forward um so i think it's like a really fascinating thing to think about like what language can you introduce that isn't like cheesy or isn't forced that's the hard part it has to feel it has to be something that people can like grasp onto and understand and is valuable not you know something that's like selfish in a way it's also interesting to think about whether you can brand yourself around your lever of value creation so we've been talking about it from like one end of it where you're branding yourself around you know the the industry or the focus area like your area of expertise from an investing standpoint um but you kind of you could flip it you can invert it and say like i'm gonna brand myself as you know um like julian shapiro you know like oh i'm like the you know product led growth or growth guy and so like i know i can help you on growth and so when people need to think about that for whatever reason because it's a key part of their story of their company and in that case growth is in general in everyone's company you think of that person and when they're you know asking like oh who should i talk to for smaller checks um here are some of the core competencies we need on our cap table you get brought up a lot because that's your core lever of value creation i think about it for myself around like distribution and and um and uh you know kind of getting access to you know large numbers of customers et cetera and so it's um it's just interesting to think about whether you can flip it on its head and do it that way yeah that's a really good point but that might there's a safer way of going about it too and arguably more valuable um to founders that you back yeah especially with small checks too i mean i think like it's a different game if you know it's like you ryan and you're trying to more like lead seed or precede deals and you're writing a bigger check and you need to really be able to offer something comprehensive in terms of an understanding you know helping them navigate the idea maze etc but if you're going to be a small check at the kind of tail end of a cap table it's much more about like what is the one you know one vector that i'm going to help you with you know one tiny thing you don't need to offer the whole you know buffet menu it's just like what is that one thing i mean i think about investing as a founder kind of like a product so you're selling equity and you know different investors cost different amounts of equity essentially and they help in different ways and um harry hurst from pipe has this this concept called the check size to helpfulness ratio yeah i saw this that was good yeah it's a good it's a good way to articulate i think um different trade-offs i suppose when you're fundraising and essentially what he's saying is you know some of the people who write the largest checks may not be the most helpful um some of you who write the tiniest like 10k angel checks might be way more helpful than your lead investor who wrote a you know five million dollar check in some cases and so if you actually compare it like harry in this case he would have sold a lot more of his company's equity to the 5 million dollar investor versus the 10k czech angel investor and i think that's important for for founders to acknowledge and think about and it's one of the reasons why i'm such a big fan and supporter of like small funds and angels and how do you enable how do you enable founders to bring out a lot of really helpful people who can can really roll those sleeves and get involved without taking the entire round yeah there's a lot to think about there um well before we run out of time greg i know you you or ryan had one or two ideas that i wanted to uh wanted to jam through um one of you guys want to uh want to throw something out that we can riff on i'll start because i've been thinking about this the last last few days um it's one of those uh me and my co-founder have this uh text thread it's called uh bad bad idea of the day and uh it's it's basically like the framing i think i know where you're going yeah it's kind of you know 97 of the ideas are bad but like sometimes they're so bad it's like maybe good so just that's the context okay so um i was watching or i have a friend or friend of a friend who um was in a boxing match with other influencers so i'm sure you're all familiar with jake paul and and the paul brothers becoming you know transitioning from almost influencer to boxers and taking it professionally there was this event that happened a few weeks ago that was not you know paul level um of fame you know not tens of millions of subscribers but from the 100 000 subscribers to you know a couple million subscribers and it was a boxing match that um they rented out a university in um in tampa and sold out and had this league um where um you know i knew some people who were boxing in it and some friends of friends were boxing in it and it was like the most fun i had had in a saturday night in a really long time so it got me thinking like is there an opportunity to create you know boxing is cool and everything but like an nba league but for influencers or a hockey league but for influencers um so curious your your thoughts here and there's a lot of directions we can go it could be maybe web 3 it could be um it could be plain just like hey like uh i think there was a show called um joe's versus pros or something like that like you know maybe you do like nba type people versus influencer people so just yeah i wanted to get your perspective there i went to um i don't know maybe six months ago i went to the tick tock versus youtube boxing thing uh which sounds similar to maybe what you're describing it was like basically to talk famous people youtube famous people going head-to-head and it was i think i was like me and me and susie are probably the oldest people there i felt like um it was a lot of people i didn't even recognize uh but it was really fun and the energy was like insane um i think there's there's what you're touching on is sort of reminds me of like reality tv in a sense like reality tv made um well it created an opportunity for regular people at the veterinary quotes to to be famous and it made it more accessible it made it for for the viewers for the audience to be like oh i'm i'm kind of like that person i could be like that person it made it more relatable um you're also touching on like you know people who are already famous doing something abnormal that they don't normally do so i think there's something there i guess the only thing is would it be would it be a one-off thing or would it be like you said league which kind of implies like an ongoing like recurring thing um like would it get old i guess would it get stale is sort of my biggest question but i mean i have to create storylines around it for sure like to the reality tv point you'd have to create you know good storylines that kind of like ran through it if you were gonna make it a series but the i mean like i just like if it's sports i think it has to be a sport that's individual enough that you kind of have you know real faces and personalities coming out like you couldn't do a football you know team or something where it's like they're passing it to i don't know it just it wouldn't it wouldn't um put the focus enough on these like individual personalities that have the you know name cachet and brand you could do probably like three on three basketball or like one-on-one basketball um golf could be a really fun one actually of like they kind of did that with like tom brady aaron rodgers with phil mickelson and tiger i think it was which was like really fun entertaining to watch because you can even the playing field from pros vs joe's with with handicaps um but i don't know i mean i think there's probably something to it because you do have like owned audience these people are entertaining to watch hopefully like kind of funny or have some personality around like sucking at the thing that they're doing um it could be kind of interesting yeah and i think uh what was also interesting is like you can do it you can also do it like direct to consumer like there's like software out there that you can basically do a pay-per-view sort of experience like i think we paid thirty dollars or forty dollars to watch this thing for a few hours um you know if you sell i mean you do the math um you know if you can sell fifty thousand hundred thousand at fifty dollars or thirty dollars like it adds up and i think i'm not sure if it's a you know venture scalable business but it might be something where um you know someone who's listening might be able to like reach out to a few influencers and and sort of bring this together um and do something small in their local area um and start and then start proving out the model i think it could be i think it could be pretty cool um i really enjoyed i don't know if you you know the youtube creator graham steffen he's uh personal finance finance yeah he has like two or three million youtube subscribers and watching him get like punched in the face um and i'm i don't even like ufc or boxing but just like it was it was so interesting to watch and i think like influen a lot of these influencers are so they're entertainers so they understand like um how to get the crowd going how to like you know where wear really fun costumes it was you know it was more interesting than a professional boxing match and they had the audience to you know build up the hype and the story kind of leading into it and everything um i mean it is something that you could like theoretically um uh apply to multiple communities like i'm even thinking like could we do this in the tech community can we get like the most famous investors and founders to like punch each other in the face um just for a night um and obviously like different communities it's like a broadly appealing like concept that could apply to different people um in different communities around the world i think i mean we've talked about that sahil i think right in our group chat we often say like you know there's a lot there's always uh there's always drama in tech twitter um and and people fighting back at each other so it would be kind of fun to put like you know an aaron levy versus uh chris dixon in in uh in the ring and you could raise a lot of money for charity yeah it'd be pretty fun maybe that's how they fight for their allocations you know in these hot deals it's like forget forget the pitches it's just whoever can like makes it out of the ring gets the right you actually have to fight it's a legitimate fight for the allocation in the deals yeah yeah i would watch it i don't hate it i don't hate it all right what one more we've got time for one more here ryan one more um so i didn't compare it with anything but i'll share one idea that i'm this is actually me asking for feedback and so i thought about this for years um uh with zero action so i'm uh anyway not not a good trait to talk about something for so many years and not do anything about it but the reason why i haven't is because it's commitment and i'm scared of commitments um so i i don't i don't really vibe with any of the co-working spaces i've been to anywhere so i've had this idea when i lived in san francisco i had this video when i was in l.a i'm now in miami and especially miami seems like a good place for this and essentially what i'm what i'm imagining is how do we how do we create a small intimate co-working space with good music um it's not too cold you know their ac is not too high uh and just good people like first degree second second degree kind of connections and um i've worked out of weworks there's there's a lot of value in weworks but it's not my vibe it feels very cold it's not where i want to hang out and like be productive and so i thought a lot about okay what would you know i'm calling a weekend cafe kind of naming after like weekend fun in my head what would weekend cafe look like and obviously there's some like basics you know maybe an open space with a bunch of phone booths so you can like take calls especially as more people are working remotely but now more recently i've been thinking well how can you actually innovate on the business model and of course my mind goes to nfts and web3 as kind of one one kind of thread to pull on and what we're seeing more and more of is people releasing a utility nfts or subscription kind of membership based nfts and you know the most obvious and basic kind of like application of that is now you actually have better price discovery theoretically for these nfts so an example could be weekend cafe is 100 seats 100 membership slots available it's really small it's intimate and the people that own the nft one of the hundred nfts get access to the space but you can resell it and you can of course have like on the secondary market the actual um business itself in this case like let's say me gets like secondary transactions like 10 of those cuts that actually is interesting because you might find that actually weekend cafe is very valuable and actually it initially was sold for 100 per membership now it's ten thousand dollars for some reason um it's just interesting to kind of think through okay what would that look like so i'm curious if you have any thoughts on this or other so innovations in that model so i like i've seen and talked to a few people that are kind of doing variations of something like this like social club or you know like the soho house of web3 type vibe um or like garyvee has this hunt and fish club i think it's called and similar stuff my concern with it fundamentally is always like how do you prevent this from just being you know the wealthiest people buy into the coolest things and you like prevent it like it actually goes to being less cool because suddenly it's like not the curated um environment group it becomes more like business and capital and money in the same way that like soho house was super cool when it started and they were very careful about who was in and it was more artists and designers and um then it became really financy and like all of a sudden every banker in the world was a member at soho house it probably got less cool because they got more corporate trying to make money to go be a public company so my question is always like my pushback on this is always how do you avoid it just becoming um you know that like rich people kind of buy these nfts and are able to go to it when they become you know one two three four five eth um to go to go purchase two thoughts yeah so first thought on that piece style i think what you can do is just make uh make it the initial batch freedom in you could have something like some level of like you know maybe you want to keep the the first batch diverse and so in some in some way so there is some you know asking some questions up front but ultimately you know people think that you know you know getting an nft is always you know they in their minds they think of board apes and stuff like that but it doesn't always need to be that case for example the number one project right now on openc is a freedom in project goblins town um so i think having freedom freedom and component um is very interesting in in this so it and by the way ryan it could also be hybrid like maybe you sell if you do 100 maybe you do 50 free to mint and you sell 50. um the second piece of feedback i would have is so first of all i'd love this concept i think miami needs it more than any any place that i've been to and i think what would be really cool is if you can reward long-term holders and good actors of the nft so one of my favorite projects in the nft space is a project by dom called corruptions and corruptions is basically this nft that the longer you hold it the more it changes and and it basically evolves and in the smart contract there's basically this like it's it's basically built into it so i wonder if you can do something similar where um if i become a good actor if i you know i hold it it change the nft changes i get certain privileges because of that um and the other sort of analog um that i also would love to implemented something like this is uh the last week i've been really into bowling don't ask why uh but and the bowling alley i've been going to has this uh leaderboard of people who've bowled 300 perfect games 300. i wonder if there's stuff like that you can do where it's like imagine you bought a coffee for someone every day and for 30 days maybe you're on some sort of leaderboard so i also wonder if there's like fun gamification type things that you can do yeah actually one note on the the corruptions concept um so the moon birds projects have been um and the proof uh collective project i've been following from the beginning moon birds has this nesting concept so i have a couple of moon birds um i got them because i have a proof collective pass from the beginning and when you nest them every 30 days it like levels up into i think it goes from like bronze to maybe silver to gold to diamond or something like that and what's kind of interesting is um as you sort of level it up um the the actual nft itself um carries those attributes going forward so once you unnest it it stops that that leveling kind of progression but you still maintain like the the status of that particular nft and so as you sort of hold on to the nft longer it gains in more value and has more abilities or prestige in the community over time that you can then sell so it's kind of like in a video game when you level up like a world of warcraft character you know it's a level whatever 100 it's it's a level 100 when you want to like give it to somebody else still and i find that concept compelling because it really rewards people for holding but it also rewards people financially theoretically in the future if they want to sell or liquidate in some way uh to the buyer so yeah i think there's a lot to play with there um and i think video games can be a great source of inspiration for all those ideas too basically how do you take like what we do in video games and apply it to these types of dynamics so if you want to start with cafe together let me know um i know i was kind of like maybe there's actually something to it there's there was one that this guy started called maxwell social i think in um in new york that i saw recently um that looked like it was gonna be pretty cool we'll see if the build-out happens and then i saw another one that's sort of around like an athlete um former athlete community network um that's a former nfl player that i know that's he's starting but some cool stuff going to happen in the space for sure i just want to see it actually play out and not become like a you know highly um uh you know like i don't know exclusive community that just like wedges people out any final thoughts guys before we wrap i know we've taken uh we've taken up our hour of time here um this was awesome i feel like we hit on a bunch of really interesting things and and threads within a single conversation yeah without anything on your mind greg anything i don't know i didn't i didn't come really prepared with anything formal so uh just want to jam and chat that's the best way yeah i mean the last thing my last question for you while i have you is are you happy are you happy you made the miami move because you were you know almost the poster child for san francisco at one point and and uh we and you know i moved from san francisco also to miami and i'm just wondering are you happy um are you happy you made the move i i am so i grew up in oregon then lived in san francisco for 10 years la for two and then miami it's been a year now and uh i am it's the thing is um i mean i've always worked remotely product that was distributed so for me even though i live in miami i'll be in new york uh later this week i'll be in la in july i'll be in tulum for a wedding the next month and so for me it's miami just it's just one of many places i live in i suppose i'm here most of the time but it's good i mean there's certainly some downsides you know summer hurricanes are a little rough uh we had a lot of rain a few days ago it was insane um but you know waking up in the morning without like the pressure of you know west coast like rush is nice um some of the nightlife here is is amazing i love the warm weather so i'm a fan um what is interesting though is i i to be honest i think that more investors are here than founders there's a lot of talk about like people from tech coming here and i don't have any hard evidence or data on this but there aren't a lot of founders here which is fine because i don't think founders in person i just go over video but i don't know if you've noticed that greg but it doesn't yeah like there's a substantial number of founders uh you know in the tech circles over here i agree i'd love to do more like we should do some sort of like event or something and when i say event i don't mean like a thousand percent event but like 10 15 20 builders in a room jamming on ideas um that'd be fun yeah i just feel like this is this is why we need a like a cafe a space because there's no shelling point right now i think that i'm aware of maybe i'm just not invited to one that exists um but we don't have like a space to just meet up and jam and co-work and that kind of thing so yeah you wonder whether it'll be like and if you build it they will come type thing with the founders like now that more of the investors are there you know and as things go back to in real life which hopefully they do because i think it's a good thing um in a lot of cases you know you wonder whether more founders will choose to build there because it's just the proximity and your access to capital will be very real mm-hmm yeah so we'll find out come visit it's great i will i will absolutely i know i'll be back down there come uh i'm gonna wait until it gets a little less muggy probably but i will be back down there uh you know maybe in september i'll look forward to it well thank you so much ryan this was awesome really enjoyed the chat and uh we will talk to you soon yeah thanks for having me see you guys later thanks so much for listening to

the cheaper your electricity the more power you have you can desalinate water you could have abundant water you could have abundant crops in agriculture but it all starts with how do we get clean abundant energy and to me the answer is elemental power formerly known as nuclear [Music] thank you so much for uh for taking the time um so so excited to get to have this conversation um and a lot i want to cover with you but you know i thought maybe we could just start uh really with like this idea of your map of reality um you're a really interesting guy really interesting thinker investor you do so many different things and one of the things i like to just start out with is kind of establish what is someone's map of reality like what has created that for you what has set your map of reality so maybe we just start there you know like as you think of your own map of reality as you look at the world what have been some of the kind of key moments or key points in your life that that help to form that some of this is post-facto so you know staying intellectually honest right the the things that were informing me 20 years ago or 15 years ago or 10 years ago at the time i might have prescribed or described something different i have always been competitive the competitive nature has uh has always been i think born in one part confidence and one part in security the confidence at times was i would see other people who either had more materially or stability so you know people that came from like a nuclear family or people that had wealth or people that traveled to fancy places or people that had cars and things that i materially did not have and i would look at them and say wait a second they're not smart or they're not smarter than me and so competitively believing in a system that was meritocratic um you know that i should that the smartest people should succeed or do better that you should get more points you get higher grades that kind of stuff so i think i think part of me has always been hyper competitive in being confident that relative to certain other people i felt i was more intelligent and so i had a sort of chip on my shoulder from that and just not being born into wealth and then the other piece of that which is sort of a toxic combination if in the wrong hands and i think a productive one if in the right hands is you need confidence to be able to believe in yourself and go and do something and persuade other people you know that you can go do something but you also need insecurity and so there's a ton of stuff that i was insecure about whether i was short or familiar situation or not having money like those same things that i was confident about intrinsic ability relative to other people i was also insecure about and so that to me was one blueprint that just sort of motivated me now in terms of like map of reality you know i don't know the first 20 years of your life more or less you're being indoctrinated by everything that you're learning and then i think it was probably around 13 that i questioned uh you know i basically took my bromance prominent money and ran i was raised jewish but i'm atheist and none of that stuff made sense that gave me the confidence to basically just start questioning authority of all kind and i was never a kid that was like questioning legal authority or getting into trouble but just i would look at things and say why is that the way that it is and uh and just sort of questioned everything today's episode is brought to you by element a tasty electrolyte drink mix with everything you need and nothing you don't that means lots of salt with no sugar it contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio 1000mg sodium 200 milligrams potassium and 60 milligrams of magnesium but none of the junk no sugar no coloring no artificial ingredients no gluten no fillers no bs i absolutely love it and how it's fit into my lifestyle whether you're keto low carb paleo or just want to feel better and more active element is the drink for you i drink it after an intense workout to replenish my electrolytes i also drink it after a few too many whiskeys late at night it totally helps with the hangovers when you sweat the primary electrolyte lost is sodium athletes can lose up to seven grams per day when sodium is not replaced it's common to experience muscle cramps and fatigue the same goes for after a big night out drinking element will fit into your lifestyle no matter who you are right now element is offering my listeners a free sample pack with any order that's eight single

head over to fundrise.com room again that's f u n d r i s e dot com slash room to get started today so that to me was always not presupposing you know as some people talk about like a chesterton fence like sometimes something is there for a good logical reason you just don't know that reason but many times things are there just for ridiculous reasons and i'm always fond of the story of tradition where a guy and a girl are dating they end up getting married years go by every time thanksgiving comes she cuts the two ends off the turkey and he comes to her and says why does why do you do that she says well my mother did it and it was tradition and her mother before her well next year you know he gets to meet the parents and he asks the mother why did you do that she says was because of tradition you know what and then the grandmother the next year and then the great grandmother miraculously still alive and then she is queried why did you do why do you guys do this right and she's just matter-of-factly says it wouldn't fit in the pan and so something that once made sense you know three generations ago for like an arbitrary or very specific reason then just gets passed down for tradition just like in religion you have you know kosher laws and eating shibboleths and all these kinds of things that you know today that back then would have saved you from trichonosis and today make no sense so i started just questioning things which i think for me was then an embrace of science because science is not you know contra religion other than being contra dogma but a scientific world view is basically trying to come up with better explanations and at best they can be tentatively held until a better explanation yet further comes along and so part of that is a is that similar mix right of arrogance that you can know better than the other people but also this humility that somebody else is going to come and disprove that and so um that has always been sort of a pursuit and then that led me that one is so interesting sorry to sorry to interrupt you that one is such an interesting one that i think about a lot because there are things in every era of history that are scientific truths quote unquote or truths societal truths maybe more so than scientific truths but scientific as well like if you think back to you know galileo or copernicus being ostracized like there are things that um we are hilariously wrong about in every point in in history and so i often think about that i had a discussion i think recently with tim urban from the wait but why writer who's amazing about this exact thing of like what are we hilariously wrong about today that we're ostracizing people that are saying the other side of um but it's interest the way you frame it and the way you talked about that of um constantly adapting constantly changing and you know kind of thinking like what are those things uh in real time and being you know having the humility around it in real time is a is a really interesting pursuit but remember just like being an election it is not just humility it's also arrogance right it's arrogance to say like those people are idiots like i can't believe that they believe that thing like there has to be you know better and so you know i posted something on twitter uh of past few days that i was just like absolutely obsessed with and it was one of these things like my god you know we're i don't know you know [Music] many millennia into humanity and we don't understand why we dream i mean endless fictions have been written about it beautiful prose wonderful movies um incredible art uh you know lots of scientific speculations and there's like five main theories but there's this fascinating paper that basically came from observing deep neural nets and saying wait a second these deep neural nets that train on a narrow segment you know like looking at a picture of a cat all day have a problem generalizing because they just narrowly train on that one thing and so researchers end up introducing noise purposefully intentionally into the training set so that they can generalize and then this researcher was basically hypothesizing well what if that's the evolutionary purpose of dreaming you are receiving stimulus all day from your senses you store that as memories and if you narrowly learned what you just experienced then you would be less adaptive than somebody that had noise injected and so what a just you know amazing hypothesis i mean obviously you know it's still sort of a rudyard kipling just so story but um yeah so i'm i'm constantly just sort of insatiably curious about pretty much everything which is you know a manifestation of lux itself is looking at all of these different disparate fields post facto we can often find this you know nice connective narrative thread but it's what i call randomness and optionality so randomness and optionality is another so you know this mix of being insecure and being intellectually arrogant and then this idea of randomness and optionality is absolutely part of the sort of map of reality which is again a mix of humility and confidence that i have no idea like what the next thing that i'm going to receive from somebody that's going to you know spark some intrigue or interest what random person i will bump into i always loved an excerpt from the david geffen book the operator where he's talking about a met erdogan who was sort of his mentor and he's walking uh in his office and he says david sit down and they sit down from a you know across from each other and then ahmet just starts to walk very slowly to geffen and he repeats this like three or four times and kevin's like what are you doing and he's like i'm trying to saliently make a point to you that you should walk slow because you never know who you will bump into that will change your life and like the history of david geffen's life was like meeting all of these incredible artists but many of those things post facto you know we're totally random this is the same thing for us in in venture capital and entrepreneurs you never know well i met i mean it's the uh i i call it engineered serendipity but that same concept of like uh engineering environments and situations where lucky things quote unquote lucky things can happen and like in that case you know it's walking slowly because you never know who you're going to bump into but there's you know a thousand ways that you can do that like rather than sitting on the couch at home one night go out and you know go to the event that you were not gonna go to and you might meet five people and maybe you end up talking about something with one of them that changes your life you don't know and you wouldn't know if you didn't go into it um the dream thing you said is fascinating so the dream state uh hypothesis i think is so fascinating because more broadly it just makes sense right that like it's sort of the whole idea of like taleb's idea of anti-fragility uh you like inject chaos like if humans are kind of pro-entropic uh you know in our ability to benefit from chaos like that injection of chaos in the form of noise uh intellectual noise whatever it might be is beneficial to your ability to adapt and become more adaptable during your waking state it's such an interesting theory of uh yeah i mean that's why we do that the person that is walking on constant straight you know um unfettered ground is at a disadvantage from the person who's walking you know on cracks and uneven you know surfaces and and so you've injected some randomness in you know a path instead of just walking on a city street you know if you can find the quote unquote off the beaten path then you will arguably be neuromuscularly more adaptive when you encounter that kind of you know surprise and so yes the same thing intellectually uh where uh you know if you're narrowly training on one thing and then you wake up the next day and the brain has uh again maybe it's engineered serendipity but uh has injected noise it would make sense that biologically that was actually uh adaptive for organisms that could do that whereas the ones that didn't have that you know just narrowly trained and then there was an outlier stimulus or situation in the real world those people perished so um provocative hypothesis they they they the guy calls it it's eric hoel he calls it the overfitting brain hypothesis which is um uh in data science and machine learning or statistics just the phenomenon of overfitting to a data series and um hewing too perfectly to it i think about it a lot in the context of like i write about and think about cognitive biases a lot i know it's something that you think about i've seen you write about it in different investor letters in the past um and i think about it in the context of like context switching over millennia or over hundreds of years because you know a lot of the cognitive biases that we have today that we bemoan were evolutionarily highly effective like i think about fundamental attribution error as a big one like we we cut ourselves a break and hold others to the fire that was probably a good thing that kept you alive like if someone did something that was kind of an [ __ ] move and then you were like hey you're an [ __ ] i'm never going to talk to you again or go near you or and just completely avoid you probably kept you alive in certain instances because maybe on the off chance that person was thinking about killing you you would have avoided them and now in a workplace if someone does something like that and you act that way it's actually not a great thing to do on the first instance and so i you know i often think about it because several of the you know a lot of the cognitive biases we have were evolutionarily quite effective in a different era and now will hold you back from you know achieving things or uh getting different places meeting people maybe you you know you kind of slow down your progress in a lot of ways and so that context switching and being able to adapt over shorter periods of time than our evolutionary uh you know ability to adapt works is actually quite interesting well that is that is correct and everything from you know fear in our ancestral environment to fear today you know the things that the stress in our ancestral environment stress today you know there's a wonderful book um you may have read but robert zepolsky why zebras don't get ulcers and the basic premise of sapolsky was really a primatologist was studying the stress response and the hormone response in chimpanzees and bonobos and ultimate humans and uh we get stressed about you know i've got this deadline i have to write this you know i got to record this podcast i've got this company that might be failing uh you know i'm gonna lose this deal to a competitor whatever it is like those modern stresses like our ancestors would have been like wait you're freaking out about what like i don't have food or my god like a tiger is chasing me or lion is chasing me and many of those things that kahneman has um uh cataloged and you know colloquially we know is like type 1 or type 2 errors and you know you think about if you heard as led zeppelin would have said you know bustle in your hedgerow you know it was adaptive to get alarmed now right and not to sit and think and ponder and be reflective because if you sat and thought when there was a bustle in the bushes you got eaten by the tiger and so uh yeah you know the things that you were talking about too about uh you know if somebody cheated you in our ancestral environment uh you know you go to like a dunbar's number of i don't know 150 people you had a smaller group of people and so it was more effective to punish a cheater and they would be publicly ostracized you know from a small group today you know a cheater can go and just you know find a different tribe the mobility is much greater it's not as effective similarly evolutionarily like you know bludgeoning somebody if they you know uh went after your mate was effective you know we have this new invention called civilization you know with societies and laws that are meant to uh bring out you know the better angels of our nature and suppress the sort of innate savageness that we have yeah absolutely absolutely so much to unpack there too um i do want to go back to something you said at the very beginning um one of the quotes that i think i've seen you tweet about write about in the past and say is this idea of like chips on shoulders put chips in pockets and you talked about it at the very beginning how growing up you had this chip on your shoulder whether it was about you know being short or not coming from money or whatever it was you kind of used that and you used that insecurity as fuel to motivate you to go and build did that play out like as you go went to start lux which i i want to talk about and you know what you've built today uh did that continue to play out in your life because at that point you had clearly achieved quite a bit you know you had gone to school you had started to you know have the early signs of being a successful person quote unquote did you feel that same energy and that same insecurity when you were starting and building lux in the early years yes and and by the way uh you know we've achieved a lot more success i've made a lot more money i my reputation has grown and i still have that same insecurity and drive and so uh this is something by the way that i feel very strongly about that society benefits from everybody being plagued by these kinds of things because it leads to human progress and you know woe to the bay area you know uh adherent to mindfulness and meditation you know to find calm and peace like we don't get peace from progress you need tons of disaffected individuals that are like super bitter with something to prove and so it's good for the individual it's not good for society to find you know your breath and meditate and be peaceful and be stoic um one of the big chips for me was broken family my parents split when i was two and a half my father was sort of the inverse of everything that i as a husband and father saw to be i wanted a big nuclear family i was an only child my mother and i moved in with my grandparents in coney island brooklyn my grandma was a meter maid and my grandpa was a um a night delivery man for the daily news my mother was a public school teacher teaching special ed and so the uh four of us lived in a you know one and a half i mean two-bedroom uh uh apartment with one bathroom and i you know it was it was a loud household everybody's screaming and yelling at each other there was a lot of debate a lot of um just uh but also very high expectations for me to do well and i was that was probably the luckiest thing in my life is i had a mother and a grandmother in particular who just absolutely smothered me with love and had very high expectations but i grew up very bitter and envious of other people around me i grew up bitter of people that had nuclear families i resented the absence of my dad um and so yeah i mean one of the proudest moments i would later sort of rekindle a relationship with my father that is a little bit to this day just antiseptic and cold and controlled by my choosing but i remember he telling me that he had met somebody and that person was like oh are you joshua's dad you know and that reframing of his identity relative to mine was like such a a win for me um and so yeah that that idea of chips on shoulders put chips and pockets i could see very early on like my highest performing peers my the people that i admire the most even the most famous people like when you look at you know larry ellison steve jobs elon musk oprah like they all came from backgrounds you really wouldn't want to wish on like your worst enemy like we celebrate these people in part because of their successes but their actual process versus those outcomes you know i mean oprah was raped lost a brother to aids like just horrific most of the others were adopted uh or had abusive you know parents that they were trying to escape um and so if you are you know the only minority kid in a mostly homogeneous white neighborhood if you are the obese you know kid in a friday night lights you know texas town um if you are you know the gay kid in a in a mostly religious you know community whatever it is where you feel like ostracized that is real physical not just psychological but physical pain and either you get fortunate that you find a mentor or somebody that is an escape valve or a group of people that might be similar disaffected uh similarly disaffected or you know they're sort of misfits and outcasts and that oftentimes give people the permission to continue to be these outsiders and embrace that identity sometimes you know it goes deviant and really negative and sometimes it has this fuel that i just have found in those people it never gets put out and that fuel is basically i'll show them it is looking at the people that are in the masses or the mainstream or the popular kids and basically just saying like i will show them it's it's it started you know i mean it started forever ago but in modern times it was steve jobs and bill gates it was the revenge of the nerds you know it was the rise of the technology guy as a uh as a hero and and i always think like the underdog is always the most interesting to root for i mean literally like i'm a new yorker through and through right like i joke like new york for life is like tatted on my on my stomach and i love the nets and i like the knicks and i'll root for all the teams but like you bring me to a game whoever is the underdog in every situation is who i'm rooting for and so it's the same thing like i love the the odds of the entrepreneur who just it's it's completely improbable the incumbent has all the resources they got all their reputation they got all the attention they got the best people and then somebody comes along and is like this thing sucks i'm gonna do it a better way which is arrogance of the highest order and i want to root for her him that's doing that and so i just love that ethos and i have found that those people no matter how much money they make no matter how much reputation they get that fire never goes away and and sometimes they lead productive lives and have good families it's what i hope i'm doing and other times you know society like i mean look at steve jobs i used to have this debate with one of my best friends like steve jobs is celebrated by all of these strangers but hated by the people that loved that were supposed to you know he was supposed to love the most and so there's these weird paradoxes in that um and i want to be loved by the people you know that i love the most um but i'm also you know petty and vainglorious and jealous and competitively motivated and i want to be celebrated by other people reputationally you're a human all of those things that you just said i mean so what actually motivates you you know you mentioned you're an atheist um i'm always deeply fascinated by people that are uh incredibly high achievers uh you know hard-working driven um post-economic in a lot of ways right like you don't need more money i mean you could i don't i don't know how much money you've made but i'm sure you could go live out the rest of your life and be fine um on a on a global scale for sure um so what motivates you on a daily basis like is it continuing to prove people wrong and go build the most amazing you know investment franchise in the world like what is it that actually gets you out of bed and gets you energized so materially it's interesting because i've never been into cars i've never been into watches i've never been to boats or houses money matters because it gives you freedom and so you know probably for me you know just being able to go wherever you want wherever you you know whenever you want and um and and and provide for your family in a significant way there's a paradox of that is which is you want your kids to have the same sort of grit and scrappiness and i i don't know right people ask like how are you i don't know if we're doing it right um there are people that lie to their kids about money there are people that are straightforward about it we've generally been very honest about a lot with our kids lauren and i don't always agree on on on that but you know we talk about death and sex and money and um and so anyway the things that that drive me are more ideas and so i'm very intellectually competitive when i find somebody else that like knows something that i don't know i either want to be that person's partner or i want to beat them and so it's a little bit psychotic but i just psychotically competitive in anything like you play chess you know we race we play basketball like whatever it is like i want to beat you and and or i want to respect you because i admire like there's no way i can beat you and so i i really like just people that are driven by excellence and competitiveness um here we don't play to play like we're not doing this for charity the the scoreboard here is results for our lps but we are playing to win and so playing to win means that we are the partner of choice beating out another firm to lead a company's round it means um that you know we have a target to recruit a particular woman as ceo and we land her uh you know to get this particular board member to join to win a particular deal to open a door whatever it is like you know you're basically trying to fight somebody from saying no to you and so you know being being influential to me is a is a driver being able to pick up the phone and access somebody and make a call and and and for them to say yes um and then the most important for me which didn't exist when i was younger because i didn't have them and didn't know i could intellectualize all i want but it's my kids and i want them to be proud of me i see the antithesis i see people whose parents are financially successful and the kids resent them want nothing to do with them don't want to follow in their footsteps it is just like utter pride and joy when um you know our kids are like you know i mean i'll give you an example in my middle was like so we got two girls and a son and my middle was like that i want to do what you do because she's very stem oriented good time on task totally into engineering she's like you know i love biology and robotics and we make stuff on 3d printers and uh and then a few weeks ago she actually came to me she said you know dad i i thought i wanted to do what you did but um you know i was talking to mom and it took you almost 20 years to make 4 billion i'm like no no i didn't make four billion dollars we managed four billion and she's like but it only took mom like two and a half or three years to make three billion i'm like no no she okay she learned about leverage yeah so so she she thinks mom's more successful right now and and so she wants to do what mom's doing but um but just making the kids proud um i love and it's actually a lens that i look through when we fund companies is this something that is going to make the history books is this something that somebody's going to look at and be like my dad funded that my dad put that guy or girl in business like that to me feels just super meaningful so you know the three things you could really make you can make money and that can lead to gratifying things if you spend it wisely whether it's philanthropic i started a school in coney island where i came from driven by some personal principles wanting to root for the underdog and make them competitive against the kids that were born in greenwich connecticut with a leg up wow and you can make money you can make meaning and you can make memories and the memories piece for my kid is you know adds to the second one which is meaning and then funding people that are literally inventing the future and coming up with the craziest [ __ ] that you can imagine is super meaningful so i want to get into that last point because you guys are doing something so ambitious i mean as an investment fund doing something that just looks so different and ambitious relative to most i mean when i think of venture capital and i assume most people that are listening to this when they think of venture capital they think of people like you know funding software companies and and sort of like you know when you think of atoms and bits funding the bits um all of these you know technology startups etc when you look at the lux portfolio you see this unbelievable array of like seemingly ridiculous things uh you know like a sale drone like a massive drone sailboat uh all of these incredible space related companies i mean it is truly remarkable i would highly recommend people go check out luxcapital.com and go to the companies tab and just go tick through it but it is this amazing physical infrastructure big swing unbelievable things in the atoms world what inspired that focus has it been a deliberate focus and what is getting you most excited to be investing in the world of atoms so historically it started with that same competitive spirit looking what everybody else was looking at and when we started lux it was coming off of the last well you know 20 years ago now um dot com boom bust which was you know opticalnetworking.com and um nobody was really physically funding the physical and material sciences so i was like look the two areas that actually 20 years ago intrigued me the most were artificial intelligence and then conception this was pre-cuda pre-nvidia pre-gpus pre-deep neural nets pre anything that would you know lead to insights for novel researchers on dreaming and and nanotech and nanotech was interesting because that was my first purview of really being able to delineate between the doers and the bluffers there was a whole cohort of people in nanotech that were like these sci-fi fringe people these extropians and um i mean they just like the stuff that they were talking about was like out of science fiction but it just didn't obey the laws of physics but at the same meetings you would have people who were like nobel prize winner rick smalley from rice university who discovered the bucky ball the fullerene carbon nanotubes and these people were just like way more scientifically credible and what was interesting at the time back then was they were chemists material scientists physicists biologists and they started to rename what they were doing nanotech because it was getting money from the government and so i remember writing this piece a little bit cynically for forbes again almost 20 years ago that you know a nano rose by any other name still arose but that became the nomenclature and it led us into this field where there's these incredible serious scientists distinct from the bs people that are like speculating about the future which are important and they were actually at the same meeting but you don't want to fund these people and you do want to fund these when these people were at the intersection of disciplines they were computer scientists that were doing uh in silico modeling so using a computer to model new materials so that you could actually then produce it you know on a on a on a wet bench and then during that process interestingly i met a guy larry bach and larry had a tremendous impact and it's like one of these things like i don't know like if there was a different person that i would have met that that um you know could have shaped me i can't run the counter factual but larry was a serial entrepreneur he was employee number 50 at genentech he mostly focused on biotech through most of his career but then ended up founding a company called illumina which we now know is the prominent gene sequencer illumina was not focused on gene sequencing when they first started they were doing like chemical sensing and other kind of random stuff that was the intersection of like microfluidics that were based on a microchip and biotech and and then ultimately genetics and that synthesis at the intersection of disciplines was something that larry was interested in because other people weren't and so larry had founded this company nanosis and uh he had gone to all these universities and government labs he had unlicensed intellectual property from mit harvard berkeley and elsewhere and he and i were both on the circuit speaking at the same conferences and he was super credible as people would later describe him he was this mensch on a mission he was probably 10 or 12 years older than me maybe maybe a bit more and i just admired him and then i met his family and i saw how he lived and this was a guy who had made hundreds of millions of dollars and had founded 17 companies from scratch taken 14 of them public cumulative market cap over 50 billion dollars illumina pharmacopia uh ida and athena neurocrine just incredible and had the credibility and he was a complete prankster and and jokester and just like had the best sense of humor in the world wife and two daughters um and i just admired the way that they lived it was humble like you'd meet him you'd be like this guy made that amount of money and did all these things it was just a wonderful character huge inspiration for us at lux in doing company creation and looking where other people weren't looking and so larry gave us a little bit of gravitas and credibility because people had no idea who we were um when we went out to fundraise i always joke that we went after friends and family money and you know we had a reasonable amount of family and a bunch of friends none of them had any money i went and met a guy bill conway and bill was one of the three founders the carlyle group and it was luckiest day of my life and again don't know the circumstances of his proceeding 24 hours whatever influenced him you know good meal good news whatever meet him and he's like i hope you make a billion and you know to this day he is our patron saying i just saw him here at lux last week he's just an absolutely incredible guy he really invested the money he was like the chief investment officer for carlisle dave rubenstein the more famous one who raised all the money and bill asked us the two most important questions why should you exist why does the world need an incremental venture fund and what's going to be your competitive advantage and and we spent a lot of time thinking about that ended up you know building the firm really based on answering those questions and in that process met this other guy larry bach that i was just describing and those two men just played an absolutely critical role and and both uh larry sadly maybe seven years ago passed away uh from cancer but both i think of every day i i literally think again i'm not a religious but in the same way that people say like what would jesus do like i think what would bill do and he's a deeply religious guy and his ethics and morals in it never mattered what the deal doc said like he just he did the right thing and i've never met anybody that has not said like bill what an incredible guy same thing for larry i've never met anybody that was like that guy's an [ __ ] everybody thought this was a guy that was a mensch on a mission um i don't have that personality innate because i'm competitive or because i you know have this these insecurities with the chip on my shoulder like there are a lot of people that are like that guy sucks like i hate him uh and thankfully i've got a partnership that is more you know balancing for me but but i just admired both of them immensely and um and that's what set us on this on this path to go after some of these crazy areas that nobody else was and and to have the conviction that you know funding these crazy scientists that had real work that other people weren't looking at if we were right could be really successful if you're anything like me your portfolio is a mix of the usual suspects stocks bonds and mutual funds maybe you've even dabbled

talked to elon musk he might not like you uh but uh but other than him i've never heard anyone say a negative thing about you um and no i mean i think i have learned an immense amount from you from just being around you a little bit and reading your work so i i thank you on behalf of of everyone who has had a similar experience to me um you know one of the things that i've seen jump out recently from your work you know as an extension of what we were just talking about and some of your big bold bets for the future is this whole idea of nuclear energy and the future and where energy creation is going and you hit on something that isn't is a really uh good lead-in to that point which was the nanotechnology point where you kind of talked about how it became a branding thing like nano became this positive branding thing that all of a sudden accelerated uh capital coming into that space and i think about it now in the context of what you've been referring to as elemental energy elemental power uh and this rebranding that needs to take place around nuclear so can we talk a little bit about that and what is getting you excited about that space and the potential for a rebrand to accelerate it you know this goes back credit to um two two guys mark mills and peter huber they wrote a book called bottomless well and mark is a friend peterson's past peter was a polymath i mean just brilliant um lawyer scientist engineer i mean super like rare individual not a lot of people like this exist today mark uh lives on and and just came out with a new book i think all the crowd wrote cloud revolution but they wrote this book i want to say 0.607 or thereabouts maybe 08. um and the bottomless well and it was at a time when oil prices were rising and they were basically making this point that um energy was abundant and uh and it was and also at a time when al gore's movie had come out and everybody was talking about you know climate change and that we need to get off fossil fuels and they were sort of taking the julian simon uh paul ehrlich bet and they were taking the simon end of that and as you know and others know you know the basic bet here was that there is one inexhaustible resource and that is human ingenuity and that in the presence of problems people and more so than ever today because we're interconnected and we can have both adversarial collaborations and we can amplify good ideas and suppress bad ones particularly in institutions that support that construct like science um that that you had this bottomless well uh and that people would figure it out and when they looked at the physics of energy density you know you had lots of famous people that were talking about building fields of fuel where you would have biofuels you know to replace um fossil fuels in liquid fuels you had people that were talking about um uh solar you know having large farms of solar energy but the the densest form of energy just looking at the simple physics of this was nuclear and so i got enamored with nuclear in part because this was the signal where everybody else was talking about you know solar wind biofuels ethanol batteries electric cars which mattered but the the thing that i heard sort of like the sherlock holmes you know the curious incident and the dog in the night the thing that nobody else heard was uh was nuclear and so the absence of people talking about it you know john doerr was giving his famous ted speeches vinod khosla was writing op-eds and these were like famous venture capitalists uh garnishing you know huge amounts of money behind their reputation and none were talking about nuclear so then i i dug in and i started looking at every part of the fuel cycle we started with uranium miners mostly we found were hucksters and fraudsters in new mexico and nevada we then looked at modular reactors great idea for society i mean instead of a gigawatt power plant that might cost you a billion dollars to serve a million people you could have you know 30 30 megawatt plants uh each you know smaller and built out and we already have modular reactors there's 104 navy nuclear subs that are going around with with small modular navy nuclear reactors then we decided that that was not going to make sense because it was going to take too much money too much regulatory risk you had this weird chicken in the egg problem that in order to get the nrc the nuclear regulatory commission to actually say yes to a reactor you need to have a sponsor but to get a sponsor you needed pretty high assurance that the regulatory commission was actually going to say yes so we thought that's probably best for sovereigns or billionaires but um you know you got all these existing reactors then we said what about the waste everybody's complaining about the waste and that is another prime you know going to your sort of models of reality like i look around all the time and i listen very carefully for like what sucks what is the thing that people are complaining about and uh and people were complaining about um about what you do with the waste and it turns out that there's two kinds of waste there's um uh low-level waste which is uh inside of the nuclear power plants and there's 104 domestic reactors just like our nuclear subfleet and there's 440 globally and then there's all this pre and post cold war bomb making waste from uh uh places like hanford savannah river idaho national labs in the u.s cellar field in the uk lahog italy as well and so i ended up looking around for a high-tech company to fund couldn't find one we ended up creating one from scratch we named it carry on after madame curie in licensed intellectual property from universities to some government labs and then hired a team amazingly there was this massive labor arbitrage in nuclear everybody was like over 60 and not entrepreneurial at all and the super young smart people all went to d shaw and you know two sigma and renaissance and the quan chops i was able to field the team that was under 60 but in fairness they were like 56-57 they were not you know that that young it was close and uh we we put a total of three million dollars of invested capital a million and a half from the fund a million i have from a few of our lps in a fund that was um a hundred million dollar fund it was our second venture fund uh we also took founder stock because we uh conceived of this it was a brain fart here in our new york office and uh you know hired the first 20 people populated the board the advisors and licensed the technology did all the company building work and then you know things were going good it would have been a great business but then all of a sudden march 11 2011 you know just uh 11 years ago earthquake tsunami fukushima disaster like three weeks later i'm on the upper west side of manhattan and uh the ceos like i'm flying to tokyo their the tepco government uh japanese government and tepco which is the authority overseeing the fukushima disaster saw our technology and um and wants to buy it and anyway we end up going from a million in revenue to 40 80 120 160 uh 40 million of a dollar we sold that for 10 times ebitda to uh violia just an amazing experience of truly matter that matters i mean this thing that was just conceived in our new york office ended up removing 99 of the radiation from the fukushima disaster particularly around cesium and strontium and it's crazy the technology without going into it between material science and isotope separation and robots and chemistry and it's just absolutely wild we we had a giant sci-fi [ __ ] it is unbelievable we had to spend a million dollars a day just to rent uh a giant ukrainian airplane many of which have actually been blown up during this current war oh gosh by russia that um we're shipping our our crazy engineer systems over there anyway uh that was very gratifying and so i really was just absolutely obsessed with nuclear and in particular what i studied was that in 1979 you had three mile island in the u.s this was a disaster you know little d disaster versus chernobyl in the 80s which was a certifiable disaster uh there was no radiation leak there was nobody that died in three mile island but two things happened number one there was a movie called the china syndrome in 1979 that came out movies are very powerful for influencing people and it negatively influenced people against nuclear the third thing that happened was a no nukes concert in 1979 which was really important because they were really protesting nuclear war i want to protest nuclear war nuclear war is terrible nuclear power is amazing and so you had you know joni mitchell and james taylor and all of these like post woodstock you know folk singers that my mom grew up on or made me listen to and and they were all protesting nuclear and it just got conflated nuclear war nuclear power the environmentalist movement roves up in part because there were no nukes and um and it just you know this has persisted now for for 40 years and so i started looking at this and i'm like seeing all these people that are well intentioned that are funding new reactor designs and new technology and i'm like you know it's not really so much even a technology or an engineering problem it's not we have hundreds of reactors that are working globally and we have decades of safety experience and know-how and even though you have an aging workforce there's just like tremendous talent what we have is a pr problem and so i was just kicking around and i'm like you know what it's it's literally elemental energy like you're talking about an element in this case uranium that you enrich zero carbon you use it to heat water the water produces steam steam terms of turbine the turbine spins and you get electricity elements are also you know uh the sun solar wind wind uh water hydro uh so the environmentalists should love that and so if i could put nuclear in this tent and rebrand the entire thing you know elemental energy element power maybe you get this uptick and and it seems to have been taken off last week the washington post had a feature piece on it and so if your name made you a new friend in jeff bezos too i saw that he followed you on twitter that was great help help spread the word you know elemental energy uh there it is i mean it's a fascinating case study of like storytelling in action right like a story perpetuates so much more than the reality and with nuclear i mean it's just people as soon as they hear nuclear they think about mushroom clouds and they think about chernobyl and they think about disasters they don't think about the potential for you know small amounts of water to literally provide the energy an energy source for the entire country um and they don't think about the potential for this to completely transform how we think about the survival of humanity over the next you know several centuries or millennia right if elemental energy or nuclear power were discovered today people would be running around being like oh my god this is magic this is the most incredible thing it would be on every it would be you know times person of the year would be the atom uh i mean it would just be the most magical thing and you are correct that if you have cheap electricity unlike the de-growth people that want to send us into the dark ages the cheaper your electricity the more power you have you can desalinate water you could have abundant water you could have abundant crops in agriculture but it all starts with how do we get clean abundant energy and to me the answer is elemental power formerly known as nuclear and it's interesting too when you just think about um you know geopolitically as well that the impact that this might have if you know if one country uh you know and honestly the u.s like if the us is continues to be obstinate about this we will literally fall behind the rest of the world and you will see the global order dramatically shift like if china decides to be really proactive if india decides to be really proactive if other large global powers decide to be proactive about this and progressive about it and the us gets held back by you know nimbyism and and whatnot there will be a massive shift in the geopolitical order in the next really i mean 10 15 20 years well it already has happened and so china is building dozens of nuclear power plants they're also building despite their jaw boning on green enormous numbers of coal plants but they are focused on how do we get low-cost energy for our people they're also looking into you know pakistan and other regions where they're basically making sure that they capture hydro uh but the geopolitical order did get reshaped in part because you had germany which was one of the few nuclear powers alongside france you had the rise of the german uh green party over the past 15 years if you were putin the smartest thing that you could do the lowest cost highest leverage thing that you could do to deliver europe to you who controls an enormous amount of gas for the world as a major exporter particularly to you europe providing over 25 percent of their electricity needs is just get the green party to shut down nuclear and that's literally what they did you had an engineer's chancellor in merkel and the political opposition to nuclear grew and grew and was fomented let's say it was mostly organic and mostly domestic with a tinge of foreign information operations to foment it that's all you had to do in germany start shutting down their nuclear power plants the first thing they did was import electricity from france but the next thing they did was become dependent on russian gas and so the geopolitical order has changed in part because of the aversion to nuclear and i hope that people wake up to this and quickly yeah and it was immediately after fukushima right germany made some pretty dramatic decisions immediately after that they basically fell victim to this you know pr event rather than continuing to think about the science behind it so it is it is pretty shocking um well one of the things that um i want to talk about before i before i kind of wrap my time with you is is your willingness to um be vocal about things that you you believe in uh elemental power has been one of those you know you've been very vocal um you know the the crisis in ukraine and the war and and russia's involvement etc you've been vocal the other one which is very top of mind right now is elon musk and uh you know his recent kind of foray and do buying twitter and involvement in the social world it kind of merges several things that i've seen you talk about at length one being like the jonathan hate article um about the kind of downfall of society over the last 10 years and social media's influence in that and the other one being you know elon musk and his uh i don't know what you would call it all you know his capital raising efficiency and um you know his ability to weave really powerful stories in that in that vein so would love to just hear you um speak a little bit on how this all comes together in your mind why you're worried about or not worried about elon musk's involvement with with twitter with free speech and your general perspectives on that let me say elon on the whole is a net positive there's no debate that pushing forward electric vehicles and beating the incumbents i mean literally a chip on his shoulder um is a net positive for the world and it will force all the other brands and all the oems to play catch up and they all whether they end up beating him in the end or competing with him in the end or not yeah that will drive the world forward so net positive uh spacex absolute net positive i mean returning the ability for launch capability to the u.s particularly with what we see now with russia a net positive so one would say what's my quibble and the quibble is with his relationship with the truth and i look at gates and i look at bezos both of whom i admire for different reasons bezos in particular who i consider one of the greatest and most rational capital allocators the amount of capital that he raised in an initial ipo you could add stock-based compensation into the mix to say another source of capital early debt um that you know today is a fraction of what it was this is somebody who compounded enormous amounts of internally generated capital and earned incremental returns on that incremental invested capital that are truly worthy of studying as a business so if you are a business student if you're a student of businesses to look at what amazon has done is just absolutely incredible in the way that you would study many of the other you know classic operators or the outsiders like john malone or buffett people that have compounded capital and rationally allocated i think deserve to be admired elon has not done that and people believe that elon has and so part of my frustration is the same way that you might see incredible wealth from a sunday preacher and i always rail against this but you know joel osteen and ted haggard and all of these sort of mega church preachers they do a service they they provide people a sense of meaning they provide people a following they provide people a sense of community um and they built them from their money okay and so there's just such a and maybe this is growing up in coney island squinty eyed and watching the carnival barkers and you know run their game and con people but i see so many people conned and fleeced and so far it has been working because the stock has been going up but um you know from the solar city shenanigans to full self driving a lot of people say well look you know this is just a guy that exaggerates or has very high standards you know and and uh will hit them it just might take longer and and there's something that to me has a witting misleading of people that he's just been exceptionally good at he's one of the great storytellers he's created an absolute cult following anytime you criticize you know the fanboys come out in mass it's it's in in fact protecting not only him but in many cases their identity as being a fan or associate and um it's really just what i consider to be the mendacity and um it's the same thing when you get frustrated at a politician or you get frustrated as a preacher when you see that otherwise credulous people are innocently being duped i just look at it and i'm like there's no reason you know he could just say hey we're going to lose money for a long period of time we're going to do something hugely important you know uh i need to raise billions if not tens of billions of dollars but it's like the subtle dishonesty over so many years that he just keeps getting away with it that's the part that to me i don't want my kids to celebrate that part the ambitious part absolutely you know the um the high performance or um uh high pressure you know culture of expecting more the chip on the shoulder going up against all of that is wonderful but it's just the honesty piece and and there's other heroes that have been incredible company builders i mean you look at henry singleton intelligent like that should be celebrated and um this sort of cult aspect of it just invokes the sort of um monorail man from the simpsons or sure your sunday preacher and and that's the thing that i just music man i see i see it and it just there's that like hustler huckster piece of it that just rubs me the wrong way yeah i guess the question is i mean you alluded to it at the very beginning the net positive of some of the things um you know with the electrification of vehicles with spacex and what it's done for the space economy um you know all of these different projects he takes on the question i guess i would have in the back of my mind is net of everything assuming you know assuming there is negative intent or there's you know open dishonesty in his own mind around things he's saying is it a net positive in the aggregate behind all of it that you know people are inspired to go take ambitious swings because they see him and the wealthy's accumulated you know an incremental entrepreneur is born uh on the back of his boundless you know kind of excitement and and energy around these things and does that offset the negatives of all that the people who've been screwed over the people who bought doge at a dollar or whatever the hell it went to you know on the back of his pumping around it um that's the question i guess i would and i don't have an answer to it i don't know the answer to a fascinated observer but it's interesting you you can point to you know jobs as well who is renowned for a reality distortion field you know in all kinds of sort of tricks when he would go out on stage for products that maybe weren't fully functional or didn't exist yet we've glamorized that as a society huh i mean ever since jobs like the reality distortion field is a weird thing to glamorize in in a sense well it is you know like even elizabeth holmes but it doesn't exist it doesn't exist in a siloed vacuum it can only exist because of the belief of people and so you know people want to believe in big ambitious things and that's that's a beautiful thing um people wanted to believe that you know this this phone or the capability that jobs are showing off would exist and so um you know people want to believe that we're going to go to mars uh people want to believe that full self-driving is going to exist and so there's a part where he's just selling people what they want to believe and so can you fault him for that and there's just this subtle line between the again the honesty and the humility of just saying like you know we're not there yet but we're going to get there is so different than like this already exists you know send your money and you know i think history will probably show that it's a it's a it's a distinction there you know difference with without a distinction to me it's just a line of like it's like somebody looking at the floorboards when they're telling you you know uh you know you mentioned twitter like the freeze i don't believe that the twitter thing is at all about free speech yeah and it's it's a um it's a line as you said and it's like it's a very very fine line and you could see it if you like find that archetype of personality you can see it cut one of two ways and there's really no middle ground and in the end it falls on one side of the line one way or another so yeah i mean it will be interesting to see the next you know 5 10 15 years how this all plays out i mean i think the twitter thing frankly if i was a tesla shareholder i'd be pissed um because like taking out a twelve and a half million dollar margin loan i mean i spent the first seven years of my career equity it's not fun just announced today that he's looking at other financing packages so that he doesn't have to mortgage as much you know this tesla stake yeah i mean i'm assuming there's a bunch of private equity funds and large institutional investors who would get on board with a uh you know private twitter plan um if it means that they can do you know take bigger swings around monetization and get away from the traditional ad model so maybe something will work out there but man look anything is possible you can believe i don't know what the implied odds right now on the merger or above this was but you know it was down to like 85 percent likelihood that the deal was you know still very high but 15 probability that it wasn't gonna actually happen you know he has sold eight and a half billion dollars of stock this is a wonderful way just like his twitter poll before to sell stock to get out of uh twitter now you could i mean sorry to get out of tesla so again he's a master of diversion right you don't i mean the ledger domain and the magic tricks and the illusion the prestige is it's it's it's it's admirably done if you you know are our student of magicians and illusion like it's it might deserve criticism for the dishonesty it's sort of the difference by the way between pan and teller and david blaine david blaine will actually tell you that what he's doing is real and penn teller will show you with clear cups and balls that they are completely tricking you okay and and i just have more admiration for the pen and teller approach to magic or or the bezos approach to the magic of technology than i do the elon approach so again to me it's a very big distinction uh but but i would watch to see if this deal ends up happening and if it does if you truly care about free speech is the answer really to saddle this company with tens of billions of dollars of debt i just it doesn't make sense i thought that that was the funniest jack dorsey tweeted um something about like uh taking taking twitter back from wall street is a great first step and i thought about reply i didn't want to and i didn't reply i should have and i was like i don't know how i must have missed how like 25 billion dollars of new debt is taking it back from wall street because like i it was over my head if there was who who owns twitter you know actually i mean your point is a really strong one which is the people that own twitter are blackrock fidelity retirement my mom's pension plan you know the united federation teachers like the people that are going to own the syndicated loans are going to be barclays morgan stanley like the bank so you're delivering senior in the capital structure to wall street you know that you're demonizing it with covenants but real covenants but it'll return the light of consciousness yeah yeah absolutely well look i i know we're running up against the end of time i do have to end with um one kind of bigger picture question so you're someone that thinks about the future a lot um give me your like one or two big bold predictions for the future and what what it looks like well i'll tell you the thing that i'm obsessed with and i finally found the team and i hope that i can share more very soon but you know you know i've talked about publicly which is actually a strategy right i throw theses out there the digitization of human scent is coming it's true for shazam for smell shazam for smell the ability to identify a single molecule in a room is coming the ability not only a single molecule that has meaning to you i mean literally a molecule a structure actually conveys to you you know a good smell a rose a wine a food a perfume a cologne and a bad smell right um from i mean you know if you ever ride the new york city subway you know lots of bad smells but um that is coming and i think it's going to the ability to give machines that sense a sense of smell i think is going to be a really big deal so absolute undeniable arrow of progress that that will exist the other thing which i increasingly i'm really inspired by is and and i think i think there will be fierce debates that almost are like keats accusation of scientists unweaving the rainbow i'm in the firm camp that the more we know the more mysteries you unfold you know the more awe we feel um you know when you finish a mystery book you never read it again right but when you learn something about the cosmos or the universe like it just creates more awe and wonder so so i'm firmly in that camp but the area i'm talking about is this intersection alluding to what we were talking about before about dreams and deep neural nets i think we are going to learn more about human consciousness as we interrogate the systems and try to understand how much of the modern approaches in ai are working to sense make models make predictions on those models iterate and learn and i think that it's going to reveal some of the mysteries of consciousness and um and i think that that will unsettle a lot of people because in the same way to learn that dreaming is not this mystical and again not to say to learn is not fair because it's a theory but to have a believable or plausible hypothesis that dreaming is not some you know uh mystical entrance into this other realm of hallucination and you know but but actually something that biologically was adaptive to introduce noise into your daily pattern to make you i mean those are the kinds of things that we're going to start to understand and suddenly be like oh uh the reason we do that you know actually had this evolutionarily adaptive function and for some it will seem you know unromantic and i think for others like me it'll inspire more more awe so well i i am going to sleep very differently tonight after uh after having learned that so i i appreciate so much your time this was fantastic i look forward to getting to do it in person soon um post baby for me um but uh but looking forward to seeing you and you'll see a few more gray hairs on my head by then so thank you congratulations man it's it's the most important thing i think so huge

the government has pulled away the ability for the average people to make a lot of kind different kinds of investments the sec basically blocks all kinds of different uh uh opportunities because they you know they scrutinize everything right so that's why we have the world we live in where institutional money like we see money is access to all these tech companies grows them to tens of billions of dollars of value only then give put them out on the ipo because it's just not worth for these companies to go public anymore [Music] what's up how you doing well you know it took me 20 minutes to log into this because technology decided that it just didn't want to work so i'm good coming in hot uh got my got my summer shirt on here the the tied eye so i'm ready to roll for uh for some warm weather what's uh what's on your mind today what do you want to talk about oh man uh i had a bunch of stuff on my list and we've got a really cool guest coming in to jam on some stuff so i would suggest we just dive right into it there was a bunch of interesting stuff that happened um recently much of which i think is sort of evergreen so i'd love to uh love to jam on some of it um did you first thing on my list did you see this um this whole thing that happened with ross albrecht the uh the silk road guy and this like bitcoin finding i did so for people that don't know who this is ross albrecht um i don't know if i'm pronouncing that right all bridged um he was the founder of silk road um which was for lack of a better way to put it like amazon for illegal stuff um you know it was founded in what 2011 uh it was like you would use the tor like anonymous browser so you could use it anonymously and it was founded with like really kind of libertarian ideals and it was basically the first use case of bitcoin um like in the very early days and it's part of the reason why like bitcoin got a reputation as being a currency for like scammers and fraudsters and you know uh illegal kind of grifters because it was basically being used on silk road to purchase all variety of things the vast majority i think of silk road maybe you saw it way back in the day was like kind of harmless drugs like i think a lot of people were buying weed that i knew like on silk road and other like party drugs but then you know there was it's the internet so there was like dark parts of silk road that were people buying you know all sorts of things guns you know more harmful drugs etc um but you know ross albrecht was the founder of it he was like the jeff bezos of this silk road thing there was a huge bust in 2013 when they found it um and he basically got charged with all variety of crimes despite the fact that it was a platform that he was running right like it kind of the whole case uh basically said that he was um selling these things rather than like operating the platform and he got sentenced to life without parole and it's like this very very controversial case yeah so i remember going on the silk road and just testing it out you know as a good product person i gotta gotta test everything out one of the things i mean there was a bunch of harmless stuff but there was also some crazy things on the silk road so there was like i remember like a whole guide around how to break into an atm machine so that you could buy like you could buy the god it was basically like this guy he was like i've broken into uh many many atm machines and i'm like the guy you know and if you want to be like me all you have to do for the you know low price of one bitcoin uh you can you can do this too if you're anything like me your portfolio is a mix of the usual suspects stocks bonds and mutual funds maybe you've even dabbled in some alternative assets like crypto but those investments can be

at checkout yeah it's like it's um i mean it's funny because like it's like the illegal alternative to like gumroad like that same guy sells that book on gumroad as like an e-book how to break into atm machines but uh you know was doing it there um the crazy thing about the case and there's an amazing book on it if anyone hasn't read it called um american kingpin which i don't know if they've done it yet but it would be an incredible movie because the story of the rise of the silk road and what he was like going through the lengths to try to not get caught because basically like the acceleration of it was like any insane tech company story but it was not venture backed it was just like pure product market fit insanity and the growth and the amount of bitcoin that was flowing through the ecosystem and the amount of money he was making like he was operating under the pseudonymous name dread pirate roberts which was the fictional character from the princess bride um and it was just like i think it astounded him and he probably got completely off guard by it but it was like insane product market fit and product-led growth story um and then basically you know he gets taken down in this bust and it becomes uh you know as part of it right they like kind of indicted him on a bunch of different things one of the things he got indicted for was like six or seven um murders that he allegedly ordered and paid for um none of which were actually carried out but that it was alleged that he um had kind of um solicited murder for hire and he didn't get charged with it ultimately and he didn't get tried for it like they didn't convict him of those things and so his sentencing has been a massive dispute especially for libertarians who argue that like he was running a platform if people were doing illegal things on it not really his fault he should be kind of absolved of that and for people who are like look you can you know say that he did those things but if you didn't get convicted of those things or charged with those things the murders how is he sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for what amounts to like a bunch of um you know kind of like drug trafficking charges effectively so there's this massive crusade that has continued and that a lot of like big tech illuminati type figures are behind to try to free ross um basically the reason it's back in the news which is what i was referencing before is because part of his whole deal was that he had to pay like 193 million dollars of restitution to the us government for like basically they were charging him like a fine for every single transaction that went through the silk road over the years that he operated it and so he owed 193 million dollars so even if he gets released and somehow like the crusade works and he gets out he was going to be 193 million dollars in debt to the us government basically never a free man all of his wages would be garnished etc um now that has changed because the u.s government has like basically secretly signed a deal with him that this one billion dollar uh bounty that they have found from a hack of the silk road they are crediting towards his debts to the us government and so he has now effectively paid back the debts to the us government of 193 million dollars it's uh it's unbelievable uh like i remember reading that and i was like this guy man this guy i mean it's like a completely insane story the fact that it's not a movie yet actually like it's going to be an incredible whoever makes it it's going to be an incredible movie and i think part of it is like people have wanted the story to finish because there's some i think there's like a broad case to be made that um that he will get out at some point um maybe then they will try to charge him with you know the alleged murders and bring him up on that which is a totally separate thing but the whole story is like completely remarkable in the book if no one has read it um the book is incredible american kingpin is what it's called we'll throw it in the show notes so anyway i wanted to start off with that because i think it's a fascinating story it's also ties to like crypto bitcoin um and uh in the early days of actual use cases of all of this let me let me shift gears a little bit with something that's on my mind hit me um so [Music] last week was miami tech week um i live in miami so basically it's this new for those who don't know it's like this new uh holiday tech holiday that delian from founders fund who's a vc basically a year and a half ago i think he he created this and it was like a small event last year this year like it was it was huge like every major fund was was throwing events um it felt very much like a mini south by southwest and what i wanted to talk about and what's been on my mind is a tweet that i saw from a buddy of mine fur khan who said your product doesn't get built at conferences and growth doesn't happen at networking events if you're a founder i highly suggest skipping these events the real work happens at a keyboard and i was reflecting on that a bit because i spend so much like energy just like personal energy talking to people like ubering here ubering there going to this dinner doing this doing that and i definitely agree with him that like i think that for if you're a founder now i'm not saying like if you know if you're a vp sales if you're a director of biz dev if you're like you know chief marketing officer like yes like maybe go to those events but if you're a founder the most i think the most efficient way to spend your time is behind the keyboard what do you think um i go both ways on this right i think it's tough because my general perspective is like i one side of me says that these are the type of things where you end up getting lucky like you go to something like this there's 10 000 people in miami you know half of whom are like very smart interested might be interested in similar things to you you go to these events you mingle new ideas strike insight strikes you meet someone that you wouldn't have otherwise met good things happen and if it's like two three days you cannot build for a couple days like what did you do last weekend you took a day off maybe whatever so that's like one side of me the other side of me says yeah like you know in the early days of something you have to put your damn head down because otherwise um you know you're just not gonna make that early traction in order to get something done i guess my general take kind of putting it all into a blender is like what type of founder are you because i think there are founders who they're not the builder right like they're the salesman and to use the naval thing which is one of my favorite general frameworks around this you either need to learn how to build or you need to learn how to sell and someone that can do both is completely unstoppable and there's like probably a handful of people who can do both at an elite level like a elon musk or like a steve jobs or whatever those are like insanely elite individuals that can build and sell but for the most part people can either do one or the other and so if you're like in the build camp if you're an engineer and you're a builder yeah i agree like you probably should put your head down and be behind the keyboard but if you're a sell type and what you're really exceptional at is selling going to one of these events and like selling the dream of your idea that can be the difference between like having keith reboy you know founders fund meet you see you you know the new investor comes on like a new employee that could be your 10x engineer that you happen to meet there um like if you're out there selling in that environment maybe that's what's actually the best use of your time not sitting behind a keyboard yeah my take on it and you'll get this because i mean we'll both get this we both spent a lot of time on twitter and and blogging and stuff like that my thinking is if i could spend 72 hours behind a keyboard typing an amazing like blog post or email newsletter or epic twitter thread the the like if that goes viral and millions of people see that the it's just way more efficient use of time now i still love going to these events and i love hanging out with like i got this like i treated it as like a vacation you know i mean like i got to i ran into so many amazing friends and it was really fun and and i did hit you know play the slot machine a little bit and i did meet some really cool people um which could be like lifelong friendships which is awesome and good for my business but i still think if i'm looking at it just from an efficiency standpoint um heads down for me is the way to go i think you're probably right i mean i think um and it depends what stage you're at right like you and i aren't in the trenches building something like a product today and so a big part of your job like what you're doing and you know what i'm doing too is being out and so it is like that's probably the most efficient use of our time relative to a builder who's kind of like in the trenches today and they they probably should spend that time doing um you know doing building or creative work or something that's going to reach you know have like a much more scalable reach overall so i don't know i go both ways on it uh but i do think it's a really interesting discussion point i loved i saw the like back and forth on twitter of different people arguing over whether founders should go to these type of events um and i thought it was interesting but like just to say it the web3 space in general i think has skewed too far to the cell and not enough to the build so i think it's like a good call to arms in general to like throw a shot across the bow to the general industry of like you know there's so many of these companies that are raising absurd prices off of no product and it's because they're incredible salesmen and there's like this unbelievable heat around the market um and i think it needs to come back into some level of balance we got val in the waiting room so should we bring uh what is up what's going on guys hey what's going on man all good good to have you yeah man we got the two legends over here three legends man i appreciate you joining you're uh you're crushing it we're excited to have you and uh excited to hear more about your story and um and dive into some hopefully cool ideas yeah absolutely man can you just give us the like one minute version of your background and it doesn't actually have to be one minute but just so like all of our listeners understand why you are um so legit don't give us the humble version either like um i want the real version of some of the [ __ ] that you've done uh so we're live we're live man all right man you're going straight to the point here um well we film we've already been on for like 20 minutes before you uh so we uh we're all like warmed up and ready to roll all right man well i don't even get to see your hair today that's not that's not right you're here for the hair and you don't even get to see it i'll just see over here today oh yeah it looks good but but my greg greg got like starting to get that going on so i don't know man you guys got a nice competition on that front going um yeah man listen i built um i'm a i'm an immigrant came to this country when i was like 11. um and i got my computer only like at 16 years old by that point i already knew everything about computers um and i was just so hungry launched the company uh i just started like doing some stuff and it just kind of took off came across i mean there was like a bunch of steps but i built uh at like 19 i started a company that built uh did google advertising and like i essentially crushed it like just huge arbitrage there all by myself out of my parents basement and then like i lived in a suburbia just like for tax purposes and people thought i was a drug dealer in the neighborhood uh this is one of my favorite stories about you by the way is just like val basically became a whale of like google ad advertising business like you were like the second biggest buyer of adwords or something from your parent's basement yeah basically it was like you and like ebay like you're doing like affiliate like what were you doing yeah i was doing a lot of affiliate stuff um i had like 800 different advertisers that i was marketing um you know i was an affiliate marketer but i had a lot of like like very premium deals a lot of like nice brands uh so i was definitely like on the premium side of affiliate marketing if you could you know so like my clients were like new york times and rhapsody and ebay themselves and um so it was like i did all the good stuff and you know i didn't really do colon cleansers and aside berry stuff you know and all those uh interesting things that were out what your what year was this in um so i started around right after like the dot-com bubble collapse okay so so it wasn't actually google i started with i started back back in the days when we used to be overturned which became goto.com and then was acquired by yahoo which became yahoo search this was so i was big on yahoo first this was an epic so no one talks about this but from 2000 to 2006 was the heyday of affiliate marketing and for those who don't know what affiliate marketing is is it's basically when a brand instead of uh you know going out and doing their own advertising they say hey sahel we'll give you five dollars for every install or lead or or sale that we that you generate and they give you a special sahel code when you when people think of affiliate marketing today they actually think of it as like influencer marketing what was happening from 2000 to 2006 is there were people like you val and i i actually was also involved in in some of this um where we would do arbitrage so we would actually you would go let's just say and do a deal with eharmony.com eharmony.com would pay you five dollars for every lead and you would go and because at the time these big brands were terrible at user acquisition it was completely brand new these people and they call them super affiliates these super affiliates were uh better at marketing than some of these big brands i mean it's completely basically so you were basically um but you didn't know how to do this it's not like you like went to school for this or something you were basically just kind of like hustling in the early days you were like oh yeah i can do it for this price and you'd go you know learn how to do it scale it up and then once you had done it well you were like oh i can scale this up do it with more money do it with more money bigger brands whatever yeah i mean listen i had a [ __ ] like little playstation website and um and uh it started making like 5 000 bucks a month i was in high school which is a lot of money in the 90s um and uh right away.com bubble burst and like i went from making five thousand a month to like 500 a month if that actually that was revenue so i was probably losing it after all the web hosting costs and all that so i started like scrambling to figure out how to sell advertising so i started selling advertising on my own then i realized that like wow i'm actually pretty good like i need more inventory so i start selling advertising on other people's websites and then i start looking for more ways to like scale that up so that's kind of how i came across affiliate marketing because i just grabbed a few like deals from half.com at the time because they would have video games um the video games was a big category there so i was like wow this is actually kind of converting and that led to me testing it on search and i was and then just actually i lost money like i lost 5 000 bucks at 6 000 bucks i think actually the first night i turned it on on goto.com there were no budget caps at the time i go to sleep i wake up i'm negative six thousand dollars and like i only had a thousand dollars in in uh leads so i lost like five g's that that one night right i was like holy cow i think most people will actually say oh my god i'm never doing this again like the stupidest thing ever and i just something just i mean like on the inside i just had that gut feeling wait i made that i got that i brought in a thousand dollars right like i'm too sometimes it's uh like i'm an optimist right so i look at it's like wow i brought in a thousand dollars i didn't think of it like hey i lost six like i lost five thousand right so like i was able to take that thousand bucks uh and then see like just dive into that thousand dollars that um that we were able to get like i was able to generate and uh turn that into a gold mine i mean that that that just what did you end up making over those few years like before you know the market now it's funny right like this market has become hyper efficient now um or at least much more efficient because of how much i mean you were you were sort of like a pioneer right like you were early days so there was massive spreads like you could um you know you could make a ton of money off of doing this now there's like uh so much money across all of this stuff that has flown in and so it's made the market more efficient but like just to give people a sense of the scope you were 19 years old when you started this and built this um out of the basement like what did you end up making off this from a profit standpoint over 30 million out of your out of your parents basement yeah that's so absurd i i remember reading your um you wrote a piece about it which i remember reading i don't know six months ago or something like that that just said that like at your uh at your largest you were google's second largest advertiser as well like operating operating out of your parents basement which is just like that's one of my favorite things ever yeah the funny thing is i only found out because somebody told me from the inside and then um when google had like all these class action lawsuits um and you start i realized how big of a percentage i was of that class action i didn't file it's like somebody always else did all the work um and uh my numbers were pretty big and like that and on that so i was like wow it's uh i didn't realize how big of a chunk of the revenue i was at one point and this is like probably right around right before their ipo uh so they were like already big but not that big yet yeah yeah and you're right listen man the the markets are becoming way more efficient the way i look at it is the windows of opportunities are starting to get shorter and shorter so like you're talking about 2000 2006 whether it's affiliate market or really search like i look at it the more on the search side right that's that was i had like a six nice six year window but after that the you know like display advertising also had a decent uh window but everything after that like facebook i mean it probably got closed in two years right instagram one year like tick-tock it's probably got burned out like within a year right and if you could catch that um lightning bolt right in the in in that short opportunity window window opportunity um you know and you could build up on that that's that's uh that's the that's the magic because you know there are plenty of successful people still on tick tock right you know but a lot of them kind of caught that caught that wave early on when it was a an open opportunity yeah that's really profound because i i think what you're saying is the half-life of marketing channels are getting shorter and shorter especially with all these tools like uh now like when you create a facebook ad uh it's out in the open uh your competitors can go and check your facebook ad and and vice versa you can go and check their facebook ads so i think um i remember well i sound like an old person but i remember when you can buy a facebook ad for a nickel back in my day you you literally when the facebook ad platform came out it was a nickel for a click yeah yes they were charging five cents like for comments like going to the movies for our parents like i i don't know the average right now but it's you know 50 cents to a dollar 50. um so the facebook ad platform comes out with all this inventory it's five cents and we you know we looked at it and i was also young at the time this is like what year was that val like 2006 maybe 2007 when they did their ad platform something like that facebook yeah well they were wait they were later than that it hadn't been later than that because it would have been i was like out of high school yeah it must be like 2011 or something i don't know let's see i don't and does it work isn't it 2000 november 2007. they just put it out and then people bid on it yeah so there was they put it out people bid on it's 2007. um i'm uh how old am i at this time i'm 18 years old 17 or 18 years old um and what we did was did deals with the zyngas of the world who were building facebook games who needed installs so they would pay us three dollars and fifty cents for all these social game companies for every installs and we were buying we were buying clicks for five cents um so what we needed hey man that is like so you were doing you were a an install super affiliate yeah so we like our our niche like we understood community and social so when all these uh social networks started implementing ad platforms we were really good at creating content around it so then we're just like oh hey let's just go do a deal with um and i don't speak about this publicly very much by the way sahel i see your face you're like what i don't even know you um but like the beauty about affiliate marketing is that if you build if you get this to work and it costs you 50 cents and you get a dollar fifty out you you wanna you know instead of putting a thousand dollars a day you wanna put ten thousand dollars a day or a hundred thousand dollars a day or a million dollars a day and it becomes the world's greatest money vending machine yeah it's so easy to scale once you got that formula going yeah i just remember seeing i think it was toby recently that like at shopify said like you know it's so interesting to your point on like the half-life of these opportunities shrinking over time it's sort of broadly by the way like the half-life of these marketing channel opportunities has definitely shrunk the half-life of like every opportunity i feel like has shrunk with the rise of technology like if you're not if you have an idea and it looks like an interesting opportunity you have to go get it fast because if you don't there's someone else that's going to go capitalize on it it's going to get squeezed out but like way more people now like um that have to have interest in in these cat in these spaces yeah there's more people with the internet right just there's more people with the internet like it's just it's really hard right you're competing not just against like the nerds you know with computers like it might have been 20 30 years ago now it's like everyone has a computer with their phone not to mention that like the entire subcontinent of india has come online and is all technology focused so there's just like there's massive massive um opportunities still but they go away fast and so you have to like be a type of person like you guys both are clearly to go and capitalize on these things yeah you know that said there's still a lot of fragmentation out there is that if you have that skill to do arbitrage or you actually like doing it or you have a skill at any particular topic or category you could still do plenty of arbitrage you just have to get a little more fragmented and figure out how to scale that fragmentation which is like one like the company that i'm building now is a lot a lot to do with that there's it's a lot more involved but uh you know but the second business that i scaled up right after that was also just just a different set of um just different set of arbitrage uh which is uh i got into the whole music category and that was that was actually a bigger business than than the first one i was like the first year i generated over 10 million in net profit geez and and uh and i had it was always it started out with just me but it ended up being like seven people um and uh we had like a monopoly on distribution of premium content specifically started with like ringtones so have you ever seen like a music site and said like send this ringtone to your to your to your cell um like back in the years that that was me um although we had like a half a billion people uh we were in front of every month and so it was pretty you know so there's a once you get like a feeling for for those inefficiencies you could take advantage of them across many categories like greg like i never got involved on the installs game i know it was cute and it was huge i never but i never got on it um but uh yeah there's like so many different ways you could uh to make that work well there's two ways there's two ways of like if you're listening to this and you're like okay how can i get involved in something like this well one way is you find a new platform shift so like search gets really big and ads come out or tick tock gets really big and their ads come out you find a new platform and you create a product or partner with someone with a product on that new platform and the second way is you create a new you're just really good at content so you created a new format on that platform so as an example um and some might and i'm not i don't know about you but i'm not creative like sahil is obviously creative like yes somehow you're like a weird creature where you sounds like you're i feel like you're creative yet you're good with numbers right i'm not creative i've never been called a weird creature before but i will take that hey man that's what makes it uh makes you tick like i said i can't i can't i'm not creative at all so i i cannot put on put out content on tick tock or anything like that so yeah but people figured out different concepts that uh work on instagram stories or tic toc what do you see today when you look at the at the landscape as some of the interesting opportunities in any category broadly like you're saying you know you need to be able to kind of identify what are some of those opportunities that might exist like if you were looking out and you were i know you're building something else right now if you were looking out like what do you think are some of the spaces that our listeners should be looking at and thinking about building in i i still think that a lot of the mom and pops um and mom and pops could be different sizes right like you could have mom and pop score 300 000 revenue you could have stores that do two five million you have car dealerships that do five ten million right so all kinds of ranges of mom and pops but i think they're still very much behind in many many categories and if you could bring in value right connect them make them relevant on whatever platform whether it's tic tac or facebook or instagram uh whatever it is make them relevant on those categories and those uh platforms uh there's absolutely an arbitrage there because they're willing to spend money to to catch up and because they haven't caught up um so i do that for the like the jewelry industry i mean what i've done is way more advanced because like i'm also produ like vertically integrated the uh the jewelry manufacturing process and doing all the data market data and marketing for them so it's way more like advanced uh but if i was um you know if i had smaller investment if i could make a smaller investment and or even if as a as a side hustle i mean that's what i would do i would just go out there and start helping small fragmented mom and pops and you know what i always like historically i've always started with arbitrage first because once you figure out that there's an arbitrage in something you could build and scale around that right so um so i think it's very important and you could once you do that once you figure out that magic formula that works you then it's up to you whether you want to take vc money or if you're like maybe not everybody's good at raising money right nobody not everybody has those connections as well yeah there's like a massive opportunity broadly you know if you think of it as like an agency business model um you know not raising money like if you're an individual and you're kind of a hustler and you have a builder mentality around these things um i mean you could probably go like in your town and go to the like small you know restaurants shops etc in the center of your town or you know in the local area i bet if you went and talked to them um you know about what they're doing around you know online advertising or online reviews or you know whatever it might be um i bet you could go and like secure a few you know monthly retainer type contracts to go and deliver them value and you could basically say uh hey it's free the first month i'll prove you know the value of doing this and then we you know agree to some sort of contract going forward and i bet you could spin up like if it's just you too and you're just like paying your living wage i mean you could probably spend up like a 50 000 a month business pretty quickly doing that for like a bunch of local mom and pops on like a you know few thousand dollar a month type retainer deal for all of them today i am so excited to talk about

do is i wouldn't go local like your own local backyard i would pick an industry like one category and then try to try to catch start getting them you know like locally regionally even nationally like go after that one because then you're gonna be very good at one so when i was when i was thinking about launching my next last um my last company so i actually retired for like three years right and i was too bored i got to like build something myself and i was like no i want to go after something that's not corporate america because that's what i've done my whole life right um i want to do something that that helps the the main street and um so the things i would look i was looking at is like something very huge like huge but fragmented so pizza shops right and this is before like slice came i don't know like later on slice i was kind of thinking in that realm right i was thinking about all the um bars like all the pubs they have they all have these they have these like beer dispensing mechan uh systems right like why can i take over that distribution of that right and then i own that distribution point like that that was the stuff i was thinking about um just going very after like one category um but that's very fragmented so i love it as a as like a general framework or idea for for starting and and building something um you guys want to do some uh some business ideas yeah sure let's hit it let's do it um all right well first off i want to do one that's sparked by a thread that you did val um so i was recently on twitter and um greg obviously knows this but val i'm expecting my first um child soon and yeah uh little boy super excited um but you wrote a thread about um basically rather than paying your kids allowance you pay them interest um and it sparked for me a business idea um that i think is kind of interesting but will you just kind of give the general concept of what you wrote about and then um i'll lay out the idea yeah absolutely so it all started with my uh view again immigrant mentality and how do i instill my kids to look i i they're going to grow up in a different environment that i grew up i was never like super poor or anything like that but i lived in soviet union and like i said i couldn't get a computer for the next first six years in this country so um i mean we had food on our table but i was never like wealthy or well off ain't like that so how do i instill that into my kids and and you know i realized that resource resourcefulness is very important right so i actually don't give i i purposely um limit the resources i throttle the resources they get right i want them to figure it out how to make how to do a lot with very little right essentially that's what what made me successful i think right at least that's what i think um so the idea was okay i'm not gonna give you an allowance you're not gonna get free money right you're gonna have to figure out how the world works and you know they start getting i noticed they started getting like little birthday gifts and little holiday gifts and i told them like hey and they start putting it at the piggy bank right they're like little kids like two three years old right they start putting in a little piggy bank right that's the thing cause somebody gave him a pig again piggy bank that's fine um i told him like hey you know that's money sitting there in piggy bank it's doing nothing right you know and uh it's like what if you put it what if you give it to somebody and they're gonna give you back more money you know and it has to be like super basic conversation and like you kind of get a little more and more detail as they get older but it has to be super basic right that somebody else needs money and could use the money to do something with that right rather than sitting in your piggy bank and it made sense so so what i did what i've done is i created this like little google sheet and and every time they have money they want to put it instead of putting a piggy bank they put it in a kids loan account um and it collects interest so essentially instead of giving them allowances they get interest on their money and i like i picked an arbitrary number just because it's easy one percent a month which is 12 a year um they're staking their allowance they're staking their allowance exactly to use greg's web 3 analogy i mean the thing that i thought was so interesting about it was it's a topic that i often think about of like we have this complete inability to educate children and young adults on investing money you know like modern principles of all of this and the things that by the way like our parents learned about that stuff are not really applicable today the entire landscape has changed there's so many different opportunities there's all this different stuff so yeah i thought this was really interesting the way you laid it out it also just made me uh made my eyes light up a little bit around business opportunities around it because as you said in the thread you're like managing it with kind of a janky spreadsheet that you pulled together and like you know um you know kind of like working with them through that and it maybe isn't super intuitive to them as they have like tons of technology at their fingertips and so you know i've seen a bunch of like general apps that are doing like kids related investing or different things but i wonder whether there's an opportunity to kind of create like a very simple set of tools for parents to um sort of like engage and have this general um discourse and dialogue with their kids around like the range of opportunities the thing i thought you know like you have investing that's one like you can put money into the stock market and have discussions around the different companies and the stocks and what it looks like and how it tracks over time you have like a bank like this interest idea which is like you put you know you put money in and it's being loaned out to other people here with other people that got it here's what it looks like you might have um you know different areas of it right like bonds whatever it might be um but kind of create a set of like very simple intuitive technology tools that allow you to have those discussions recently saw a company called greg you and i talked about this uh um early bird early bird that i think our friend alexis backed that um has like the investing side of it where you can kind of like set up an account for your kid and have you know people contribute dollars so that you can have investments and and talk to your kid about those over time i think the combination of like the actual functionality plus the um education and like discussion aspect of it is where it becomes really interesting like what you're doing where you're actually able to have the discussions with your kids explain to them how it works what the trade-offs are of each decision etc that's where i think something really interesting comes together so i'm curious for you guys thoughts i love it i mean i'm actually just checking it out uh i haven't heard of early bird there are i know there are some other uh what's the one with the something with green uh i know i know one of my kids was asking for like a credit card from that company it was specifically for children and uh to help them manage finances right um so anything around educating about finances for kids i think it's i think it's a great thing it makes them more comfortable with money you know some of the comments i was seeing in the threads and it was like it wasn't largely people loved it right it kind of went a bit viral relatively speaking for me you know so nasa heal viral but it went viral enough for me um and you know there were some comments about you know some parents like oh let the kids be kids and don't talk to them about money like i don't i don't you know i feel like they should be more comfortable yeah about money and not be all weird about it when they grow up and if you kind of you know it's not like i said that with them like just talk about money all the time but that's i think that's part of the education um yeah and it's not like you're forcing i mean you're giving them the sense of the trade-offs right like they can either sit and let their money grow or they can spend it in which case it's not growing and they're using it on something and so like my my general take on it is like uh this is stuff that you're going to have to decide the rest of your life like you all three of us every time you have to decide whether to go buy some nice thing or spend it on something else you're deciding between like investing it in something cool putting it into the market staking it encrypt it like doing all these different things you're having to make those trade-offs and those decisions and so why not educate kids on those trade-offs over time from an early age the challenge with most of these businesses historically by the way has been the customer acquisition cost is insanely high because um kids are like gen z all of these like teen investing apps and teen banking apps notoriously very difficult businesses that you have to raise a shitload of money for because the churn is crazy high because the kid just like you know they get on it and they're all into it and then they go on to the next thing like whatever the next hot thing is that comes really high turn um and it's really hard to market to them like your marketing to our point earlier through tick tock instagram snapchat it's super expensive to buy the ads and to get the customers um so i think they're like going early is really interesting because then you're actually selling to a parent like with early bird it's kind of cool because they're like selling to me um or they're selling to you val and they're saying yeah like oh you're interested in talking to your kid about this over time come join us you're going to be able to track and watch this throughout your life and so now it's like a sticky customer that is sitting there i think there's something actually really interesting with it yeah yeah you know one of the distributions um that i remember when i was researching one of the categories we're looking into potentially start a business around uh and it was actually kind of related to families and children what i realized how huge of a distribution channel the schools themselves are and you could get in them through ptas oh i like that yeah the p the parent teacher associations are like everywhere like and they have so many parents involved and you know and teachers like so there are many ways yeah and get into uh some of these categories here's the tech lite version of it by the way which i'll leave you and we can jump to the next idea the tech light so that the tech heavy version is something like early bird you know build a whole platform they raise money they're like you know now a high-flying tech company um the tech lite version is literally go create like a newsletter or a blog that is um it kind of offers uh free information plus like paid premium tools that take parents new parents on this money and educational journey with their kids i think that in and of itself would be really interesting and valuable where you're literally just like hey we're going to give you free information about how to talk about interesting new money things and teach them to your kids and by the way if you want to do more here's like the free or no here's like the premium paid uh set of tools for like showing in a spreadsheet how to track the different things and it's just like a preset spreadsheet where you can track their investments or track the interest stuff um i think that would be really cool you could probably go set that up and like build an audience around something like that and i bet you could generate a seven-figure business just off of doing something like that well it wasn't market watch i don't know we could move on but like market watch is like the right i think it's market watch that has the stock market game yeah right and if you have kids like all the schools use that one platform to do a stock market game like they compete in the schools and they all use that market watch uh stock market game so somebody's already giving it's just like one tool yeah and it's been used for who knows how many years it's been around i think it existed when i was in school yeah like it's been around you know i mean i went to school they didn't have market watch back then so um they used to do with some other like little paper like i would fill out like my stock buys i remember uh on a piece of paper but yeah like those tools and i i bet i bet marketwatch has so much traffic just coming from that particular category if i was doing this uh idea i would do it as a free-to-play game so a video game okay i'm reading this book right now called reality is broken why games make us better and how they could change the world by jane mcdonnell and it's fascinating and i think it's actually a must read for any i think it's a must read for any person interested in product but i also think it's a must read for any parent um because there's definitely that you know a lot of parents think oh my god you know my my kids are playing video games it's a waste of time that sort of thing but it's just about how you can use uh game dynamics to get people to learn how to do things and if it's a free game you can go to the pta and be like hey like it's a free game go check it out go to xyz.com um get that's what robinhood is yeah it's a yeah it's a game it's a game it's a robin hood they they gamify the stock market yeah listen so somebody like probably my age and you guys right the reality is the government has pulled away the ability for the average people to make a lot of kind different kinds of investments the sec basically blocks all kinds of different uh uh opportunities because they you know they scrutinize everything right so that's why we have the world we live in where institutional money like we see money is access to all these tech companies grows them to tens of billions of dollars of value only then give put them out on the ipo because it's just not worth for these companies to go public anymore right same thing happens with all the alternative investments and we're starting to see all this cracking all over the all over the place robin hood gamified it i mean they got into trouble with the cc a bit here and there right you got like all these other platforms that are just made it more available like angel list right or other places like so you got more public involved in just all these investments now because it's finally getting like reopened up and there's just so much pent-up demand for that and uh so i think we're seeing seeing that right now and like you're to your point greg like robin hood is that's what exactly they did is they gamified um the dynamics of the stock market this is like a fascinating space but i'm actually about greg i haven't talked to you about this i'm about to invest in a um big player in this space in india um that's doing like um i don't know what i don't know what it's called like played a game i don't know it's like real money finance type games where like you you put money into it that gets you um like literal tokens not like crypto tokens but literally well it's like being in an arcade so like you put money you put you know 10 rupees in you get 10 rupees worth of tokens you can use them to play the like games that are in the app um and you can earn rewards from the app um and that's kind of like their marketing costs but the 10 rupees you put in is actually like into a savings account like it's invested for you and so then you can like it's sort of a way of onboarding this whole new generation of people into saving and investing via games um and so like exactly to your point greg it's this amazing way of like onboarding an entirely new generation of people into saving investing etc through a gamified uh experience that people kind of intuitively know and understand yeah super interesting space state to earn i think that's the terminology for those all those games yeah this isn't quite play to earn uh with savings component yeah i don't i don't know what the what the like effective term is of this um it's not play to earn because you're not like um it's not quite the same mechanics of it it's not like a crypto you know etc um it's really like you know real money gaming um is kind of like the general space that it exists in but super interesting space nonetheless um yeah anyway let's uh let's jump who else uh who else has one uh business idea you wanna you go who who went who did the first last one i think that one was me oh yeah you did the last one okay um listen man i i think that i mean i could i could give it a shot go for it i think that and i'm learning this myself now to be frank i think that is underrated right i've never used that in my past in my life um whether aggressively or even moderately i'm starting to use it moderately the reason i'm saying that is the abundance of availability of like sba loans now the government is like looking for ways to give give out money people should be taking advantage of that right because and if you could use that i'm not saying like just do stupid [ __ ] and waste you know and you know take on debt um i think it's very serious but in right moderation you could acquire a little you know or not maybe not so little to most people you know a business right that maybe it's a franchise business or it's a or it's a you know a local you know two doors low you know local two doors doing whatever selling whatever or doing whatever right so if you could take an sba loan a lot of times the mechanics are you could pay that loan off so quickly and then you have this high roi business that will pump out cash flow for you even after you pay that um after as you're paying that loan even so there's so many opportunities around that especially the interest rates are being super low i i think that uh everything becomes an opportunity yeah i think um you know the combination so sba loans small business administration like they give out loans basically they have partner banks all around the country so you can go you can look up on the website what partner banks exist near you develop a relationship with like a local branch that issues these loans they come with really friendly terms you know like long long terms low rates obviously rates are rising some now but still quite low i think the combination of sba loans so the the downside of sba loans is they are they are um personal like uh personal guarantees and and recourse to you so if you default on one of these you're gonna be on the hook with like garnishing wages in the future to pay them off um but an sba loan in combination with doing some form of seller financing um when you go buy a small business is like a hugely hugely powerful thing and it's what some of if you're on twitter and you follow like cody sanchez who we've had on this show or um nick huber or some of these other folks um they're writing about this where it's like this huge opportunity that exists where you can go buy these small businesses with extraordinarily little down um chris munn is another one that i've seen right about this um where basically like you can put 50k down get like 750k of seller financing which is basically that you're buying the business from them but what are they going to do with that money they're going to have to pay a bunch of taxes on the business and so they're loaning you the money to buy their own business and you're going to pay them a rate on that so for them they're happy because hey they don't have to pay taxes because it's not like a gain yet it's a loan that they're making and they're getting a rate of return on it which is probably above what the market is giving them in this environment um and the combination of the seller financing plus an sba loan you can go buy a business that maybe is making like several hundred thousand dollars in cash cashier for much less than that and be making it a massive effective rate of return on the equity that you're putting into it so i mean i agree with you i think it's really interesting the flip side of it is i do think there's like massive headaches that um operating one of those businesses can have that uh you know small business twitter uh maybe like glazes over when they when they write about these things oh absolutely it's uh anything like that is a hustle right and but if you are making whatever if you're making 60 000 salary 80 000 salary right and you have the opportunity to buy something that's generating 200 000 i mean that's a game changer and you'll like if i was in those shoes i probably hustled to make that 200 000 and then eventually at 200 000 you know you you buy a few more or you build a few more and you're up to a half a million a million dollars a year uh in profits and like i i didn't i don't really follow much of those on twitter but like i i've and i've never taken sba myself but um some people asked me for uh advice and like i'll give you one example this uh this guy he's a he has a family and he uh was looking at buying a business for two million dollars that was generating like seven hundred thousand in in profit um i think was ibdam or net i don't remember and then you know and he could take a he was already approved for sba to give him a loan all you have to do is put a hundred thousand dollars or 130 000 or something like along those lines and there you go like you put on 120 000 and you could buy a business that's generating five six hundred thousand dollars right and there's so much cushion like if something goes wrong and you don't make that six hundred thousand now you made four hundred thousand dollars or three hundred thousand there's just still so much cushion in between for these small businesses because they're typically sold at like three times you know three to five times income um so roi and like there's a big cushion if you mess something up you you um there is like room to make mistakes yes it's interesting too because it's a way for people to like opt out of the um the standard path right like maybe you're not you know a tech you know builder or where you're not going to go raise a bunch of money for some vc backed thing that's totally fine but you also don't want to go you know have to work for someone the rest of your life this is like a pretty cool way if you're you know entrepreneurial to go buy a local business and build you know really meaningful income and wealth um you know without having to do either of those paths like you can kind of opt out of the of the standardized life and system of like working for someone and climbing up the corporate ladder and buy like a local landscaping business um and you know operate it doesn't have to be so scary like buying a local landscape business is scary like there's so many things that you probably most people don't know about right but you could also buy a franchise right and a lot of the stuff is already figured out for you by those friends it doesn't have to be like a major major franchise it could be like a franchise with 300 locations i wanted to do kids swim schools that was the one that i was like really high on recently because parents pay everyone puts their kids into these swim schools now they'll like i was looking it up the other day the unit economics on the boxes like they make a couple million dollars per box um with like really high margins because it's literally just a pool like it's not a fancy place um and so if you can just like finance the build out of one of these uh very low overhead from a labor perspective because it's literally just like a few classes a day and you just need like one or two teachers to do them but there are these kids swim schools that you can go get there's not like crazy net worth requirements to getting the um to getting the uh franchise um uh licenses or whatever it's called um for i for a given exactly which one you're talking about because my my my kids for many years used to go to uh one of those and there's also franchise yeah and literally everyone puts their kids into these things goldfish was the one that i was looking at um uh i think but i'm not sure if it's a franchise or not i think it is a franchise yeah safety swim yeah yeah the other one that would be amazing would be building these like um uh kids like birthday party places um these things have like risen especially in higher income areas like apples yeah they're like you basically just put up like a turf field and like a bunch of like games and people can like bring their own food you rent out the place they're rented out for like years the one in my friend's neighborhood where he was having his kids birthday party is literally rented out every weekend for the next year like he had to do the kid's third birthday at the same time as doing his second birthday because it's rented out for every weekend so and i was just like this is in the middle of nowhere it's in an industrial area it's literally just like turf there's nothing super nice don't think they're a machine too like they like they have everybody on the conveyor belt to go from room to room yeah and you can do like during the week you can do like corporate events or you could do like soccer games like do like a league or something like that i i think you could make a killing off that business i'm listening to you guys speak and i couldn't be less interested in like owning a landscape business or owning this like turf where i'm inviting kids to it and for high income earners like i think what happened was on twitter there was everyone just talking about internet products all the time and then there became this like wave of like you know sort of physical sweaty businesses and it's been like really you know in vogue on vogue to like go and buy a laundromat and my take is it's a really personal decision like i know as an internet person like owning a laundromat owning a landscaping business like you know my hair looks good or you know i've got a lot of hair but my hair is about to be gone like fully take it out of my hair like if i go and you know run a business like that i think that it's a very personal decision for me not no bueno but for i think there's gonna be a lot here's my prediction i think there's gonna be a lot of internet people who are gonna end up buying laundromats and stuff like that and it's gonna go really wrong and i have one more i want to end with one thing val if you were building your affiliate business and all of a sudden you're like you know what i need to go i see there's this like loan i can get and i can go like buy a landscaping business isn't that like you know right before you came on we were talking about focusing and how big heads down is really important isn't that like the opposite of that like splitting your attention like don't you think like if you're really good at something don't you think you should like double down on it oh yeah absolutely that's what i was saying like figure out what you're good at um try to do some arbitrage around that and then double down into that category i would absolutely not be buying landscaping businesses you know like like i said i don't i don't know anything about a lot of things out there um but what so my pushback to this greg by the way first off um i completely agree with you not for everyone sounds like a complete headache what the way i would do it because i don't want to go run a landscaping business either i don't want to run like uh this place was called chatter splatter like the kids turf thing or like a goldfish swim school like i don't want to go run that [ __ ] either um and i don't think i'd be good at it i don't think i'd be good at it but could i like go pay some young person like 200 grand a year and it'd be a great salary for them to run it and like deal with all of the headaches give them like some upside plus a salary and now i own something that happens to be netting me like 40 cash on cash returns annually and now it's just like a great investment and it's throwing off a bunch of cash flow i don't hate that idea yeah until that idea works extremely well until something happens and the manager quits or leaves and all of a sudden you're like on the on the front lines in the trenches and like you're sacrificing your main business to go like go for a swim yeah and that's that's the risk and yeah like is that you know a small risk absolutely but like i want to i think yeah yeah the way i think about it is like i want to take risks in my world and my business like around like agency and studio and stuff like that like i in internet stuff and community and web 3 i don't want to take risks and like and stuff like that i think what you're getting you're getting at like a very profound and and important point to reiterate which is like know your know your game and um and focus on your game um and i do it i think it's a great point to make because um i i've been saying this recently like if you if you want to excel in anything write down the 10 most important things in your life and then cross seven of them off the list um and focus on those three because like you can't have ten things that you care about that you're focusing on you can really only have a couple and so you need to just be ruthless about prioritizing them i completely agree with you greg actually um in hearing you say it and thinking about it because i've often thought about this in the case of real estate where i've had friends who are like make theirs make some decent money and then they're like oh i'm gonna go buy rental properties and personally i think that most people that buy rental properties maybe this is a hot take it's like a vanity thing where they want to be able to flex and say that they own rental properties because the vast majority of my friends that have done that it is the combination of a headache and it doesn't drive better returns than just investing in a publicly traded reit that would get you the same exposure to real estate in general without having to actually manage any properties or do it um so i agree with you greg i think there is probably for the vast majority of situations a much lower headache and lower intensity version of driving the exact same the exact same financial returns listen you got to be able to if you can't scale something it it's not going to be to greg's point it's not going to be manageable because like that manager quits everything goes to you know hits the fan right um like so i actually have a portfolio of multiple companies right that either co-founders of mine or managers who are ceos of these businesses so like i'm talking about serious companies like i have a mobile advertising business my my co-founder is the ceo he runs it you know there are 100 we have 100 employees it's like it's gonna do it's on the track to do like 100 million revenue very profitable right he got it like i don't get involved like real estate i partnered up with a guy who i've known many many years he's like super smart we got i started his business five years ago real estate development around you know like around new york city area is where our focus is which by the way everybody wrote off all over the country uh like every headline like everybody's writing off new york city but it's it's doing so well it's it's unbelievable like we got over 100 million worth of um properties that we're either already finished developing or sold or or you know kind of starting to break ground on now um so i think it's very doable as long as you have the right managers in place but you all you you have to scale up the team first because if that manager can't um you know can't continue for whatever reason right they get hit by a bus or something you got to have ability to be you know if you have scale there are always people that could uh you know step into those shoes or you could hire into them into that position because you know you have a big business that could afford a you know a salad manager so um luckily i've never had that situation but uh you know but i think it's very very doable um again on the on the bigger side like you shouldn't be doing you shouldn't be doing uh landscaping business on the side like in hoping that somebody's gonna run that business for you it's just not gonna happen yeah normally if if something sounds too good to be true it probably is uh yeah and i think with with most of these things you need to go in eyes wide open about that like you're not you're not getting those kind of returns uh for free it comes with additional risk in the form of headaches or financial risk um you're buying a job too you're like that scale you're buying a job yeah which like if you're you know a hustler and a grinder and you want to get out of your like sales role that you were doing and trying to climb the corporate ladder maybe that's what you want maybe it's like a great way to kind of own your own career and own your life and you can go build around that but to greg's point not for everybody um no this was awesome and really enjoyed getting to uh getting to jam with you man i mean 30 million dollars uh from a from a parent's basement i think has to go down in the record books as one of the more legendary stories of uh of uh hustling that we've had on the show so dude truly appreciate you joining um a bunch of interesting stuff i mean the um huge opportunity around finance for kids um check out early bird if you haven't checked it out val i think it's i think it's pretty interesting i just set one up for for my kid actually super smart move by the founders by the way like i had tweeted about something with it and they uh they sent me fifty dollars um for my kids account and it like got it started now i'm like oh i'm using this you know it is a great customer acquisition tactic now you're talking about it to do that really smart now i'm talking about it and they did it so um very very smart um but uh between that the um business idea around you know or or lack thereof of some of these uh sweaty businesses as uh as greg points out the downsides of them a lot of interesting stuff to chew on here so really appreciate you joining um any uh any final takeaways from either you guys go read oh man i appreciate you having me uh this is awesome i mean listen i don't know i don't know what you guys are doing but you got some magic sauce um you know both of you on kind of the content side and some of the some of the stuff i i read uh some of the threads i've seen it's like wow um so i mean it's it's interesting reading those because i'm not a good communicator some people are and some people aren't that's just not my strength and some of the tweets like i see coming out of you guys um i think you're doing pretty well yeah like i've been doing that and i don't even realize uh i've been doing that my whole life you know what i mean you're doing pretty well for yourself man i don't know i mean you're um you're sharing real earned insights because of stuff that you've done and built along the way which i find really cool and super value-add to the community because a lot of people can learn from it both the positives and the negatives along the way so truly appreciate all that you're doing and excited to get to continue to follow along on your journey nice awesome man and go read uh reality is broken val the that book around game design oh yeah that sounds cool yeah we're gonna check that out yeah absolutely and i already got the i already got the kids thing here so i'm probably signing up to that too yeah check it out awesome awesome great seeing you man thank you so much thanks so much for

the way i kind of think about it i remember a therapist said to me 10 years ago she said look if you're an elastic band and um you know drugs alcohol um stimuli that's you pulling up on the elastic band right but the cost is going to be whatever the equal reaction is on the other side so an up let's say you're a zero as a baseline and you go to eight you know you do some mdma and you go to eight well you're going to go negative eight for the next couple days after that you're gonna pay for it in the same vein if you are a zero and you just allow yourself to be bored and that's a negative two or a negative three probably for the next week you might have a rebound that you're gonna be a plus three plus four so there's this idea of paying you know buying yourself happiness or selling yourself future sadness i think of it as like reducing the amplitude like if you're a wave you know the amplitude of the wave is like the distance from the baseline that it swings and you know people we all know people who are like this you know wild swings up and down above and below the baseline and i've always found that the most impressive people in the world like find a way to just reduce the amplitude like they never get too high they never get too low and they have these like so everyone has waves right it's going to happen you're going to have things that spark happiness things that spark joy etc and you're going to have downward swings but being able to like squeeze that into a tighter band is a real skill and it's something that i think needs to be honed never let the world

so i've always thought that raising money um at first i'd be impressed i go oh wow you know sequoia invested a billion dollar valuation the hundred million dollars you go oh wow did they sell their stock they got 100 million dollar windfall and it's like no no like sequoia who are like the most intense mfers in the world just join the board they're going to hold a gun to that person's head and say you need to grow your company 300 a year you need to spend as much money as possible to go there and that ceo's life is that's the equivalent of somebody saying i'm going out i'm putting myself into personal debt and i'm getting uh credit cards at 30 annualized interest right to me i'm just like oh no i don't want that once i knew what it was so that was fine and the cool thing about what i did and i'm sure greg has had the same experience is my business metalab was selling pickaxes to gold miners in silicon valley so we would provide the services to help them build their business design development etc and we didn't take the risk so whether the company fails or not we're not risking alongside of them and i got to be a fly on the wall in a lot of these board meetings and conversations and see the tremendous stress and misery that these founders wender and then i would compare it to my life and i'd go sure you know my company is not worth 100 million dollars but i'm making 500k a year a couple million bucks a year living a great life in victoria no this is pretty good number two was once i understood compounding and i could do basic math i realized that i was going to be way wealthier than any of the people that i knew even the people who had billion dollar companies because i just knew that if i was compounding my capital and reinvesting you know 80 of what i made eventually the numbers would get huge and i kept i built a spreadsheet where i was like okay in 2010 where will i be at in 2015 2020 2025 and when i started noticing that i was actually following the trend line i was like okay this compounding stuff works and it felt like um the tortoise and the hair right you're just slowly chugging along the hair is running like a maniac and getting exhausted and i'm just slowly compounding at you know 25 a year um and now i you know when i see someone who's got more money or whatever it is i just go okay well if i just keep compounding you know i'll be good

f-u-n-d-r-i-s-e dot com slash room to get started today i do think i mean look i um it's balance right like i think i would enjoy being isolated and having that experience for maybe a month or a couple months a year um but doing it full time and around the clock i agree with you andrew i think it would be you know it would drive me insane probably to not have the human connectivity but look like one of the things one of my first encounters with you andrew was a thread that you wrote on twitter i don't know it's probably close to a year ago now or maybe october of last year where you basically wrote about your experience of getting off the grid completely both you know physically but also from a technology perspective and so i'm just i'm curious uh what precipitated that and to get a little bit of context around that for anyone that might not have seen it sure yeah i mean so basically over covid i just got into this habit of constantly being on twitter constantly checking my email as as everyone else did just constantly searching for uh entertainment on the internet and losing the kind of day-to-day touch points that i had of seeing friends and stuff which calms your brain and so i got to the state by the end of july where i was just waking up every single day and i was miserable and the way i would describe the misery isn't i want to kill myself i can't get her to bed it was do you know like when you're scrolling netflix on a friday night and you know you want to watch a movie but there's nothing that will scratch the edge right no movie is good you keep stopping movies starting new ones you're pissed for not choosing the right thing that's how my entire life felt nothing was satisfying and so i didn't know what was happening physiologically but i just knew something was off and so i just basically went up to we have a lake house and i just said [ __ ] it i'm turning off all my devices i'm cutting off everything i'm putting up an autoresponder i told my assistant like call me if there's an emergency but otherwise i don't want to hear from you and i did no music no podcasts no device no screens no anything for a full month and i just read books all i would do is go on my kindle and read books and hang out with my kids and kind of occupy my time and i didn't know what happened i didn't really understand what i was doing but effectively in retrospect i was doing a detox this is like when someone's a drug addict or an alcoholic you go and you go to rehab and you spend three to six weeks just not doing that thing and it kind of resets your cravings and your brain and your dopamine system and so i got back after a month and things that would have been very unsatisfying were very satisfying so walking into a cafe and hearing muzak sounded like the greatest thing i'd ever heard listening to a lecture on youtube was like you know like glass of ice water and hell everything was just incredibly satisfying and so i was kind of on a quest i was going why is what did i do why did this work what's the science behind it and i happened to listen to an interview that andrew huberman did with dr anna lemke from stanford who specializes in addiction and i listen to it only because i have an interest in opioid addiction i'd kind of researched the sackler family and that whole story so i thought maybe i'd learn something and as i listened i went oh my god like she was talking about how addiction is not just to drugs it can be to anything that stimulates the dopamine reward system so it can be eating a piece of chocolate it can be scrolling instagram listening to music anything that fires you up and makes you feel motivated and the the interesting thing they talked about was that there's this kind of pleasure pain balance so when you first do it when you first eat the piece of chocolate cake and you haven't done that in a long time it's pure ecstasy it's the best thing ever but if you do it every week it gets less satisfying if you do it every day it gets very unsatisfying if you do it every hour your body craves it and is in pain until it gets it but then it's not even doesn't move the needle doesn't make you feel good you're just constantly craving and so effectively what i realized was i was a drug addict for twitter for dopamine and that i needed to detox and frankly i mean like anyone else you go to rehab and you relapse and i have now seven months later started to relapse listen to podcasts constantly listening to spotify you know going on podcasts going on twitter a little bit but i think it's an important habit to build for yourself to create those spaces so i decided every august i'm just fully sabbatical no devices and we'll see how that goes i have a few i have a few follow-up questions on it so first off have you ever done something like this like have you ever even done you know like greg kind of does like a one day per week detox like a sabbath um where he gets away from technology had you ever done anything like this or was it the first time and you went cold turkey for the month i done it by accident so i have a friend who lives his family lives off the grid on a remote island in bc and he took me there for three days and i remember feeling incredible you know it's obviously very hard for the first you know day or so but i remember feeling really incredible but not knowing not knowing what i'd done but no i mean it was the first time in 20 years i'd been without a device for more than 24 hours effectively and did you experience similar to a drug addict who goes to rehab did you experience that the first 48 hours were like excruciating silence oh yeah i was furious like i was like literally you know when you stand up and you're tapping you go to the urinal and you're tapping your pocket oh [ __ ] i forgot my phone that feeling of desperation what am i gonna do while i'm on the toilet or you know you need it constantly um i had that every five seconds and my kids you know we have this lake house and there's this little beach there and so i'd sit there reading with my kids there and even the instinct of i need to take a photo and text it to my friends or i need to capture this moment if i don't capture this moment i haven't won or there's something wrong and removing that instinct uh was really really helpful because you know do you want to be present and remember it or do you want to just be taking photos of it and looking back at things you probably won't even look at right that urge to text your friends and tell them about something you're doing is like the most bizarre thing i think the the scary thing about what's happened with social products like and i've worked on a lot of the large social products the social products are gamified but now basically all apps are being gamified like robin hood like i just logged into robinhood this morning and like i'm looking at like my net worth going up like crazy and going down like crazy like that that gets your heart jumping and it's kind of happening to all spectrum of apps which is pretty scary i'm curious you know what your perspective is on that well i think it's um the the genies out of the bottle right and i think there will be people who are ethical you know the work that tristan harris does to try and coach some of these companies or up and coming companies to use this stuff for good there's actually a company i'm investing in right now i think it's still stealth so i won't i'll be vague but effectively what they're trying to do they're a bunch of very experienced people in the gaming industry and they're trying to use this same dopamine pathway and biology to harness it for good so to teach kids things to do it in a healthy way to kind of promote pro-social behavior and that kind of stuff and that's very interesting to me to me these are these aren't things that we should all swear off right i think they they're good dopamine is something that motivates us and moves us forward but that said you don't want to be you don't want to feel you're a rat in a maze being drawn you know down down a you know down a path you don't want or understand let's talk about that for a second because we talk sahil and i are constantly talking about this um so i'm made fun of a bit in my in my friend group because i'm like for many reasons for many reasons for many reasons one of them one one of the yeah but one of them is uh that i'm like a man of moderation like i'm you know if i'm going out i'm only having one drink and i stick to it and if i say i'm not you know checking technology for 24 hours i'm not checking technology other people aren't like that and so how do you like how do we for people who aren't into moderation or it's very difficult for them what are some like ways for them to become more you know well i'm i'm very similar to you actually so my my friends would also you know when i was in my partying days i would always go out and i'd only have three drinks right it was always like i will not drink drink dinner i'll wait until we're at a club and then i'll drink three drinks get buzzed and then i'm going home by x time so i'm kind of similar to you the most effective thing is similar to what you do if you're an alcoholic which is don't expose yourself to environments people etc that will cause you to do that thing and then remove the stimuli from your home from your office etc so i'm very they call this term self-binding so the idea would be like hey i want to eat healthy when i'm at home um a i'm gonna remove all the unhealthy snacks from my my pantry i'm gonna make it a real pain in the ass to get to it yeah sure i can go drive and get it but that's annoying and then i'm gonna have alternatives so for me for example you know for a while i was like snacking on all these like shitty things at home i now have uh i always have berries and i have pistachios and i have various things that i just substitute and i find when i'm craving something and i eat the healthy alternative i don't usually crave it afterwards so that's been my approach to it i also use screen time very aggressively so i have somebody else set my screen time passcode i totally limit my ability to look at news social media for more than about two to three minutes a day and that has really deprogrammed my brain like you know i don't i don't naturally just go to twitter when i'm on my phone the problem is you search for a new thing so it's like i might scroll my youtube feed um i might go to the wall street journal so i'm always trying to cut those those pathways off yeah it's like environment hacking is kind of how i think of it generally is like when you know you're trying to create a a pattern change like that you need to hack your environment and so that your actual systems can can adapt and change like i've always thought about a combination of environment hacking and then just creating a new habit like i've written about this recently of basically this whole idea that we've lost the ability to um be alone and to be bored and when i was a kid i remember spending hours like what i would typically define as bored like wandering around outside reading a book you know doing literally nothing and that was just we didn't have ipads we didn't have other things and maybe i didn't have friends around and so i was like outside and just walking around and my parents didn't worry about where i was and i think over time we've just lost the ability to do that so i i do like 30 minutes a day no matter what of uh i call it like creative boredom but basically just like walking around no music no podcasts no phone whatever i carry around a little notebook which i just like carry with me everywhere and will write down things that come into my head and i find that those periods of boredom end up being when my best ideas actually strike and it's no surprise i mean it's no surprise to me that that's the case but it is quite interesting yeah no i think um i think it's a very um it's a very real problem and i think i said this to you we were doing a call maybe a month ago there's a great quote on this by blaise pascal which is all of man's miseries arise from an inability to sit quietly in a room by oneself right think about it you can't just sit still you can't have a moment of boredom one of the things i did after this dopamine fast was i said you know rule i don't listen to things when i drive so i just have these quiet contemplative 20-minute drives everywhere i go i've now slept obviously given i relapsed but i do think those sorts of things are really really helpful and that experiencing boredom at some day time in your day is important the way i kind of think about it i remember a therapist said to me 10 years ago she said look if you're in elastic band and you know drugs alcohol um stimuli that's you pulling up on the elastic band right but the cost is gonna be whatever the equal reaction is on the other side so an up let's say you're a zero as a baseline and you go to eight you know you do some mdma and you go to eight well you're gonna go negative eight for the next couple days after that you're gonna pay for it in the same vein if you are a zero and you just allow yourself to be bored and that's a negative two or a negative three probably for the next week you might have a rebound that you're going to be a plus three plus four so there's this idea of paying you know buying yourself happiness um or selling yourself future sadness i think of it as like reducing the amplitude like if you're a wave you know the amplitude of the wave is like the distance from the baseline that it swings and you know people we all know people who are like this you know wild swings up and down above and below the baseline and i've always found that the most impressive people in the world like find a way to just reduce the amplitude like they never get too high they never get too low and they have these like so everyone has waves right it's going to happen you're going to have things that spark happiness things that spark joy etc and you're going to have downward swings but being able to like squeeze that into a tighter band is a real skill um and it's something that i think needs to be honed so have you guys heard of um it's teleb his concept of the noise bottleneck no so it's pretty interesting and it relates to all of this so basically he has this concept called the noise bottleneck which basically says that we assume that consuming more leads to uh more information more knowledge etc so you like you know if you're going to watch the news for 30 minutes that's great but if you watch it for five hours that's even better because you just consumed so much more information and you got more insight knowledge etc and it accumulates in compounds his whole theory is that it's actually um it's actually a paradox basically where by consuming more information the noise to signal ratio actually increases by bringing more and more in and so your actual insight and knowledge goes down from consuming more and so you need to beware with certain things of consuming more and more actually leading to an inverse relationship in terms of your growth and progress i think it applies so he talked about it in the context of news i think it applies so broadly to different things that we're consuming where like more and more actually leads to this massive bottleneck that is contrary to what you would believe but all of a sudden you're like oh my god i know nothing even though i just consumed this is this is the fascinating thing is you end up with cocktail party knowledge right so if you read the new york times wall street journal every day i'll be at a cocktail party and i can sound very smart for about two minutes on any topic but i cannot go in depth right i have no i'm an inch deep in a mile wide and i what i try and focus on that i find the times where i'm actually learning the most i'm focused on long narratives of a single story um and i'm looking at stuff that's happened five or ten years ago where you have full context and knowledge um i think looking at day-to-day news is like looking at a stock ticker and going oh my god it's up one percent it's down two percent it's not that meaningful and what i've noticed as i've stripped news out of my day-to-day life for the most part is that people will still tell me right i will know if there's a nuclear bomb that goes off somewhere in the world or you know the twitter merger with elon musk i know all the details because friends text me and talk about it i don't need to be sitting there scanning my stock portfolio of news constantly and watching the tickers um so i really just try and focus on long-form uh longer narrative and kind of rear looking i just don't think there's any upside in looking at what's happening in the moment the cocktail party knowledge point there's a great paper if you haven't read it um i think it's dan lew on this whole thing of cocktail party knowledge and incidentally the people that have cocktail party knowledge he kind of ties to like cocktail party ideas basically the people that have that surface level of insight on something are also the most likely to be actively proposing solutions to problems that they don't understand in any level of depth and it's like this fascinating phenomenon you go to cocktail party in san francisco everyone there will like talk to you and wax you know wax poetic about how they would fix you know all of the deep challenges of san francisco politics a lot more challenging than that you have like surface level knowledge it's easy to propose solutions well it's also not original knowledge right it hasn't come from contemplation it's come from regurgitation where i don't know if you've had this happen but there's often these big podcasts where i'll hear someone that gets interviewed and it's very much in the zeitgeist to somebody that everybody knows everyone listen to the same podcast and then i'll be sitting with a friend and he'll say something very interesting and insightful and i'll go wait a minute i heard this on tim ferriss and i heard x person say it right and this is the thing we're all just regurgitating these memes over and over and over again and actually having original thought is very unique right and you don't get that unless you're spending time uh actually having deep learning on something is that why like is that why you one of the reasons you live in victoria like to a lot of especially the americans listening they don't even know where victoria is probably there's like oh yeah maybe it's it's in canada or maybe it's on the west coast or maybe it's like near vancouver but for the most part i think it's safe to say they don't even know where it is and i know you were you know making lots of trips to san francisco um when you were growing your business were you ever tempted to to move to san francisco where you know the center of a lot of the technology noise were was is i i think um it's difficult what is the galilean relativity it's hard to understand a system when you're part of it and i think having distance from it actually gave me a lot of context and made me realize that the things that those people wanted were not that important to me and i was able to be somewhat of an original because i was here i wasn't getting caught up in all the memetic desire of you know these people raised from sequoia that's how i measure my worth as a person therefore i need to go raise from sequoia and move to san francisco and bnyc um so i think it saved me and i don't think i'd have a profitable at scale business today if i had moved to san francisco um did i ever get tempted by it absolutely was i intoxicated by the excitement of being there yes um you know was it a contrast when i would go down there and talk to people who were fired up in the startup world yes like i we didn't i didn't have that in victoria but what i ended up doing is just having a really great network of people who i talked to on the phone and text you know just like today like we're all interconnected we were still 10 years ago um so i think that the nice thing about victoria and for those that don't know victoria is a about a 300 000 person city on the west coast of canada on vancouver island so i'm about 30 minute flight from seattle 30-minute flight from vancouver canada and um there's something really nice about not needing to be a multi-billionaire right you can actually in if you're in victoria if you can get a couple million bucks together you can basically have the best life of anyone in town and um there's just not this endless ladder of achievement and so i felt like i won the game 10 years ago and from that point on it was like okay now i can think about you know higher pursuits or whatever i want to focus on whereas if i'd been in the in san francisco i mean i've got friends that are worth 200 300 500 million and they're still striving because they're not worth a billion uh i had one guy he's worth two billion dollars and he goes uh oh you know this person's so rich and it was someone with 20 billion dollars and i said like what like what can they do that you can't and the guy goes kind of quiet and glassy-eyed for a second and he just goes super yacht and it's just like what like who cares this is crazy yeah i mean you bring up an interesting point on like the game you called it the game you know i think of it as like the meta game like what is the game that we are all playing and is it a game that you want to be playing too and should you opt out of the game that you've been told you were gonna play i spent the first seven years of my career in private equity which is very much that game that you just said right there right it's like you know unless you're a billionaire fund manager you're nothing and um you know the the wealthy partners that have made 50 million are still working 70 80 hours a week because they're like well that guy has made a billion or a few hundred million and we got to raise bigger funds and i'm still stressed and i'm not you know spending time with kids or whatever it is um and i always just thought it was like at some point i came to the realization that i was on that treadmill and thinking like okay did i get a bigger bonus this year than last year and what did that person's but why did they get more than me and why didn't like i put in more work whatever like you start having these weird weird pathways of thoughts and i remember having this one conversation that triggered it for me where one of the uh one of the people um at another firm was was talking about one of the partners of that firm and saying how oh he's the laziest guy ever uh and like that he he worked so little and made all this money and like it's it's so stupid and like they were saying in a derogatory way and i said to the guy i was like wait doesn't that just mean that he won the game like he won the game he made more money than everyone else by working way less that sounds like an awesome thing um but there was this glorification of like the hours worked associated with getting there that just felt out of whack to me so i just realized like man what is the game that we're all playing and why are we playing it totally it's it's insane and i i mean i don't know if you guys have read uh wanting by luke harding or familiar with mimetic desire how are you guys familiar so effectively just high level you want what the people around you want right so if you're a comedian you want a netflix special if you're a musician you might want a grammy um you know if you're a professional baker you want to win great british bake off right like you just have these different desires and the the concern i have whenever i'm competing in a game is i end up wanting the things that everyone else wants so here we all are with nice hair right we're all gonna play the hair competition game make sure we always have nice hair if i lose my hair i will literally think i'm gonna die and i've lost all my worth have i no i probably look fine bald hopefully i don't have any weird moles under there but you know at the end of the day it's like i'm fine but i've defined what happiness is but it's not intrinsic happiness it's totally external um and it can be any metric right you talk to people and they're like what plane do you have right and and it's like what like that people just have crazy metrics that they value happiness on and at the end of the day none of these things actually move the needle what moves the needle is doing things that you intrinsically want where you would do it even if nobody was watching and you couldn't post it on social media right so i mean it just changes right like greg you and i have talked about like you you get to the thing that you thought was where you were gonna get to and then your number just changes and i've known so many people who were like oh when i make 15 million dollars i'm done i'm just gonna quit and then they make 15 million and then they're like well if i just got 50. 50 is the number where like i'll just quit and then they get to 50 and it's 150 and no matter what the future that you're working towards just changes the number just changes i mean it's the hedonic treadmill right it's like this whole idea that we just adapt and happiness above a hundred thousand dollars is like scientifically proven do not fundamentally change above a hundred thousand a year where you can like basically get all the baseline things that you need in life and to take care of your family at that point the only thing that changes happiness is big changes so like you get the second house and all of a sudden you're like oh sick i got a second house i'm a baller this is great and then a week later you're bitching about how it's hard to maintain and it's just the way it works you like you know i got this house in in new york and we moved here and i was so happy i was like man this place is amazing and then literally like a couple weeks later i was i found myself in my own head complaining about you know having to maintain like it has a pool i was like oh man this pool's a pain in the ass i was like oh two weeks later i was so happy about having this house and it was like my dream come true and you just find a way to adapt to it and it makes also just accepting that misery is the human condition right that's the baseline that's a zero right you're always gonna go back there you're gonna overanalyze anything you have right and there's tools that can slightly increase that to a one or a two but at the end of the day you will be miserable in some way at all times and that's okay and accepting that i actually have an iphone reminder every day and it just

so how do you build slow like for both of you i mean there's a question for both of you guys because i'm my wiring as greg knows and we have a lot of conversations about this just as friends because i've learned a lot from him on this front is like my wiring is balls to the wall for lack of a better way to put it like i just want to go put my head down and run through a wallet whatever it is i'm doing and it drives me insane sometimes because i take on way too much i'm not good at saying no to things i chase every opportunity rather than being deliberate about the best opportunities to really take on and the ones that are going to optimize my situation and happiness it leads me down a lot of bad paths you guys i perceive you know both you andrew with tiny capital which i want to hear you explain more about and greg with you know everything that you're working on now i think are both really deliberate about what you take on what you say no to and i'm just curious how you've developed that instinct and what advice you'd give to people that are trying to kind of get off a treadmill and make that change well i mean i've been doing this for 17 years and i'd say the first seven years were me literally any business idea i had no idea how to filter out good and bad i would just do it and it would drive my team insane i would throw spaghetti all over the wall and nothing would stick and i would pursue all these stupid business ideas i'd say yes to everything and have shiny object syndrome and after a very long time of doing that i realized that it didn't make me happy and that i was basically the guy walking into the gym and trying to bench press 300 pounds on day one so over time i just learned that makes me unhappy and i started learning the skills of saying no and filtering out you know the bad ideas um so for me personally i just had to learn it over time it just took time and i went through all that same stuff of being miserable being over scheduled you know saying yes too much starting dumb businesses everything um so that for me it's just the only way i seem to be able to learn is to stick forks and electrical sockets and figure it out for me i would say it comes natural to me i remember in the third grade i got glasses i had to wear glasses my mom bought me these they were ralph lauren glasses that were designer and they're really expensive and you know i don't know if we you know i didn't come from a poor family but like it was a lot of money for for to to sort of spend on it and i remember we went on a class trip the next day to quebec city and we're we're on this boat and it's like you know me and my three best friends and we're kind of on the railing just kind of looking around at the city and all of a sudden i can feel my glasses falling down and i just remember everything kind of like stopped and like my glasses were falling down and i had just told the story to my friends how these like were expensive and i kind of felt bad about it and like i was like in my mind i was like no you know and you know i all of a sudden like glasses hit the ocean and i just remember thinking to myself i could either be upset about this or just accept it for what it is like i'm not gonna jump into the ocean like i'm not you know it's freezing in there and it's it's gone right so i think like naturally i've always had that just built in i will say though when i moved to san francisco um unlike you andrew like i you know grew up in montreal and the weird thing about canada is you're kind of like you're so close right to america like montreal is a it's 40 miles it's a 40 actually it's a 40 minute drive to the new york state border so you're so close you're looking at like the center of the center of the world new york you know new york city and but you're not there so i moved to san francisco because i was like all right i want to be in it and i got caught up with the noise and why i go like why i think it's important that people have a victoria or have a you know my small town in quebec um is because it's important to kind of spend a few minutes months weeks whatever it is to just sort of center yourself and be like what really matters to me well how do you i i mean to this is to that like broader point how do you avoid the like comparison trap because like for andrew or for you greg if you're gonna do things slow and feel really fulfilled from doing that personally and and individually i think that's amazing and a great thing and you're gonna come you know you can compound wealth over the long term with something like tiny and you're building and you're trying to build something enduring and sustainable and lasting but the challenge i've always faced and i think that a lot of young people face is you're constantly hit with this barrage of like to your point earlier andrew so and so raised from sequoia at a billion after launching the company you know two weeks ago uh paradigm investing at a billion for some new crypto thing that my friend started you know so and so made forbes 20 under 20 or whatever the you know latest accolade is that forbes charges for uh to uh to put people in uh no offense to actually i guess offense to forbes uh and uh you know how do you avoid that aspect of it well i think um two things one i realized what it meant so i've always thought that raising money at first i'd be impressed i go oh wow you know sequoia invested a billion dollar valuation the 100 million dollars you go oh wow did they sell their stock they got 100 million dollar windfall and it's like no no like sequoia who are like the most intense mfers in the world just join the board they're going to hold a gun to that person's head and say you need to grow your company 300 a year you need to spend as much money as possible to go there and that ceo's life is [ __ ] that's the equivalent of somebody saying i'm going out i'm putting myself into personal debt and i'm getting uh credit cards at 30 annualized interest right to me i'm just like oh no i don't want that once i knew what it was so that was fine and the cool thing about what i did and i'm sure greg has had the same experience is my business metalab was selling pickaxes to gold miners in silicon valley so we would provide the services to help them build their business design development etc and we didn't take the risk so whether the company fails or not we're not risking alongside of them and i got to be a fly on the wall in a lot of these board meetings and conversations and see the tremendous stress and misery that these founders render and then i would compare it to my life and i'd go sure you know my company is not worth 100 million dollars but i'm making 500k a year a couple million bucks a year living a great life in victoria no this is pretty good number two was once i understood compounding and i could do basic math i realized that i was going to be way wealthier than any of the people that i knew even the people who had billion dollar companies because i just knew that if i was compounding my capital and reinvesting you know 80 of what i made eventually the numbers would get huge and i kept i built a spreadsheet where i was like okay in 2010 where will i be at in 2015 2020 2025 and when i started noticing that i was actually following the trend line i was like okay this compounding stuff works and it felt like the tortoise and the hair right you're just slowly chugging along the hair is running like a maniac and getting exhausted and i'm just slowly compounding it you know 25 a year um and now i you know when i see someone who's got more money or whatever it is i just go okay well if i just keep compounding you know i'll be good that separation of perception from reality that you mentioned is such an important one and i think candidly it's just like there's an information gap there's probably a business in just like providing more open insight and information around the way these things work like i thought i just watched um the new wework document series the with uh with jared leto and hathaway which if people haven't seen it's on apple tv it's pretty exceptional i thought it was really really well done and very cringe just as cringe as you hope it to be but one of the things i thought was interesting i watched it with my wife she doesn't understand you know the way startups and funding work and it led to a lot of interesting discussions where like at the very end of the show you know there's spoiler alert i suppose there's this scene where like i think it's jamie dimon is talking to adam newman to basically convince him to step down as ceo and adam's like i'm never going to go out i you know i won't do it and jamie diamond is like well here's how it's going to play out wework is going to run out of cash the company is going to go bankrupt we've loaned you 380 million dollars against your shares in that company that are going to be worth zero you still have to pay us back for that and so you you just ran this 44 billion company or hero of the world are literally going to be financially ruined for the rest of your life and people i mean it was so shocking to my wife she was like wait but they have that apartment and the house in the hamptons and they have all the stuff and i was like no they don't like you know it's not theirs like you're renting somebody from somebody at the end of the day if you're borrowing the money to do that um but that perception and reality gap around startup funding uh you know raising the round from tiger raising the run from sequoia whatever it is and you've made it is such a big one i find especially during bull markets i learned a really great tip around this from our friend julian smith or this concept is called uh i think he called it the personal board of advisors so uh every week julian and i used to meet at 7am we used to have these monday morning meetings called the punch you in the face meeting i think no one wants to meet for coffee at 7am especially in montreal when it's like minus 40 in the winter time and we'd go and it's one of the first things he taught me and he said greg it's really important to have a board of advisors in your head and he's like who's on your board of advisors and i started thinking about it and at first i was kind of like elon musk type people and jack dorsey um but eventually what i've grown to realize is it's important to have these yeah a more balanced board so i was like my grandfather my mom you know andrew sahil like and maybe one elon musk and now when i make decisions like hey should i go on this podcast or hey should i buy this business i asked myself what would each of these individual people on my imaginary board of advisors in my head say to this and that's been like one of the biggest keys for me to like make decisions that are more true to myself i love that i think one of the biggest problems is that everybody hypothetically wants to be elon musk they want the celebrity and the glamour and the genius of it but if you've read interviews with elon musk you can see that the guy is very i think probably troubled and has a very difficult life very exciting life very true to himself i'm glad he exists but when i look at his life i go oh my god i you know i could never do that i think it would make me incredibly miserable um and that's the thing is finding people who you believe are not only authentically happy but similar to you so one of the errors that i made was in 2012 i uh or sorry 2014 i sold a business was sitting on a bunch of cash started reading about investing and read about buffett and monger and it blew my mind you know i loved it i started worshipping these two guys and i started copying everything so literally structured our business operated the exact same way they do um you know everything i could do and i thought what i would want was their life and their life is they sit on their ass and they read 10ks and books all day and i tried that for a while and i hated it i realized that i'm still entrepreneurial i'm extroverted i would say you know maybe those guys are a little bit on the spectrum they just want to absorb data um you know that's not me and so if you worship someone i think you can learn a lot from them but you don't necessarily want their lie like their life and i am still trying to find that person like who who do i want to be when i grow up and i think it's so helpful to just be like yeah my grandpa i really like my grandpa you know what would he say right versus trying to be elon musk i've always thought to that exact point i've always thought one of the most helpful um sort of like hypotheticals that i've played out in my own mind is uh take two different people one person uh extraordinarily wealthy you know has made 200 plus million dollars but is like sort of known as kind of an [ __ ] like a scumbag people don't want to spend time with him or her um don't like the person you know sort of known as like a shady operator just generally like super rich can afford literally anything in the world the money's good but uh not really like someone that you'd people want to hang out with or spend time with or or not someone that is well respected on the other end of the spectrum a um a person who has very little money or like not a ton of money enough to be good and healthy and pay for things but not rich you know a million dollar network 500 000 net worth can live in a city but not lavishly wealthy by any means but is extraordinarily well respected smart people just flock to the person want to spend tons of time with them um you know want to ask for their advice perspectives ideas brainstorms etc always sought out where do you exist on that spectrum of who you would want to be and i think it's a spectrum i don't think it's one or the other i always ask the question as a hypothetical one or the other because it's interesting to figure out which side you more closely align to and for me personally i would much rather be the latter i would much rather be because what i care about most deeply is not money actually or fame or any of those things it's getting to spend time with smart people and that is what i find the most energy from is like things like this where i get to sit here and for a job i get to talk to two really smart people and that is insane to me and it's a massive privilege but that realization for me has clarified a lot of things because then it means that i don't want to chase money for the sake of money i want to do things that are going to get me in rooms with really smart people and i want to do interesting things that maybe attract smart people into my orbit and do things you know the right way hopefully quote unquote that allow me to be the type of person that smart people flock to as well do you guys know uh there's this friend of mine nick gray you've ever heard of that yeah for sure i'm uh nick here let's give nick a quick shout out because i have it right over here dude i have that too what is it okay so so nick is somebody that i've been following for probably 15 years i would there's all these people in new york who i was friends with on tumblr and so um for years i kind of just passively followed him really interesting guy actually at one point stayed in his apartment while he was away and i've just kept track of this guy for a long time and he started what's called nick gray's friends newsletter and he sends this out i think every month and it's basically just here's all the interesting [ __ ] i've done right so it could be hey guys i bought a tesla here's me video reviewing it hey guys i learned the perfect way to do a kettlebell swing hey guys here's my breakfast routine and he's he's actually just written a book um that i don't know if he's cool with us talking about but basically it's a i'll just broad strokes it's a very good well-written book on how to socialize how to build meaningful connections with others and one of the things i've found is that the richest people are do not necessarily have the richest lives right in fact great wealth often isolates you know they have security teams they don't trust people people are always pitching them the most interesting people are the ones that actually find creative ways to use small amounts of money to live a really great life and this is something i've thought a lot about recently of like what are the things that have actually made me happier and for example one of them is i just host lunches i host lunches i rent out a restaurant i have a whole bunch of interesting friends come i put out down name tags and get people together and i love connecting people and being around smart people that's it right to me that's the ultimate way to use money to be happy but that is not something that's expensive right you don't need to be a billionaire to do that right and then you think about like well if you're a billionaire what would the version of that be okay we're gonna fly to the galapagos islands on my g6 and we're gonna stay in a crazy fancy hotel well maybe that's worse because everyone feels indebted to you and they're awkward about it and there's all this status like i i think wealth just in many ways just makes that stuff worse so a couple weeks ago on the pod i was saying my inspiration of the week was mike posner who's super you know he he ran across america and he almost he got bit by rattlesnake and i just thought he's really cool my recent obsession is tom green's youtube channel tom green tom green is a comedian can i remember him of course i remember him from way back in the day he used to do the songs right he did songs uh he he had a tv show in canada i think in the 90s where he basically stopped people in ottawa and just like kind of just say goofy stuff and and it was filmed and then he oh he was freddy got fingered yeah he did yeah exactly then he moved to la he had a few movies did really well um he was actually one of the og podcasters like joe rogan actually was like attributes tom green to getting into podcasting um so he was in that scene and then when covet hit he got a van uh and he drove across america this is seems like a theme and he landed somewhere outside ottawa and he bought a a uh i don't know a bunch of acres um in the middle of nowhere and he has this youtube channel where he basically it's him and his dog and they've got a barn and he's discovering animals and he's having fun and i will tell you this guy just looks like the happiest guy in the planet tom green is a happy guy like tom green is a thousand times more happy than elon musk well this is the thing is how do you find five tom greens to hang out with right or how do you so this this is one other thing is like we're all hanging out we're all interesting people we're talking about business and life and some of that stuff how do you meet the people that are not in your own bubble because we all exist in the same bubble i mean sahil we talked for 10 minutes and we're like we knew like 30 people in common even though we've never met right this is a very incest to a small world but there's fascinating people in every every industry um that have day jobs that are just you know they work normal lives they are artists they're musicians whatever how do you find those people how do you bring them into your life and how do you create new interests that are unique because the struggle i've had is for 10 years all i've read is business right so like i've started reading fiction over the last six months or so which has been great but i just need to de-program my brain from consuming the same things and doing the same things over and over and over again okay so i have a tip here and the tip is hang out with old people period i spent you know you know what i did from 6 a.m to 7 a.m today i was in a hot tub with a 97 year old man who was in the military and was telling me about you know vietnam and was telling me about you know multiple wars and it was just like telling me about family and and and you know i don't know what he has done like he's pro like besides from that i don't know maybe he went and created a billion dollar company i don't know but like probably not he's probably just an old guy who like served in the military and i don't think well we do a good enough job spending time with older people and the way to do it is go to public settings like i also don't think we do like we spend a lot of our time in private settings you know soho house this or whatever you know these like private settings or like high-end restaurants and stuff like that and we don't spend enough time like go to your public pool like go to your public park it doesn't have to be in a hot tub that you hang out with old people though right it doesn't have to although it is more enjoyable the other the other two things i've been doing recently that have been really interesting so with my existing friends um one i do this thing um i basically do a ypo forum with six guys and i've been doing it for 15 years and i have a few of them so i do one a week and it sounds like it's business but it's really not we almost always end up just talking about personal stuff family life and you learn so much more about someone than if you're just friends some of these people if i was friends with them for 15 years i would never hear this stuff so that that's been good the other thing i started doing recently is using structured conversations so i will sit down with a friend and i'll bring a pack of cards and the cards will just be random deep questions and it's fascinating there's people i've known for 20 plus years and i'll hear all these stories about their life for their family that i never never would have got you can buy those at i think it's schooloflife.com um there's they're just incredible um but i am trying to crack this right and reading nick's book was fascinating um not enough people talk about the tactics of having an interesting life well it's it's also just about being interested like it's so easy to go through your own life thinking about like who can benefit me and having this like transactional mindset whether or not you are truly transactional a lot of us have a transactional mindset so you get into an uber and you're like i'm going to a meeting you know with some important person and the whole time you're in the uber you're thinking about whatever the important person is and what you're trying to you know whatever deal or whatever trade you're trying to make with them and you lose sight of the fact that the uber driver might have a really interesting life story and if you just ask them like hey you know how's your day going like what's been you know causing you headaches like what's interesting whatever you end up having this amazing conversation like greg with the old guy in the hut like if you didn't say hello and ask about his life you'd never learn all these interesting things i've often thought about it in the context of like going to bars alone i think personally every single person should have at least one dinner by themselves per month just like go out by yourself and sit at a bar talk to the bartender talk to random people sitting there it's weird in america people will look at you and be like why are you talking to me but in most cultures in the world it's like super normal and great that you're talking to your neighbor and people around you and so it's something that needs to adapt in american culture and it's actually coastal american culture if you go to the midwest and you go to like a local bar everyone wants to talk and people are super friendly so i think it's something about like coastal culture you're supposed to like keep your head down and do whatever you know whatever it is you're up to i've often dreamed and i think i will do this at some point in my life of taking like two three weeks or maybe even a month and driving around to different parts of the country and just like staying in random places and doing a night or two and just going to like the local dive bar and the local pizza shop and just sitting and talking to random people and like maybe documenting it maybe not but i like read a book uh that someone did that and it was it was more it was written about trying to understand how trump won and they went and like drove across america all these different places and did this um but i would do it with no you know political business whatever aims it would just be interesting to go talk and meet all these people from different settings understand how they're wired what you know what interests them what concerns them all of that but it all comes down to being actually interested well the problem also we have this breakdown in our society where you people used to be much more religious i'm not religious i'm you know atheist agnostic but you used to go to church and church was this you know central place where you connect with a whole wide variety of different people and you'd go you know into the you go shopping at the market you'd see people and now we've just we have these very insular lives and we've lost that friction and in my 20s i would go to bars all the time right i would go out drinking i'd make random friends i would do all those things as i had kids and marriage and everything else it's amazing how those things slip away and you have to create new rituals to create that stuff i have this idea for a party or cocktail party or something but effectively you invite you choose six very interesting unique friends who you know enough but not super well and you say i'm hosting a party i'll handle everything um everybody gets to invite six friends three male three female they just have to be interesting and you end up with this mix of people and like i wanna do stuff like that i just wanna do these hacks to meet people i wouldn't otherwise know because otherwise you end up in this very sad state where you know in your 30s and 40s your friends dwindle down to this core group and you know it's lovely but you're just not getting new people in i like that yeah you end up i like that a lot i think the one thing i just want to add to that is i think a lot about the importance of public spaces and how cities are designed and i'm worried that over the last 30 years we've had a lot less public spaces and i'll give you an example so at least in america or north america so i remember as a kid going to the public pool and i'd go the public pool and like the community was there and i'd meet other kids and and like all parents were there and we used to hang out over time over the years i noticed less and less people used to go to the public pool started asking why turns out like people started creating pools in their own backyards they wanted private pools and then the the the trend became like the privatization of these like public goods so i i worry about that a bit like i want to give i think it's important that we invest in our public spaces so that it isn't just like cocktail parties and houses and also public events what do you guys think you know what it's i think it's brilliant it also all relates to one of my favorite um have you guys do you know who jonathan height hate h-a-i-d-t he's like an amazing writer author he writes for the atlantic now um and he had you know like this general piece that he wrote that was really well known around like basically uh how we've become so fearful and this was about american society but we became so fearful about our kids and i think it ties to this greg of like privatizing everything because we suddenly got scared that our kids couldn't be out like no you couldn't go to the public pool on your own i mean when i was a kid i used to just walk to the pool and like meet my friends there and i was probably like eight or ten or something i would just go i didn't have a cell phone like my parents didn't know where i was i was just gone during the day and then i would come back and there wasn't this intrinsic fear and then all of a sudden news cycles start changing about like child abductions and cell phones are hitting you with all this stuff and now every kid needs a cell phone by age seven so that they can be tracked and monitored at all times like you know you put a baby monitor on your kid that has like a heart sensor and all it's just like insane insane proliferation of like tracking and fear of what's going to happen if we're just out in a out in the open and so i think part of it greg is that like we've developed this fear of public spaces so we brought everything back in into these private spaces where like oh the town pool is not safe because my kid can't walk there so i'm gonna have a pool here and he can have his friends here but suddenly you lose your independence you lose the uh the exploration that was so transformative to how we thought and grew and developed as kids and that scares the [ __ ] out of me like raising a child now i had i i remember like really key moments of independence where my parents would be like okay you want to go to the computer store like go downtown there's a pay phone here call us when you get there and we'll see you in four hours right and i would go off and i would just feel so confident and independent i never had any problems um and i think that today that would be seen as kind of insane and i think it's because we've been watching all these movies where every time you see an old man at the park he's a pedophile and he's going to abduct your children and there's pattern matching i've found myself do this right i'll be at the park see some old guy reading and go is that you know is that a creep and it's kind of like optimizing your life around a jet engine falling out of the sky and killing you because that's how likely that is to occur right it's like the odds of being in a terrorist attack or something else are just so much higher it's not even worth thinking about almost you're you're more likely to be your kid's more likely to die in the pool in your backyard or falling down the stairs than any of those you know kind of silly fears yeah i think if you map to the things that people are afraid of versus the things that are actually risky it would be absurd there was like the whole stat post 911 where um plane flight like no one took plane flights because everyone was scared of another terrorist attack and so people stopped flying and the miles driven that year went through the roof because everyone started driving places and the number of additional traffic accidents and deaths that happened from those additional miles driven was like far in excess of the number of people that had died in 9 11. and it's not to you know make light of it but it's an amazing fact of like the human inability to weigh and balance risks like that where way more people died from 9 11 as an indirect result of people being scared all of a sudden because of the news cycle around what terrorist attacks had done to the world it's crazy crazy and you know at the same time even like nick i remember nick and this guy that greg and i know invited me to a party in new york and i was freaking i didn't end up going i was i was busy but i was scared to go right the idea of going to this party where i don't know anyone and there's all this social anxiety that's how you know insular we've become right i'm a nick i'm an extrovert i love meeting people and i was like terrified to go to this party i just had a conversation with um you guys know tim urban um i just had a conversation with him about this exact thing of how he was like i love being alone but i was on this trip and i was like the fifth wheel with there were these random groups and suddenly i noticed myself being all like self-conscious that they were looking at me and it started pissing him off that he was feeling that way like he realized he was feeling that way it started annoying him that he was feeling that way and like it's the spotlight effect is the name of the bias where we assume everyone's looking at us uh constantly the reality is no one really cares

and look every almost everyone anyone who understands the scale of the universe and thinks about how probability works almost all comes to the same conclusion of course we're not alone right it's like if you picked up one great note we have one example which is what happened on earth if you picked up one grain of sand from a beach and you looked in the microscope and you saw it was crawling with little critters you wouldn't conclude well maybe this is the only one that has that you'd say of course i'm sure they're on all kinds of you know i didn't just pick up the one that has it right [Music] dude great to uh great to meet you and thank you so much for taking the time yeah i'm happy to uh meet at one of my twitter friends i know exactly well it feels like everyone at this point is a twitter friend that i'm now meeting in real life like over the last two three years some of my best friends in the world now are just like people that were anonymously on twitter it's like a genuinely good way to um to meet people like they're like like twitter sucks in 100 ways but like the it's like really like fantastically great for like three or four really important things um yeah i found that it like yeah to your point it's it's both ends of the spectrum right it's i guess it's like anything else in life there's like the one percent you tweeted it actually just recently about like advice filters um and trust filters and i feel that same way it's like you need to know and figure out how to find the one percent that is super interesting that you're really going to engage with and learn a lot from um amidst all of the noise that is out there yeah you i think like it depending on who you follow it can be um a great way to learn a great way to like get a quick feel for you know to keep your finger on the pulse of what's going on it's a great way to do that in a way that like if you were just checking random news sites versus you know because twitter doesn't just teach doesn't just show you what the news is it shows you what the perception of the news is and it shows you what the arguments about the news and the different you know viewpoints and the different you can and if you follow the right you know array of people it actually gives you a feel for what's going on in every bubble you know yeah i had a really interesting conversation on this exact topic with a new york times journalist who i won't name but who's very famous well-known literally earlier this week and he was saying that they just had a memo go around internally at the new york times that basically encouraged them to stop using twitter so much and to stop reading so much because they have an internal perception that it is like five percent of what's actually happening but commanding 95 of their mind share of what is happening and so they're worried that it's like skewing their journalistic integrity or their the journalism so i'm curious just like generally how other people think about that i haven't floated it with anyone else since having that conversation today i am so excited to talk about riverside riverside is the leading platform for studio quality remote podcasts and video recordings from anywhere we absolutely love it at where it happens and you're going to love it too greg what have you enjoyed most about riverside what's amazing about riverside is

head over to fundrise.com room again that's f-u-n-d-r-i-s-e dot com slash room to get started today my instinct is that that's it's hard because on one hand like what's going on on twitter is part of what's going on in reality like and it has a big effect on things so you know you don't want to totally have your head in the sand and just pretend it doesn't exist but i do think that we you know we're like we're really um social beings like i uh this is a random story here uh i i always used to like love traveling alone right it was one of my favorite things and you know the first time i you know i went i was kind of like oh i'm go to like a restaurant alone i'm in a foreign country this is still like embarrassing i'm like i started to like reframe and i was like this is not hey none of these people know who i am and they'll never see them again um but b it's like why would i be embarrassed anyway it's like who cares if anyone thinks and and i got into this mode where i suddenly was just like so comfortable being alone traveling whatever but then i found myself on like a little tour uh it was like in the amazon uh and it was this is one of my solo trips and it was a little tour and they were like and i often made friends you know i was very social when i went so i often did meet people and i like you know i liked making friends from other countries and i went to them this tour and there was this uh there was like six of us and i guess like the other the four of them like two couples or whatever had like gotten to know each other um and then the fifth one was like another european and they kind of befriended that person and i was like an american i don't know why they didn't like americans or they didn't they didn't like me but i felt very like out grouped in in a way it was like it was like a two-day thing and i found myself like caring so much about being outgrouped by five randos who i literally was never gonna see again and like it was just it was just a reminder that like there's a mechanism in our brain that can be flipped on and make us insane like to for me to care about being outgrouped by this group of complete strangers was like it was because i appreciate it even at the time i was like this is super irrational but i was really kind of upset about it three days after it was over i was like why did i care but anyway so back to twitter i think that what twitter does is it has a lot of dynamics on it a lot of kind of in-group out group bullying like you know um uh you know slandering and and it has like you know uh you know people have their crew they have you know that agree with them and people like me you know we we tweet we retweet this stuff whatever it is and i think it like switches on kind of a kind of a crazy part of our brains and i could see journalists kind of getting wrapped up in it and suddenly kind of feeling that like middle school kind of social pressure and and i don't think that's that's probably i don't think that's good for many people and i think journalists especially so it was a roundabout way of kind of explaining why i think it might be bad well i love that story because i've often talked about how i think a lot of society's problems or your individual problems would be solved if you went out on a date by yourself once a month and just like sat at a bar by yourself with your own thoughts i think we've lost as a society our ability to be uh in solitude and experience solitude because we're constantly you know we're on our phones i've got my phone you're getting pinged there's just stimuli all around you and so we've lost the ability to just be alone and i think that when you do that when you re-engage that sense a lot of positives come from it to your point it's interesting some of the like biases and psychological impacts of it like the spotlight effect which you kind of referred to um we constantly think that other people are looking at us the reality is everyone's just thinking about themselves everyone's selfish and just thinking about themselves no one cares how you look sitting alone at the bar nobody's thinking about you um but it's such a funny and even if someone is like it you have to if you just like it the the thought that it matters is a very crazy part of your brain that cares that it's like oh you know like you know when i'm in a good zone that kind of is comfortable and in a mature zone i can i can be pretty sure that other people i know even like people i know well are talking [ __ ] about me and i don't and it rolls off my back and i say you know i talk [ __ ] about people like it happens it's okay of course that's when i'm in a really good zone you know and when you're in a bad zone like you just like you care so much about social things yeah it's a uh it's such a funny like the ability to pull yourself away from your your own internal uh feelings like that is very rare i feel like i personally i i won't comment on my own uh experience with this but i've heard that when people are under the influence of psychedelic uh drugs or medicines that you have some people have the ability to step away from what they're feeling and so you're like wow there's all this crazy stuff going on but then you can pull back from it and experience it as like what is happening in my brain this is an interesting experience and process which is part of why scientists think there's a huge um you know potential use of for treatments of depression and other psychological disorders as well you can like unpack and deconstruct your own um your own perspectives and emotions well yeah it's like i feel like uh if usually you're kind of um the way i kind of like it's if you're in um a sphere of like you know experiences and feelings and um thoughts yeah it's like psychedelics allows you to kind of like step outside and look at the sphere and like maybe look at it from other angles and like walk around it look under it and like and that is um uh incredible like it's an incredible um uh tool it relates to um exactly how i wanted to it's funny we had a roundabout way of leading to the exact thing that i wanted to frame up this discussion with and i always think about like what is the right way to um sort of frame up like as a framework or mental model the kind of line of of discussion and and chat and you know i thought i would kind of go meta here in uh using one of your own pieces one of my favorite pieces from wait but y um which was your neural ink piece and you had a line in there that i just thought was fantastic and i think it's a great way of framing up the discussion and what you said was i learned that you can only fully wrap your head around certain companies abstract companies to really anything by zooming both way way in and way way out in on the technical challenges facing the engineers out on the existential challenges facing our species in on a snapshot of the world right now out on the big story of how we got to this moment and what our far future could look like so maybe just to kick off what did you mean by that when you when you wrote that um and i want to just kind of use that thread of zooming way in and zooming way out to examine a few different a few different topics today yeah i think um i just in general are talking about zooming i to me it's like a very uh it's a it's an axis kind of you know that we can be on it's a spectrum of um how can i think backed up or you know sometimes i think about it as you're backing up but i think maybe sometimes even a better metaphor is like uh you're so um when you're zoomed in it's like you're on a beach and you can like look down you know you really know you're on a beach and you're looking around you see so like the coast goes around you know wraps around over there and over there and you see some you know water goes out and you just you don't see anything else um and so first of all you can zoom in which is you could take a microscope and start examining the grains of sand and um you know just really getting down there and and understanding how did this happen how did each grain of sand get you know get like this and um you know how how do these trees grow and you know what are these little tiny organisms doing but to me you know what what's so that that's one that's one thing that i think can help you really understand a beach better but um often we're you know we're looking at something and we don't know is this are we on an island is this part of a continent is this is this a little strip stretch of a ton of beach or is this the only little area of beach uh is that am i looking at a lake a big lake or is this the ocean um and so what what we can do is like if you i think about like a news story if a news story that day is just like looking at a strip of beach sometimes you don't know like is that news is this new story actually important like how like in 10 years will russia ukraine be like one of the biggest things of the decade or will it be like this kind of like oh yeah remember that russia ukraine thing that was on for like four months like it's hard to know right like um there's all these you know stories that it's so i think of it as a helicopter you go up and now you can see more you can start to like so if you if you look back at them last month um and i know i'm like yeah bringing news stories and now it's a little bit convoluted but basically if you look at the last month of news stories you can start to see like oh okay this matters that's like when you can like zoom up and you can see the whole um kind of region here but you still can't really see is this how big is this place is it continent is a huge island i don't know you go up farther and farther until you're actually now you can see actually okay now you can you can see the whole continent and the outline of it and where you were on it and you go up even further you can see the whole earth and you can kind of fully see to me it's like um if you you know if you zoomed out uh um on a lot of things you can see the huge huge story and and so often i think we're like caught in the middle um we're caught in the middle like time wise as i said with like news stories like it's hard to it's it's hard for us to see the big big picture here what's the real overarching story that's going on in 2022 right now and and and you know we time gives us that that helicopter hindsight um uh but also it's not just time it's also just you know in an industry if there's a company well what's the big story of this company what's really going on in this industry what are the major forces in play so i think um um we need to do a lot more zooming out uh the best we can obviously again hindsight helps and um certain statistics can help to get a feel for uh i i think that uh whenever i want to understand something that's my instinct he's like what's the big big story going on like what's all of this a part of again is this is this part of an island is this part of a giant continent is this it's you know how relevant is each thing but then also zooming in um i find that so often like we just again we're caught in the middle where we like read the news story um or we um we we understand you know we try to study how a company works or you know the basic deal with the company uh but it's when you you know if you go in and you actually talk to the engineers and start to understand the problems they're facing you watch what they're doing on a wednesday at 2 p.m and you sit in on some of the meetings it's amazing how much clearer everything gets suddenly when you look back to what you thought like a week ago before all this and you're like wow i i really had this like depiction that was just wrong it was not accurate um it's so interesting because my perception is that we often spend i think most humans spend the vast majority of their time in the middle not zoomed in not zoomed down it's because it's most comfortable right that's like the the point of peak abstraction where uh to use your thought experiment um the pencil just looks like a pencil and you don't worry about it and you're like yeah write with it you know this is my thing it's my pencil and zooming in is really uncomfortable because you go in and you realize all of the different components and like your thought experiment of no one in the world knows how to build a pencil because it has lead and or what you know all of the different components of it not there's not a single human who can build that pencil and know how to put it the entire thing together but then when you zoom out it's also really uncomfortable you zoom out and you're like what is the meaning of all of this and what how does the pencil how has that changed society over the last thousand years you know in all of the writing and so most people because it's the most comfortable end up just sitting in the middle and you kind of play that like peak abstraction throughout your entire life the middle is important too it's just that it's only one of the areas and yeah it's actually probably the best place to live but to understand you kind of need to go to both extremes yeah and it's probably the point where it's like you go to both extremes and then you can coast in the middle and be happy and like feel fulfilled in there and i do think uh the secret of if you if it's some of the most you know people who seem super prescient like they can just you know read the future amazing at investing in stocks or they're incredible entrepreneurs they just can see opportunities or whatever it is um i think even you know stand-up comedians you know which is a good standard comedian is they really see the the the bigger social forces going on and they can point them out in a way that everyone says oh my god that's so true you know i think that one thing that people have in common is that they often are really good at the zoom in and zoom out like elon musk classic example like no one's a better zoom outer i mean he he he just seems to like see the overarching farthest back stories of like uh you know humanity is you know the um uh like trying to keep the light of human consciousness uh uh uh and and he sees um you know the the the major existential threats uh he just thinks that's where his head is he's always thinking about that but then also you know he knows exactly the four elements that make up the paint on the rocket you know and and you know and he can tell you how much the rocket weighs uh more if you use this paint versus that paint and you know every single component of the tesla you know he can tell you about so but when you have that level of both out and in kind of clarity it just um you're just like seeing without any fog you know we have so much so if you think about it as you know we see it in the middle kind of even there you know the middle often we can get deceived if you don't see the top and bottom you know we can often be deceived by news stories you know or by by you know headlines and you know you know kind of dogmatic story lines like you know political narratives can kind of fool us but when you when you really see the big big picture and then you also kind of understand what's going on i feel like it's at the small level i think it's just you're much harder to trick and you can you can work magic uh in investing and entrepreneurship and the arts and other things like that so i i want to spend like a couple of minutes doing a zoom in zoom out on you um i feel like everybody uh knows you as you know the most popular blogger in the world whether or not uh that's like an official title you might not be in the guinness book of world records for that i don't know if people still make those or if they're uh they commanded like a massive outsized share of my childhood i kind of took a view it was like it was like one of the it was like the peak you know that was the pinnacle of human achievement was being in the guinness book of world records in my mind it was like one of the main it was like one of the three or four main things it was like right it was like it really i tweeted out something uh maybe like i don't know a few weeks ago like what was one thing that you thought was really important when you were a kid that actually turned out to be totally useless and like the most common responses were guinness book of world records um and then the other ones which i thought which i find hilarious are like quicksand uh piranhas like the bermuda triangle i really wondered why no one was looking into the bermuda triangle i was like man planes are falling out of the sky in this thing and no one's nightmare to it nightmarish yeah i mean quicksand is a very good one like i think part part of it has to do with the princess bride um but i think it's just in general it was it was in cartoons and it was like it was like very kind of a scary part of life yeah it was quick i mean i thought i was like really going to encounter that stuff as an adult i really thought that was going to be a part of my life so back to the broader point on you um like you know you were born now you're here you know kind of what what happened in between how did you um you know form your maps of reality like what were the what were the kind of um key parts of your life that you feel like have impacted where you are today um yeah i uh i think i've always just kind of been an analytical person like i just it's just my instinct to um when something is going on or i feel a certain way or something happens to just like try to categorize it you know and um and and like make sense of it in a way and and and and so i also then like people who do that i end up connecting well with them and when i find someone who also happens to do that we become really good friends um because we just do a lot of that um and so were there downsides to that were there ever downsides from a relationship standpoint or growing up where you kind of felt different as a result of that analytical nature um i mean there's downsides in that it just can like you're thinking you're just thinking all the time right it's hard you can take you out of being present um i think it can cause you anxiety i think you can overanalyze stuff i think if something unfortunate happens like instead of just being like yeah that was a bummer you might like really you you might like internalize exactly how big a mistake it was in a way that like you know been better to kind of just not be thinking so hard about it um i always thought you were a pitcher right yeah yes baseball fidget toy that i carry around yeah like i i would have uh been an awful uh match for that because i would have been like you know um you know i don't know because you know i'm just saying i'm like a relief pitcher and i come in and and i and i you know i have two outs and there's like a man on second and i just like in my head i would start thinking whether this third guy gets out or gets a hit is the difference between my entire like like week being like a good having been like a good you know weekend like and like you know and then of course it's like the playoffs i would i would have a moment when i'm like i would just not be able to get it out of my head that like this what i do now will like affect the rest of my life you can extrapolate by the way like i bet there is a very clear correlation if you looked at pictures the one common thread that i always found among great pitchers and i think it applies to all athletes i actually think it applies to entrepreneurs is this like almost irrational arrogance uh around your own abilities and like with pitchers you had to be so uh irrational that you could go out and give up a grand you know the worst outing of your life and come out of the game and be like those guys suck man that was you know lucky whatever like i'm way better than that's [ __ ] uh you had to have that like completely irrational it made no sense if you actually evaluated every single outing you would have gone nuts and to your point you'd never be able to do it at scale yeah yeah you have to have some kind of um kind of like emotional shield that's just like when when bad things happen just like bounces off so you stay strong you know and um and so i think i think you know analytical people like analytical i'm not even sure is the word just i don't know whatever it is but like it's a little bit of a zoom out thing like i guess if i were pitching i'd be zooming out and being like i see the whole career and be like oh [ __ ] like this might be my one time in the playoffs like if or you know like if i like uh you know whatever it is like i would the zoom out is not helpful in that moment you know it's like you want to totally it's kind of like a weird partially uh permeable shield too like to your point on the shield i think that's a great reference but you sort of need something to break through so that you can actually adapt and get better too you want like most of it to deflect off and shoot off back into space and the like little inkling of insight that might make you better the next time out to actually permeate and kind of hit you i think that goes for a lot more than sports too like i think if you think about um your beliefs your ideas and who you are as a person your personality like the way you are i think it's good to be a little bit on the arrogant side a little bit like enough where you're like proud of who you are you're confident in what you know and and uh your values and your beliefs and you go with them you're not always you know rethinking them or questioning them or self-doubt you know you're you're maybe even have a little less than rational self-doubt like you know you're you're kind of just like this is who i am i'm proud of it and that is what i believe and i think that that's a good thing to a point um and i think that it's like that's a and it's like you said you have to you have to mix that with being able to sometimes say something's not working for me here or maybe i can grow up a little bit in this way or maybe i'm wrong about this like and if you can't do that now it's like a rubber shield that's so thick because maybe you're so maybe you're so scared of what it would feel like to not have that because usually once it gets when arrogance gets to a certain point i think it's not a result of confidence it's a result of some kind of fear when it gets to and now it's a rubbish shield all new information bounces off of all negative feedback bounces off of and you know you know you know you can tell when someone's like this when they get negative feedback they get really angry and they end up even more sure of themselves and they hate that person i mean that's someone who has a i think an arrogance a problem with feedback um but i i think that um being totally rational about like maybe i well maybe i should question this because that's i don't i think i think it's that's actually can can be a paralyzing place and you can quickly drift when you think of this as like a spectrum of arrogance all the way down to like insecurity you can drift below that totally rational line to a place where now you're you're doubting yourself even when it doesn't make sense to you right and so um but like for example like this is the kind of thing i've always done for we're having this conversation and now in my head i've formed a an axis a spectrum that goes from arrogant with a dotted line in the middle totally rational down to totally insecure and then i think the right thing is like a quarter of the or third of the way from the dotted line to the but that's just like that's just how i think i've always done that right um or like i remember in college i met these a couple of my best friends you know we really connected over our just like we were really really interested in the topic of like how to find love like how to find the right person to marry or whatever um what what makes a good relationship first is a bad what should deal breakers be so so much so many of the things i write like i've written now a couple posts about that kind of thing and so many of those emerge from these conversations um that i've had and like i remember we were like you know i kind of come up with a theory um you know just talking i was like okay i think what matters is um you know three there's three things that you have to be good and then everything else can be bad and it's fine like the three things have to be you have to have like a general attraction you can't just see them as like your buddy you have to you have to have like a crush or you know you know physical attraction of some kind of physical attraction is you know especially at the beginning but like if it starts off with a lot of that i think that carries you it's always feels a little more special than just a friend so there has to be something there um there has to be like a best friendship type thing where like you don't want to feel like when you're out to dinner with your person and then also your friends and you're having so much fun with your friends and you then they leave and you're heading home with your person you're like damn it's just just us again like you don't want to feel that way you want to feel excited oh it's just us now we can like really get into it you know um like you you don't want to feel like bummed out that like your friends aren't there all the time because you're just kind of bored with your person and i i actually used something called the traffic test there which is if you know there's certain friends of mine uh friends family members who when i'm i like talking to them so much i have so much fun just being with them and just talking to them that when we're like in a car somewhere and i'm driving them home right or vice versa i'm actually like it's pumped up when we hit traffic i'm like yes traffic yes we have more time as opposed to like you know normally traffic sucks i think that your person should pass the traffic test you know you should it should be one of those people uh where it's just super fun okay and then the third area so there's like attraction like best friendship the third area is just like a deep trust that you just like you just know that they're you feel a very good person you feel like they're just like they're they're they're like you know deep down they're that you totally trust them they're not gonna like hurt you badly you're not like kind of always like scared that you're gonna get you know or you know you can just kind of be yourself and know that it's okay um so it sounds like that's a lot but actually there's a lot of other things you know there's stuff you like to do in common there's like mutual friends there's like same philosophies on values on these other things you know religion you know there's a lot of other things that i think are there that i think that you know if the uh if those big three things are there that's right so anyway that's the kind of thing that i've done in real life it reminds me of like john nash uh you know uh hypothesizing around the nash equilibrium and like game theory around the women at the bar yeah it's in beautiful mind it's like that scene you know from the scene it's a very vulnerable scene it reminds me of that uh you know it's like uh breaking down this situation in a mathematical way and in such an analytical way it's very um it's very interesting how did um how did wait but y actually come about were you writing before it like i don't know the origin story of how it actually came to be and like the stick figures and all of your amazing drawings and like how did you actually launch into that endeavor yeah i um i was writing um i basically i i uh i always wanted to do something creative professionally um and the thing i was trying to do was music but it's like the worst match for a procrastinator because you know you can't just you know you you know and perfectionist you know you always i would be paralyzed by wanting to write like the best movie score for this thing possible and then you just like end up behind deadline and like or i just don't go out in the first place and do the networking i need to it was a lot of like things where i i was not i did not have the work habits to like that i needed to be like really getting that career rolling and so i was procrastinating on that by doing a couple other things starting a test prep company which is just like my side job and then i ended up hiring friends who were all out there and they also needed job and tutoring and then i started blogging just for fun which i didn't take seriously it was like just a fun procrastination activity on i made like a blogger um and you know just super simple and um and i found it was part of it was it was this it was this i didn't know i tricked myself where i was doing a creative pursuit that i wasn't being perfectionist about because i didn't pride myself on being good at it and i didn't wasn't trying to do anything big with it and so that's often how you end up in a really kind of loose carefree creative zone having fun and so i ended up writing what i think was a pretty good blog it was it was it was not i didn't put anywhere near the time that i put in now it was just kind of stuff about my day or my theories on this or a bunch you know 20 things i don't understand you know um and i would just you know i just had fun with it right and um and uh and then so meanwhile on the test prep side of things i uh my uh my best friend since we were five moved to la which is where i was and we partnered up and we were doing that together and uh you know now now i'm like 30 and i'm basically telling him i'm going crazy doing these like creative pursuits on the side i was writing a musical on the side i was doing blogging on the side while doing this test prep company i didn't feel like i was giving my all to the business and i wasn't giving my all to anything and it was this kind of classic me situation to end up in like super miserable um not really you know and and i was like i need to go full time with one of these creative pursuits and we decided to do something that you know uh could be also maybe like something that could be um a a a business venture possibly um you know it's like because it was a way to like keep working together because i liked working with him but he would manage the um the kind of the business we were doing and i would go and start a new thing that was the kind of idea it was like a way to have my cake and eat it too without having to like fully quit everything but also get to do something i really wanted but something that maybe was a fun thing for him to be part of if it grew as opposed to like a musical which is just like it's such a long time process it's like so hard to get that to actually make money and so anyway because it was deciding between those i was like i do a lot of blogging and i'd do this this musical so i decided to go with blogging that's kind of this long story but the like the bigger picture was like i finally at 31 did what i should have done a long time ago which is just go full in with one of my creative pursuits it's so interesting um because there's a generalized version of this story which i've experienced as well which is just this idea that you almost like most people that go and build something really unique or um something impressive successful etc they had the like janky version of it that happened before and then that led to and sort of allowed and enabled the really beautiful polished version of it and like i i used to write this um like once a month newsletter that i would send out to probably at like a max distribution of like 500 people and it was like what i read that month basically and it was sort of just me like reviewing a few books and it was pretty crappy like the writing probably wasn't good but it was loose to your point and it was kind of um again like a janky version of the audience building and the thing that i ended up doing at scale um was the seed had been planted and i was working on it and i think about that when i hear you tell the story of wait but why like you'd been working writing you know you kind of opened yourself up creatively put yourself in the arena a bit and you had to do that small thing in order for the big thing to actually happen there's actually even another level which is when i started this first blog i realized that what i was actually doing is i was doing something i'd done forever which is i'd come back from a trip or a crazy weird day and i would just type an email to like 12 friends and and i would do it you know i'd be like okay you know like you know throughout the day like the following things happen like tick this take this take this right i just do that i'll write these long kind of you know emails to friends and i realized when i started blogging it's like oh i'm just actually doing the thing that i used to just do on as an email i'm doing this now as a blog and then then i took it and did it as a full-time job you know so there's even like more layers like and i think that is a lot of times something you're doing very casually actually you know is um you you actually sometimes find something that man i'm good at this and i really like it and it doesn't feel like it it could go anywhere because it seems like it's such a casual thing but sometimes you can make that connection and say i think this like thing that i do with my friends actually is pretty special maybe i can do something with that like sometimes that's what you know that sometimes it's there yeah if you're anything like me your portfolio is a mix of the usual

know built relationships built a reputation around your writing and your creative work that is astounding and you know and far-reaching your posts which you're a bit of a unicorn within the um you know blogging and newsletter writing sphere because you don't really have a set cadence for these posts you're not like you know one of these hey i'm going to write one a week or one a month your posts are sort of few and far between but when you release them they go completely nuts and people you know dive in they're these longer posts really exploring a topic from what i love about them is it feels like you come at a topic from basically any every any and every angle that might exist at it and really envelop the topic one of the things that sort of kind of vaulted you to another level of prominence along the way was your relationship with elon musk and you mentioned him earlier and some of your insights on him and so i feel like a need to to unpack that a little bit can you just tell the quick story of how you originally got connected with him in the first place to write the pieces you did on spacex tesla neurolink etc yeah um it really started when so at the you know as i said this was a partnership with my friend andrew finn and so we're every week i was you know coming up with what's the next topic you know what's the next um it's the beginning it was more regular and it was like you know you know it you know i i was able to kind of go longer and less regular once it was already an audience i shouldn't be there um and it was always like you know what's like you know so many topics potential topics what's the choice and he said to me one day andrew was like um he's like you might want to write about ai there's you know the um nick i think he's like you know there's a bunch of people are reading this book by nick bostrom um super intelligent so i was like all right so i picked it up read it was like had you know jaw on the floor um and then i um read you know another book um uh and then i read uh i forget what the second book was called it's in the post at the bottom um i read a third book i read ray kurzweil's um singularity is near i read you know a bunch of long articles i read a handful of papers i watched a bunch of people on youtube and i just started to like absorb this crazy topic and wrote a big long post about sometimes you happen to you know sometimes you write something at the right time and sometimes you don't right it's part of the skill is trying to like figure out when it's a good time for a topic you know a good time is when it's it's it's fuzzy but people don't quite understand it yet is a good time for a topic like that you don't want to do it when everyone's like read a bunch of stuff and they already have a sense of it and it's become like now there's camps political camps about it it's controversial you want it at the beginning when everyone's like what is this new thing you know um everyone's wide-eyed still about it and trying to understand but if you do it too early then also it doesn't hit either you know it's it's it's there's a goldilocks there's a goldilocks moment for things to hit yes so i feel like i got lucky uh here with you know um i ai was it was the right time and the post you know really went pretty viral um and then one day you know we used chart beat to see how many people are on the site um and one day you know there's you know get the notification from chart beat like you know high activity or something and you go and there was like a trillion people on this on the site it was like it was like a you know it was like a few days or a week after this thing was published and you see on the side like tweets they don't do that anymore unfortunately but i showed you like tweets that are sending people to your site elon musk uh went to the see what the tweet was and he was like you know funny you know interesting post you know good primer on on ai and i was like damn it was like super exciting obviously yeah um you know i was i was a fan i already thought he was like a super awesome dude um and so i had part two coming out in a couple weeks and now i'm writing part two thinking you know elon musk might read this right and so you know it was uh it's kind of stressful and also in my head i was like he's not gonna like he already dedicated you know 15 minutes of his like ridiculously precious time to my idiot blog i'm not don't don't expect more you know my hopes were done but i published it turns out i don't know how he got back to it but he ended up reading that and he ended up tweeting about it again and i was like wow uh so i was like okay this dude like likes this blog that's pretty awesome so then um then i got an email from his uh you know like a staff member of his who basically was like you know do you want to you know elon likes your stuff we'd like to talk to you about like maybe doing some writing about you know his stuff yeah you know and again i expect that to be him on the phone for a second or maybe not even at all like it's he but it's actually someone else and he's on the phone for a second then he gets off and i talk to like you know a person who's working for him about what turns out he calls me one on one and it's just uh just us on the phone for like an hour um talking about spacex and solarcity tesla and like um ai and other things and like super interesting conversation um and did you feel over your depth in that conversation you know i think the the way this started was very helpful if this has been something where it's like a i i had a good friend that knew him and like asked if he would talk to me for a minute i would have been like you know so but he this he came to me after like clearly liking my stuff so i think that gave me some like confidence like and i'm very much myself on the blog i'm like i don't have to pretend to be someone else you're clearly like he's coming he specifically like is interested in me writing because he he likes like the way i am thinking about this stuff so you ticked up north on your own spectrum that we talked about yeah yeah i i think i mean look i'm not saying this now i think probably if you asked me at the time i would have been like yeah this is horrifying like this um i probably was like you know just a mess like you know rambling but um he also like you know to his credit is pretty easy to talk to like you know he he like uh you just ask him a question and he kind of just goes on like he would in an interview or anywhere else he just kind of starts talking about it and um very very upfront you know you know there's there's just really he's really interested in the things he's working on so if you ask him about it he'll just go and it becomes very easy so um we had a great combo and and the idea was like we were trying to figure out he had no specific idea was like should you write some stuff on the tesla website because there was a blog there um written by actually uh hamish mckenzie who now is the one of the founders of sub stack and it was like oh should you do some stuff on that blog and i was like i didn't want to do that because i was trying to build my own site and i don't want to spend a lot of time writing something that was going to bring traffic to the tesla website um um and so i you know i wasn't sure if you know he was going to be like well that's the only way i'm going to do it he again very laid back i was like i was like i think it should be on weight but why uh and then i can really like i can have all the features i want i can put footnotes i can make it long i can have images and uh and he was like okay and i was like cool uh and so then we were like what's and then so i kind of came up with the plan though he didn't really have like any like instructions for me it was like i liked what you did on ai i liked that he felt it was like entertaining and accurate those are the two things you know that's what he he cares about accurate and he also like prefers something to be you know a tone that peop you know that might broke people in so i basically was like well why don't i do a post on tesla and on spacex and you know see you know what else whatever else and so that that turned into a four-part series first one was just a big picture about him the second one was a long post about tesla and third one was even longer post about spacex and the whole story there and the fourth one was about like why is this guy so successful like what's going on and to me it was like the way he reasons and that was the answer there um and i've more since written about other companies of his like neuralink but um but but what was really interesting is because he just doesn't do things in normal way you know he doesn't you know you think someone like him would have this pr team that's doing his tweets there's no pr team right this is him you know he's a guy he's acting like a guy he opens up his twitter and he tweets something funny he just doesn't do things the normal way for someone like that right in so many ways how does he think i mean you spent time with him he's obviously in the news and you know his prominence since you first interacted with him is probably a hundred asked a million because he was already yeah i think he had a million twitter followers when we yeah so if you just take twitter it's a hundred x that if you look at any other metric you know his influence in the world is yeah um completely astounding you know with all the different companies with starlink now with everything that he's doing how do you think he uh what is your perception of how he thinks about new opportunities and like i'm asking this question in the context of all this stuff that he's talking about with twitter now and with all the different stuff that he's doing in the world of atoms you know that's out there like how do you think um like what is his mental model or his framework for evaluating what to take on and new opportunities what's your perception of that um i think he always starts from the big goal and works backwards from there so the big goal for him he's very clear-headed about it and he's been saying in the same wording the same goal since if you look back to interviews from his you know or you know things he wrote or said in 2001 2002 um which is uh to increase the probability of a good future for humanity uh and an even bigger picture maybe to he wants the light of human consciousness to go on for a long time and he wants it to be a good future he wants it so increase the probability of a good and long future for humanity not not for each individual person you know he's not he's not working on life extension for people as much you know he's concerned about the species and again i think if you really zoom out and you take a big step back and you picture the whole milky way galaxy in front of you and you know that there's this little like dot of of higher consciousness there maybe there's a lot of places where that exists but maybe not we don't know but we know is that it's one place and it and and you know he thinks about the fermi paradox a lot why don't we see other aliens he's worried that maybe we're very rare and maybe you know it's very precarious to keep a civilization like ours going so he wants to keep that dot that little flame alive really badly um and so at that point now you start thinking okay so you work backwards from there so if that's what you want to raise the probability of a good future what are the threats to a a good future what are the threats to a long future right so what are the major biggest you know existential things going on um and then from there what are okay so now you've identified some threats like he thinks you know advanced ai is a threat he thinks that um you know not moving to a sustainable energy world is a threat to a good future um he thinks being stuck on one planet alone you know all our eggs in one's basket is a threat to a good future um he's you know so there there's some major things like this um and so it's almost like inverting like he kind of inverts like if the goal is the big future he's inverted that and said like what would lead to a bad future yeah and now go solve those problems that could potentially lead to that bad future yeah you know which which of these has potential solutions like where can human effort um have an effect a positive effect on some of these things and raise the probability of a good future um so the erosion of free speech is a threat to a good future he you know i see twitter very much i see twitter very much as part of the same story here he sees um and this is you know this he sees uh what's just in general the polarization of society and and the threats of authoritarianism from many angles um as a threat to a good future um and and um and again it's not just that it's a threat but he thinks he sees ways that human effort can make it better he's he he he sees ways that if we change things in this way it could be better with you know sustainable energy future he you know uh if if if everyone went electric for vehicles like that would have be a big help and it seems doable like electric vehicles are good enough where people will want to switch over if they could you know so it has to be practical has to make sense but he'll talk about even if he thinks something has a 10 chance of succeeding but it's really important it's worth trying well this is like his uh charlie munger lunch right like charlie munger spent the whole lunch i don't know if this is actually a true story but it's definitely been told several times of like charlie munger at a lunch with with elon musk tells the entire table all the reasons why tesla will fail and elon responded by basically agreeing with all of the reasons and saying i agree all of those are real reasons why it is likely to fail but it is still worth trying yeah yeah i mean you know it's like you miss 100 of the shots you don't take kind of thing like if this really matters well the one way to guarantee the failure is to not try it at all but you know he's not crazy if he thought if he thinks it's a point one percent chance of succeeding he's not gonna put his time into that but ten percent it's also it's an ev right like it's an expected value bet and he's a highly analytical person as as you are as well right and so you're calculating even if it's a ten percent chance but if the outcome in that scenario is astronomically better than in the event of not trying it or in the event of failure you should probably take that bet and you would do it over and over again and the overall ev of society will be hugely positive from doing that yeah yeah yeah exactly like whatever he could be working on that's more of a 90 chance of success he does he doesn't see that eevee as as as matching up so i have to route back to something that you mentioned in passing there on the fermi paradox because i absolutely love this one uh you've written a long post on it which i thought was which i thought was fantastic um for anyone that doesn't know this is like the where is everybody uh question of you know like if life in the universe exists as we you know as people surmise shouldn't we have encountered it by now um you know if there's like millions of stars and there's likely to be planets that look like earth um where is the life that would have progressed to the point of interstellar travel why haven't we met them yet um so i'm curious just for your perspective on this like what is your current thinking on this paradox is there life in the universe why haven't we encountered it yet yeah i mean it's like it's it's the world's most interesting question right i think there's nothing if you take a again zoom out like there's nothing more interesting than than this um and and the reason it's so tantalizing i mean first of all it seems like it's something i suspect that we're gonna get an answer to in the next like 50 years like i think we're at the end of our i think this is the this one in the last not last it's one of like the the it's it's it's the it's one of the big questions that's probably going to be solved in our lifetimes in my opinion i just think that and it can only be solved in one direction because the absence of evidence is not evident correct i think i think yes although although the better your tools get the more that the argument that maybe we're alone starts to go up if you don't find anything so but yes that's not a clear answer obviously um and uh and our tools is just like you know if you think about it it's not like oh well it's been millennia and we haven't answered it so well we've only been actually searching for like a few decades in in a real way and our tools are getting exponentially better so it's just um you know it's unbelievable what they can do now like just by looking at the wavelengths of light emerging from uh a star system they can actually understand what gases are on a planet like they can understand the atmospheric makeup it's like insane to me totally interesting just like imagine how knowing how to do that and so they can be like yeah there's you know and they and there's a certain kind of fingerprint that we you know maybe life exists in lots of different kind of atmospheric fingerprints but we know one we know one where it really worked here and so we if we see another fingerprint that looks a lot like this with a certain amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide and nitrogen or whatever uh i think that you know that's a that can be a signal so so anyway and obviously the big things you're looking for is like some weird you know thing where a star is you know one of my favorite i'll get to the answer in a second but just i just there's a lot to think about here one of my favorite scary theories is like um there's this boots void it's called uh which is like this insanely large space out in the universe with no galaxies or like very few like a much smaller it's almost entirely blank it's just like a sphere of black uh when when that's not normal like in any other sphere that size there's like you know thousands of galaxies and so it could be a lot of things it could be that that's a big black hole you know like or or there's a group of black holes that like merge there's a lot of different ways of good things it could be referred to as the great nothing yes colloquially or referred to i'm i'm kind of scared after that it's it's upsetting it's an upsetting concept like i'm just like i don't want to be in the middle of that where like what's crazy is that light that go that leaves one side of the boots for it doesn't hit the other side for like a billion years so it's like so you can be you can be so so so and the thing is there are planets there are some stars and planets like scattered in there what's crazy is that if there are you know planets around there and there's life on there they'll look out and they will be sure that there's no such thing as like a galaxy or there's no such thing as like other galaxies they're just gonna see you know they're only gonna see anyway so one of the territories one of the potential theories is that actually what you're seeing here because you know one of the one of the ideas about what advanced life more advanced than us might do is you know we think about it in terms of energy so there's this thing called the kardashev scale level ones a level one species can now harness all the energy of their home planet so we're not there it's logarithmic we're like a point seven out of one but that's not seventy percent we're like two percent but logarithmically it's like seven point seven so we're a little below that like you know we're there's obviously all kinds of energy from the inside of the earth and from you know rivers and from wind that we're not harnessing right now um then level two is you can harness the energy of your whole star so that can be a dyson sphere around the star you know this idea of like a sphere that captures because you think oh you can't sometimes i think intuitively you can't put a sphere on a star it'll go out i'm like no no it's not fire that needs oxygen it's it's fusion there's nothing to do because i'm like you can't like but say you know you could cover up the sun and it would be burning just as bright and just as as as you know doesn't there's nothing it needs from the outside of it so you can put a sphere around it and all the thing goes into the surface of the sphere and it gets channeled into different you know tubes they go out to the you know whatever it's like that that would be so vastly more energy than we have right now that we could ever need but but a super advanced civilization they might have thousands of space habitats and they might be on hundreds of planets and they might be doing way higher level kind of uh stuff that you know energy requirements anyway level three is when you harness the whole energy of your whole galaxy which again sounds insane when there's you know over 100 billion maybe uh maybe you know half a bill half a trillion stars but if somewhere if someone mastered the dyson sphere thing you know once you get it you get like it's like it's like building um a building was really impossible for like early humans like a big tall building but once we did it we just replicated in other buildings or everywhere right so you can see once they get it now so they just start to go out and they start to uh even if it takes them a few million years because you know and and you know to go build these dyson spheres and anyway the one of the theories about the boots void is that there's an extraordinarily advanced civilization that has been you don't see the light because it's all been covered up by their things and they're living this vast thing that you just can't see it and that's that's the evidence of their expansion anyway long answer to get back to you asked is just a big picture for the fermi paradox um and look every almost everyone anyone who understands the scale of the universe and thinks about how probability works almost all comes to the same conclusion of course we're not alone right it's like if you picked up one great note we have one example which is what happened on earth if you picked up one grain of sand from a beach and you looked in the microscope and you saw it was crawling with little critters you wouldn't conclude well maybe this is the only one that has that you'd say of course i'm sure they're on all kinds you know i didn't just pick up the one that has it right so we we have one example here um or one solar system and we see that civilization happen to think that well maybe this is the only place it happened makes no sense right of course with the scale of course this must be coming that said there are some very compelling papers and arguments out there that that say we don't have any good reason to be confident that what happened here wasn't outrageously rare like that's on a scale so it could be so rare that it pops up in a galaxy once every couple million years so we're here now and then maybe there's another one over there and then maybe you know these two die out and a million years passes and the other one pops up so it could be like that and again if you if you picture those as like little lights flashing on if you zoomed out you still see if you see all the galaxies you still see all these lights everywhere and all the galaxies you know so that but but if that would be rare enough that there would be nothing else in our whole galaxy right now right that would be mean we are unbelievable freak incident if it happens like once in a galaxy every once in a while you can go further and say that you know maybe this is the only time this has ever happened in the milky way but it's happened in other galaxies here and there you can go even further and say actually this is the only time it's happened in the observable universe um again it's it's it goes counter-intuitive but we have no sense of how rare it was how freak of an incident it was obviously it's some kind of freak incident that life began because it took so long before it happened right so a lot of collisions of molecules before it happened clearly it's a hard thing to have happen uh we also know i want to propose yeah i want to propose something that's a bit i don't know whether anyone has ever thought of um this kind of angle to it so have you ever heard of cope's rule no so cope's rule is this idea that like organisms basically scale in size linearly over time um kind of up to a point right like then basically like becoming too big you know if if you followed that humans would be you know the size of the sky would be giants etc and so like there's this idea that as you get too big you know it's bad right like there's like an actual you kind of asymptote from a size standpoint you can't actually get much bigger it's bad for you for various reasons and you see it play out like you know companies get too big and then struggle or like investors like once you get big a lot of large numbers it becomes difficult to perform et cetera so i wonder whether there is an intelligence asymptote of societies where at scale you actually will not see interstellar travel ever become a thing because societies find a way to die off uh from an intelligence standpoint when they basically like get too smart for their own good so like in the same way that size becomes a disadvantage when it gets like too too big does intelligence actually become a disadvantage and are we seeing the beginning of that with the fracturing of society and the way that we're seeing today yeah i mean so you're talking about is is is human level intelligence a possible great filter candidate great filter is a robin hansen term that is you know is there some point along the evolutionary path that it that that that almost every single attempt hits a wall there um and and and there's a few options here it's not just what you said it's like the great filter might be behind us it may be maybe going from simple cell to complex cell with a nucleus because that took a i don't know it took a billion years it took a huge amount of time i think it took a billion years of simple sales i mean that's but maybe actually the average is it would have taken a thousand uh you know a trillion years and it happened really really early here it was a freak incident so maybe it's behind us and all the other attempts they don't get past that we happen to that would be great news it also could be ahead of us um meaning you know we look this is you know nick bostrom talks about how uh what if you could make a nuclear weapon by microwaving sand right set up a nuclear bomb by putting sand in the microwave just something like something that anyone could do you have to imagine we would be set back to the stone age at this point right because one out of every 100 000 people is a maniac who would love to extinct humans and love to go down in the you know look at school shooters i mean i don't think that they're choosing to only kill 15 people i think they could kill a thousand they pro a lot of them would right and they're obviously trying to go down with the biggest bang possible so it doesn't matter if 99.999 of people are good and reasonable if it becomes easy to blow up the planet the planet it's going to be blown up right so uh this the scary thing is to think about well as our technology gets better and better and better um and you look at stuff like social media maybe this happens on a lot of planet maybe every planet that you know all these civilizations they end up with their social media phase and when they get there very quickly you know madness starts to prevail over reason which is what's happening on social media this most people are reasonable but the forces of madness are on the rise and and squashing the forces of reason right now and maybe this isn't you know maybe this is just very predictable and happens all the time and at some point you get too interconnected and the weapons get too easy to make and all the reason in the world doesn't matter because suddenly everyone's back in the state of nature just shine trying to protect themselves and and maybe it doesn't extinct them maybe it sets them back you know to the stone age or whatever and then they can you know so you know it doesn't have to extinct us to so yeah i mean it that's a very possible thing but here's here okay here's an argument against it if life you know because there's also lots of theories that say even if even if this is pretty rare there's so many stars out there so many sun-like stars with earth-like planets around them habitable planets that a lot of other people say well what we would expect is that there's not just other civilizations like ours there's milli tens of millions of them in the milky way alone milk is just one of hundreds you know two trillion galaxies um and so even if this were the case what you were saying there'd be a freak incident there'd be outliers there'd be some species that developed this all-encompassing religion that was so you know that did such a good job of policing people's behavior that they that they made it past they got to the point where they could now all upload their consciousness and you couldn't kill off people any more easily and they were on many many planets and they had developed you know intelligence that allowed them to snuff out any threats i don't know so or maybe not but it seems like you know man it really it's a great filter that filters everyone if it's working right it's a pretty amazing i mean it's just amazing to go to the like reaches of thinking on this the boots uh the boots boy because there's so much space in between stars but all of the stars around us we're all in like a tiny like a super like urban neighborhood you know a galaxy is like super condensed but yet when you actually get in here you're like oh my god there's so much space between galaxies is even more space and the boots void is like it's next level it's like it's upset it is amazing to just think about like humans do have a fascination with the very very big um and like the zooming out you know cosmos like neil degrasse tyson and cosmos and and how he kind of brought a um you know an abstraction of the complexity of the very big to the masses um you know and before him obviously the original cosmos um with carl sagan and um that there's always been this amazing fascination with the unknown of space and the scale of it and it like you know you watch the first episode of cosmos and i defy you to not like get pushed back into your pillow or wherever you're watching it and feel like holy [ __ ] what is the meaning of all this why am i here um but the big has this allure that i find personally the like very small doesn't necessarily have in zooming in i mean it's just the bigness is just so because like the smallness we know it's there right we know at some point you can just get it's like you know it's like yes if you zoom in enough on anything you're going to see really small particles right but the bigness like we didn't i don't think you know humans knew about how big things were for a long time um which which of course is another way of saying they didn't know how small they were right it makes us really small like tiny um but not to mention that there are things about the bigness one of the things i find fascinating historically is like galileo was ostracized cast off um you know a complete pariah for um you know theories that he had about the universe and about the bigness uh a few hundred years later he was obviously proven completely correct and was no longer you know considered a pariah historically but there are going to be things that today uh we are hilariously wrong about that we are like ostracizing people um saying you're an idiot you know pushing them off like they're on the fringes of science that 100 years from now that person will be like the genius that you know predicted x y or z whatever it was yeah yeah it's uh they're uh i mean there's i forget who said it but you know if you go back to any point in history uh to any society there's gonna be a bunch of things that you will that you should not say out loud a bunch of truths that you better not say out loud right and it's easy to look back at the people in the past and the societies in the past and see what they were and say oh my god you know if you said this very obvious normal thing today out loud back in 1620 england or in you know the roman empire um you're you're done you know you're you're at best ostracized you know um and uh yeah and it's hard to unders it's hard to see you know again we have that we have the helicopter view of those those societies now so we can see um uh but we are ridiculous like you said we are for sure without question i mean i think 20 years ago it would have been like wow we're probably ridiculous in some ways today it's almost like it's it's painfully clear to see like just looking at social media um looking at like like the way like we're being manipulated by in information warfare and um you know the fact that there's like um still like lots and lots of like brutal dictatorships um and like our livestock farming there's so many areas where i'm like you can see like it's annoying to know the things that we're gonna be laughed at in the future but like i'm sure people in the 1700s and you know if you look at like abigail adams letters to john adams people were aware how bad slavery was you know there were a lot of abigail adams is writing these letters basically being like this is like the worst thing ever they knew right so i think a lot of the time like there are a lot of people who know how bad things are but there's there's some forces that are keeping it up upheld uh so yeah i think about this kind of thing all the time it's like yeah the ridiculousness of the human state the the one thing i will leave you with and i know we're running up against end of time um is one of your one of your tweets i think it was last year which is sort of to this day one of my favorite tweets and and general thoughts which is this idea that like if you went back in time to a few days before you were um conceived or born um you would be very careful about the actions you took because you would know that there was the potential that any action you took back then might lead to you not being born back to the feedback to the future if you went back to before your parents met you'd be like don't touch anything hide in the closet don't say anything right because you know yeah and so it's a good reminder if that's the case that in the present to think just as carefully about the things you were doing because your actions have very real impacts um on the future and yeah where everything goes from here right you don't have to like worry about like oh no like i just interrupted that conversation now those few people might not like have gotten married you have to worry because it doesn't matter because any of the future paths might be equally as bad or good when you're in the present but it's a reminder that you know any i do think that like we take any person who lives from like a baby to like old age and then they die whether they're totally you know ordinary person living an ordinary life the ripple effects that that person causes and the the the secondary kind of consequences i think you have a totally different world uh if if they if they lived or if they didn't live most cases you know and yeah and certainly today you know um so yeah i think it's it's it's empowering to be like yes what we do matters yeah yeah it's empowering um and the last one is on the fermi paradox uh you said it has two possibilities both of them make me want to hug you either the universe is teeming with aliens which means we're a single family in a cosmic society great or there's no one else in which case we're stranded together on a tiny island in the vast darkness but gladly not the boots boyd yes and that's true that's part of why the fairy paradox is so cool because like either way it's mind-blowing right there's no non there's no non-mind-blowing outcome here and either way it it is a reminder that like fighting with each other above dumb [ __ ] like human tribalism is so stupid it's it's only when your like head is so like zoomed in that you can't like just remind yourself what the hell is really going on here that's how i feel a good a good reason to not fight on twitter with strangers oh man well thank you so much tim by the way i love you i love your twitter i uh i appreciate it it was uh you know it's been an absolute blast talking with you i feel like i owe you money um for how much i learned from this conversation and i also feel like i'm gonna be kind of mad at you when i think about the boots void later tonight so i appreciate it so much look forward to to getting together uh when you're out in new york and uh thanks so much for joining me thanks so much for listening to today's episode if you have any questions that you want featured in a future

you've got this whole population of older adults who are basically in this position of like wanting to get started and they don't know how and i think that's where a lot of startup opportunities are like how do you lower the barrier to entry make older adults feel comfortable make them feel like they're not going to be ridiculed for being there they're not going to get taken advantage of for being there but like activate some of those behaviors that they've been saving up and they just need like a little nudge to start doing the stuff they always thought they were gonna do [Music] uh what's up man good to uh good to see you how you doing i'm good dude the sun is shining uh the northeast has finally decided that it's spring it's like i think it's 70 out i've got some trees in the front of our house and um they were pissing me off because they looked dead like dead winter and now all of a sudden i'm looking at my window and they've got this like amazing you know white blooming flowers on them and so i'm pretty excited it feels like it feels like springtime here spring is in the air uh are you in miami or montreal right now i'm in miami okay so i'm in miami i'm looking out on on the water i'm feeling inspired what uh what do you want to talk about today well i want to start with a quick recap on how bitcoin week was because you just experienced that i had to miss it you know we're on like full baby watches you know um and so i couldn't exactly play the political capital of like hey sweetheart i'm gonna go you know down to bitcoin week and party with my friends for a week while you're uh 36 weeks pregnant or whatever we're at now so decided not to play that card gonna save it for nft week in the fall in new york well we missed you i actually didn't go to the bitcoin event um i know there was 25 000 people who went to that event which is wild i will say that our buddy bobac had a pass that was one of those they were called a whale pass okay and they were literally seventeen thousand dollars for the pass only at bitcoin week will they charge you seventeen thousand dollars to get a quote-unquote whale pass to get access to the event and people are paying for it were people paying in bitcoin i'm not sure i mean i assume so i assume the i just got my tax bill right like it's so it's tax season we're filming this on april 13th um and you i was just texting you about the pain and ask that is crypto taxes and trying to figure out what to use and there's like all these different software tools that have come out that are trying to solve this problem my general opinion on is that like most of them aren't quite there yet um i've used and tried several of them i used coin tracker this year and i thought it was quite good actually on recommendation from alexis a prior guest um who i think was like a precede or seed investor in it i thought it was quite good one of the things that shocked me which it shouldn't have shocked me but it did is um like i invested in a company and i invested in bitcoin um i was making a ten thousand dollar investment in a company and rather than doing it in cash for some reason i didn't think about it i was like i'm just gonna send you bitcoin because it's a crypto company and that's a freaking taxable event and so i didn't invest ten thousand dollars i invested ten thousand plus whatever the taxable gain was on that ten thousand dollars from whenever i bought it which was at a really low cost basis and so like i was so annoyed at myself because i literally just didn't think about it and the company i invested that in is a dud and so it's probably going to zero like can't write it off yet um and it's just like i just had never thought about it that that's a taxable event for all of these things so people when they're like oh i bought this car in bitcoin or i bought you know my pass to this thing in bitcoin maybe they're just not declaring that stuff but the reality is those are all taxable events right now yeah so my reaction to that is i know people who have a bunch of apes and a bunch of punks and who've so who basically set up individual wallets and who are not paying taxes on it so they're selling these eights for hundreds of thousand dollars they're not paying taxes on it so i mean i think it's a terrible idea like obviously the uh irs is gonna i think they're gonna figure this out at some point yeah um and that's scary i was like dude how do you sleep at night like how are you sleeping at night today's episode is brought to you by market or hire with

using marketer hire and absolutely love it if you're a growing business you will too check them out today at marketerhire.com again that's marketerhire.com and tell them sahil sent you taxes are one of those interesting um it's one of those interesting things right because it's sort of a spectrum like you have on one end of the spectrum is like perfect compliance you pay every single dollar that you could possibly buy the rule book um the other end of the spectrum is like pure fraud right you just don't pay a dollar in taxes and you like wait for them to come for you and then somewhere in the middle is you know what feels like the pareto optimal solution where you're like yeah i'm gonna try to find shelters and do intelligent things to like not have to pay every dollar but i'm also not gonna get in trouble because it's all legal right and that's like everyone complained about donald trump not paying taxes a few years ago and like his whole thing that is like the most common thing in the world the real estate tax loopholes i mean we have friends who are like literally making multiple millions of dollars of cash income a year and paying zero dollars in taxes because they have all this depreciation off their real estate portfolios it's like a well-known loophole that was created by the us government in order to incentivize people to build and develop property and so it's just it's interesting to me because i do think that tax is one of those things where you kind of just need to decide where you're going to exist on that spectrum and then have a strategy and like clearly you're friends with nft thing i would argue that's closer to the you know pure fraud end where you're just like there's clearly taxable events that you're just not going to declare um but it's going to be really hard for the government to figure out and have the resources to police this stuff i mean the complexities of understanding wallets and flows for a massive fraud are high enough like when they had to go through that big bitcoin you know scam the thing where that couple stole you know four billion dollars in bitcoin that was so complex for them to do for this massive scam now imagine doing that for a random person with like you know ten thousand dollars in gains like does the us government really have the resources to go police that yeah so i i don't know about that and but i will say one thing i will say i'm excited for the day when wallets do a better job at predicting and basically being like your tax man or tax woman on the shoulder and being like hey sahil you probably just so you know if you invest this you know 10 grand in bitcoin like you're gonna owe x amount of dollars in taxes that's actually a brilliant yeah it's a brilliant point it's a brilliant idea there i think coin tracker is trying to do that where like it's not integrated though like right now coin tracker i think will let you do it where you can like put in what you're about to do and it'll tell you what the tax implication would be but it is a really cool idea to integrate that into the wallet so that it's telling you in real time here's the likely tax implication of doing this yeah and i think that's where wallets are going like wallets are going from wallets to smart wallets and they're gonna be building a lot of this predictive technology into it i hope um that's where i'd imagine they're going do you think it's a just like from a startup idea standpoint do you think that is going to be a incremental software solution that then sells into all the wallet companies like somebody focuses on just building that tax software piece um and it they sell it into metamask sell it into rainbow sell it into phantom like go to all the wallet companies and sell it in there or do you think it's going to be something that the individual companies have to build so to me a wallet is very similar to how search engines were when the internet started so in the beginning there with the when the internet started i'm sure you remember there was like excite.com ask jeeves lycos yahoo all there were so many right and you know what do we use today 90 of people use google um some people use bing because it's the default on on uh on windows i'm consistently shocked by how many people use bing by the way when you look up the stats on it it's like sociopaths i'm convinced it's only sociopaths that use being full disclosure i used bing today and i'll i can point proof i get my point only sociopaths use bing i i i'll talk i'll talk about it i'll explain why at the end but my point about wallets being search engines is that eventually google you know i remember the first time i used google was this like magical experience where if you put like restaurants in new york city you actually got amazing results um and you actually got the results you wanted and then that basically built that trust between you and the search engine and then you said goodbye ask jeeves and hello google forever that is what's going to happen with uh wallet so we're in the same experimentation zone i would say with wallets like people are trying different types of wallets one wallet is gonna win and i believe that the that consumer experience like google didn't go and like uh license the technology to do the predictive technology for you know when you type in uh new york it you know it predicts city um they built it from scratch so i think a lot of it is going to be built from scratch and it's going to be these unique consumer applications but i will say for people listening it's a massive opportunity right now to be experimenting with wallets yeah it's super interesting um and by the way i just pulled it up while you were talking about it being 126 million unique u.s users apparently like half of the us still searches on bing which says to me that half of the us is sociopaths like you well that's a good segue so i'll explain why i use bing today so and you know i'm slightly embarrassed to say this but i got a i got a pc uh the other day is everything okay no honestly i got a pc and are you going into finance it's weird saying that i got a pc because i run a design agency and like we have a bunch of some of the most amazing designers in the world and like they love mac um and i'd love mac too but i got a pc to try it out and i will say that windows 11 is almost as good as mac os i know this is gonna be people are gonna hate on me but until you try windows 11 it's actually a fantastic product and windows like machines like for what you can buy for like a thousand fifteen hundred two thousand dollars it's like so so amazing and so quick so i'm loving my uh windows experience and microsoft edge which is their browser comes pre-installed with bing which is why i use bing today ah okay so that's got to be the whole driver of these numbers then yes um i wonder how many people opt-in to bing versus like just get defaulted into negative yeah yeah negative 100 i do i mean i do remember just like i'm a big fan of funny marketing campaigns um and like creative marketing campaigns and i did think when bing first came out and they did that like bing challenge where you would search you know six things or five things and then you would click which search results you liked more and it would tell you if you liked being more than boring than google i thought that was like a pretty creative and neat way of doing it so um interesting to know zigwen other people's zag on getting the computer greg i'm proud of you um i i'm a reformed you know private equity guy so being on a mac is like the biggest joy in the world now after spending you know as many years as i did on a pc working in excel well so i actually don't remember that the bing challenge but that's actually a really brilliant idea and i'm a big fan of like you know marketing stunts like that um that speak to the core of the product i think that's really smart it reminds me of do you remember the pepsi challenge yeah i was going to say they ripped off the pepsi challenge yeah what was that from what i remember i actually went to a town you know i grew up in montreal and there's this town across the border called plattsburgh new york and we used to go there to like go to like walmart and all these american and get like american food and like candy and like bad things for us basically um and i remember going to the shopping mall in plattsburgh and there was the pepsi challenge this is like in the uh mid 90s i would say um and they basically uh you know they're like hey kid you want to try this do the challenge i was like okay and they basically gave you a cup of like i think it was like a blind taste test it was a blind taste test yeah and it was you know it was awesome it was fun it was interactive and yeah and it was an intro introduction to pet to pepsi and it's and it was smart is that a lot of people have this brand loyalty to coke and it challenged that yeah the the classic though with it was they missed um because what ended up happening was that it showed that people preferred pepsi and they used it as this big win it turned out that pepsi is like a little sweeter i'm not i'm not a big soda guy but pepsi's a little bit sweeter and so i guess like in the small amount that they were giving you you were more likely to pick pepsi but then people actually preferred coke for like drinking a full amount that you would actually get and so it was like they they missed on something but we're sitting here and we're still talking about it so clearly they did they did something right and they're i mean they're a massive conglomerate now and they own a bunch of different things um i do want to talk about before we have our guest on um i know you had an idea that uh that you texted me business idea that you wanted to jam through so we can either talk about it now or we can wait for the guest and we can jam through it with him um whatever you prefer i don't know if i can wait i want to get right into it so let's go i texted we have a group chat idea of the day we basically come up with an idea of the day it's actually a really good forcing function to do with your friends like go and create a group chat with your friends call it iod idea of the day and just be like hey everyone we're going to come up with an idea some some days are going to be good some days are going to be bad but just like put it out there and get feedback so that's highly recommend doing this highly recommend doing this one of my um idea of the day group chats um has now led to a micro sas platform that we actually built and are rolling out um and that i think is going to be like a multi-seven figure win so ideas of the day big hack so i i texted on the weekend um actually i talked about it on the pod so on the pod i talked about i think it was yeah it should be coming out soon but i talked about uh on the my first million podcast i was talking about how [Music] uh i have been having trouble getting my security deposit back from my apartment rental and how i wanted a service i would pay for a service to basically send a lawyer's letter to get my uh to get my security deposit back and that got me thinking that there's a business idea here so here's the idea the idea is actually let me pull up the the text thread and i'll read it to you exactly so idea of the day a modern day security deposit platform for real estate the tenant posts the security deposit the landlord sees it the tenant has the option to put the deposit into alternative assets equities or crypto the tenant is happy because inflation isn't eating away at the deposit the landlord is happy because the landlord splits the upside with the tenant for example if the security deposit appreciates by 20 the landlord takes 10 percent the tenant takes 10 minus the fees from the platform if the security deposit depreciates the tenant is on the hook to give at least the original security deposit back this could be a wedge into a much larger real estate platform so what this idea is basically doing is taking something that's like super old school i literally had to give it a check i wrote out a check to my my landlord and i said here's this money give it back to me later and he you know he has this money it's sitting in a separate bank account he's not happy because he's not making money off that money like he could theoretically make money off that money and as you know inflation is at 8.7 or whatever percent and i'm not happy because when i get it back years later it's worth so much less so this is an idea that basically creates this internet platform that we can go on i can see what's happening you can put smart contracts in into it so i don't have this situation where i can't get my money back what do you think of this idea so there's a handful of things i think about it so first off the sheer it triggered me to go down a rabbit hole a little bit on understanding security deposits i haven't rented in a few years and so i'd kind of forgotten this whole like archaic system and it depends on where you are um but generally speaking they'll ask for at least one month rent generally more you know i've had friends who have had to pay like they're doing a multi-year lease they have to put down a year of rent up front which is insanity but in in certain markets sometimes it's like first and last month rent that you put as a security deposit the sheer numbers on the dollars that are sitting in security deposits in the us are insane there's 45 billion dollars tied up in security deposits sitting in stable checking accounts so there's generally regulations in some states that say that the dollars from security deposits have to sit in um have to sit in checking accounts in the for the most part there have been advancements now recently in legislation that have allowed for like more creative insurance products and different kind of takes on this so i think the arrow of progress in terms of like unlocking these dollars is moving in the right direction but the like pure just market size is massive like at any point in time they're being 50 billion dollars 45 billion dollars that are sitting getting zero percent um it just strikes me as an opportunity so that's that's my first reaction is like it definitely seems like there's a large enough size of the prize i also think there's probably a few ways you could go about it i think one way would be like oh i'm going to try to build this big venture-backed platform in the space and like go create the alternative to security deposits there have been a handful of companies who have tried to do this like there's a company called abelego i think that i found that was like starting to try to do you know a security deposit alternative like a completely different type of product um i think effectively most of them what they're trying to do is like they take on the underwriting of the tenant and say like okay we'll assess their risk and we'll stand up for the security deposit you know in some in some manner with you know a smaller amount due from the um due from the tenant that sort of to me is like the exact same thing as a security deposit um and it's just someone else's bearing the risk versus versus the landlord and so you can go with lower amounts i think that your idea is more interesting than most of those because it plays to this kind of just like general theme of people wanting more control and more diversification and more access and like gamifying more of these things and so when i look at it like just on the surface i think there's something interesting here i think it just comes down to like how creatively do you go about building it out and then how do you build it so i mentioned the venture-backed one you could do that i also think if you were like a hustler you might be able to go to like 10 buildings and just say hey let's par i'll partner with you let's do like i'll build this software out you can have a much more creative way of doing this um and it'll be a it'll be an attractive attraction point for you to drive drive-in tenants as well yeah i think you know one of the things that was sort of initially stopping me from this idea just to open open source my thinking was in certain states or certain provinces or whatever like i know that yeah like you said it has to stay in a checkings account the but i don't think that should stop you from like going after this business so for example like airbnb uber like if you look at a lot of local laws like you can't you know pre pre the app store like you couldn't like rent unless you're playing your hotel tax uber like you're getting in a car with a stranger like these people aren't like don't have licenses i think you know so the reason the reason they do that by the way is that they want um they're protecting so that the law is there to protect the tenant from loss of those funds so they don't want landlords taking all the money having this like year of float or whatever however many years afloat and going and doing stupid going bankrupt and then they they're not able to give the tenants back their money what i think could be interesting would be on that point you basically go and take like for a year of time or multiple years of time the landlord will have an average amount that ends up getting used out of that security deposit and what ends up getting returned say you you take the amount that on average gets returned and that goes into a checking account and it is there and so like on average your entire pool of funds is going to get fully distributed back to people and then the remainder is either the landlords or the tenants to play with and i think it's more interesting if it's the tenants it's like here is your kind of like net and you have a dashboard and you can see it and you can kind of like do funny upside things with the remainder of your deposit that's sitting here and the rest is gonna sit in this safe thing so that you know you know you'll get it back like no matter what that would be the other kind of like flipped model take on how you could do it yeah i like that and i think that's really creative and i think these are the sorts of like don't be like how i was on saturday and have an idea that like might sound like it's not possible like keep going you know like try to be creative um sometimes also you need to like build the prototype to just like test the boundaries and see see if it's it's doable so i really like this idea if anyone listening likes it i know you like this idea too so um you know maybe yeah i think there's like i think it's super interesting i mean it's like it's just like as a mental model on this whole thing or a framework to think about it it's like this is cash that's literally just sitting around doing nothing yeah and anytime there's a massive pool of cash sitting around doing nothing there's an opportunity there and i don't know whether it's this specific idea or if it's like doing more creative insurance products around this or if it's um you know finding a way to gamify the investment around this like there's probably a hundred different angles you could take on it but there's a 45 billion dollar pool of cash annually that is just sitting around doing nothing and i bet if you went and surveyed a bunch of tenants and a bunch of landlords you'd learn a lot about what their like willingness would be and what their risk tolerance would be on doing something more creative with this yeah and i think you know the framework for how i think about it is like i'm always trying to trying to do a temperature check as to how people are feeling about certain things and like right now with inflation people are just like really feeling it and that's um everyone like every single one so there's tons of opportunity to create products that speak to that anxiety that people have around inflation and that could be a really really good lens to come up with and generate a bunch of cool startup ideas that might actually work i had never thought about the thing that like you get the money back say you get the full deposit back a year from now and it's just worth a lot less because of inflation like i just never thought about that because inflation was generally you know one percent like now the calculus on that has changed um so it is uh it's an interesting point yeah i mean i got back my [Music] my uh you know my security deposit actually the other day and i was like what am i going to do with it like i can't even buy like what i i can't even buy much with this money yeah it is interesting like i i um i haven't thought much about inflation just personally like i still view cash the same way as i did um because to me i think of cash as like a call option on future interesting opportunities um i like having more cash than anyone would say makes sense and the reason i do that i think of it as the same as free time by the way it's like now when something cool comes up i'm not like having to reshuffle out of equities or out of crypto or out of different things i just have cash sitting there that i know that i can draw upon like if we want to go invest and build some business or we want to go do something and hire some devs like it is a legitimate call option on going and doing any of those things free time is the exact same way if your calendar is like back to back i showed you my picture of my calendar from a year ago if your calendar is like that what headspace do you have to go pursue the cool idea that comes up you have none and so i um i'm kind of funny about cash like i probably any financial advisor you would talk to would you probably say like i have too much cash sitting around and probably too much free time sitting around as well um but it's part of my like general mental model for how i think about being able to go pursue these opportunities that do come up i like it's contrarian but i like it i i think it makes a lot of sense i think in our space also having there's just you know there's opportunities and and you can you ha you know especially now with the down market like you can go and like invest heavy and do really well uh yeah so i like it john it's also john's in the way of jonah yeah oh cool let's bring him in super excited what's up john nice to meet you sal yeah nice to meet you welcome on to the show thank you for joining us yeah thanks for having me let me set the stage a little bit so i've known john for a really long time but what i wanted to bring him uh on today is he runs a company called the live ventures and what alive ventures is is a venture studio that incubates products for older adults did you see what peter thiel said about warren buffett at the bitcoin conference what was the quote it was so absurd right uh guy i do need to pick it up now yeah pick it up that quote greg it's so i'm gonna pull it out i mean you called me a sociopath i think he called warren buffett and he called him a sociopathic grandpa yeah wow so i saw that and [Music] i hated that to my core because for a few reasons first reason is that i don't think we as a society respect older adults the way we should um and that was an attack he was he was trying to attack warren buffett but what he really was doing was attacking older adults in my opinion and by the way that's a that's a western culture thing um you know like my mom is from india india has a very um strong culture of taking care of your parents when they get old japan has a very strong culture of taking care of your parents as they get old the us for some reason doesn't have that culture like nursing homes became a thing we send people off so it is a cultural thing too greg absolutely so that yeah i don't like that at all and then i saw that and i pinged john and john and i actually they check out and the live ventures actually have been sort of incubating some some products for older adults and what i like about alive ventures is alive ventures is and john i'd love you to explain it but um is thinking about how to create products to make the lives of older adults happier and healthier and what i wanted to use this time for with john is just to like talk through some startup ideas um because i actually think that not only you know coming up with startup ideas for older adults is like good for the world it's also like a really good business like there's so much opportunity to build like everyone's focusing on like gen z and millennials but like older adults like huge opportunity by the way i don't know if you guys know this but my dad um is a professor is a researcher at harvard and spent i would say the vast majority of his career actually he's a demographer and the vast majority of his career has been spent on population aging largely in the developing world and so like spent a lot of time on japan obviously with their kind of demographic curve um and the aging population but he writes and talks and researches a lot about aging populations and the impact it has on economy so it's like very down the fairway this this exact conversation so he's going to be excited to tune into this one too yeah you know it's interesting because i think that there's been now a couple of decades of research by demographers by economists by sociologists that you know sort of raise a flag about that challenge um sort of inverted pyramids demographically and sort of the idea that you know older adults are no longer economically productive and so they're sort of a drain on social resources and that therefore when there's more of them and there's fewer younger people working to pay taxes or to create wealth or grow the gdp then you know you're isolating productive economic activities down to a group that's actually smaller than the group that's going to consume them this is actually exactly my dad's field of research it's called he called it the demographic dividend it's like the ratio of working age to dependent age populations um and when that ratio is very high you can experience a really robust growth curve like sub-saharan africa right now east africa et cetera when it's very low like in japan where you have tons of old people that are going to be relying on a smaller working age population it's a very challenged situation economically yeah yeah so undoubtedly that's true and i think people have you know at least had some surface level familiarity with that with if not you know sort of deep knowledge like like your dad i actually think though that um the way that that problem is framed is actually not that helpful for resolving it right i mean maybe from a policy standpoint it might be but not from a creative standpoint from an entrepreneurial standpoint from an investment standpoint because what ends up happening then is is we sort of see aging as a problem in older people as a problem that we have to solve rather than like an opportunity to think here's a vastly underserved population right as entrepreneurs i think we like to identify opportunities where like people want stuff and what they can do to get that stuff is inconvenient it's too expensive you know for whatever reasons they're just like not fulfilling that want or need and then we make businesses to go you know serve that um i think so much of you know and this is very understandable but so much of the way that um like the the philanthropy that work on aging the economists that talk about it they basically are trying to provoke urgency to say if we don't deal with this we're going to be we're going to have problems oh also you ought to be more empathetic towards older people you ought to respect them more you know older people are really challenged because they're increasingly sick and frail and alone and i need you to solve for them being sick like please invent more medical devices please you know encourage more people to take care of them and that's certainly important work but i think like the untapped resource is all of the creativity and innovation that comes from people that are like you know what i know how to do i know how to find people who want to do things like meet and connect with cool people uh who want to do things like have a a service that they're excited to go tell their friends about and participate in and capture some of the value there who want to build brands that people you know are excited to participate in and that to me is like where the real opportunity is where the white space is because very few people are competing there so many people are competing for gen z and millennial attention and you've got this like really crowded field but like if if i asked you right now think of um you know a soho house for older adults that you can imagine the coolest older people that you know wanting to go to you probably would have a really tough time thinking about that if i said think of a cool new app that's launched that recognizes that there's you know 30 million older adults in the united states who are re-entering the dating field that is going to like serve their needs and and help them connect with other interesting people that they can develop romantic relationships with i doubt you can think of anything there yeah it's super interesting just as like a general framework of what you're laying out this whole idea of like find these large underserved populations and it's like it's super unsexy as you said everyone wants to build the new like app for gen z you know greg we filmed an episode talking about this party app and it's like you know for teenagers and like college kids basically and parties in these cities and it's like super sexy to go build that you want to go build that but the reality is just from a sheer numbers perspective there are 46 million adults aged 65 and older in the u.s that's supposed to grow to 90 million by 2050. yeah and so like if you're just going to play numbers actually and you know what you want to like play the rising tide that's a pretty damn good tide to play from a rise as it's rising over the coming years yeah and two-thirds of the wealth in the country is controlled by older adults people over 65. yeah and when it's not sexy to build there as you said the competition is less fierce it's like i don't know if you guys have ever seen this it's one of my favorite investing frameworks um it's a matrix a two by two that is like complexity of building something um and then whether it's boring or sexy and you know like everyone wants to build the sexy stuff but the competition is super fierce so like the complex the highly complex and highly sexy things like spacex crazy crazy high competition everyone wants to build that thing then you have the like super complex but also really boring stuff like salesforce which has built this you know enormous enormous company around it because it exists in this place where it's boring but pretty complicated to actually go and build so this is like i think it's a really good way to think about these kind of ideas yeah and i i think we make those things sexy as entrepreneurs by just by like being bold enough to recognize that opportunity and then knowing that you can build a cool company around it right like think about stripe like what are they solving that's sexy they're solving like one of the most boring problems ever totally but most of us think that's a really cool company like we would have loved to have founded stripe um or you know even even uber is like basically a logistics service which you know people don't think about uh most people i think like growing up and being like you know what i really want to do when i get old i want to be an entrepreneur and i want to create a really good logistics management company but you know we made that cool um so i just think there's a there's if we think about it in the right way there you're right there's all this economic opportunity there but it could just be like fun work that yeah on understanding people and it's starting it's starting like i feel like the tides are now shifting a little bit with older adults and building and entrepreneurs are starting to realize it so you always say uh alexa ohanian who we've had on the pod always sees the future but he's been investing the last two or so years in a bunch of old startups for older adults and i think he probably i mean we should have him on to talk about it again but i think he probably realized it you know when his folks started getting older and also when he moved to florida which has uh just you know a lot of infrastructure for older adults and maybe not necessarily the right infrastructure um so and then the other thing i want to add to this you know i agree with you sahel about you know how do you build for underserved communities um one of the interesting things is we can actually take a lot of the formats that have worked for gen z or millennials and add the add nuances for this particular demographic so you don't have to that's that's why i think there's so much opportunity here is like you can actually like tinder you know you meant john you mentioned dating like tinder actually has a in hinge and a lot of these platforms have really great interfaces the problem is it doesn't speak to that particular audience in the way that they want to be spoken to so i'm wondering john and i know i texted you before this and i was like hey could you you know bring on some ideas or some some spaces that you find that you think there's a lot of opportunity can you talk more about some yeah just one or two ideas that you have on your mind today's episode is brought to you by market or hire with marketer hire you can get expert marketers on demand it's easy and fast what's marketer hire simply put marketer

marketerhire.com again that's marketerhire.com and tell them sahil sent you yeah um i've got i've got a lot um so you know sort of as a as a context setting thing one of the things that i think a lot of people don't think about that's really interesting about today's uh group of older adults is in many ways they're a go first generation and that makes it a lot like millennials or gen c and what i mean by that is these are people who grew up with an idea of what life was going to be like when they were 60 or 65 which they expected to to die maybe at 68 or 72 and that's kind of what they internalized in terms of like what is my life going to be like when i get there they're also the generation that sort of grew up the the last vestige of this social infrastructure that we had where like the with the idea that you take a job and you work there for a long time and you you know form community by going to church or being on the pta and like as all of those things have dissipated they were the ones who sort of counted on that to know like how am i going to get my friends well i'm going to get my friends and my relationships from my job that i've been at for 30 years i'm going to get like have my participation opportunities based on like going to the local vfw hall and you know communicating and as that's disappeared they're now in this place of thinking gosh i still have 20 or 25 years left of my life the world's been changed i don't have anybody to ask of like what does it mean to be doing it right right now and there's that same level of anxiety that i think millennials felt when the world changed and you're like i can't ask my dad like how to date well on tinder like he doesn't know anything about that you know he's not going to have any advice so we're figuring it out and we're also constantly worried that we're doing it wrong somehow we're missing out on opportunities so that's where older adults are yeah not to mention sorry to interrupt you not to mention like one of the things i've noticed with my parents with my wife's parents like this discomfort with spending what you've saved and built up over your life is a fascinating phenomenon to me like i consider my parents um i don't know moderately frugal i would say um but they have this like built up that they've saved for retirement and now there's this thing of like oh we don't want to spend it down and my whole reaction is like spend that down man like i i don't want it when you die because that's not going to be fun for me like i don't want to get a pool of money when you die it's just not what i want and i'd rather you live and have the most fabulous last 25 years of your life that you can possibly have but there's like if you've lived a certain way for 50 years and you've lived frugally and that's why you've built up this nest egg it's very hard to mentally shift into like a consumption mode of splurging on yourself and doing the fun things and spending the little extra it's just like a challenging thing and so i do think to this whole point like companies trends communities things that start to like unlock the way that older people are thinking about spending and living those last years of their life in a um you know productive healthy but also really exciting way are going to be really interesting yeah and you know the other thing that's exciting is that same principle i think is true not just with money but with time so you have this generation that basically deferred a lot of like living to say i'm gonna wait until i retire right i can't do that now i'm busy raising a family i'm busy saving i'm paying a mortgage i'm accumulating stuff i go to work 50 hours a week and then one day that's going to go away and then i'll do all of this stuff but what happens when you get there is then you're like i don't really know how to spend my time in a way that i love like i haven't really cultivated what value means to me and how i use my time so i need to get started so you've got this whole population of older adults who are basically in this position of like wanting to get started and they don't know how and i think that's where a lot of startup opportunities are like how do you lower the barrier to entry make older adults feel comfortable make them feel like they're not going to be ridiculed for being there they're not going to get taken advantage of for being there but like activate some of those behaviors that they've been saving up and they just need like a little nudge to start doing the stuff they always thought they were going to do from a from a product standpoint i think what might be helpful for folks is is to have a framework around this so i think when i hear both of you speak what i'm hearing you say sally you're saying like hey older adults sometimes have issues spending money and john what i'm hearing you say is sometimes older folks have challenges spending their time in the ways that they want to spend it like the format i would use for that is some you know some sort of calculator or budget so like imagine if you had a a calculator or or a me a me budget that you have to spend like it hooks up to your credit cards and it's like you have to spend a thousand dollars a week on stuff for you and maybe it's like experiences or maybe it's experiences for your kids or you have to spend a certain amount of time doing xyz and creating a whole platform around spending money and time specifically for older adults like that's that's an idea what do you think of that have you seen greg the the fat fire reddit community yeah yeah that is fat fire is like so fire is like financially independent retire early or something i think is what it stands for and fat fire is like so fire was the thing that rose that was like you know people who wanted to save just enough money and then basically quit when they were 30 or whatever age and live the rest of their life very very frugally that fire i was originally alerted to by sam parr our friend who um had been a big fan of it and basically this was like you're going to do that but you're going to do it in like a lavish lifestyle way so you're going to make enough money that you can you know then go live in a in a um you know in a more extravagant way maybe not like insane yachts you know planes but like a very very nice lifestyle and um it made me think when you were just talking there about like that idea but for older people because i don't think that community really exists like fat fire is really like our age it's like mid 30s 40 year olds that are doing this but older people like that same community you could probably build if you could figure out the right way to go find those people of like this core niche community of people who are trying to figure out how to like retire really lavishly and or maybe it doesn't even have to be crazy but retire in a way that is um you know in line with the way that they want to live their last 15 20 years of their life yeah yeah exactly like we've you know we've sort of built up a financial planner industry for a really long time and that's about you know calculating down how much money do you need to have in order to meet your monthly nut we haven't done anything like that that's like you know you're gonna need friends when you get that yeah that's my that's the thing it's like you need the commute the calculator i think is great greg the challenge with it is like my parents i could show my parents a calculator and show them hey you got to spend this much it doesn't change the psyche when you see it you're just gonna be like okay my financial planner told me i can spend this much i know you know wealth advisors have been telling you that it's like the community aspect to go to your thing it's like that is what brings people out of their shell a little bit when they start seeing like oh it's not weird for me to spend this and then you have a community where you can ask about like well how are you navigating the discussion about your spending with your kids and what they're thinking about with the will or you know all of these different considerations and you can now come in and like you could be selling affiliate things you could be selling leads off that community i mean if you built a community of like 2 000 high value um older people around something like this that would be an extremely valuable community because the investable assets of that community would be massive they'd be highly likely to spend on interesting and like cool experiences opportunities whatever i bet you could build a seven-figure community around older people that are looking to like understand how to spend and live in a more kind of glamorous way for the remaining years yeah yeah for sure for sure um and i i think it absolutely would be an interesting startup if you could layer in some of these you know other things like once you have a lot of free time you're going to want to have people to spend it with are you good at going out and making friends do you know how to do that you're probably not right you're going to have to get intentional about how you go mate make friends what the world built to help you do that decades ago was like senior centers that you don't want to go to because you don't like bingo or zumba you want to do things that make you feel like modern and alive and an interesting person so how are you going to do that like and it's not a switch that you're gonna flip so you gotta start practicing it before you get there in order to have you know those sort of relationship assets uh to be able to spend into when you get there so i think i i think there's just like a whole bunch of startup ideas that are that are around friendship making for older adults about romantic relationship making for older adults there are even things like if you're if you've been in a 30-year relationship in a marriage but now all of a sudden you're an empty nester and you're not worried about the kids anymore and and you haven't really made your main priority the relationship now you want to rekindle the spark you know with your partner now it's just like the two of you again like how do you start re-dating your husband uh after you've been together for 30 years and like what are some of the ways that you could do that right um so i i think those sorts of things that recognize the time of life that you have a bunch of people who are generally really wise and super experienced at living but now they're in this whole new context and they need some easy ways to start participating in that context that doesn't make them feel like you don't know what the hell you're doing shut down and rather it's like open up start talking to other people start learning from other people um and uh and sharing that back have you have you guys seen chief.com yeah so chief.com last week just raised 150 million dollars at a 1.1 billion dollar evaluation led by it's a community for uh women in the workforce largely for professional women exactly and there's like an app associated with it where you know there's different groups there's um uh now there's a physic a few physical spaces in new york and la and sf i think um [Music] and and at the core of it though you're right it's like this community of like-minded women who have a goal in mind um and that goal you know is making friends and and being supported in their career and personalized do you think a chief.com for older adults could be a a similar multi-billion dollar opportunity i definitely think that um and i i think there's there's multiple businesses to be built that way some like chief could be sort of you know professional community by older people for older people but also could really be intergenerational right there's there's chief is an example of that but you know there are all these ways we're rebuilding um [Music] opportunities for mentorship and for learning from one another and you have semi-retired or retired people who just know so much and are desperate to share that and then you have a bunch of younger people who are craving more sort of real-time in-the-moment advice that you can't really google you know like things like negotiating a job offer you can read like about what the negotiation strategy is but if you don't have an older mentor in your life it's hard to just be like yeah but i think in the meeting i'm going to be freaked out like how do i how do i call myself down and have the right conversation some of us are lucky that we can ask our parents that or have other people but there's so many people who don't right so what if like you know there's a linkedin like service where there's video connection to mentors like that on a on a part-time basis that's disrupted disrupted to this whole huge growing coaching industry you know um yeah there's a massive business to be built here actually um you guys know what ypo is yeah young president's organization and then they had um like they had offshoots of it but i just looked it up it uh it did a hundred million dollars last year it's a non-profit technically and so you can look up their numbers publicly like on causeiq.com um that's crazy like there is a big business ypo is so dated and dead like the whole concept of it but literally what it is is like higher performing you know people over the course of their life get brought into this community they do events they do trips that you have to pay for they do you know different gatherings there's a network you know that you can access etc but the idea of going and doing this um for older people that are kind of transitioning in their life and that are at that point when they're trying to transition is super interesting um and you can do it on such a micro level like if you went and built the chief.com or the ypo for older people yeah it doesn't have to be that you go you know national with it out of the gate like you could pick a couple of small kind of cities honestly like do it where a bunch of retirees are it's probably a good idea like go to boca and and spring something like this up and you could probably go get a thousand people pretty quickly like go host an event there that is specifically targeted for older people and get signups through that and probably pretty cost effectively get a pretty cool group of signups but like starting this completely bootstrapped as like a um an interesting cash flow-like business to own i think there's like a pretty big opportunity here because you can charge the people a lot for the membership and if you host cool events that it's like yeah paying for access we always talk about nfts as paying for access but like these people aren't going to do that necessarily but you can you know charge a thousand dollars a year for access to this like really exclusive cool application only community of older people and you know do these very cool gated events um you know screenings cultural things like ways where you can come in and meet people it's like what ypo did or what ivy connect was this company that tried to do it with like ivy league college grads yeah um similar thing like trying to create that whole vibe i bet you could build a really big business around this yeah well i think you didn't say this but just in in sort of explaining it i think what really smart entrepreneurs are trying to do because people have have tried to do that before but they've focused on i guess what i would say the supply side right it's really easy to recognize hey there's tens of millions of older people they know a bunch of stuff like it's an underutilized asset right so let's just gather them up and then we'll have that asset the place to focus is really on the demand side right so like who wants that who wants that and how do you structure it in a way where you know who the customer is what they're gonna pay for it why they would buy it what they would do to participate and make it cool for them and so that's kind of the the way that i would try to build that is to recognize um not that we we've got something because we've collected all of this wisdom it's really more who needs wisdom how do they need it how can we give it to them there's like you know we're basically going to arbitrage the wisdom because we can get it cheap from people who have more free time but still make it an attractive exciting participation opportunity for them where they feel well compensated by it but it's like you know way less than hiring a full-time business coach might charge you or something like that i just think doing it like community first as like call it the dusk social club or something like that like dusk of your life uh make it really cool and have this cool vibe to it where it's like something that their kids would you know have participated in and that they think is cool but they don't think that exists for them like when you think about what opportunities exist for you when you're a senior if you have you know some financial means it's like golfing you know like an old country club or a stodgy you know set of things and you all of a sudden make this feel elevated and cool there's a community built around it really interesting people cool events i bet you could spring something up pretty quickly in a in a small locale and build out like a really interesting cash flowing business to just to own like not maybe it's not a billion dollar company that you want to go raise money for and do that but i bet you could build like a very cool business that you could tack on a bunch of tier point john ancillary revenue streams to from like you know affiliate stuff where there's gonna be a ton of people that find value in this community that you're building yeah yeah for sure another another i think really big opportunity greg i know you've done some writing in the past about like unbundling things and how that creates a lot of startup opportunity i think the unbundling of like the senior living facility you know has so much opportunity because mostly that business is like we're going to vertically integrate housing your social calendar uh you know nutrition health you know all because the idea is if we can get you to live here then we put those services on top but they're massively expensive it surrenders control of a lot of those things to like yeah maybe i like you know the apartment i would get but i hate your your you know saturday events um that's not interesting to me at all right so think about if you could if you could change it where there's more of a way where you could find access to housing stock that's more individualized right that might even just be um sharing rooms together um when you want to move to a new city but then you get you you know that there's some way that's still like digitally or um you know some combination of in-person and digital there's going to be other people there for me to talk to there's going to be stuff for me to do right it's just unbundled now i for sure i i i think that's brilliant you should you you should write a post on it um and get that out there i think unbundling happens when a certain me you know medium channel gets just too big and often if it gets too big plus it gets really kind of old like the unbundling of craigslist where it got too big plus it got really old um there's like double opportunity um it sounds like the unbundling of senior living is is a bit of both it's gotten really big plus no one's really innovated on in such a long time so i think that uh oh and the other thing for startup entrepreneurs it's easier to take off a piece than to build like a whole thing so i also like that piece of it i mean definitely like craigslist it's like when you when you bundle it like that it just pushes you to lowest common denominator for so much stuff so that's why those services are like bingo because you're trying to think like well what's something relatively unoffensive that everybody can do if you if you let vertical communities exist within it then you can you know be an older adult who loves uh watching horror films and you know build a community around that or whatever your interest might be it could be really cool just as like an ancillary idea to this unbundling of the nursing home like what if you built a platform that was like culture or experience as a service for nursing homes like if you just play the numbers game right there's 45 million americans over over 65 there's going to be 90 by 2050. it's a huge population of people that are going to be in nursing homes um nursing homes are being built at an insane pace right now to fill that and for the most part like when you think about nursing home like what experiences and culture they're providing it's like someone comes in and plays the guitar or they do bingo night or whatever and i imagine a lot of these nursing homes would love to outsource um the entire experience and culture of what they have to some company that will just like create these amazing best-in-class experiences in culture building and so i wonder whether you could go and sell that in like do a b2b sale you probably could go to like some of the chains that like are sort of regional nursing home chains that have you know five or ten facilities in a region and say like hey we're going to be providing you know one to two monthly uh really cool experience or culture things you can use it as your marketing by the way as a nursing home to acquire new customers on your end and it could be a really cool just like straight cash flow business again where you're like coordinating you're basically an event coordination business but you're selling it to a population that has you know really high willingness to pay and and it would create a bunch of value i think it's a it's a good business idea um and i think there's opportunity there and but i will say right before this i was on a call with someone from disney and hearing the disney folks talk about their experiences and how they design experiences like disney would never like outsource like programming you know what i mean so what i'm what i'm what i'm excited about with some of the alive venture stuff um and some of the opportunity in the space is is really like from the ground up like what is a core user experience that not and and the other the other problem with older adults is we bucket older adults into this like massive category it needs to be subdivided like you know right totally it has to be granular and it has to be community based to your point like go find these little niche communities i mean i was talking about what the example of the big community here that's like high you know wealth um high wealth seniors right like it's people who are going to have a bunch of money to spend they want to go do this vibe cool thing that's like probably a very small proportion actually relative to the larger proportion of people that will be in this 90 million so i completely agree with you it needs to be niched down yeah i mean certainly we talk about older people as this hugely monolithic population right and it's it's just like 65 and over and we would never say like all 20 to 50 year olds in the country like the same stuff you know like if you're a soccer dad in iowa who's 47 are you looking for the same kind of experiences as a 23 year old new professional living in new york city unlikely right so i think there's just there's a lot of basic stuff that i think creative entrepreneurs are really good at i just think that by and large they haven't been attracted to the space kind of going back to the earlier point because we've made it unsexy and because we've also like it's so patronizing the way we look at older people that we're like uh they just need help with like incontinence or they just need help with um you know preventing dementia and those things you know are important and and necessary too but like a lot of it is just trying to do the things that we love to do our whole lives and do it you know in in better ways but with people who who know how to do that you know who know how to make something cool who know how to create a vibe to it who know how to focus on a community not like somebody who just happens to be the marketing director for a senior living facility and like is selling to the children of these people to get them to pay 12 grand a month to move them into facility and then be like okay now make it cool too for like the people that live there like they don't know anything about that but i bet you guys have done you know a lot of really cool things in your life and had a lot of cool experiences and if you were working on it and trying to think about what would be something that i could imagine myself being really excited about when i'm 67 i think we'd have just way cooler stuff have you guys heard um either one of you greg probably right up your alley have you heard of this business silva s-y-l-v-a with silva.com yeah they're like it's kind of interesting they're they're basically going and acquiring like micro communities um and then they have like they'll take over all of the kind of like back end of running and nurturing and building these communities um so they're kind of like rolling up these niche micro communities around things it's sort of interesting it's like greg it's sort of like micro acquire for communities so you can go build little micro communities you know 500 like i have a friend who um built a community of like 500 people um paying a little bit of money a month and got an acquisition offer for like six figures for the community from silva um it's sort of interesting like all of a sudden there's actually liquidity on these micro communities that you can go build so the idea of going and testing something within a senior world with some micro community that you identify and that you go build something for specifically um there's actually like a liquidity path on the back end of it too to kind of nurture and continue to grow it yeah so i'm i'm curious i mean you guys work more in web3 than i have i think we probably all think you know this generation of older adults are probably not the ones buying nfts and they probably don't know what it what a dao is they're not used to it maybe they're technology-phobic and that's probably true if you compare you know attitudes or experiences against you know gen z people but like that's not going to be true seven or eight years from now right if you're building a company so i'm just kind of curious if you know if you're thinking about it from a web three angle like how do you bring what we're learning about community and about participation and about you know distributed ownership models to like older adults in a way well i first want to myth bust a second there's this myth that older adults like don't get crypto not interested in crypto not interested in nfts and it's the complete opposite i i also want to myth bust something about myself maybe i you know i actually spend more time with 82 year olds than i do 28 year olds and you know my idea of a good time isn't going to like live or nikki beach in miami beach but is to go you know hang out in a jacuzzi with you know an 87 year old man who's he's going to tell me amazing stories about his life as a concert promoter living in in brooklyn and the place i live today is this island in the miami area and it is predominantly older adults who are retired and we have a ton of programming on this island i believe today or tomorrow there is a whole event around crypto and they brought in this guy not me but they brought him this guy who's coming in talking to people about crypto and that wasn't like a top-down thing and there's not that many events this is like people were like hey we're interested in crypto we're interested in nfts like teach us so what when i saw that event i was like there's probably you know we were talking about wallets before you came on john there's probably an opportunity to build like a wallet for older adults or there's probably a set of financial products that could be created for this demographic that's genius that um i actually i'm curious if anyone's doing that because the amount of capital that has flown into that for gen z like for kids you know like banking for teens banking for 10 year olds there's like crypto for toddlers you know raising at a 250 million posts like it's absurd the amount of money that has flown into all those by the way those people are so high churn that these these companies are deploying so much money into customer acquisition because a customer comes on and it's freaking 18 year old they change their mind every day so they're switching versus like a high loyalty sticky older customer like this um i think it's really interesting and it would be like a unique set of tools that you needed to build out for them too um you know to make the product make sense i mean my parents asked me constantly about this stuff i have to imagine they would appreciate a product that like is built for them integrated into their life where you're kind of abstracting away the complexity of all the all the noise in the background yeah and if you built a really cool interface for that and you showed that you know you have some understanding of when you're in a later life situation how you're thinking about assets and spending down versus buying new and you just did that even in a way that showed you have some stickiness with the community like could you really not sell that to a fidelity or a prudential or a vanguard you know for lots of money and you know get out of that business because they're not going to do it themselves um and like i don't know i just think if you're you know even just opportunistic about what's a two or three year play um to build a company that creates massive value for like the financial services industry or the retirement planning industry like there you go john can you talk more about or can you talk about aarp like i vaguely know what it is because i've seen like their magazines and i know they're super big um but can you talk more about like who they are what their role is what their business model is and their you know if someone is is building a business for older adults today like should they be working with them or how they how should they be thinking about aarp well i don't work for aarp so i i don't you know i'm certainly not the authority on them i'm happy to talk about it just as a sort of casual observer so it used to stand for i believe american association of retired persons and then they recognized that a lot of the audience they wanted to have didn't really that didn't resonate with them and people were retiring later or never retiring and so they just made it aarp that stands for nothing anymore um and i think this was a dozen years ago or more um it's just an acronym without any you know further elaboration but they actually i believe have the nation's largest circulation magazine it's like 39 million subscribers and they've got two sides of it one is a is a not-for-profit that does a lot of like advocacy and policy work um and then they have another side which i believe is a for-profit business which contributes to the non-profit that you know sells products to older older people um advertises through the magazine you know all of that so they've done this this really big audience aggregation but yeah a lot of people like they don't look forward to getting the aarp card in the in the mail you know first of all like who even like opens their mail anymore i don't know if they send it to you digitally now or not um but like that's that's the thing with all of this like people build for older adults in such a way that they don't want to be associated with the brand they might want like the discounts that you get from aarp so they join but nobody is like gonna wear an aarp sweatshirt out to you know an event and be be proud that they like it and so i think again like if if we thought about older people as being cool in certain ways that younger people aren't and we built a brand that like spoke to that that they were excited about then you've got people being like you know i'm part of i'm part of chief people like saying i belong to chief you know they don't generally like saying i belong to the senior center i belong to aarp yeah it does seem like unbundling aarp is an interesting idea yeah like how do you take the components of it that have done well i mean the magazine circulation is fascinating like could you not create a much cooler version of that and circulate paper you know physical printed magazines that are like dope really cool card stock like high high high quality but much cooler and not the like i remember the first time an aarp magazine arrived for my dad and he was probably like it was you know several years before he would have actually been retired and it was early and i remember him like kind of cringing he was like oh you know now i'm old because this thing showed up so it definitely wasn't like a point of pride and something cool in the way that it could be right you could like attach and stick to people um that i mean it seems like a cool opportunity actually to your point on like any business where people there's tons of people and they they made 1.7 billion dollars last year um in revenue and like any time that's the case and no one is proud to say they're affiliated with it that seems like an opportunity just as a mental model for sure for sure right if you flipped it in a way like as we grow up a lot of our life is looking forward to being older than we are like when we're kids like i want to be 16 so i can get that driver's license and drive and be independent or i want to go to college or like i can't wait till i'm fully an adult and i don't have to deal with my parents anymore and then we stop treating older people like that but there are things that i think you know later life brings uniquely and so if you could build a brand around that that's like oh no young dude you you can't be part of this yet you haven't earned your way in this is for people who've you know who've really lived so look forward to to get into the age rather than having that kind of cringe experience when it comes that's like signals like i guess my life's over now it's just declined from here um you know that just seems like again it's something build a business that people want to participate in you know rather than one that they're ashamed to be a part of yeah well i have so many takeaways from this discussion just like on little frameworks and mental models that i feel like we went through and talked about in the context of a bunch of different ideas like one of the biggest ones for me is find you know large underserved communities like these large growing markets where it's just it's not sexy it's not the place where everyone wants to participate and go and create something that is uniquely for them go talk to 100 people within that market and you'll immediately know what it is like what pops out is the common trend that they're all saying they struggle with or that's a pain point etc and go build something for that little niche you can test things very quickly by building a little community around it to steal one of greg's you know common themes that he likes to talk about and there's a huge opportunity to go do that i think with within the senior community as that population grows and as they're looking for things and looking you know in that transition and tipping point of their own lives for new communities and new ways to engage with others so i those are the big ones for me greg biggest thing for me is just because there's a bunch of people fishing over here doesn't mean you need a fish over here and in fact over there might be where all the fish are um older adults you probably don't wake up in the morning and think about how do i build a dating app for older adults and just but turns out like there's a huge opportunity there and beyond opportunity like you're doing good you're doing good so um this is yeah this is a great reminder so yeah thanks john i love that analogy it it i'd be careful with it because in my world it sort of means another thing because there's so many scams targeting older adults that when we think about fishing um right we want to make sure that you know we're not talking about fishing that way um but this was really fun guys i really enjoyed you know thinking with you both and um and seeing you know sort of where your brains go when you when you start thinking about these audiences yeah there's a bunch of cool opportunities in this space it'll be interesting to see what our community thinks of these and and hopefully jam on a few of them i mean i do think there's a bunch of really cool cash flowing businesses that you could spring up pretty quickly around this space so um doesn't have to be the massive you know vc-backed techcrunch article but there are some really really big opportunities here and hopefully some bright entrepreneurs that go and pursue them where do where do people learn about a live ventures um and what you get you guys do so alive ventures.co is our website uh we put out a campaign just recently um uh sharing some of the insights that we've gotten uh both from a market perspective and from talking to hundreds of older adults um that we call growing older better um so that's just alive interest dot co slash growing hyphen older hyphen better free insights that's where every great startup idea comes from so we'll take it i love it thanks guys thank you so much for joining us john this was great really enjoyed it cheers man thanks so much for listening to today's episode if you have any questions that you want featured in a

sal how many followers do you have on twitter uh 575 000. okay so that's quite a bit right you know this is like a popular guy right uh now you know so i could argue and i'm very critical that you add value to twitter right i mean you there are 5 000 people who follow you and get value so you're adding some value to the company right no i hope so when was the last time i sent you a check for your final thoughts and followers and the work you do on twitter i haven't seen one yet unfortunately okay when was the last time they asked you for input into addition that they're making in their offices in san francisco uh very rarely well you know so and by the way either again i was at twitter and i mean pick on them but you you know been seven to eight years ago when social media but maybe 10 years ago when social media came out the construct of social this so there was kind of a an agreement on social media right the agreement was we will give you an audience and you in turn will give us content right and that's that's the deal right and you grow your audience and by the way you know we will show ads against it and you know it'd be great business so that was kind of the deal but over the years i think that concept has slowly shifted like i think the rise of the creator economy the rights of companies like cameo has been like kind of a shift where you know you've seen these creators who are like saw the creator right like sarah could be like hey you know what you know i you know i deserve to be compensated for my service to twitter because we can obviously see he's adding some value to twitter [Music]

user generated content are for the very first time so we'll figure out a bunch of these were even taos for example last year and a half we learned so much about governance and you know we learned tons more about token design but i think the possibilities are just like it blows your mind [Music] what's up dude what's going on i like your outfit tonight thank you uh i like the buttoned up all the way button down i think it's like a it's a sharp look the stock market is is tanking right now so i've taken a second job as a busboy that's that's kind of where i'm at can we talk about the market actually for a second i'm not i'm i'm zero percent market analyst um but i do find it funny i tweeted and then aborted a tweet today um because i didn't want to offend people like for the last 10 years everyone has been tweeting out like warren buffett quotes about you know that quote um be uh be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful uh you know like everyone tweets that out it's like this common wisdom that everyone throws out and um you know then when everyone actually is fearful everyone just panics and you start getting texts from all your friends being like the world's ending you know like nikita and all these other people in our group chat sending us texts telling us the world is ending yeah i mean you and i are on the same page with this like we're

look at the market right now so first off i buy the s p 500 every single monday like without fit i just i always do that that's just like my dollar cost average and that will always be like my biggest position long term um but i i mean when i look at the market today and i see some of the things that i'm like personally um excited about the trends around i think it's hard like i'm just pulling random stuff up like look at um random like random growth trends that are in the market that you know are going to be around and be big for the long term and they're down like 40 off their highs or 50 off their highs it's just hard to imagine if your time horizon's long enough that it's not a good time to buy these like tech forward names and it's not financial advice but like when i look at it that's why i like personally on all of these massive collapses i'm just like go buy a little bit of basically everything in my portfolio yeah i mean same here not financial advice but i was just just looking at uh robin hood so robin hood uh just announced a few minutes ago that they're laying off nine percent of their workforce um and the reason why is because of they're like we have duplicate functions um which is obviously terrible that people are losing their jobs um and the stock is down um at the same time i look at it and i'm like okay the market cap for the business is 8.6 billion they've got like almost 6 billion dollars of cash on hand so the enterprise value is like two you know three billion dollars something like that and it's robinhood they've got like 20 million plus customers um you know you gotta think that that's a decent bet yeah i in again like i know nothing about the fundamentals of these i don't actually buy single name stocks you know this like i only own one single name stock it hasn't gone so hot since i did it because my the only one that i bought it was like right into the peak of of the nasdaq but i don't really buy a single name stock so i'm just like some of these industries are just going to be massive and continue to exist if we're going to have a future as a society like semiconductors down smh which is like the name that i'm in there is literally down from like 300 plus to like 220 or something 230. like that is a massive drop um and yeah like is it gonna get impacted by all this stuff probably but the reality is like semiconductors have to exist and continue to develop for us to have a technology driven future uh do you know raoul paul um yeah the real vision guy um he sent me his latest piece um he calls it the exponential age um you know his whole like thesis for the future here and um he basically is like tracking this basket of what he calls the kind of exponential age stocks and looking at where they are relative to their trans trend lines and whether they're buys and for the first time this week he started saying um on the drop that he was going to start legging into this stuff because they're so far down off of their trend lines that you know as these become a bigger and bigger part of our technology future they're gonna be like life-changing returns on the um you know on the upside coming back from this so it'll be interesting to see i mean there's tons of macro involved obviously like the fed continuing to tighten and raise interest rates is a huge driver of the markets i personally think that if we see my gut tells me that we're going to see like a pretty bad q2 from an economy standpoint like i wouldn't be shocked if we actually saw negative growth and people panic i think the fed will just like reverse course very quickly because they've shown an unwillingness to allow pain um and i think if they do that growth stocks will rip like we've never seen them rip in history uh and anyone that was actually you know kind of had the guts to be buying i think we'll be rewarded for those guts but again not financial advice and uh time horizons matter if you're planning to retire and you need this cash soon for some purchase or something completely different story than you and i sitting here just basically like you know i feel like it's toy money because i don't need it for a long time switching gears from public markets to private markets i don't know if you saw you mentioned nikita but he tweeted the other day if the startup you're working for is valued at more than 100 million dollars and the exercise window on your options is 90 days you should pencil in that your equity will be worth nothing at this point um and i'd love you to just to explain that for folks uh what is he saying and then how do you think that these you know big drawdowns of 50 60 70 on public markets are gonna affect you know seed series a series b series c startups yeah i mean i think broadly what he's getting at is the idea that um you know equity to to employees was issued at you know sort of the most recent valuation of the company and in an environment like this if you were joining like a series c or series b startup that had raised at a big price and your equity was being issued at that price um you're under water you know on a true mark to market basis private markets do not have a mark to market function and the way that public markets do i can go check the coin based stock every single day and know that the value of my equity is lower but in a private market if my company just raised at a billion dollar valuation and i got equity granted at that valuation now a few months later the market has clearly adjusted that billion dollars which was based off of a lot of public comps in the market is worth it could be worth 40 50 less just off of like pure public comps because of how much some of the public names have dropped from a multiple standpoint and so what i think nikita's getting at is just this idea that like oh my god a lot of startup equity in these employees that have that equity are wildly underwater and there is like a massive return in the market um that needs to be achieved prior to those people having any value in that equity um and it's a challenge i mean we saw instacart i think i think it was instacart a few weeks ago like repriced their uh repriced their internal valuation for this exact reason so i think you're going to see um more and more startups having to think um really deliberately about doing this like instacart i just pulled this up march 25th instacart basically um cut its own valuation to 24 billion dollars which was a markdown of almost 40 percent off of where the last funding round had been done by fidelity d1 sequoia and andreessen so all those guys invested um you know at like yeah 39 billion dollars in march of 2021 and a year later um you know the company was actually marking it down from 39 billion to 24 billion for the purposes of making sure that employees you know had real value in the equity that they were that they were granting because you know it goes without saying if if the whole market knows that you're worth less than 39 and you're trying to incentivize employees by saying hey i'm going to give you a grant based on the 39 billion valuation if i'm looking at it i'm saying like well that's worth half what you know that's worth half what you're telling me it's worth basically um so it's an interesting dynamic i do think you're going to see more companies having to reprice and uh and think about employee incentives in a more comprehensive way yeah and you know you say it goes without saying but i actually think we we should talk about this stuff because i think there's like you'd be shocked how many employees like just don't know the fundamentals of all this stuff um well there's a business idea there by the way like the the lack of education and transparency around how options work um how exercise periods work you know the tax side of it managing liquidity managing your tax implications all of that stuff is crazy and that goes for like public companies it goes for private companies all of it i mean my sister-in-law works at twilio and you know has had equity over a long period of time and it did extraordinarily well over the you know period in 2020 it rose to 400 a share now it's all the way down to 120 and she was having to pay taxes on things from you know gains that she had had and it was just like this massive headache of things that candidly very few people that are joining a tech company really want to or would have learned about that stuff right and so i think there's a business somewhere in there of like it's probably a b to b to c sale like you go plug in some sort of software or something easy that's an education and kind of management tool for employees plug it in with the companies card has tried to do it but their platform sucks man when you go look at it and try to like manage your options on there it's really not intuitive and non-educational to me so either they should acquire someone and adapt it they should improve it or someone can come in and disrupt this market and provide something better yeah i like it i think there's there's definitely like a need for that just like people who understand tech like you understand like hey like your ceo might say this company's worth 39 billion but it's really worth 24 billion so um i definitely think uh there's a business there um i want to pull up um a text message that i got right before this call from a founder i invested in um because i think if he's texting me this a lot of people are probably thinking about this and it's related to our conversation so he said do you really do you think that the fundraising environment is changing or is it just a lot of unwarranted fear um and then i said what stage are you talking about and he writes i guess any sage seeds or series a and then he links to me a tweet by uh harry steppings yeah i saw that tweet founders you need to hear the truth the funding market has changed that raise you wanted you aren't going to get you're raising too much with too little you will go out burn lots of discussions raising too much then come back with smaller requests don't do this um so you want to plus fud from harry man yeah so he's and then he writes lol after that um and first off i think vcs are a little self-serving when they tweet stuff like that and i will tell harry this harry's a friend um you know like look i personally if you're a series b series c you know and later startup has the funding market changed yeah absolutely because uh you know like i had i told you about this i just had a conversation with um uh one of the heads at one of the big crossover funds and he was telling me like what we're looking at now because we invest in both private and public is we're basically those late-stage private companies we have a direct comparison point now to look at a public company that has the same growth profile is of bigger scale and that is liquid and so he's like with what those have traded down to why would i invest in a private late stage software company that is illiquid uh when i could get the same growth and fundamentals in a liquid name in the public markets at a better price he's like it makes no sense and so what he's seeing is he thinks there's going to be like kind of a rush out of that late stage growth market so companies that went and raised big rounds in 2021 don't really maybe have to worry about it because they've got runway and hopefully they're being prudent from a cash standpoint but if you were planning to raise a big you know series c this year at a big price it's really really hard you're just not going to find a lot of capacity in that market on the earlier side of the market i'm curious what you're seeing greg i haven't seen a massive change in like seed and maybe like the the high priced series a's probably aren't gonna happen quite as crazy as they were which is probably a good thing candidly um but the like pre-seed seed market and it's just so long-term and it's you know 10 plus year horizons that i i don't see a massive change in the valuations yeah couldn't agree more precede seed you know mostly business as usual you're back in great teams basically so um i still i still think great teams and great products are going to be competitive but yeah agreed on the later stage um i think there'll be some correction um i just what i don't love about that tweet um harry stebbing's tweet is i think a lot of his following are founders who are you know seed series a or even precede and i want to encourage people to to go you know to go and build and don't be afraid like a big part of raising money like i've raised money a few times like is the confidence and so if you're listening to this like just because you're seeing some tweets um that like prices are going down it's gonna be harder to raise like you know keep your head keep your head up high yeah i completely agree and look like builders build um you know fundraising is fundraising but if you're building something valuable and you're building real value um there's going to be a market for it and there's so much capital that has been raised by all of these venture funds it has to go to work somewhere and the truth is i don't know the truth is like if you're going to see a tweet a fun tweet and it's gonna stop you from raising money like are you really an entrepreneur right yeah like like that's plus who cares like if it's at if you raise your series a at a you know 100 million versus 150 a few months ago yeah there's more dilution but if your goal is to build a 10 billion dollar business um yeah you're going to own less you know percentage points is it slightly worse off you're still going to be rich like if you go build the big thing you're still going to be rich it's okay uh so i don't know man i i um i just think it's like separate the signal from the noise a bit here uh i know we've got sriram in the uh waiting room so let's uh let's go ahead and bring him in thank you so much for having me on you know the cliched saying of like long time listener first time caller i just love what your books do i watched all of it i watched you know the one with alexis and such you know i would say okay i'm gonna say a bunch of good things and then like one really bad bad thing okay a bunch of good things is you know love the vibe of the show and you know love like the couch and the the comfort and the conversation it's all great i just feel like you know you know i was watching alexis uh the one that alexis um which is great episode it's amazing minimal uh minimum viable community and in the middle alexa just kind of calls off camera and someone just brings him i think some vodka or tequila or something and i just want to say first of all i have like a coke zero over here so i feel like i'm not getting the full-blown guest experience well i'll actually see like you know the big shot like let's get him you know let's get him like the full container like oh so yeah yeah let's get him one like a you know like a shitty you know internet connection and let's get this one out so yeah i feel like so i okay first off very fair criticism i blame um i blame kovid i guess i blame omicron because the last ones we were able to do in person were like art basel week in miami and since then we've been doing these on a remote uh you know on a remote setting on on zoom or on riverside uh which is one of the lexus's portfolio companies i think they just raised their series b so we've been doing them remote although super excited post my baby and once my like paternity leave is done to be able to come back and do the the couch vibe and we will have you back on and we will have someone walk into the shoot and give you a tequila i think that was babak by the way greg that did that i will hold it by the way i just want to say also congratulations in advance you know i was sort of expecting you know well it might still happen any moment you might just kind of disappear and it's gonna be me and craig i hope not i hope not but um i will take you up on some uh father advice at some point soon so anyway man thank you so much for joining um we have been really excited to have you on and so the feeling is is really mutual and a bunch that we want to want to chat about with you so i personally would suggest we just dive right into it the the first thing that i want to talk about before we get into the obvious around elon musk and all of this twitter stuff um the first thing i want to get into is um this uh aku world the akutars uh hack or or exploit or um thing that happened greg did you see this i did so i can give everyone anyone that hasn't seen this i can give a a quick primer on so aku world aku world um the website is aku.world i believe um it's created by this guy micah johnson who incidentally is like a friend of mine and um someone who uh i think extremely highly of he's from the baseball world actually which is where i know him from he played baseball at indiana ended up going and playing professional baseball um and since has become an artist and he's this incredible artist um and basically in the early days of the nft uh rise he created this project called aku world and it was all based around this pretty amazing story of his nephew who is an african-american kid who basically told someone that he wanted to be an astronaut and was told that black kids couldn't be astronauts uh and so uh micah created this whole art and world and project around um around that idea basically uh it's a young boy with an astronaut's helmet on is kind of the basis of this whole world and it's really incredible our incredible thing they've had a ton of success with the early drops but the latest is um sort of an unfortunate thing that's happened in their most recent drop which was a error in the code around the smart contract that was exploited and caused about 33 million dollars to be locked forever uh in the smart contract and so i'm curiou like you guys are my web three guys i'm curious um i'm curious uh what you guys think of this situation in general how we can prevent things like this from happening and um you know and how we can sort of um come back from stuff like this uh good question okay i probably have a disappointing answer because i don't think i followed the situation too closely i saw it on twitter but you know um i didn't follow the situation too closely so uh this might be very more general um i think it's like kind of a couple of things right um you know i think if you kind of look at any sort of technology shift over the last you know 20 30 years uh there's kind of been like a period of time when you know we've kind of hit oh here's this amazing new platform they can do a bunch of amazing things and then there's a bunch of like you know i think there's two things which happen right i actually don't remember the details in this case i think it was kind of a error of some sort it wasn't like a malicious hacker uh you know and as a but you know in the last six seven months there have been like you know multiple famous incidents you know the the wormhole incident there's a few other famous incidents there are actually you know people on the other side so i think they have two broadcasts or things which happen like one is uh you know um engineers and developers over time you know discover like what are the patterns and practices and make like painful errors uh i like a great story from 90s they'll just get to the other other version of this they're just bad guys and you know the bad guys get smarter and then the good guys get smarter and there's kind of like a warfare which keeps going on and i think you see this over time and time again one of my favorite stories is from a close friend of mine steven synovsky uh you know who we all make fun of you know uh because for all his history of windows and offices he's amazing he's yeah he's one of the most senior people at microsoft and he was running office uh or probably a very senior role at office in the late 90s any of you room with the i love you bug right um i do remember it vaguely yes i'm dating myself uh this is no i remember this my dad it was the it was like an email that went out from aol it well no it was like it was like an email that went out from aol where like it you it sent out to your entire address book i remember this hitting my dad it was an email that went out to your entire email address book that just said i love you uh and so it was the subject line was i love you and so like a bunch of your colleagues were getting an email from you saying i love you and people clicked it and opened it and it continued to spread and it was like this malicious it was malware or something right exactly by the way half your audience is going i have no idea what i love your bug is and the other half are just feeling triggered that you just said well i know this because my dad told me what back in my day well i just remember when this happened to my dad and it was a big deal because it was like the first hack i had experienced too it was not like a big part and what would happen you know it's basically sort of like you know misused some scripting capabilities and steven stafford has a great story of how he got all these phone calls you know from all these reporters saying like what is going on and you know micros involved in this and you know even without knowing what is going on he was like well we're going to beef up security you know i think what's an output express or outlook and we're going to make it harder to run scripting code yet right and so i think it's kind of this constant you know the good guys put up more defenses the good guys teach developers how to write better code uh you know audit more code you know they're kind of like open source repositories or patents and practices and the packages now crypto obviously has a uh uh an added sort of incentive because there's like real economics at stake um you know which makes it a lot more lucrative uh but you know i think you know one thing i've been seeing is that there's just so much community effort and just making things more secure like here's a plug uh uh on the uh i don't you know we kind of recording this in near the end of april and on the a16z side we put out a blog post from the security team on you know who uh riaz who kind of works on a bunch of our security efforts and a couple of others talking about like bunch of security practices right so it's going to be a constantly evolving thing we probably haven't seen the last of it but i think the community is going to get stronger with each one yeah well the interesting thing that you pointed out there so it was a dutch auction um which for people that aren't familiar it starts at the top and sort of steps down until you find the buyers for the entire pool um and basically they were going to issue refunds to anybody that bid above what the ultimate uh resting price was on the auction and um it ended up that all of those funds because of a mishap in the code that got exploited basically got locked and trapped and to the credit of the team you know it was a coding mishap they basically didn't audit the code sufficiently to make it function at the appropriate level to the credit of the team they came out of pocket from the treasury to refund the people that were supposed to get refunded and micah who i will admit is a friend i thought handled it with a lot of grace in terms of just stepping up owning it and um you know and basically saying we're going to build back brick by brick and it doesn't change the quality of the world that we're trying to build the point that you made uh street ram that i thought is also interesting is the way that web 3 works um around you know like someone came and exploited this like somebody exploited this mishap in the code now in a market level this became a big incident a lot of people knew about it it shines a huge light on making this type of mistake in the code that should not happen again now because so much money was lost in some in a mishap like this the next people that are going to build the next project should actually benefit from the fact that this has happened because now they've learned there's been a light shine on this someone's going to audit that specific piece of code very carefully and so you have this like market mechanism now to hopefully continuously improve so for everyone that shines a light on like oh there was this mishap in the code and look at all the money that was lost web 3's broken et cetera actually the flip side of that argument would say that now everyone gets to know that exact mistake that can be made and improve in future projects against it so i think it's really interesting i think so i think with every one of these the you know the patterns and practices you know you you probably end up making different mistakes like we live in a world of technology in code uh you know um and we can throw a lot of tools at it and a lot of interesting new tools from like formal verification to auditing but there's always going to be like threats like you know for example you know there are uh you know what folks what apts are like advanced persistent threats which basically means you know uh governments like you know folks like north korea or other countries you can imagine trying to go after these always be these people um but you know i think i'm just gonna build on something you said i i i didn't follow this instant pretty closely but i always find it very remarkable when communities can survive and continue with legitimacy one of my favorite blog posts in the last several years not just in crypto in anything is from vitalik it's called legitimacy is uh you know the the best cash resource if you haven't seen it you can probably drop a link in something go check it out um and it talks about how you know one of the you know one things that crypto really deals with and not just why are not just good about life is how scarce legitimacy is i'll give you an example all of you probably remember the dow hat right it was kind of the famous thing which caused uh this uh ethereum fork and i think only recently we actually figured out actually what might have happened uh you know because of the book this came out um but you know at one time you know there was a big question of you know will eat actually survive um and in a lot of ways i think it was metallic and the community having the credibility which made them all you know switch and you know actually survive and obviously you know they've done really well since then so you know i sometimes think about there's a monetary aspect but one of the most interesting things for me about web3 uh you know as kind of a cultural social force is sort of legitimacy technology and economics kind of all being mushed together right because i used to work on social media and you know be there with social capital like you know people having millions of followers but there's not real economics tied to it but web 3 kind of brings those together which i think is really really interesting i'll give i'll give my point of view on this because i i do a ton of drops uh via our agency late checkout so we we build drops and if i ever have bags under my eyes it's because we're doing a drop that day um i i think my what i would love is i would love web 2 infrastructure in a web 3 world and what i mean by that is in webs exactly a great a great song title what i mean by that is like a lot of the time what we're doing in web 3 is we're writing custom contracts custom software um or we're grabbing multiple things and sort of putting it together and be and because of that and also because there's a shortage of talent um and because people just haven't been doing this that long a lot of the time there's mistakes um and there's a lot of processes that you can do to to mitigate the mistakes and like what we have a ton of those processes in place like for example like when you do your first mint you know make sure that you can withdraw the ethereum from that first mint to somewhere else make sure it's not locked and there's like 100 things like that that you can do but my only advice to people listening who potentially want to do a drop is it's important to to to basically have those processes in place and and you know work with people who've you know aren't doing their first drop you know work with people who've done multiple drops i think is really really important um i do want to switch gears a little bit and talk about twitter because that's that's that's on my mind right now um did something happen with twitter it happened you just stole my lines you just stole my line [Laughter] so you know we're sitting here uh it's been about 24 hours since elon musk has been uh you know it's approved that he's buying twitter so it's very exciting [Music] um do you think that elon is going to make twitter a more web-three version of twitter and if so what would that look like good question by the way i have to say you know if you follow this story for the last uh couple of weeks from you know him you know revealing that he has a stake you're going on the board and all of that it's only been two weeks so i don't know when you first plan on getting this podcast out but this could be like hopelessly out of date by the time you know we might as well be talking about something in the 90s uh given how fast the story is moved uh no so first of all i just want to say like you know twitter is a company and a product which is just very special to me on multiple levels uh one is uh you know just my personal story i think so much of my professional connections personal connections uh uh you know have come to twitter you know i'm pretty sure like sal and i started dming on twitter at one point in time i made a lot of relationships uh through twitter uh i also you know over the years you know built up a little bit of a following and people have been a bit so good to me on twitter that's not just on the personal side i also worked there for a few years and you know i had uh ran a variety of products over there so i got to see the company on the inside i work closely with jack and the team over there so i feel like i'm very connected and you know very grateful for the product in multiple ways now uh okay experience there's things which i think elon has said that he would do uh and there's things which i would you know i would love for somebody to do and you know that somebody might be elon or something i think might be fun if he does i think what elon has talked about uh in public so far has been a you know he wants to you know he has a point of view about content moderation and censorship and free speech which we can probably get into if you want to get rid of that uh he's talking about bots um and he's talked about uh you know just kind of just improving the product right and i think a lot of people have very very strong views to put it mildly on elon and some of these but uh uh which you can also get into uh but for me you know uh you know i i think in some ways even jack has talked about is i would love to see twitter get decentralized and it might be just kind of like talk about like what that actually means and i have no idea about that elon i don't think you actually talked about it jack has a little bit but i think elon has talked about it so we'll have to see uh so uh i think the best way to talk about is through analogy so we all grew up using you know email um and i remember april 1st i think it was 2004 when there was a rumor of google launching this new email product which had one gigabyte of free space and you know you could you know the invites were really hard to get but fun fact i tried to impress my wife arthi uh back when i was doing her by getting her one of these really hard to get invites and we got married so uh uh kids there's a story for you there uh you know but you know but the truth is email had existed for i think a couple of decades you know before gmail came along um and even to this day right you all just using tcp and smtp and imap and pop i can send you an email no google nobody else in the middle right so there is a protocol uh you know which is built on smtp imap pop etc and there's a bunch of like infrastructure that goes along with it then there are a bunch of clients like i grew up in a uh age when like yahoo and hotmail emailed us were really popular the gmail became popular and all of us i'm sure had a variety of like work email addresses and so on so um but at no one time did when you forced to use one company's product it's not as if like google says hey you know what folks you're off gmail today and then you're banned from the word of email right so i think that that is one lens of decentralization which i think of it as like you know you can pick the client that you want to use and by the way the gmail client very different from you know your client i have one of these nerds who likes to sometimes check email with emacs uh gunus fans represent uh i'm sure you have no idea what i'm talking about but that just perfectly works you don't need google in the middle um and i think there's something really powerful about that concept of uh hey there is a right to exit even if i don't even if i can't use google or google makes me not use them for some reason i have an alternative that's one very important uh you know factor the other important factor is you can build your own client experience right so for example gmail has a spam algorithm they have a recommendation algorithm right all those different things but that's not what gmail is doing on the client it does nothing about the nature of email itself like in fact you know i'm sure if you have like a non-gmail client they're not sometimes going to spam they don't do the recommendation or whatever so so you have a client which is doing ai in ml which is trying to detect your spam or not trying to sort it to offers or social or all things that gmail does so what you're having is you have a protocol which basically kind of transmitting you know electrons really uh but then you have a client layer which is doing ai recommendation gmail try to guess it what you might be interested in viewing it tries to you know send out all the you know the viagra ads off into spam like it does all those things for you now um you know when you think about say twitter i i don't mean to pick on twitter i think it's a very special company or facebook or any one of these companies i've been very grateful for all things they've done to many amazing companies but you don't have a choice right like if twitter says you're off you're off it's not like you can code up something on emacs and be like oh i'm going to use twitter in my own way so there is no right to exit which i think is like one key bit on decentralization so this is one key factor now the second key factor is uh now this whole debate on speech content moderation we can by the way i was there on the inside we can spend hours talking about this right and i think you know beginning and you know we probably won't make most people happy but let me kind of like oversimplify right there is one set of people who think certain sets of things should be allowed to be said on twitter but there's another set of people who think certain things should not be noticed on twitter right incredibly broad oversimplification here folks that's the name of the game now the challenge is uh if any one of these people say you know uh you know win or you know are right on twitter the other side has no alternative you're basically banned from twitter like you have nowhere else to go the same doesn't exist for email right on email like in if gmail bans you that's fine you know i can still find a way to get email to you now of course you you may not use the email client that actually read it or whatever so i think that's also important in terms of like uh twitter needs to be decent to life one into a protocol so people can use a different client the second is they can use their algorithms of choice right so you could get banned off say you know the twitter that uh let's pick an example uh uh uh again name your favorite personality today's episode is brought to you by market or hire with marketer hire you can get

absolutely love it if you're a growing business you will too check them out today at marketerhire.com again that's marketerhire.com and tell them sahil sent you elon musk uh well let's pick somebody from our world um my favorite vc twitter personality um shoot this is while you're thinking about it i'll give you nikita beer yeah nikita is a good one no i don't want to give nikita that much credit okay fine nikita hopefully nikita doesn't hear this nikita deserves all of this right he deserves it uh so let's speak nikita right let's say nikita you know uh you know what you know obviously is a brutal dictator i mean look i know the guy right he's gonna be a brutal dictator and nikita says look you know on my twitter you know all of you are gone right it's going to be me and logan and you know a bunch of people i like and a bunch of people i control everybody else is just gone from my twitter if you know that right that's why because you can still go use uh you know i don't know like cream twitter or solid twitter or greg twitter and you can be perfectly fine now of course we kind of joking around here because the stakes are much higher like today if you get remote on twitter right you lose a massive audience on what is a world which can really shape the discourse and i think that's kind of the other part of decentralization which is you can say hey you know what i can pick i was i was explaining talk about nikhil today on this podcast right but so you can be like hey i picked nikita twitter which has a certain set of algorithms maybe nikita twitter says look when you open up twitter the nikki test tweets are going to be pinned like 500 pixels at the very top and then you get everything else because yeah that's the rules right for your twitter and if you want and naked pure is the best product you use it if you don't want it you can pitch it pick a different algorithm but i'm clear we've tried to do this also over there so we're trying to say hey you know maybe we should have uh ranking algorithms maybe we should do only latest there's always in this controversy of only latest ranking which by the way took up three years of my life which we can also talk about if you're interested but i think the point here is you don't have a choice and so decently i think this one is a rate of exit where you can pick any client and the second part of deselect is really interesting is when you pick the client you now have a choice of the algorithm so for example just like gmail picks a spam algorithm for you nikita twitter which is going to be now trending on twitter after this can pick the algorithm for you right and of course we're kind of goofing around here but you kind of see you know how you know choice can be really important so this is one level of decentralization now let's get now where it gets really interesting is uh how many followers do you have on twitter uh 575 000. okay so that's quite a bit right you know this is like a popular guy right uh now you know so i could argue and i'm very clever that you add value to twitter right i mean you there are 5 000 people who follow you and get value so you're adding some value to the company right now i hope so when was the last time peter sent you a check for your thoughts and followers and the work you do on twitter i haven't seen one yet unfortunately okay when was the last time they asked you for input into addition that they're making in their offices in san francisco uh very rarely well you know so and by the way either again i was at twitter and i mean pick on them but you you know been seven to eight years ago when social media but maybe 10 years ago when social media came out the construct of social this so there was kind of a an agreement on social media right the agreement was we will give you an audience and you in turn will give us content right and that's that's the deal right and you grow your audience and by the way you know we will show ads against it and you know it'll be great business so that is kind of the deal but over the years i think that concept has slowly shifted like i think the rise of the theater economy the rise of companies like cameo has been like kind of a shift where you know you've seen these creators who are like saw the creator right like saaho could be like hey you know what you know i you know i deserve to be compensated for my service to twitter because we can obviously see he's adding some value uh to twitter now i think so just to pause you there so the flip side argument to this is something that our friend at sweaty startup nick huber tweeted out which is a flip of this entire model which is that large creators should actually have to pay more uh for use of the platform as their audience scales so rather than me getting paid or me being able to harvest value the whole idea is like look i have not been paid by twitter no i have not gotten a check from them but i have made a whole lot of money off of having a large following broadly from a lot of different things you know and that that fact probably holds for a lot of people that have large audiences who are active on the platform maybe not like famous people that just have a large audience for the sake of it but people who have built audience of the platform have have monetized pretty effectively and nick was saying and got a lot of flack for it that basically it should be a fee that you pay per follower so per 1000 followers you pay you know a dollar per month or something so i'd be paying 500 a month um you know plus in order to use twitter and it would kind of scale up and it was an interesting thought experiment he got massively dragged for it as he does on a lot of things that he tweets um but it was kind of an interesting flip of the model that you're talking about well i didn't see the tweet but uh but you know i kind of reject i think i disagree with the premise and the reason is um you know let's say for example you were first pitch better right and an alternative social platform came to you and they said you know what you're paying those folks like why don't you come over to us and we will pay you instead now we see this happen all the time like you know you know like you know streaming companies like netflix and hbo compete for movie makers or podcast companies you know sign up you know compete who gets an exclusive to some famous person next podcast so you basically the market will decide and i think what web3 is doing or could do for twitter is give give the people who give value twitter two things one is economics and the second is government so what economics means is uh imagine and i'm just making stuff up and i have no idea how this could actually work uh you know but imagine there is a token and you and the token basically incentivizes behavior you know this is a very naive version it basically says you know what sal should tweet x number of times and the street should be positive and it should spark the right kind of conversation you should do it over a long period of time it's not like you know you can take a check and then um run away um and you know and but it's some more communicate with the value you're adding to twitter all of a sudden you know i think two things happen one you're getting rewarded for the work that you're putting in uh second that token could be tied to governance and you know we can get it kind of obvious if you kind of follow like you know a lot of like stuff exactly you know you could be like hey decides you know to make you know to ship something new or a different algorithm change you could have a stake in it so it's kind of the very bad bones basic version of what could happen but let's get more interesting right imagine you could say hey you know what you know uh been on you know we've been somebody new comes into twitter because you know own twitter token you want the token to grow in value i want to bring in new people so sars would be like hey there's a you know joe unknown over here and i'm going to stake my token in him because i really believe in this guy or right and i believe they're going to be good for twitter right because you know have kind of like a value which occurs when they do reality really well we do this today by the way in twitter in a subtle way we do this using social capital now i was whole theory by the way if you're want a tangent about how twitter is all about social capital which is not converted to financial capital like right now if i could tweet sahara and say follow this guy right like i am sort of imbuing or giving someone special capital i may say hey i endorse this person i'm going to trust that you know you trust me that i'm not a jerk and you've solved the survey to be like somebody terrible to follow my followers to be like oh my gosh like serum is just a total muppet right but so you kind of stick you're putting something on the line which is why like quote reading kind of means something unless you're talking of course so uh but in a token world all these mechanics can be brought in and formalized in some really really interesting ways so imagine for example somebody is like you know can be an investor in the next big twitter user uh where they can be like i'm gonna go and find maybe the next charlie demaio of twitter or you know the next you know dwayne johnson or pick somebody who's going to like social media native celebrities so a lot of things you'll start opening up and then users could have a direct voice instead of this model now where you have a bunch of people making decisions you could be like hey i don't agree with your latest algorithm change or i don't agree with changing to dark mode or just go ship edit i don't care what you say i just wanted to ship edit and let's take it to a word so those things would be really transformative this one thought i'm gonna steal a lot of lines from you know chris dixon who heads up our crypto fund who's kind of really you know all the credit for ac and crypto should really go to him he basically tweaks bezos line of your margin as my opportunity and he says you see a lot in web 3 where there's kind of some value which is not being given to the right set of stakeholders and website kind of fills in that spot like we see this as artists right artists there's so many middlemen between the music and the fans but i think you might see this in social media and we actually seen start seeing some very interesting companies uh hopefully i can talk about them soon which are taking the same model to social media or just kind of community-based products uh too and being like hey you're not rewarding your stakeholders appropriately we can empower and reward the product anyway i'm gonna stop that okay so there's a ton to unpack here um and i have a handful of pushbacks as opposed to to a bunch of this so um social tokens uh is like a general concept that i think you kind of talked about or around that i find conceptually quite interesting um you know the cynic in me says that this stuff just like sort of asymptotes to being like a ponzi scheme and you're like where's the real value and how is it you know how's it being created or managed is any of this stuff um in your guys's opinion viable for them to actually like progressively decentralize or layer any of this into existing twitter or does it have to be built into a completely different platform where you're trying to like spin up scale it's a great question um i can attack it in a few ways right i think there is kind of a there's a technical answer there is an economic answer then that's going to become a social cultural answer um you know on the technical and economic and so that's why this is great paper by one of my um you know teammates miles jennings he's uh general counsel for acne crypto but it's kind of a real genius when it comes to all things decentralization it's only the pin tweet that's like a 25 page paper it talks about how companies in web 3 can progressively decentralize and then actually some social media style examples in there so and it talks about different kinds of decentralization like there's a kind of a technical architecture that's kind of a legal architecture and i think there's a special word for twitter give it to existing company so the technical architecture i think is kind of a sequence of steps right like the first step would be kind of my gmail uh you know smtp example imagine the world where twitter says hey instead of just using the one blue app or twitter.com you can use any app and it's perfectly fine and you can use the algorithm of choice and all we're going to do is provide you the api of choice by the way you see this in web 3 today right like they're a company like for example you know you could unisop's website yeah they can go off and it's perfectly fine because it's kind of a protocol which runs by itself and you don't need an actual website there are multiple clients which can do the work of the website so twitter could basically say hey the twitter.com url and the website or the app is just one lens but it doesn't really matter you can pick any lengths right whether we intuitively know that about gmail you know that you can use superhuman you know that you can use outlook and you can you know you can use a gmail app and you know it's all the same view on your email and it's kind of fine but imagine the same for twitter so that is like i would say step one um where you're like one of many and then everyone is kind of equal uh step two would be some form like tokens that i described and i will be the first uh admitted a lot of this have to be figured out we have some ideas you know there are some amazing founders working on the space but it has to be figured out in terms of how do you incentivize creators how do you incentivize various clients like for example you need different people to build you know the versions of gmail client or thunderbird or superhuman or one of the the equivalents of twitter so i think it's all like to be interesting so that's on one side um and i think it's kind of like a sort of a legal sort of variation of this or how do you do this in a way uh you know where uh you know the way you kind of like pass the hinky test now i think the harder problem to be super honest with you is cultural and i don't have a great answer for that um i i think like so far a lot of what we have seen in web3 is we have three native companies from the ground up and i don't have like a really good existence proof of somebody who used to be web 2 but now moved into web3 so it's going to be hard lift right because you have to turn over power and economics to your community and i think it's a hard culture but but i'll say having said that if somebody can pull it off elon would be the person to pull it off can you can you so ben thompson wrote an amazing piece maybe like a week ago like back to twitter's future i think it was called where he he sort of sketched out a world where um in a private market you could separate twitter into effectively two companies where it's like current business model with the social graph and the ad monetization existed as one company and then there was sort of like a twitter services company that licensed access to the social graph plugged in by apis and then that kind of becomes like an open protocol layer where people can build on top of it gain access to the social graph and the great high value part of twitter but build in their own ecosystems on top of it in an open world that kind of strikes me as like an interesting middle ground that you could start to see a sort of transition like if it becomes a more open ecosystem it's been traditionally this closed ecosystem and personally i think that that has made it so that twitter was not able to innovate they were trying to do everything like exclusively in-house with their own engineers rather than i mean i'm a free market guy right so like i i believe that harnessing the value of amazing innovators everywhere is the way for these platforms to you know exist and thrive so i should you know just in twitter's defense right like there's a good reason why they did what they did though it was unpopular the reason was ads right so for the last 10 years well the early part of last year actually the dominant internet model that people knew how to make work was advertising so it would have basically two choices i did early for the last ticket by the way this is i wasn't there i'm kind of speaking like from what i've heard from other people one was you could build an api business and you know where you know you basically charge people for access to tweets and then people you know build fines or did things where they paid money for that uh and whether other people actually tried to build companies you remember dalton caldwell who's in our y combinator built a company called app.net which was purely like api twitter uh and uh the other model was as uh it turned out and you know who knows at the time like you know um we don't know that the ads model was much more lucrative easier to kind of like figure out than api twitter watch now you could play you could play hindsight and you could be like you know maybe they didn't execute well they didn't have right people in place we don't know but they said okay we're going to do ads now the challenge is when you want to do ads is you need to actually show ads to people because you're going and telling advertisers hey we have all these human beings and they're like great but half your users are using a client which does not show ads right and they are like so you don't have a real problem and i think that actually pushed twitter over the years say like if look if you're in the media business and you're showing ads you need to actually show the ads to people so i think that's why it led them down this road and look i'm not totally defending them because i think uh you know a lot of startups you know uh you know we're destroyed like crystics and you know it's kind of close to a lot of those companies and they very rightly feel agree but i think that's kind of what the sequence of events was going to happen yeah i think but i think what we're talking about now is now you're a private company a lot of options now open up right maybe you don't need to do ads anymore maybe you can do a subscription business subscription isn't really a thing like eight ten years ago uh like for example like break and start how much would you pay for access career every year how much dollars you would uh i mean yeah i mean i make a lot of money off of it yeah i mean we we use twitter i mean it's like in a lot of ways it's like how much do how much would we spend on like business events and networking events and travel right it's like the same sort of thing yeah i mean i'd pay i'd pay a thousand dollars a month yeah me too probably probably even more just given the value it gives me right professionally so uh you know maybe there's a word and this way this model didn't really exist in 11 years ago so maybe there's a world they do subscriptions but i think that'll be the private company that some of the pressure is off of them but elon can directly sorry i need to stop you there so i so public company like totally agree ad model they've had to do it public market it was their golden goose it was the only way they were generating revenue their ad stack sucks uh they serve up really bad ads there's no signal really bad conversion like it's just a bad ad stack and so when advertisers are comparing it to like snapchat instagram you know tic toc all the other places they can advertise it's never really performed really well especially not on direct response advertising which is the most lucrative so um they now go into the private market everyone is like oh now they can experiment and do things sort of agree sort of disagree there's 25 billion dollars of debt sitting on the business now and that debt has interest rates on it that aren't super low and in an environment where a sofa the you know the baseline rate is rising right now it's actually going to be a shitload of interest payments that they're going to have to be paying so you can't just like a lot of people have been asserting that he can just like go rogue on the model and shut off ad monetization but someone has to pay the interest and like and so i like jack tweeted today this whole tweet about um oh it's a great step to take back twitter from wall street and i was kind of like yes sort of but 25 billion dollars of debt doesn't really feel to me like it's taking back you know twitter from wall street it's just different hands on wall street that now own a whole bunch of twitter and if things go wrong it's not very good the other thing i would point out and this is all just from my like private equity days that i come back to it in my head is elon took out a 12 i think it's like 12 and a half billion dollars of the purchase price is a margin loan against his twitter stock uh or against his tesla stock what that means is uh he doesn't have to sell his tesla stock and bankers are loaning him 12 and a half billion dollars that has recourse to his tesla stock so if the value um or if he's unable to pay the interest on it or if something happens they can go grab his tesla stock as the collateral against that the challenge of that which i would not be happy about if i were a tesla shareholder by the way is if tesla drops for whatever reason they miss a couple of quarterly earnings if the stock cut starts to come down those bankers are going to get a little nervous about the value of that tesla stock and the coverage they have against it they can ask him to put up more collateral against that 12 and a half billion margin loan how does he do that he has to sell assets that he has in order to put up cash collateral what assets does he have it's all tesla stock that's liquid so suddenly you get into this like bad spiral of he's having to put up more cash as collateral against that loan and the only way to put up more cash against that um is by selling tesla stocks so tesla stock's dropping you get called for more collateral you have to sell more tesla stock which further pushes down the price of it it's like this is literally how people have gone bank i'm not saying that's going to happen to them but this spiral of like taking out a loan against your stock having the stock drop and having to sell the stock to put up more cash against that loan is the spiral that leads to people going bankrupt sometimes so it's not like a fun thing actually by the way for tesla shareholders here um and i don't think that's something that anyone's talking about well look i i i have absolutely no insight into sort of the financial engineering here uh okay first but i just want to say i want to kind of defend the twitter ads team you know i think you know there's some really amazing people there they play really hard uh you know we can sort of get into you know something they try really hard uh you know but i think there's you know there's a really good tech there and i think they actually deliver some great resources from brand advertisers uh you know i have a bunch of friends that i'd be the most if i didn't like point it out um look i have no incentive in the financial engineering but i would say one thing i think this one of the ways and we have to see what happens nobody knows you know by the time this podcast comes from the whole situation that has shifted one of the way this could help is you know you now are off the earnings treadmill and you now have maybe a longer leash on time to go build something right totally and i've actually visited like other companies in the past where you're sometimes on this treadmill where you can't really go take like a deep long-term bet uh that's kind of one dynamic the other dynamic is i mean elon's like a strong opinionated guy right he has opinions so and he's gonna go try them out and i think having somebody who has like a very clear sense of what he wants and by the way a lot of you on twitter may not agree with what he wants but that's you know but you know but he definitely has a strong opinion and the second part is having sort of the bandwidth or the runway to go to go for it instead of being like well you know if we you know this we can't actually get out of this dynamic because you know our employees rs used to drop and it's going to cost a lot of people leave and go through this whole thing so um i'm very excited because i think for the first time look we're not talking about twitter there's a bunch of energy in the air yeah it feels like they could try out a bunch of stuff they could ship edit they could try a bunch of stuff and uh it's a cop it's a service that i think is very valuable to humanity i'm very excited i do i do hope and believe long term it's going to be decentralized i do think it's a i think twitter's ethos has always been about the community it's always been about the community and we are in service of the community so it feels natural and for me some way that the community in some days should own twitter in some shape or form whether jack has actually talked about this you know if you look at blue sky you know uh i'm not telling you from how well blue sky characters progress but the idea of blue sky originally was that it turned should be decentralized in some shape or form so uh i think it was always the arc hopefully it gets there someday but it is not boring right now so i want to clarify the the point around like the governance token and what that means the social token piece and what and what true i'm saying around like what does it look like if twitter users like have a piece of this pie in in forms of tokens so did you see when elon musk tweeted uh different polls about like basically where he should take twitter like should we ship an uh edit button and you know should we open source the algorithm and people were voting on it did you see that so we voted you know millions of people voted and elon could basically you know if 99 said we need an edit button and one percent and said no elon if he's the new owner could basically say like you know what i don't feel like shipping an edit button but if we actually had tokens that represented uh some amount of governance what's who i'm saying is he would if it was on chain he would actually have to go and do it and that's a really really powerful concept yeah i i that makes sense to me what i would say is like my pushback to you guys on that is i think that all sounds great when everything's going well um and when it's sort of peace time quote unquote but when you are in wartime and having to make dramatic you know bold decisions quickly the idea of going and asking you know 100 million users to vote on something and trusting that it's going to be the right long-term decision when they're operating with imperfect information relative to you as the general is a little scary to me and so like that's my general pushback or maybe not pushback even that's my general question for dows um as a prospective future i love the idea of community governance i love the idea of communities owning more of the equity of a startup if they've created a ton of value but i do have serious questions about the ability of a community at scale to make rapid bold decisions uh during war time wait i just my push back to that the first thing that comes to mind is isn't that the democratic society that we live in like no no no it's not actually because we live in a representative representative democracy right like okay let me let me let me first of all this is let me let me explain let me explain myself and by the way this is coming from someone who doesn't vote in the american elections because i i'm not allowed to because i'm an immigrant and who doesn't follow politics at all so take it with a grain of salt but the way i understand how politics work is or democratic countries work is you vote and depending on what country you live in like let's say in the us i think there's a senate and there's a congress and these people are voted in or sworn in and then you sort of trust that these people who represent you are going to make decisions is that is that correct yes so that's the exact same as like a shareholder of a public company voting for board members at the you know proxy whatever and you vote the board members and you vote the ceo in or out and then you trust that they're making the decisions and i like i actually think that works reasonably well yeah i think i think social tokens in a lot of ways are is very much like owning a share in a company and getting a vote the only it's just the only difference in it is instead of like if i want to vote in a twitter shareholder meeting i have to go and buy twitter stock and i'm not sure that i can vote on like product decisions however with um if if you know what true i'm saying is basically if you know you brought a lot of value to the network and you were able you were rewarded with tokens for giving that value it doesn't make a difference if you didn't have the money to buy those tokens but because you created that value you would have the ability to influence the product yeah i think that i mean like i think the ethos of that makes a ton of sense right like if i i i have contributed more value to twitter um and like probably more innovation to twitter than some random billionaire that owns a hundred million dollars of twitter stock like just full stop i i understand the product probably better i understand the puts and takes i understand the ecosystem better and um if i were to have received like governance tokens accordingly with the value that i've created and could have a say in the decision making and the changes in the product and the development i definitely would be more valuable to them than some random person and so right now in the system it's just driven off of dollars and so a really rich person has more influence than a poor person even if the poor person has done so much more for the community totally agree with the ethos and and what you're saying there i'm just curious to see how it actually plays out um in a more challenging you know environment and context yeah i mean just just to close on this you know if i could zoom out i think the internet has kind of always had some version of what a dao is like i grew up in the open source world right and you always said it's kind of you know bdfl these benevolent dictators for life liquido for python and linus for linux and the idea was you know they were there just like vitalik for ethereum like they had legitimacy right they were there for the trust of the community now they've been totally rogue or they've been crazy the community could just fork and go somewhere else right but there was a sense that they were your representative and you know you didn't like look at every pull request that dennis was uh opining on but you trusted him you know because of the legitimacy he pulled over time to be like okay i'm gonna trust him to make positions and this is gonna be the official kernel for and i think in some ways tokens you know do two things one they formalize that they formalize the relationship between you know for example so many people contribute value to linux you know but how many of them actually got the same value back you know you could have a token with the mechanism which actually orchestrates the second point is what you said which is sahil i don't make this about twitter same is true for instagram same sort of ticked up it's not just social media think of any marketplace company right a lot of marketplaces have on the supply side you often have these small set of suppliers who basically generate a lot of the transaction volume or it's in a lot of the economics but they often they probably don't have any presence on the cap table right like you know any sort of like marketplace ecosystem now you know we have three version of that would say hey we are going to take over and give them economics where the marketplace it's as if you know ebay 20 years ago came and said i'm going to take our top 10 sellers uh they have to write some version of this but it's kind of like i think a symbolic move but we're gonna take our tops and sellers and make them like some meaningful stockholders in like on the ebay capital and we're going to give them governance and whether it's gonna constantly shift based on their you know uh if they leave ebay they lose that right now if they can you if they stop selling somebody whatever it is so and i think we actually by the way we actually just you know partnering with the company which is doing for some version of this so uh i think all of this kind of like very interesting i'll be the first to point out that this is very early it's a this by the way i think there's a question i think we're talking about is like why am i drawn to web3 one of these is like all this stuff is brand new but it is a totally unexplored like design surface right it's like 2005 and people are figuring out what the rest apis are and user generated content are for the very first time so we'll figure out a bunch of things we're even taos for example last year and a half we learned so much about governance and you know we learned tons more about token design but i think the possibilities are just like it blows your mind so i know we're running up against the end of time i have to ask you this um because i think a lot of our listeners are you know builders um ambitious people that are trying to go create you know these different futures you're a general partner at andreessen horowitz one of the most famous venture funds in the world if you were to give advice to prospective builders who are looking to raise money for their startups and for their projects what are the couple of things you would say to somebody like what stands out to you uh when you meet a founder um for the first time uh good question um so it's interesting because uh you know uh my you know my wife is a multi-time founder and you know i saw her go through the whole like fundraising process uh you know in silicon valley you know some good meetings vcs lots of bad meetings with pcs and now it's kind of weird that i'm on the other side and you know like people ask me how i spend my day and most of my days been talking to founders and often it is for the very first time i'm meeting them for the very first time and they're coming in uh these days over zoom and they're telling me about something amazing that they're building and their vision for the future it's honestly one of the best jobs on the planet uh okay so there's no i'm gonna give a i was thinking about this question because you asked me about this before i think there's one bit which i often missed uh when people bcs give advice uh which is my job right or any vc's job is to go invest in founders like if i spent a year or two years without investing any company like bill and mark would or should fire me because the job is to actually go invest in companies right so if you're a good vc um you know you are going into every meeting you know hoping like this you know is going this is going to be someone amazing this person is going to build the next google or the next facebook or the next coinbase or you know take your pick then you know because that's the job like your job is to hopefully the next person who gets from the zoo meeting or walks into the door is going to be that founder so first of all you know i i think you know my wife other founders you know like i feel like you don't understand like you know the venture capitalists need you you know uh maybe a lot more than sometimes you need them uh because you know they you know we're kind of giving away one of the most commodity of products which is money um now like i'm putting that aside i think every every bc firm and every individual are very very different in their own ways and of course you can kind of go into like what it means when you're a seed stage company when it's a very first investment it's two people in the proverbial garage and you know they just have an idea all the way to somebody who's been there for five six years and they're raising i know at several billion dollars because their growth run but i spend most of my time on the earliest of stages where it's either the very first round of capital or it's close enough to the first round of capital right i don't think there's a few things i'm looking for um and uh by the way none of these are original i've kind of stolen them from a lot of people i've worked with offered assistance especially chris dixon and mark himself and alex rumpel the first one is there is a phrase called the idea maze and i think it comes from either chris or balaji which is has this person spent a bunch of time figuring out you know going through all the you know the various versions of before they've kind of settled on this thing right like for example you know uh you know i've spent like close to 10 years working in social media companies right like so i've been a lot less positive that i spend a lot of time thinking about social media right so if i say you know with mobility social media company you could probably say after a lot i'm thinking about this as opposed to if i started like a database company right i know nothing about databases like you know and unless you could you know i could prove to you that i spent a year talking to every single database developer every single customer or spend your time with the insight i don't think i could kind of credibly say i have gone through the idea maze and i think that is one big difference and it's probably one of the first things i'm looking for which is has this person gone through idms by the way that doesn't mean they need to have worked in that space before and web3 is often new but i'm looking for you know how has this person somehow explored every version of this idea maybe they've spoken to customers maybe they built some prototypes maybe there's a lot of time thinking about it maybe they've worked there for many years it could be in one of many kinds of categories but in just step one because if you don't have that right this won't be somebody else who's probably gone through idms who's probably going to build a much better version so i think that's step one uh step two is uh i think you know uh i'm going to steal this from alex rampell uh you know he looks for can this person you know manifest things can they manifest talent can they manifest uh fundraising can they manifest sales uh very simply the best founders uh when you meet them right they've already put together something they've already maybe hired one or two people or they already built something very quickly or they already have like a you know a bunch of customers in some hacky prototype somewhere right but they already they're very good at just having high output in short periods of time and it's very you know and often when you see that kind of trajectory you can sort of plot the dots and be like okay this person you know probably has a good probability of continuing doing that so uh and i think the other part of it like so much of startup life is very hard i think one of the best things about ben and mark is they are founders themselves and they drill into every single person of the firm which is kind of respect for founders and respect for startup process because it is very hard uh you know you should i highly recommend ben's books for that um and so you know what that means is you know uh you know can you actually demonstrate that you're able to actually go sell people on the thing that you're doing because it's going to be hard right can you maybe close a higher close the sale you know maybe you raise capital only whatever it is i think so that manifestation thing i think is super key i think the third part is uh it's a dual-sided relationship right i invest in a few companies every single year and uh let me ask you a slightly different question people ask me what's the difference between being an operator i hit the word operator and being a vc right and one of the biggest differences as we see at least you know our firm when we invest in someone that's a relationship for life like 10 years from now every company i've invested in or 20 years from now will you know will be like somebody i've worked with hopefully i'm calling in the middle of the night and we'll back them and support them and go to the ends of the earth for them so that means that you better be very very careful about you know the nation because you know you have to it's going to be a very very long-term relationship right uh you know and when i joined the firm it was amazing because my very first week we had this off-site with all the general partners 16c and i saw everybody kind of talk about all their companies they have worked with and and it was something so so much connection with companies like been around for seven eight years you know because the firm is like you know or ten years old i was like wow these are like really deep long relationships right so on the other hand so when i'm talking to founder you know i'm trying to think of like okay will i want to work with this person for the next 10 15 years like will i want this but you know will i want to you know talk to this person in the middle of the night you know attend their wedding or you know whatever it is like i think it's kind of like a interpersonal thing so i think so on the founders side i think there's kind of a chemistry aspect to it there's also an aspect of like how big can this be because you know we are very much like a power lord driven business so i think one of the things for founders is being able to articulate a vision of hey how big can this be how can this be world changing um and then having all these proof points to go get there so i'm massively oversimplifying what is a really complex process i'm still learning uh um but i will say it's probably one of the best jobs in the world um and the reason for that is you just you know every single day some really passionate smart person comes to you talks to you about their hopes and dreams and you know and if you if you're lucky you know you get to work with them and it's just one of the best feelings ever you said so many things that resonated with me there i mean i i just in general i every day um kind of pinch myself at the novelty of like getting paid to give money to really smart people that are building big ambitious things um and that's just such a cool thing greg and i you know constantly text about this like how neat of a job it is to be able to invest in companies um and so what you said there i mean it really resonated i appreciate all the advice i know a lot of people um will find it really valuable as they continue on their builder journeys so i feel like we got through um you know four hours worth of content in uh in an hour and a bit because you my friend talk as fast as anybody i you're you're like a podcast on two and a half x speed we're gonna we're gonna have to uh um you know normally i think people have to put us on one and a half x because greg talks kind of slow i talk like pretty fast and so we're like balancing out but we're gonna have to uh suggest everybody listens to this on 1x speed um you're amazing man that was it was awesome um got through so much in a short period of time and we promise to do an in-person episode in the near future and we will bring you we'll bring you that tequila uh we'll we'll bring you that tequila thank you so much for joining man thanks for taking the time with us thank you i just want to say i'm a big fan and uh you know i love what you folks do and i love working together with you on multiple multiple ways and thank you for having me and thanks

so avi and compound are crypto money markets where you can basically deposit tokens and receive a stablecoin loan um based on the value of those assets right so uh yeah you might be able to write let's say you deposit 100 hundred dollars of uh of a token of let's say eth you can then draw maybe twenty dollars of stable coin right and this basically allows you to get liquidity uh from your crypto without having to sell it and yeah you can also write like on the other side you can also borrow from these money markets if maybe you want leverage or you have some need for eth and the reason this is hugely valuable i mean in a normal in a non-axi context is like if i have a ton of bitcoin but i bought it at 100 and now it's worth 60 000 and i want to go buy a house i can't do that if i like i sell my bitcoin pay a huge tax on that gain and then go buy a house with the cash this allows you to leave your bitcoin you never have to pay the tax and you can draw money against it and then go and buy it and so in the axiom finity case why it's interesting is people wouldn't have to sell and convert to fiat in order to pay for their food in the grocery store down the street they could leave it in the game which by the way has the nice benefit of creating price stability in the game which drives more people in and continues to drive appreciation and growth of the ecosystem but they can still draw against it to go buy their food and live live on a database yeah that's like a potentially potentially important project a product you know we have to do a lot of education right like so we see axi as an accessible cute nostalgic um community driven kind of rabbit hole into the rest of crypto as well right so you start with the game in the community but then right you start to learn okay how to stake right how to uh pull liquidity um you start to all these other verbs right get unlocked right stake farm deposit borrow and yeah 50 of our users have never used crypto because that's amazing 25 of them don't even have a bank account so we have to do a lot of basic financial and crypto education um so people are learning incredible amounts i see axia is also like an education platform in some ways [Music]

ground beef for life by going to butcherbox.com room you're gonna love it so one of the things that i always think is important to start off you know any discussion any interview is this idea of like determining the person's map of reality um you're familiar with the concept i assume but for anyone that hasn't heard of it it's sort of you know this idea that we all have a specific map or lens through which we view the world and through which we perceive things and i think it's important to understand what someone's map of reality is as you kind of dive in and to understand their perspective so maybe we just start there and and see where it takes us what do you think your map of reality is morgan what what has shaped your map your map of reality over the course of your life well one thing that i think about a lot and maybe this gets back into what you said before about not taking myself too seriously is the extent to which i should be like a a car mechanic or a grocery bagger or an uber driver with with no offense to those professions but the ex the the fact that i'm here doing this if you look at the trajectory of my life is crazy i there was absolutely nothing about me when i was a young adult when i was a teenager that would have said you know that would have predicted any of this whatsoever i've talked about this before on other podcasts i don't want to rehash it too much but i have no high school education i didn't have i basically have an eighth grade education and then i went to college after that but i had this gap in my teenage years where i was i was dumb as a rock waste of a waste of waste of a breath whatever adjective you want to use i had absolutely no intelligence and it wasn't like oh i skipped high school because i was so smart no it was not that in the slightest you know if you if you were to meet me when i was 19 or 20 i had an eighth grade education and i and it showed i was it was it was that and i think i thought and everyone else around me thought and my parents thought that i would be you know an eight dollar an hour service worker for the rest of my life and that was that was my expectations and i'll tell you i was okay with it i was totally okay with that that was so i think coming from that and then being here wherever here is my that map of reality it's it's uh but i'll tell you it yes it's it's cool like that's it's it's fun for me to think about that journey but it also is like kerosene for imposter syndrome and this feeling of like oh this is all gonna end and i'm gonna be pushed back to where i belong so i feel like that's the that's the the other side of this that often goes uh undisclosed for people in this situation so that's so interesting you know one of the things that comes up in kind of researching and learning more about your background is your parents lived on a commune like a farming commune and i thought that was such a unique i mean when i was thinking about what i perceived to potentially be your map of reality i thought that might be an interesting part of it of like your parents um you know had a very interesting trajectory in their own lives and your dad became a doctor at or decided to become a doctor at age 30 which is very unique um so how much of that like your parents having a maybe at the time actually it wasn't that different i guess you know at the time when they were probably living on the farm commune maybe that was actually like the cool thing to do probably at that uh at that era in american society but how much of that kind of impacted your you know young upbringing and and uh and how you perceived the world you're definitely right that when they moved there and lived there in the 1970s it was the cool thing to do that was like the hippie movement full-blown that was like an awesome awesome thing to do i would say both my parents grew up in fairly affluent households and then so it was their choice to be like screw all of that we're gonna go move to this commune and and rebel against everything that they that they had um i i think it impacted my my upbringing substantially because well in two ways and my my brother who was five years older than me had more of this but i saw two very distinct sides growing up you know when i was a young child my parents were students and we were completely flat broke we had absolutely nothing it was not it was not homelessness it was not it was not that but we had no money whatsoever and then my dad became a doctor when i was um i don't know 10 12 something like that and and things changed and so i think seeing both sides of that is important because i feel like most people growing up only see one side of it maybe they grow up poor maybe they grow up very wealthy and it's relatively the same throughout their childhood seeing the stark black and white contrast and again from my brother who was like 16 when that contrast happened that was like a shock it was just like shock and awe because most people adapt to whatever their situation is so i say when i grew up when i was seven years old and we were flat broke i didn't know it and i didn't care i lived a guy had a great childhood i loved playing i loved digging in the dirt and climbing trees no but i did not care i thought it was great but then when you see that other side you're like wow there's another there's another world out here that so that was one way it impacted us the other was when i went on my little teenage journey of not going to high school i was skiing throughout my entire teenage years you were ski bum okay i was i was a complete ski bum i grew up in lake tahoe and i was a competitive ski racer and the high school thing was um school kind of gets in the way of ski racing so i'm i'm not not gonna do it it's basically what it came down to and i think at one point reading i'm sorry to interrupt you i remember at one point reading a story that you wrote about uh a close friend of yours who you had skied with for a long time in tahoe competitively who um tragically passed away in in an avalanche um and how much that impacted you during that period as well has that been a formative experience and i apologize for rehashing something that's clearly an upsetting event in your life but it does strike me as something that is you've been um sort of introspective about it and what it's meant to you in terms of how you live your life so i'm curious how that impacted those years and then your decision to kind of you know start to blossom into uh into the intellectual that you are today as well yeah there it it actually had a huge impact because of the timing that happened and there there were two of them actually two of my friends growing up with that we were we were skiing together all that that day and um they they did an extra run where i wasn't i wasn't with them i was gonna go pick them up at this out of bounds area where we would we would ski and they were killed in an avalanche during that during that run that they did by themselves and that so what happened i was i was 17 which for the ski racing world is kind of the [ __ ] get off the pot moment of like either you're pro or you're not like when you're 15 you can kind of hack your way through it 17 it's kind of like okay you're either going to the big leagues or or you got to figure something else out so and then two months after my friends died i broke my back skiing so between those those moments it was like okay it's time for me to go do something else it's time for me to kind of hang it up and figure out what's next it took me years to figure out what was next i had a couple years from you know age 17 to 20 where i was just kind of hacking it through not really doing much of anything but that was i think that event was it shaped me in a lot of ways it shaped it was obviously it was the first it was the first bad thing that ever happened to me i had a really good childhood upbringing everything was great very loving household great friends everything was perfect so that was the first bad thing that i had ever experienced in my life and it was a really bad thing so that had a big impact but also just timing wise it was actually a great forcing function to be like okay time to go do something else right well it relates to uh very closely to the sort of first rabbit hole i wanted to go down with you which is um this recent piece that you put out called deep roots which i thought was a fantastic piece if people haven't seen it we'll add it to the show notes but it all kind of ties into this idea of like the dots in your life you know the steve jobs famous commencement speech i forget what year 2005 maybe at stanford he talked about the dots connecting in your life and how it's basically impossible to connect the dots looking forward you have no idea he in his example was he took this calligraphy class where he was just like bumming around at reed he had dropped out and he was bumming around and took this calligraphy class and there was absolutely no reason why a calligraphy class would ever be impactful for your life a totally useless set of skills but then it became an integral part of how they thought about creating beautiful type fonts when they were doing that at apple and so he talks about it that you can never connect those dots looking forward but in hindsight you look at them and you say wow this weird chain of events led to where i am today into this set of circumstances and you wrote very beautifully about that as it relates to money and investing and second-order thinking but it ties into this point of what we're talking about i think of a terrible event in your life that you can somehow now trace to all of these different things that shaped you into the future and so i wanted to just talk and kind of talk to you about this idea of of forecasting and like as investors we all sit and try to think about oh i'm going to try to predict the future right now there's a million things going on in the world right like russia's invasion inflation's through the roof um you know the consumer economy is kind of teetering and so you sit around and you can spend hours and hours trying to predict the future but as you point out in your article it's almost impossible to do with any level of intellectual humility it's like basically impossible to do because the world is so damn complex yeah so can you just talk a little bit about that and you know the frameworks that you've kind of been using to think about that problem i think any time you'd really piece together why a chain of events has happened if you're really honest about the long chain of events of how you got there it could be so absurd that you realize that it's how hard it is to predict things i think about to use this like a really quirky personal example when i started at college they had like an orientation lunch for all the new students and you sat by your major the biology students here the econ students here and i got there and i i was trying to get into the business school but the business school table was all full there were no more seats so i was like okay i guess i'll sit with the economic students because economics is closely related to business like i'll sit at this table i sat next to this girl who became a very close friend of mine she's wonderful and she introduced me to my now wife so it was it's like like that's just like a simple chain of events of like this table i wanted to sit at was full so i randomly sat at this table and now we got two kids and we've been together for 16 years and i'll give you my example of that exact thing because it's very similar um so in seventh grade uh i was trying to impress a random girl um who i had a big crush on and for some reason i decided the way i was going to impress this girl was uh the test uh the social studies test we were gonna have the next day i had noticed was sitting on the table printed out all the copies of it that we were gonna take and so i bragged to her like hey i can get the test for tomorrow and she was like no you won't you won't do it and so i went in and i took it and i gave it to her and i didn't even cheat on the damn test which is the funniest thing in hindsight but someone snitched i got caught i end up you know getting a zero on that test so i get like a d in the class seventh grade whatever it shouldn't matter but as a result of that i had a bad grade for the class and so i didn't go i didn't get into private school which was kind of the plan my parents had had for me was that i was gonna go to private school for like eighth grade on through high school because i didn't go to private school i met my wife my sophomore year of high school at our public high school and i met this girl at the time we end up dating long distance did the whole thing and our son is being born next month so because of this like stupid decision that i made you can now trace that all the way to i'm sitting in our house my wife is somewhere nearby and we're having our first uh our first child next month and here and here's what's what's true with with all the due respect to both of our wives if i had sat at the business table and if you had gone to private school things may have worked out great as well so the alternative history is not necessarily better or worse we just know it's vastly different and everything is is like that i usually i've used this example in my book of like why are student loans so high today well one of the reasons is because in the early 2000s there was a huge demand for college when the job market was so weak people are like i can't get a job i might as well go to college or i need to go to college to make sure i can get a job in this really tough market huge demand for college why was the economy so we was a jobs market week well because there was a financial crisis why was there a financial crisis well there was a housing bubble why was there a housing bubble well interest rates were cut too low why were interest rates cut too low well because 911 that was a big part of it so just from right there by the way you could keep going with that but why are student rates so hot why are student loans so high today nine because of 9 11. and like no one would tie those together and on the morning of september 11th no one was like oh here come the student debt nobody made that nobody would ever make that connection but you can piece it together pretty clearly now there is a thing called the narrative fallacy which is like putting like sometimes putting these things together in a way that makes sense like i just did can be like it's it's not it's not that clean i think mostly the narrative fallacy is when you piece together things going forward it's when for example on the morning of 9 11 people say consumers are never going to travel again which was which was not true but it was a narrative that made sense but i think looking back the narrative like that like piecing together that narrative does make more sense it makes sense in hindsight and when you realize how absurd it is in hindsight then you realize that any any skill that you think you might have looking forward is like is so do we have no clue what's going to happen next one of the examples i like from this too like a positive example are the number of incredible things that came from world war ii one of the biggest ones that's easy overlooked is penicillin which was basically it was discovered in 1929 and then it was basically a laboratory toy in the 1930s and it wasn't until world war ii that we were like hey we have all these six soldiers and we need to keep them healthy what is this like crazy mold that might be antibacterial like great make 10 million doses and give it to the soldiers and that was kind of the birth of antibiotics and like would we have discovered it without world war ii like yes probably but i think you can draw a straight line between world war ii and antibiotics coming online in the 1940s to say nothing again about like jet airplanes and rockets and nuclear energy all these like amazing things gps radar that happens specifically because of the war now nobody when the war began would be like oh here come all the amazing technologies but it's exactly what happened yeah and now we're in a similar period right like with kovid and the massive disruption and the impact it had on the world you could argue you know that there are going to be those similar unbelievable things technological innovations that get created as a result of this but similarly you need to have humility around the fact that we are not going to be able to predict what those things are looking forward with any degree of certainty totally and the obvious one that people use these days that might end up being the big one is mrna that's like that's like the easy that's the narrative fallacy of like oh because of covid we're gonna have all these mrna drugs which might be true it is true so far but there's gonna be things ten years from now that would be so absurd that you and i 10 years from now will be like hey because of covid we have the x whatever it might be and connecting those dots is going to be like the craziest thing you've ever imagined you know that's going to be the case whenever there's an upheaval in your personal life or in the economy in the world 10 years in the future there's this crazy chain of events that led to something either really good or really bad by the way um that you never could have seen coming yeah the whole takeaway for it is just humility and forecasting it's like the whole idea of like pro-entropic investing i recently heard i think from antonio gracias i think it was on a uh invest like the best podcast with with patrick o'shaughnessy and he talks about like companies and ideas that benefit from that chaos it sort of relates to telev and anti-fragility and that that whole general concept but when you think about these periods of chaos there are going to be certain ideas certain technologies things that benefit from that chaos and get created because it just sparks all of these new collisions of ideas people concepts etc that good things come out of it's like chaos theory right all of a sudden there's this movement in this one you know area that creates something amazing yeah and a lot of bad things come about that too so yeah to me one of the most important things here when you have humility and forecasting is such a preference for survivorship and endurance and durability so that you can stick around long enough for those positive surprises to actually pay off um you know to to state the obvious if you are if this is 2008 and you got you got pushed out of the market you got foreclosed on whatever it would be like you you did not stick around long enough to enjoy the rebounds and the new technologies and what and whatever it would be so that's when you have that humility and forecasting there's this great quote from talent that i like too where he says invest in preparedness not in prediction that's what i think it is like we can't predict what the good or the bad is going to be but i can invest in making sure that i am durable enough to stick around to experience whatever it might be in the future you also tweeted another tele quote recently that i thought was great about you know if something if you're if you're thinking that something is irrational for like a really long period of time your definition of rationality is probably just off if something has remained irrational in your mind for so long which i thought was it's a very funny uh it's a very funny quote i mean he's he's like a trevor treasure trove of uh of great quotes though he's great now as you say my example from this is that there is a there is a cohort of investors who have think who have thought that the market has been overvalued for the last 30 years and it's something the permabears you're like maybe your model is wrong i don't know maybe like like maybe this is a 30-year bubble or maybe you're you're not calculating this right so that's why like it the market looks irrational to them but if something has been irrational for a long period of time i think what you're actually just observing is the normal craziness of human behavior well it's like the uh the hilarious case study of um of recession predictor people where like you uh if you accurately predict a recession once you forever are the guy that accurately predicted that recession and if you just keep predicting recession you're eventually going to be right right you're like i don't know whether it's you that's written this in the past but someone has or you just say you know like a recession will come and it's just a question of you know is it one year three years five years seven years ten years like you're going to be right eventually and you can get paid to go on cnbc for the rest of your life as the guy who accurately predicted the whatever year recession if you just do it once totally like if you just go on and say we're gonna have a recession it's only a matter of time people are like oh that's a big deal and then if it happens four years later they're like oh he said it he said it was only a matter of time and it was only a matter of time it actually it's the the absurdity of financial media is hard to overstate like i was watching cnbc the other day and they had a former i'm forgetting who it is they had a former um fed board uh individual on and they asked him very directly like so are you telling your clients that you think a recession is coming and he said something to the effect of oh no i wouldn't say that i'm telling them that it's more likely it's probably 45 to 50 percent likely now versus the 30 that it was before and i was sitting there just like how how is this put like possibly relevant valuable information for anybody because i have no idea what 30 versus 45 percent likely means to my portfolio what does that mean what do i do like not only like what do you do as a client but also the idea that anyone can be like oh the odds used to be thirty percent but now they're forty percent is is insane is insane that you're being like that technical about it i think the best way to summarize financial media was um this is ten or twelve years ago jim cramer was on jon stewart show uh the the daily show and jim cramer like jon stewart was poking fun about how crazy how dumb some of the segments are on cnbc and kramer said i'm paraphrasing he said you know john you have to understand we have 17 hours of live tv to fill every day and stuart said maybe you could cut down on that like that's that's the solution here that's not the excuse that's the fix and think about if you had like 24 7 live tv of like the trucking industry or the shipping industry or like the chemistry industry there's nothing to talk about and it should be the same in business news but we want there to be 24 7 live coverage and therefore like the only way to fill the time is just kind of by making [ __ ] up sometimes yeah and it's this whole idea that everything has to be breaking news right like everything is news and um you know new things that have happened and newness and they put breaking next to everything and um i've heard you talk about this before and i think it's such a great point that the best stuff is evergreen the best writing is evergreen the best ideas are evergreen they're not only relevant for the 10 minutes that after you post them they're relevant forever and i know you've kind of strived in your career as a writer to write things that will be relevant 10 years from now if someone reads them it's going to change the way they think it's going to provide them with frameworks or a lens through which to evaluate problems that do come about in the future and you strike me as an interesting character in the financial world because you don't come across as someone that cares deeply about um money in a in like a gross sense you know of you don't strike me as someone that like wants to be the richest person in the world and you know have the yachts and the planes and the cars and do all of that and yet you write so eloquently about money um so what do you think has kind of formed that for you and what why are you um you know different in that sense i have no desire to be the richest man with the yachts and the ferraris i probably have an above average desire for independence i i want to be independent more than than most people and therefore i think it's it's easier for me to have some concept of what is enough money like how much do i need to be independent and if i've checked that box then everything else above that is really superficial um and i think that's that's where it it comes from some of that might be if i were to be like deeply introspective it might be like some sense of insecurity i think some of my desire for independence is out of fear that um this is all gonna end so like i need to become independent as soon as possible so that i can leave on my own terms versus leaving on somebody else's terms getting fired whatever it might be i think that's probably the roots of it um but that's that's where it is i think i just view money as a as a tool towards independence versus a tool to gain social aspirations and like wave your peacock feathers and show everyone how rich you are so like i i i like nice things i like nice homes and nice cars and whatnot but independence is above that like 10x that's that's all i really care about so i want to tap into this a little bit more a few years ago you were on shane parish's podcast the knowledge project and you talked about uh your one of your bucket list items was true financial independence uh and this feeling that anything could go wrong and you'd be okay um a do you feel like now you've gotten there i mean you've sold a book that has sold a million copies um have you know a new job i think since then with collaborative fund and being there a lot of things have changed in your life um and then b where do you feel like that insecurity comes from like why why do you feel like you have that i actually feel like i have that as well so that's that's the root of the question from my perspective to answer the first part uh yeah i think it's i think it's largely there not maybe not a hundred percent because it's easy to move the goal post even if you're trying to treadmill it's it's easy to do that but i think for the most part it's roughly there and i'm proud of it it's what it's the thing i'm most i'm proudest of in my personal life outside my wife and kids i'd say it's something that i think is like a really key contributor to my um i wouldn't say happiness i would say just well-being like it's not that independence makes me happy it's that it removes an anxiety that used to be there which is great that's a benefit but it's very different from happiness um what's the second part of your question i forget that feeling of insecurity oh yeah yeah yeah you know i i because i have that as well and i still have that to this day and i know a lot of people who do who i consider highly successful and that i don't you know from the outside looking in shouldn't have that insecurity but do um so can you just double click on that a little bit i would say it's that's a good thing i'd say if you don't have that insecure the absence of that insecurity is probably the definition of ego and like i think you want i think you want that insecurity you shouldn't try to get rid of that once you get rid of it that's when you're screwed once you're like i'm so talented i'm so good i could do i could i could make a zillion dollars doing anything tomorrow that's when it's like you're probably in trouble i think i think there's a very heavy there's a very healthy dose of insecurity one of my favorite little uh quotes was many years ago charlie rose was interviewing mike moritz of of sequoia and he said why has sequoia been so successful for 40 years not just in the last market cycle but 40 years and mike moritz said we've always been scared about going out of business and charlie rose is like that's like you're the most successful he says we've he said we've never taken anything for granted we never have thought that yesterday's success guaranteed tomorrow's success we've always been paranoid and i think that's a great mentality for a lot of things in life in your personal life in your personal career for your business whatever it might be just if you're lucky enough to be successful the acknowledgement that it does not guarantee you anything for tomorrow nothing and i think i that's where that insecurity for me comes from and for me it was it was probably like maybe the the humble background that i had and graduating in the teeth of the financial crisis as lots of people did was like i want to i don't want to rely on other people to um judge whether i'm worth it to be in a job the judge whether they should hire me to judge whether i should stay around to try to figure out what my what my salary is that they think i'm worth i don't want to rely on the kindness of strangers for that i want to i want to do it all myself it was also another and i'm sure this is a universal trait it was just to me like the absolute worst feeling i could have as a husband and a father would be looking my wife and kids in the eye and saying like we're in trouble and you know the the word husband derives from like to provide is what it comes from that's why like animal husbandry it's like taking care of providing for and i feel like if i ever got to that point where i couldn't i couldn't provide i couldn't you know give them what they needed not what they wanted but what they needed i would have utterly failed at life and i was just so and and still am so paranoid of getting to that point that it's made me pretty conservative and pushed towards independence what is up you guys today i am so

deposit at least five hundred dollars josh wolfe has this wonderful quote on this similar topic similar to what you said with mike moritz um that failure comes from the failure to imagine failure um which i always think is so sharp you know it's obviously like a funny play on words but it is very very true in my own experience that when you actually fail it's just because you didn't prepare for those crazy chance events and i've heard you talk about this in the past that the rocking events the things that truly shake you shake society etc are never things that you could have predicted having happened and it relates to your deep roots article again they're never things that you could have predicted you didn't have a wide enough imagination to predict that like no one had it on their you know on their uh their score card that uh global pandemic was going to shut down the economy and every single service worker was going to be out of work you've said that before um and so you didn't but by definition whatever allocation you have or whatever you you know have done with your house your personal finances your investing etc is not prepared for that thing because you just didn't think about it it wasn't there and so you've written this and i think it's very smart to and it relates to this point around insecurity and not wanting to ever have to look your family in the eye and say that that you by definition because of that fact that you didn't realize these things could ever happen you need to have sort of an extra little like you know the tail risk event pool that just exists out there so that you know that you won't ever have to have that conversation and have that feeling in that discussion and what's hard about that is that what that really means is having a layer of of cushion in your finances that doesn't make sense a layer of conservatism that seems like it's excessive because the only way that you're going to prepare for the events that you cannot imagine that you cannot foresee that you cannot predict is if you have a level of of of security that doesn't make sense if if you are only saving and preparing for the events that you can foresee you are going to miss the ones you can't foresee ten times out of ten and the ones that you can't see coming are always the ones that do the most damage i mean let's say you are 95 years old today and you're you're you're on your deathbed you're looking back at your life over the last 90 95 years and and if i asked you hey what were the biggest economic risks that you face in your life you would not say oh in june of 1985 we missed non-farm payrolls by 100 like you would not say anything like that if you were looking back you would say covid 911 world war ii the great depression the oil spikes in the 1970s those are the biggest risk and the common denominators of all of those are that nobody saw them coming before they happened the biggest risk that you would look back and be like oh that mattered more than anything are things that no one saw coming well i had a recent example of this where um every january the economist which i think is a great publication one of the best but every january they send out a big issue called like looking at the year ahead and in january of 2020 their look ahead of course did not say anything about coven 19 of course but that was all that mattered and then two weeks ago i got the january 2022 edition i think it was lost in the mail so i got it in like march and of course there is nothing in there about russia ukraine because in january no one was talking about that so here it is like the most astute publication in the world that i really admire and their look ahead in two of the last three years was a joke it was a jo it was completely detached from reality and that's not a criticism against them to me that's just an example of risk is what nobody can see coming it's what nobody can see coming and that will be the case i guarantee you the biggest economic news story over the next 12 months is something that no one on twitter or anywhere else is talking about and the biggest story of the next decade is something that no one is talking about and i can say that confidently because it has always been the case and it always will be the case it's why i absolutely love by the way to go back to teleph his like barbell investment strategy i think i think is what he calls it which is this idea that like 90 of your money should be in the absolute safest you know risk-free like truly risk-free by the way like really um safe hopefully cover inflation although now maybe that's more challenging um investments and then 10 should be the highly you know risk-on things that maybe benefit from these insane spike events you know the like the crazy crypto thing or whatever it is that you're putting out there but that you know that 90 of your capital is truly safe from these insane insane events it's like yeah so i i think i i don't know if this is exactly it but i think his recommendation was like 90 treasuries 10 way out of the money call option something like that yeah and to me like the more practical everyday version of that is just this philosophy of save like a pessimist and invest like an optimist like if you can save like a pessimist with the idea that all of history is a continuous chain of surprises and setbacks and disappointments and pandemics and all these things that like suck and all of history is a continuous chain of that and it always will be so you say with the idea that like i need to survive and endure all of the unpredictable nonsense but if i can survive it if i can endure it and stick around long enough well then in the long run humans are really innovative and they fix things and they solve things then they rebuild and they recover and so i want to invest like an optimist so it's just like saving like pessimism in the short run so that you can survive long enough to enjoy the compounding of the long run is how i think about it yeah and to put it into your own words too from your piece uh the the saving like a pessimist is because of the humility you have about the absurdity of forecasting the future and then the investing like an optimist comes from having that wide imagination about what all of those potential futures can look like and so you can sort of map it exactly to that yeah it's totally it it's always been the case in history that we have you know very smart people have said the innovations are done look in the last 50 years we've done some amazing things but going forward it's just it's like we've picked the low-hanging fruit that's true today it was true 50 years ago 100 years ago and i think it just becomes like you said a failure of imagination about what we can do because let's say it was 1920 and you were looking at like hey what are the next the big innovations going to be for the next 25 years you of course could not have foreseen world war ii and therefore you could not have foreseen like i said penicillin nuclear energy rockets jet airplanes radar gps internet satellites it was impossible to see those because you could not have seen world war ii coming so a lot of it is just a failure of imagination that when we look forward we think linearly of just like oh this is the world today and it's going to progress very step by step and if i think about it in those terms like oh there's not a lot of innovations but the world's never linear it's like a slow couple years and then like boom everything breaks the world breaks once per decade on average it always has i think it always will and during those breakages that's where you get these step function innovations i think it was charged charles duell who was the head of the u.s patent office uh something around 1900 was the one that said the like famous quote that everything that can be invented has already been invented um and obviously hilariously wrong in hindsight but at the time and at many points in history as you point out people really thought that that like the major innovations have already been have already been made and so everything going forward is going to be incremental and obviously knowing what we know that just cannot be true i got into an argument with a friend uh this guy nick huber who's on twitter like a somewhat controversial figure uh sweaty startup he's um you know has the like uh made the like tomato farm joke that went super viral uh a year or so ago but i got into a debate with him about this because he basically said that technology is not going to impact our lives incrementally over the next 10 years and i just the absurdity of saying something like that knowing what we know about how much every 10-year period technology has impacted our lives incrementally is it's just it's astounding to me uh yeah i think i think it's it's usually true that when a new innovation comes about it takes 10 or 20 years for it to really start like weaving its way into society so it's easy in any period of time to look at the new innovations of the last five years and be like oh those aren't gonna do anything but you can't imagine where they're gonna go i mean some examples of this is like even when the car came about like the automobile it was for a long time inferior to the horse like when it came about it broke down every 100 feet and it was loud and the roads weren't equipped for it and there were no gas stations you could have named like a dozen things about why the car is never going to work and why the horse is always going to be superior and that was true that wasn't like you weren't missing something that was true you just couldn't foresee that like oh well actually in 20 years there's going to be gas stations every everywhere and the roads are going to be paved and they're going to the cars are going to be quieter and they'll be more reliable and in that world it's actually going to be amazing so i think it's it's always the case i mean i'm sure that was true for like the early internet i'm sure early in the day it was like easier and more efficient to fax something than it would to email something when people didn't have emails you know yeah and it's always easier to say why something is not going to work than it is to predict out all the things that need to change for it to work like i think about that net right now with a lot of the web 3 technology space and how it's very easy to like dunk on it right and say there's a lot of deficiencies and you know it's slow or it's insecure there's a hacks or whatever you can come up with a million reasons why decentralized tech is not going to dominate the world in the way that you know web3 aficionados think it is but can i sit down and think about you know a handful of things that might change that could completely shift that perspective probably it's just a lot harder to do i also think about in the same thread of what are things that we absolutely believe now that we are hilariously wrong about and that we will be proven hilariously wrong about a hundred years from now and i i heard an interview where you talked about this in the context of a great book that i also read the gene um which basically was talking about how 150 years ago our perception of what the gene was in the human genome was so fundamentally off what we now know to be the case and to be true and it got me thinking about like as a you know and i think you used the example of like people thought that there was a full-grown child like a mini full-grown child within human sperm inspiration right and then there was another theory that was really popular for a long period of time which is that sperm sculpted menstrual blood and that's where humans came from and the logic that they used was when a female gets pregnant she stops shedding menstrual blood she stops having her period and therefore the blood stays inside so that must be the human and the sperm must be sculpting the blood into the human and that was a popular medical like idea for centuries which we can crack up about now like i'm sitting here laughing this is hilarious but literally was the common understanding of among really smart educated people a question that i that i have a lot that like i think by definition you can't answer is who is the modern like galileo like who has this idea where everyone's like that guy's crazy lock him up he's a nut and he's totally right he's a hundred percent right about what it is but it completely goes against everything that we know to be quote unquote 100 true and you know that's going to be the case you know those people are out there another like more modern example james garfield the president died in what was that 1870s or 1880s something like that because the best doctor in the united states of america did not believe in germs so james garfield was shot he tried to he was trying to be assassinated he survived the bullet but his doctor stuck his like muddy finger into the bullet wound moving it around and then james garfield got this incredible infection and the doctor thought that infection was good he caught it like a good healthy pus and that pus was like a good that pus was a sign of healing and then he died from the infection and this was the president of the united states during our like great great grandparents lives like not that long ago and so you know there's going to be something like that 100 years from now that there's going to be some medical treatment that you and i are doing today that we're going to look back and be like how could we be so dumb i mean in our parents life that was smoking cigarettes yeah that was medically recommended in the 1920s and 30s and now we look back today we're like oh my god what were we thinking and so i think again by definition you can't answer what that is but we're gonna look back and and laugh or be really disappointed i do wonder whether there is something fundamentally different today like when you bring up the question of who is that person out there that is kind of being ostracized or you know just ignored plain ignored for whatever their idea is that will in a hundred years be the like genius that we look back on oh my god they came up with this idea because i and the reason i wonder whether it's different today is because of the internet and social media and how ideas proliferate and find their little micro communities that espouse them and can support them and promote them and i do wonder whether because of that because any idea can now reach millions of people um you know people can go tour around the world talk about whatever their crazy ideas are i wonder whether that has changed it a little bit versus the days when you know your reach as an individual was really geographically confined see i i buy that i would also buy the exact opposite if someone said it's actually worse today because the ability to cancel people is so much greater than it ever has been i i i equally believe in both sides of that that it's easier to get your crazy ideas attention and it's also easier for your crazy ideas to ruin your life do you worry about that as a as a public figure with a large internet presence and twitter presence do you worry or ever feel insecure about the risk of that yeah particularly of course the things that would be innocent not that i would like be trying to do something and say something like yeah i think it it i don't know if it worries me but i've because i feel like i'm a pretty open book online i'm not really there's not a lot that i'm hiding but so much i think can be misconstrued and whatnot and there's definitely times where i'll be talking with friends in private and there's a joke that we're telling that is a normal joke that you know men in their 30s would tell in private but i'm like god if like if we send this to the wrong person there's times where it's just like you know a lot of people who work in tech security work in it security will say like nothing is private you have no privacy anywhere ever and there's times where it's like yeah that's that's kind of frightening because every single person in the world says things in private that they do not want online everyone without exception and so that gets a little concerning you and i actually our first interaction kind of uh you know direct interaction was because someone tried to like cancel me or dunk on me for a like legitimate joke reply to a snarky tweet that you put out if you recall this like somebody you tweeted something um and i replied like some joke basically making fun of like banking culture and like oh a tier 2 banking analyst something or the other and someone came out and dunked on me and so i deleted it and then i sent you a message and was like imagine taking my joke that seriously and we kind of laughed about it that like no matter what you put out there there is someone that is going to take it way too seriously yeah and extrapolate it out to your character right it's like the whole idea that um you know you should uh you probably shouldn't take everything and like put it on to someone's character versus just to whatever a joke whatever it is that they're saying like fundamental attribution error or something like that totally there's also like online on social media there's the um road rage phenomenon where once you're not talking to a person you're talking to a handle then all all humanity goes out the window and it's just like in road rage it's easy to like flip someone off and scream at them but if you actually get out of your car and see the person you probably shake hands and be like hey i'm sorry i didn't mean any harm like it's so easy to dehumanize people when you're talking or when you're dealing with when you're not looking at their face and they're i think that really goes in uh on in social media where you misconstrue what people mean and it's easy to create a caricature of who they are and what they want when you're just dealing with their handle this is a common challenge or pushback i have to the web 3 ethos of pseudonymity and it's a massive concern that i have so i tweeted out again you know maybe slightly controversial i tweeted out this mike tyson quote recently which i think is an amazing quote not a referendum on mike tyson as a human being just like full disclosure it has nothing to do with my like like or dislike for the guy but he he once said social media made you all way too comfortable with disrespecting people and not getting punched in the face for it um and i think it's so funny because it's really true right like you can openly disrespect someone with zero repercussions and it used to be if you're in a bar and you do that you lose your teeth if you say something to someone you have to know like if you think about it just from a pure like risk spectrum standpoint like risk and expected value if you were going to say something to somebody it used to be that the upside was like everyone goes yeah and you kind of got the guy like that's great but the downside was also he turns around and sucks you in the damn face yes yes so so you had to do that calculus there was the full spectrum with social media and whether you're pseudonymous or not that risk side is now like here it's just been narrowed where i don't have to worry about getting punched in the face maybe i have to worry about the person getting mad at me or like taking a screenshot and sharing it but definitely not getting punched in the face but it's almost the opposite not only are you not going to get punched in the face you're probably gonna get a thousand retweets which you like like like not only do you have no downside you have all you have huge upside by being a troll and yeah it's that's a that's a tough thing the quote tweet phenomenon of like how easy it is to dunk on people and get a bunch of likes for it is a very sad reality of twitter at scale it's also why and i think packy mccormick a friend of mine was the one that said this it's also why um a lot of large accounts as you reach scale become more and more fortune cookie yeah because it becomes the safest thing to do because it's hot you don't get dunked on i think this is true for me if i were to go back and look at my tweets from five years ago i probably took way more risk than i do today because the the downside as you're following grows increases as well i think that's definitely true i've also done this a handful of times not very often but if someone says something really terrible about me on twitter just really like not just casual trolling but just really mean i will i mean 99 of time i ignore that but once in a while i've dm that person and i've said hey i'm really sorry i offended you uh i'll i'll try to do better next time like kill them with kindness every single time without exception every time i've done that they have written back and said hey i'm sorry i didn't mean i i shouldn't have i shouldn't have been so mean i'll i'll delete the tweet and this i think gets back to the road rage phenomenon of like when you're dealing with the handle it's easy to be that jerk and then once as soon as you realize you're actually dealing with a human being like most people are actually pretty civil most people are actually pretty nice and so i think i i do that just because i think it's interesting to see how quickly the demeanor changes once they realize they're dealing with a real human being i've done the exact same thing and had the exact same experience every single time it's crazy i had somebody um you know i put out this thread explaining what swift was right as the sanctions were coming out and it went quite viral and at the end of it we had planned to do an episode where we would talk about swift and the impact of all that so i'd linked to the podcast and someone shared it and said like oh this guy you know trying to profit from uh you know the deaths of ukrainian citizens and i just i sent the person a message and just said like hey man that clearly wasn't my intent like i'm not trying to profit from anybody's death like we're gonna do an episode i want people to tune into it like i get it i sort of understand like maybe like on the margins of it but come on you know you like you know that that wasn't the intention and he immediately had that same reaction like okay i deleted it thanks for reaching out to me you know i'm sorry that i did that it was a gut reaction yeah and that's like i don't know if i don't know if it's good or bad to see that because you realize how easy it is to be a troll because you realize that the people who are doing it don't understand exactly what they're doing it would be one thing if people who are a troll knew what they were doing and they're like the world needs to hear this this criticism and this person truly is awful and i need to let the world know it but 99 of the time that's not the case it's just the barriers to entry of of uh on in civil behavior are so low on social media yeah no it's it it totally makes sense i mean it's it's the challenge that i think uh everyone faces as they continue to scale and continue to share i would say that the good definitely outweighs the bad i mean the ability to reach people all around the world how many people your writing has reached at this point your book you know sold over a million copies and continues to reach people it's it's quite amazing when you think about all the opportunities it has afforded creative people to to go out and and uh and put things out into the world that reach people at scale you have a few followers yourself i think and you've had a couple of tweets that have gotten like a few hundred likes i think just a few hundred a few hundred um so i i know we're kind of starting to run into the end of time here and i i don't want to um i don't want to let you go before asking for a few um a few a few final questions um one would be you are a prolific writer um you i don't know i'm at this point you've written thousands of articles i imagine from your days at the motley fool on now to your kind of weekly post with with collaborative fund and all of the writing you've done the book etc what is your process like are you writing every single morning um from a creative standpoint are you reading a lot every day like what is your actual process and your kind of framework that allows you to be such a prolific uh writer of really evergreen content i re i read a lot and i spend a lot of time just kind of aimlessly wandering around thinking going for walks or just sitting on the couch and just trying to like throw thoughts around actually sitting down in a google doc and writing is a very small minority of of what i do the huge majority of it is just trying to form thoughts and come across little examples and data and whatnot so almost every day that i have during the week is unstructured there's very little on the calendar and a lot of it is just kind of casually reading sitting on the couch and reading a book or listening to a podcast or scrolling twitter or talking to a friend on the phone it's things that do not look like work to anyone but what it is is just like i'm just trying to find the idea for the next article or something what are the most what are the most consistent things that you read like what are you reading on a consistent basis you mentioned the economist i think that's a phenomenal one what are the other things you're consistently reading the most the most consistent is probably history books um that's probably that like takes up the lion's share they have absolutely nothing to do with investing or the economy most of the time but they're just i just think they're insights into how people think and if i can gain an insight into how people think i'll be able to tie that back to investing that's always how i look at the process and so that's interesting that's what most of it is it's an interesting perspective because most of your writing you know people would characterize it as financial writing you know you work at a venture fund you're not writing about venture investing you're not writing about startups you're not writing about really the stock market all that often you're writing about the world frameworks perspectives mental models you're not calling them any of those things or branding it in any specific way but when i read your work i i find myself coming back to it because it encourages me to think about things that i'm seeing around me in a different way or in a new in a new light that's why i find it so interesting because you're not a financial i mean you're not a financial writer you're writing about basically everything the world around us i'm trying to i think that that's right and i'm trying to write about how people think and how people think is a hundred percent of what matters in startups and in venture capital and in the stock market and whatnot so they do they all do all tie together but i want to get there in a roundabout way and i think if you can learn something if you can find something about human behavior that is true in multiple disciplines you've found like something that is very powerful in human behavior so if you can notice how people react to risk in medicine and in military history and in politics and in relationships and in education and all these other facets of life if you start seeing like there's this behavior that keeps coming up it it almost certainly applies to investing as well like people don't people don't think about risk in their investments any differently than they think about risk with their health or you know for example there's all these things that fall under the same umbrella and i think it's much more interesting and more complete to think about investing through the lens of those other fields rather than the narrow tiny little lens of finance through a finance textbook i think that's like so incomplete to view the economy just through the lens of an economist but if you view the economy through the lens of economics and sociology and psychology and history and political science and biology and all these like geopolitics all these other things that have nothing to do with economics you understand the big picture so much better as the son of an economist um i can definitely say that economists are notoriously wrong about the economy yeah uh and it's sort of the hammer to a nail you're right like to to a hammer everything looks like a nail if that is your lens if that is the framework if that is your map of reality everything in your life is going to guide you to the that specific one answer and if you don't view it from those other perspectives or think in that multi-disciplinary manner you're going to have a really hard time yeah i mean i think most fields are some mix of that like um i heard this great quote recently i'm going to butcher it but the the this person it was a geologist and he said there's no such thing as geology geology is where chemistry and physics and astronomy and all these other fields like overlap that's what geology is and to be a good geologist you need to be a good chemist you need to be a good physicist you need to be a good astronomer like all these all these things like mix together and i think that's really true for economics as well that you can be an amazing economist if you don't really have any uh economics background but you're but you really understand psychology you really understand politics you really understand sociology you really understand all these things all these different things the mixture of those the intersection of those is going to make you a really astute economist it would also make school much more interesting and engaging for kids if we were able to teach and learn that way in a way that's not so compartmentalized across subjects because the reality is they all bleed into each other and so how do you kind of it's an interesting thought experiment for another day but how do you reframe our traditional education system to allow children to learn in that way where you're going a crisis more networked learning you're kind of going across different subjects and pairing things together that seemingly don't make sense but that actually lead to much more compounded knowledge growth and here's the thing i think i think most colleges try to do that with general end requirements like if you are a computer science major you have to take psychology 101 and in biology et cetera so they try to do that but where they fail is that they never blend them together they they still all those courses live in their own little silo and they're never woven together to be like hey here's what psychology teaches us about economics you take psychology and then you switch gears and you take economics but you never blend them together two final questions for you um most recent book that you really enjoyed i read the biography of charles lindbergh of course was the first man to fly across the atlantic in 1927 he flew from new york to paris and it's not an exaggeration that he was the most famous man in the world when that occurred it just completely blew people's minds the airplane had been around for about 20 years but charles lindbergh flying across the atlantic was the first time that the entire world was like oh [ __ ] this is a big deal this is going to change everything this is not a little toy to fly you across town this is going to completely change the world he was 25 when that occurred and he became the most famous man in the world and then his life um was kind of a series of downfalls after that a couple years after that his two-year-old son was kidnapped and murdered and then in the 1930s he kind of cozied up to the nazis which destroyed his credibility of course and so his life was i think i think probably more than any other modern human his life was extreme highs and extreme lows and the book just describes how he took it and how he dealt with it and he's just a really fascinating person is this is it lindbergh by scott berg that's it yep okay awesome all right well i'm gonna order it and then my final question for you i mentioned it earlier my first uh first child son do in uh in about a month lessons or um one thing that you would provide by way of advice when my wife was pregnant with our first child our son we went to dinner at a house with some friends who had young kids themselves and their advice was love the kid that you have not the kid that you want that is a little bit of preparation to say that your child is gonna be hard in unique ways every child is hard in their unique ways and every child is gonna do things that you didn't expect and that maybe you didn't necessarily want you thought it was gonna turn out differently but just love the kid that you have rather than the one that you want maybe it's like the charlie munger quote that the the key to happiness is low expectations that's that's that's a great that's a great advice for a new parent yeah great way to end thank you so much morgan this was amazing so many takeaways for people and i think it's going to be i think it's going to be an amazing one for people to listen to thanks man this is fun thanks so much for listening to today's episode if you have any questions that you want featured in a future episode email us

Description:
Today's guest shows the power of community by sharing a personal story of how Discord changed the trajectory of his life. Jiho (@Jihoz_Axie), the Co-Founder of Axie Infinity, tells the story of how he went from community manager to C-Level Executive at Axie Infinity. As the co-founder of one of the most successful play-to-earn games to date, Jiho has tons of knowledge about NFTs and video games.

we've got uh i guess the like natural future of where people are saying video games are going it's like the web 3 future so you're going to guide me on this journey down and play to earn land because i grew up i was like a pokemon guy i love pokemon uh world of warcraft met like all this stuff i played i love video games i haven't been as close to it recently invested in the space a little bit i think it's awesome but stoked to talk about video games today with with jiho yeah i mean i i've never told you this but i actually played professional counter-strike no way i was like 16. really yeah how did that come about did you practice and you were like sick at counter-strike yeah pretty much dude yeah this reminds me so much of you you know josh um but josh has three so josh fabian founder of metaphor has three kids i think three four and two of his sons are like top 50 in the world pokemon players and they're little dudes and they go up against adults in this like strategy game and they're just complete savages like destroy them and so i'm imagining you as a 16 year old kid or a 15 year old kid like little baby greg rolling around destroying people in counter-strike totally yeah we uh me and my my clan actually competed in the qualifier for the world cyber games and maybe 2004. which was a long time ago i love that so yeah i need pictures we're going to need to check receipts on this there's one picture of me which is insane which maybe i can dig up um we're going to dig it up we're gonna throw it into the discord after we get done with this because we're gonna need to see this picture i need to see 15 year old craig i'm going to get memed yeah i've got like i hope so the longest side anyways i can't wait yeah so what are we going to dig into today i mean we've got a lot to cover with jiho have you well i've been just i've been thinking about plato and a bunch and also learned to earn mm-hmm um have you seen rabbithold.gg what is learn to earn so pl play to earn we're going to dive into it like we'll talk about all the definitions and get into it learn to earn i've never heard of so what is that learn to earn well i'll explain it by the example like rabbit hole so the way rabbit hole works is you earn tokens from decentralized applications by learning about them so for example uniswap is one of the biggest protocols that exists in decentralized finance and they'll basically give let's say you know 10 uni tokens if you go on a rabbit hole quest and the rabbit hole quest is all about learning about how new to swap works and how to actually you know use some of their protocol um so udeswap is happy because they've just acquired this new customer uh who's vetted right they've actually learned how to use the protocol and they've actually they've got you know quote-unquote on-chain reputation so meaning you've learnt uh how to use uniswap and it's almost minted to the blockchain so it's like this you know greg eisenberg learned this and that's that's really the concept of learn to earn yeah that's really cool i mean it's a it's a natural sort of play adjacency to play to earn it's really interesting to think about like normal world non-web 3 applications of that exact thing like how companies might be able to integrate learn turn because if you think about like a bank a credit card company new financial services infrastructure they benefit so much from people understanding what they're building in the product suite and so i wonder whether there are ways to like leverage that idea by just like teaching people more and now suddenly you've acquired a customer effectively and it's more interesting in the web3 context because now you have like people that could be developers like they should do a developer camp where they teach you how to code on solana or they teach you how to code on top of ethereum and then you get one eth for doing the course like they pay you to take the course because now they have new developers that are building on top of it and creating this whole ecosystem effect yeah i think i i think that that's where it's all going where i actually did a thread on this where i believe that in the future you'll have your resume on chain and you'll be able to apply at a job and then within 60 seconds get that job because you know those people know that you are great at uniswap or you understand how to code in rust or solidity or whatever and you have these these badges to prove it um i think that's the future i got like a ton of backlash from that thread like thousands of people being like you're completely wrong like so it was the idea sorry i want to go deeper on that just for one second before you extend so the idea of it being on chain would mean that you would have your resume it would also have like credibility scores on chain associated with every skill set then experience you say you have so people could have in a trustless way you would know when you went to it that that person had been stamped of approval and had executed a number of things really high quality with whatever that skill set is what's stopping me yes that's exactly how it goes what's stopping me from going on linkedin and being like i'm the head of magic at mcdonald's totally nothing yeah so what i do like about applying blockchain to this is it's vetted you know there's you i went through rabbit hole and i've learned this skill and therefore i i've proven yeah that really is interesting it's interesting to think about derivative businesses you could build off of it too of like how do i um like it would be very cool to say i'm gonna like you did crypto college you're teaching a bunch of people how to build in in web 3. um if i'm an enterprising person i might actually go buy a bunch of those nfts stake them stake a bunch of people scholarship and say i want 10 of your first company like use it as my venture investment in them and say if you're gonna go build in the space i'll buy you your ticket into this thing but i'm the guy now you have to give me a 10 stake or when you raise your first round i have to have priority access out of 20 discount to whatever you raise at in order to invest and it's sort of like i mean it's what these incubators are doing in a lot of sense but it's for a web three worlds you actually are paying i mean like you're you're giving them their ticket to the learning experience and even cooler when you think about the actual protocols doing it so like solana paying to have students go and do a solana boot camp because they know that it's going to create and foster a broader ecosystem kind of a cool idea to like think about what the businesses are that could be built around that yeah i think uh i mean it makes sense right like so with crypto college like we were of course teaching about nfts dows and social tokens and we had 150 people who are builders right they're building they've now like they're vetted they've learned how to do this and a lot of them are building successful projects it makes sense that either us as as crypto college or or some external group comes and basically yeah stakes or lends out uh these these uh admission tickets and then you would imagine that it there's a smart contract that's baked into it that basically says yeah i get x percent of your revenue or i get why why and that's the beauty about web3 and and crypto is that you can just bake that into the code of the smart contract yeah so this learn to earn thing is really interesting um i want to i want to talk more about it with you because i think there are a bunch of cool i think we could do a whole episode on learn to earn yeah i think there's like a bunch of really cool applications of it too to like dive in more understand some of the business opportunities that come off this and also like can you create kind of learn to earn services that then um you know you could plug into older world companies and figure out ways to foster new kind of uh ecosystems around your existing like old world web 2 company and product so i really do think that's interesting i do want to bring in jiho and dive in on play darn because the video game aspect and what they're building is super super interesting and i think we need to go deep on it and he's he's the guy to bring in he's the guy so let's do it bring him in we'll jam on it hey this is jiho i'm the co-founder of axiomfinity coming at you live we are live in miami for nft uh nft yeah there's youtube podcast spotify um and then a community so we built a whole thing around discord alongside it it's kind of nice i should join your discord yeah it's gonna be cool we'll go in like after the episode drops well changed my life yeah really yeah like so that's how i that's how you know like i i saw the wired article that a cryptokitty sold for 150 000 dollars like what the [ __ ] is the crypto kitty uh but this seems really kind of interesting this seems accessible as i was always a gamer i was always a collector i wasn't i wasn't into crypto it was about trading i already knew how to trade options so if i wanted extreme volatility i already knew where to get that uh yeah so that so then i found i saw that what your kitty had 2017 like december 1st or something like that so basically four years ago to the day uh right yeah exactly four years ago happy birthday discovery cryptokitties and i was like it was an interesting community right like people were doing interesting stuff around it i built i worked on a project called kitty hats that was building accessories on top of on top of it right so uh yale at the time no no no i had graduated i was a quad recruiter for a couple of years uh no way yeah so the smartest people that i was talking to that i'd been talking to all super interested in ethereum uh and smart contracts uh so so it was on my radar right and then i saw cryptokitties uh but then right it kind of was just a proof of concept right it was like it's like let's not try to turn this into something that it's not destined to be uh but we knew that okay like right there was problems with the economy right so we need we needed to figure out like how can we get people to actually just right like want to hold these pets rather than just like breeding and selling right we need we needed there to be more verbs more utility right i think utility in terms of verbs right like okay you could breed you can collect what else right okay battle right um that's a cool way of thinking about it i've never thought of that utility in terms of verbs it makes a ton of sense though battle collect build yeah harvest yeah right these are all uh verbs that we're trying to bring to axes that's so cool okay so you so discord you ended up like you got into discord channels because you saw that things were going on with it and stuff was happening you would talk to a bunch of smart people that were getting into it and clearly then you started paying attention to it until like what actually brought you from there then to the axi story yeah so i joined xc as a community member right so i i hopped in i think there were 10 people like that were regularly chatting in the discord at that time so uh and yeah i met the founders uh trung masamune they were talking about their vision in the discord at the time it was like uh and i said hey like this is something that could work it's right it has that a collectibility aspect and the scarcity but there's also right this plan for long-term fun and uh utility and i was like i saw that as the perfect formula for building an amazing community um yeah so did the game exist at that point or was it just a vision it was yeah so i arrived on the day i think that the axis were unveiled so there was a month where people were buying tokens nfts that you couldn't see actually this is this is not like a common yeah this is not a common strategy right but at that time it was people were like people like are these is this a scam is this art ever gonna be revealed and then as soon as the art was revealed i think people felt safe to to kind of tell me about it yeah uh so then i i arrived you could see the axes right i bought three and i was like okay like what do we do next right like we need we need to uh we need we need to start building what did they cost when you first bought them i think you remember the axes that i got were like .15 each or something like these are origin axes right so i think you know there was a chance that you could get a when you were buying these original axes right there's only 4088 of them hard cap uh origin axes and around like basically each time up one of their body parts or a gene was rolled there was a chance that it was a mystic part right so they're uh six body parts um so it's like around like a thirty percent chance that it would have a mystic part mystics are like limited collectible yeah uh or kind of like the holy grail within oxy rates i think like mystics are i think around 30 right now each something like that it's so cool because um like now we're all familiar with these terms like you spend time in that nft world you like understand rarity understand all the different properties but in 2017 or what it was 2017 it was like this is weird i don't understand it it's like the chris dixon thing of like if it looks like a toy you know it might be the thing of the future people were saying that like in the early days of nfts right they were just they were pretty and i i'd seen that i think andreessen invested in crypto kitties it obviously became dapper labs later so like okay this is a space this is going to be an entire market uh so i was i was kind of looking for an opportunity to get involved as a builder in a project right so yeah i found axey as a community member and just started trying to help out so that's helping with the community doing some writing just keeping the discord chat liquidity high you guys are kindred spirits so you're gonna see you're the ceo of axe infinity right no no no i'm a co-founder growth lead cgo i guess yeah so you can go from a community member to a c-level executive by just literally partaking in the community and contributing like you know when you started i would imagine joining that community your first you know you never thought that you'd be or or correct me if i'm wrong did you think that you were going to be the chief growth officer of this of this big thing i don't know i was taking it day by day like i was just also having fun right like i was just hanging out meeting new people uh and yeah it's kind of the web three i always think about greg's gonna make fun of me for this probably like i am a uh i'm still a ludite and i still am like developing my understanding of all these things and embracing it and i think of all of these things in like prior to web 3 analogs and i think of this as like a story of it's like the person that starts as like the you know stockroom floor and now is the ceo like walmart actually i think the ceo of walmart currently is a guy that like started as a store man like he started as a store clerk i mean right before this we had cat cole who wasn't she was a hooters waitress and became the head ahead you know and i think i think the you know the 2021 2022 equivalent of that is you start in the discord we're hiring incr like incredible talent from the discord right now from the community so cool that's so cool so i want to get into um i want to get into the axi story for sure because i think it's amazing i've done a bunch of research and reading on you and um and the story but maybe we start like let's set the stage for people that are listening people like me that probably don't understand it quite as much with just like a little bit of kind of definitions around it so can you guys talk you guys know this much better than me can you talk about like free to play and then how does that transition and what does plato play to earn mean yeah sure so in the in the right in the in traditional gaming right like the developers the app stores the publishers they're all right they're all working uh and they're they're working together they're selling a product right they're still either selling skins or game copies um selling loot boxes right traditionally they're taking close to 100 of the revenue generated by the game all right there are some like black and gray markets but it's it's not uh yeah they're they're kind of difficult uh to to uh access and and use so our our model is a lot different right we're very focused on the community the player owned economy uh so we see it as we've kind of lowered taxes from close to a hundred percent to around four point two five percent right which is the uh fee on the axi marketplace right so rather than selling axes directly we uh monetize by just taking a percent or a cut of all peer-to-peer player to player transactions on our marketplace so the original i just want to read it back to you guys and make sure i'm understanding it correctly so like earlier okay think like fortnite everyone knows fortnite they you know had epic games like has this massive ecosystem that they've built the game is free to play and you go buy skins or you buy different attributes or whatever within the game all of that money it sounds like is going to epic like there the 100 that's the rent the way you put it i thought was great the rent they're taking it the players get to play the utility the players get is that they have fun there's no like you're not earning anything and the difference here when you start thinking about plate earn is rather than that company taking a hundred percent that whole pool now is basically for the players and for the ecosystem and the world in a way that you're creating and the actual company actually takes a clip like it's a tiny percentage that gets taken i don't know five percent or something it's also like an important thing to recognize too right is people are also spending within axi for reasons that they spend on traditional digital items right like they're spending for fun they're spending for status right like actually is an incredibly fun game and it's an amazing community this is actually what backs the economy that's also why it's so hard to replicate right if it was just about mechanisms then everyone would just copy the mechanism and there would be all these thriving nft planner games right now but there aren't there's only one actually because i think it has to do with that uh idea of the social capital backing the economy could you talk more about that so what makes a great play to earn game what are what are the ingredients i think they're they're they're there's a lot i mean you need i think an amazing community something where the way that i think about crypto in general is like what are are there products where the community is doing a majority of the work already where a middleman is extracting the value uh away from that community and can we cut out the middleman and basically reward the community for the work that they're already doing so i think that any product that has the community like user generated content right like that's brilliant anything that has a high amount of work being done by users with with large existing middlemen is ripe for disruption so that's why that's how i i look at it so yeah i think like the roblox model would work better right if they opened up the economy even more you know what roblox actually uh was very irrelevant for a long time until they allowed people to actually cash out their robux um so it's a more open model that's why it's like that's why it's actually catapulted but we just we're taking it to the natural conclusion which is like you know giving giving as much as possible uh to the community so we need to go deeper on this because that was brilliant so just as a framework find a business or an industry where the community is creating the vast majority of the value and if there is a rent collector sitting there that's somehow harvesting most of the value from that it needs to be disrupted and it likely will be disrupted by something that looks more like web 3 and that is more decentralized and community oriented i think it's so interesting to think about the incentives that you're relying on to advance these spaces too where like with the prior versions you are relying on the fact that like epic or whatever the developer is will continue to reinvest those profits to enhance and make the ecosystem better and continue to make the game better and make it more engaging and fun over time with this you're actually not relying on anybody because it is in every player's best interest to make the ecosystem better so that they can earn more money in it and so they all have that they want to read many of the players right you can see each each of them as a digital pet store owner right i i actually magic is actually more of a decentralized model too right where right there's a secondary market there is kind of like this economy uh each store owner right is kind of incentivized to host magic uh nights right they have like magic friday i think like they have market cards right so it's more of a decentralized model right so but i think like yeah one of the things that nfts do in my opinion is they give the characteristics of physical collectibles like trading cards to digital assets can we talk more about that so magic i've always wondered like who was like why they were throwing these magic tournaments like can you talk more about the mo first of all i didn't know that you were like a magic nerd i wouldn't say i was a magic nerd but i loved magic cards pokemon that was a word people were into that kind of stuff like how to work out like these a lot of them like we're super early to actually because they see them they see the model it's just like taking that physical world model yeah and applying it to a borderless future i just i when i look at him i see like stanford baseball pitcher fun fact the stanford baseball team my freshman year the entire team on all of our road trips would be sitting on our computers playing world of warcraft together on the way together nice hilarious narrative violation but yeah going back to magic like do you know about their model because i'm i've recently been obsessed around taking sort of like older community models and bringing it online so i'm just curious of you yeah i'm i'm like i studied it a little bit in the early days of axi uh and i saw that basically physical events were really important to their propagation on the proliferation of magic right where uh yes store owner the store owners and right like they basically will the wizards of the coast they'll send merch basically and i guess appoint people um just kind of like this bureaucracy or whatever and and they have this whole framework for basically uh yeah hosting events and i think there are like thousands of them right every friday all across the country it's funny because we we talk about the metaverse right we talk about this digital place but so many of us forget that physical is where communities are so community right so for something like magic where there's a huge secondary market right just like axi the community is really important because people need to be spending right for that flex right so in magic right why do people buy why would anyone buy a black lotus right they might see it as a store value but it's also right it's like you get to tell the other people in the magic community that you have a [ __ ] black lotus right so similar right some are similar dynamic in the axi community right with all the collectibility um and that it's that right like uh status that right drives a lot of the economic activity as well yeah and it creates a it creates a world as you continue to scale it both physical and digital but you're sort of just what you're creating is not a game anymore it's like an entire ecosystem really a nation um of axi players that's borderless and so it doesn't matter if all the articles about the people in the philippines that are earning a living wage playing actually it's amazing it's like you watch these videos and it's very inspiring that there are people that are doing this and then there's someone in america and like you go and host an event at art puzzle and people that have never met never connected in person in any form or function are now all of a sudden connected in this cool very real way it doesn't matter the color of their skin it's like very global it's really really cool that's one of the things that i love just like the promise of it that i love so much is that borderless aspect to it one of the things i want to also ask about is like what are the challenges or the unique i don't know drawbacks or challenges of this plate iron model like with axi you had this massive hype cycle um you know like [ __ ] had his piece on it and there was all this press and everything and you know the prices of everything spiked it's it's obviously like with every hype cycle it pulls back pricing so like how do you think about that aspect of the play-doh and model where you're going to have natural like any market fluctuations in the prices and how it impacts players and gaming sure i mean this has happened too right like where we we built all through throughout 2018 2019 right axi prices went from the cheapest you know kind of run-of-the-mill axes went from i think five dollars to 20 cents or something but that was really important for the community that was character building that volatility actually uh creates fermentation a fermentation process so it's actually needed right like every crypt a strong crypto community needs to go through a bear market to uh together unfortunately maybe for better for worse i think that's how it works i think that's also one of the part parts of starting a project now and a lot of projects come to me for advice on like how do you build a community it's like but they're they're operating in a totally different market right like the same things that we did back then are not gonna work now um it's like the lindy effect have you read uh like he's like somewhat hated in the bitcoin community for like anti-bitcoin but hit the lindy effect of the whole idea of like the longer you've survived the longer you're likely to survive and so being hardened by those periods of pain actually leads to more survivability of it i think it's a great it's a great way of putting it actually like you need those moments i'll also say they're one of the drawbacks of like this whole narrative around play play to earn i prefer we're we prefer to call it play enter right uh but one of the drawbacks of narrative is that right the community aspect the you know the uh the fun of the entire ecosystem it kind of takes like a back seat to you know this thing that's kind of a new innovation right it's there's there's so many fun games out there there are a lot of amazing communities out there this is kind of a fundamental new innovation but sometimes uh it takes a little bit of the spotlight off of the rest of the ecosystem and and also this stuff that basically allows the player and model to work right and then people start saying oh like plato and like how does this how is this sustainable because they don't understand how fun the game is how awesome the community is fast forward 10 years from now what percentage of the game gaming market is play and earn versus traditional as you define it well i think that these digital economies are become some of the largest economies of all time right so like it's more like how many games will there be that are larger than large countries or something right with economies that are larger than large countries um i think that there will be i think that there will be hundreds of millions if not billions of uh players playing you know participating in these uh digital worlds right we're already seeing that right our digital lives our digital identities are becoming increasingly more important and the pandemic right kind of expedited that uh but now it's like okay we're using the digital world as kind of a a way to funnel or to sift through who we actually want to spend time with in in the physical world as well right so i think it's also that unity that fusion uh is is super bullish for uh everything that we're building and is the vision can you walk us through a little bit of the vision of axi in the sense of like um could you see a world where people not only come to axi to just play but they go maybe there's quests that have real world implications or like do you see it more as like um a potential like virtual world where it could be serious and fun or do you see it just fun like you know hey we're just trying to build like the most fun experience and there's some on-chain revenue etc yeah actually like so uh we just had an internal discussion about this right it's like the world they want to see like oh this is a fun game right but as uh right stewards of the ecosystem we think a little bit more in terms of like what are the archetypes of players in this ecosystem right we so right now we have like uh battle competitive battlers right we have scholarship managers people that are renting out their axes we have scholars right they're kind of just farming tokens to survive then we have the collectors right they're really into the aesthetics and the scarcity aspect of it um and then we have people who just they hold access and they stake it and they're also contributing to the ecosystem there are people who write they trade the slp token and this provides liquidity for it why because it has interesting like uh correlations to the rest to all their basically asset classes because it's kind of like a it's a it's a uncapped uh coin that's kind of tied to the value of human effort within our ecosystem so it's kind of like a weird correlation thing so basically there are all these different archetypes right and we need to also think about when we think about the future what are the future archetypes of people that we want to have in our ecosystem so it's a little bit i think a more precise way of thinking about it because right fun is very uh subjective and some people believe that they're the arbiters of fun uh but it's to me it's like yeah it's not specific enough it's not something that you can build uh scientifically with so you hit on something there that i think is like one of the most mind-blowing like for it [ __ ] me up the first time i was reading about it to be totally honest which was like this whole idea of the physical world real world economies that are being built outside and alongside adjacent to axi and like the scholar thing is a perfect example of this like i've seen it with i think what is it ygg yeah yield guild games is that what it stands for um and a few others that have kind of popped up that are basically have they've built real world physical businesses adjacent to axi to kind of support the ecosystem that's being built not supported by axe it's just companies that have like enterprising entrepreneurs that have gone and realized they could stake people to go and play in the game the same way honestly as like what we've done with athletes in the past like russian tennis players have been backed by these like oligarchs to go and build a career and then they take a percentage of their earnings that to me is like this seminal moment of what you're doing that all of a sudden there are economies being built outside of you where you're like oh this looks like a country where you have all these random economy points did you guys was that like a vision that you had or did you start seeing it and say holy [ __ ] there's really something to this it was it's it's something right like i don't know like you if there's fog of war right like so you just go and you try to get to product market fit in the early days we saw that right axi was more more than a game because people were spending so much time on the discord right like that was kind of like their home so we saw axi in the early days as maybe a social network but we couldn't pitch it as a social network when we hold had only 200 people in the community but early on we saw that there was something very special happening with the community uh you know we've we all had you know a thesis that these digital economies would would start to rise uh but yeah you know it was definitely right like to see yeah to see people start building on top of it right to see if even uh physical uh physical businesses are starting to accept access and slp as payment uh to lure right more foot traffic right like if you if you know that there are a lot of like axi players in your town you can get them to come check out your business by accepting our in-game currencies right so this is a marketing strategy a user acquisition strategy for uh businesses in the traditional world so yeah i think like what what is a nation like how do we define a nation right donations typically have like right like a kind of an economy maybe culture national pastimes sometimes languages um i think it's it's it's we're starting to see all that uh develop within axi uh physical borders are maybe like you know the last component of it i think that we have a chance you know over the next 15 years to you know potentially acquire some distressed real estate from a sovereign nation uh and maybe set up a special economic zone or something that could be recognized by the un um so yeah we we we've already status we start issuing statements to the gov to the legacy governments of the world right because they're like oh like we heard that the central bank of the philippines was interested in axi and asking questions about it uh and so we didn't know how to get into contact with them so we put out like an announcement saying that you know we encourage our players to pay taxes if they have to if they're if they're you know local i guess governments are requiring them to yeah i think i mean on one hand i hear you sahil like you're not even saying anything but i hear you in terms of like it's wild that you can start a game [Music] bring people together that eventually leads to like a country on the other hand it kind of makes sense right like you've built an economy you've built like-minded individuals you've built culture you've built community we just had a conversation with melton and melt well you know what melton was saying is you know the future basically that there's going to be these like new churches and new cathedrals um and she's actually trying to build i mean like the church of bitcoin i don't know if it's bitcoin but basically like an actual you know treated as a religion for tax purposes and you can put your gains into this so that it's allocating on a tax efficient basis to go do it it's kind of it's a crazy concept but not that crazy when you break it down to the atomic unit of it actually um i mean it sounded like my fraternity right like was like some uh i think it was like a non-profit organization yeah right right yeah yeah yeah exactly and it's you know how many people play axey approximately like uh yeah we have 2.8 million daily active users so yeah millions of people right like iceland is 400 000 people you think about it yeah we have i think two players in iceland it was a long time where i was like [ __ ] i can't like iceland green i think iceland like i just didn't have any anyone there i was like who wants to be the first yeah right yeah and i think like so i mean you're bigger than iceland yeah you know you're you're you're you're five to six times bigger than iceland yeah um and it makes sense that like yeah like you might want to acquire you know some people might want to move to this place makes it makes a lot of sense i'm starting to see people describe the scale of the axi economy as in terms of gdp right um so yeah yeah i mean that's like the tipping point right when people start saying it that way well old is you know gross domestic product new is game domestic product yeah i the um the first time i ever thought about this question like you asked like what is a country um you've all know a harare has that book sapiens which everyone should read if they haven't and he goes into that like what is an organization what is a company what is a country it's just shared belief at the end of the day and it's just like you have a shared belief in something and there's community like all of what we're talking about here it's community it's bringing it together like money what is money it's just trust like you what is money that was actually the opening line to my thesis seriously but it's i mean it's crazy when you break these things down to the like boil them down to the root um i just that like i just think it's fast i also think it's fascinating if you're a builder and you're looking for a new startup idea well you have an axi and probably there are a couple other things out there that have a similar fervor around them right now but not many is a group of 2.8 million people worldwide that are highly highly engaged with something that have a ton of needs that like you can go and create something for exactly those needs the people that were doing these scholar programs staking or doing that but like they're going to be unique banking and financial services needs that come off of um people that are playing on a regular basis what can you go build that like services those people really really well so we just we just actually just launched the dax a decentralized exchange it's called katana uh i believe it's the second large there's a 1.4 billion dollars locked in but we only have two pairs axis ethan slp ethel we also have usdc youth as well um so we're getting stable coin access to people in the emerging markets as well where did it previously happen was it like ftx or something where they previously did it they were using like binance a lot like dexes on ethereum and stuff there's a lot of like friction around right like basically you claim the token within your our ecosystem for playing the game then you have to like transfer out of the ecosystem to right to sell it right um so yeah like it's it's i think it was a huge catalyst for us uh yeah i think they're a huge thing for you guys this is just a random idea that i'm having right now but like in terms of creating stability within the ecosystem as well and i've talked about it with several people like rich people don't sell the assets they have they take loans out against it never have to sell it they live off of the loans against it that will eventually happen in the axi community and then you won't have these massive price swings and volatility within the market because people will be leaving their slp within the ecosystem you can like have financial services infrastructure that gets built outside it that allows people to actually take a living wage as a claim against their whatever i think the next the next thing maybe maybe maybe you agree like i think maybe one of the next things that we should build on ronin is something like something like ave or a compound a money market basically um and this will basically allow right like people to get liquidity right from their access holdings yeah uh without having to suffer a taxable event could you could you explain what ave or compound is to to write in you know regular normies uh yeah like yeah so ave and compound are crypto money markets where you can basically deposit tokens and receive a stablecoin loan based on the value of those assets right so uh yeah you might be able to write let's say you deposit a hundred dollars of uh of a token of let's say eth you can then draw maybe 20 of stable coin right and this basically allows you to get liquidity uh from your crypto without having to sell it and yeah you can also write like on the other side you can also borrow from these money markets if maybe you want leverage or you have some need for eth and the reason this is hugely valuable i mean in a normal in a non-axi context is like if i have a ton of bitcoin but i bought it at 100 and now it's worth 60 000 and i want to go buy a house i can't do that if i like sell my bitcoin pay a huge tax on that gain and then go buy a house with the cash this allows you to leave your bitcoin you never have to pay the tax and you can draw money against it and then go and buy it and so in the actual infiniti case why it's interesting is people wouldn't have to sell and convert to fiat in order to pay for their food in the grocery store down the street they could leave it in the game which by the way has the nice benefit of creating price stability in the game which drives more people in and continues to drive appreciation and growth of the ecosystem but they can still draw against it to go buy their food and live live on a database yeah that's like a potentially potentially important project a product you know we have to do a lot of education right like so we see axi as an accessible cute nostalgic um community driven kind of rabbit hole into the rest of crypto as well right so you start with the game in the community but then where you start to learn okay how to stake right how to uh pull liquidity um you start to all these other verbs right get unlocked right stake farm deposit borrow uh and yeah fifty percent of our users have never used crypto that's amazing 25 of them don't even have a bank account so we have to do a lot of basic financial and crypto education um so people are learning incredible amounts i see axi is also like an education platform in some ways there are a lot of educational like content companies coming to us you know saying hey lou they would want to have us reskin their course with axes so that like it's people actually use it yeah i mean this is like you're creating so much value for the web 3 and crypto ecosystem by educating people in this way it's also what you're saying is the reason why i haven't invested in any financial literacy like platforms or businesses is because i fundamentally believe that financial literacy happens through actual like action and putting skin in the game no seriously and like it's not me taking a course on like how to invest it's by actually having skin in the game and learning it by feeling it out and like [ __ ] up feeling the pain of something and getting rugby whatever like ends up happening um but that like that the amount of value that's being created by taking something that looks like a toy people get on ramped into crypto another red pill to some extent starting to see what the future looks like all of these different things happening and suddenly we have you know it's 2.8 now it's 10 in a few months it's like it becomes very very powerful long term as you compound that super exciting do you um you mentioned axi you know when you first started axi you know it was a social network do you think in in in play to earn a play in earn the way it works is there's like multiple worlds that you end up in so for example like in social like there's multiple areas right there's twitter for this there's instagram for that there's tick tock for this do you think it's one big world in planner plan earn or do you think it you know you could imagine a world where maybe axi creates separate worlds so i think that when we're just riffing right so this is this is all like very hypothetical and and speculative right but i think that there will yeah i believe in that there will be multiple worlds but i believe that there will be certain assets starting with erc20s like money kind of or in tokens um that will right like kind of be borderless um because these things with like a i don't know liquidity and a dollar value or it's easier to port than between worlds right uh but then right obviously we get into like interoperability i'm more bullish on vertical inter interop so for that's in our case right one team of axes many different games built by many different developers in the axia universe right and then eventually maybe like right like having standards to port them between like platform i see it more as an attack vector like if there's a if there was a game that was bigger than axi that used nfts i would give those nfts some utility it would try to give them some utility in axi to basically take their users um so this is actually we did this with the central land in the early days where uh i s we said that everyone who owns land of decentraland can get free access and we just gave out a lot of axes to decentralized landholders and then we had the land uh sale and a lot of them ended up becoming members of the community and you know getting stakes in land which uh i think like changed a lot of lies as well so i like that my last question for you is uh a sort of a look into the future like can a traditional gaming company effectively become play to earn and try to participate in this future or is this a new future that has to be built by people that are organic on the ground play to earn or play ander i think i think that these grassroots products that are built by users i think they have advantages i also believe that there's room for traditional players to come into the space i think it really is highly dependent on the team and they're kind of you know internal chemistry i think that right like this model can be applied to a lot of games right especially where there's kind of there's rarity there's scarcity there's collectibility there's a strong community there's user generated content i think those are the ingredients that would fit well for some kind of port i think that i also i'm super bullish on all right so you're a traditional game developer you have like a pretty good game it's like a nice game in terms of mechanics but maybe like there's something off with the ip or the art i would love for them to come right just reskin the game with axey incubator and then it becomes part of our ecosystem and then they have this distribution right this is like community as a service right it's like your product has no adoption but it's a good product okay just like making an axi product and then all of a sudden you're gonna have millions of users so it was like axi infinity eating the world like maybe right where the gaming world at least to start it's like all about right the future is all about user community aggregation and distribution um right so if you have that this is what d5 protocols are learning uh that they can't do because there's no ip there's no like there's no there's very little brand loyalty uh when it's just like i don't know clicking some buttons right it has to be attached to content yeah and the way it's set up is you can have as many sub communities as you want within the axi world it's already had all right there are thousands of thousands of different guilds right these are many of the girls right they say oh like they're metaverse guilds or whatever they're all for the entire player and ecosystem but all the only thing that they're actually playing where they have live users the only you know economy that they're participating in on a daily basis is axie yeah we have a um we have a common friend this guy josh fabian runs this company um medify and it's like coaching one-on-one coaching for gamers you get coached by an expert and he was telling me recently that axi is like their number one requested thing that they want coaches to coach actually because it's so valuable people can actually go earn money doing it so then they're they're willing to pay to invest in that and so it's another example of what sounds like a good ecosystem a good opportunity for a lot of our influencers too yeah right like they're looking for you know cool ways to you know monetize their time enough yeah within the ecosystem so yeah i would love to chat with you yeah you should i'll connect you with him for sure he's phenomenal and they're about to announce a big big fundraise a bright future well thank you so much for joining us man thank you uh this was epic i mean i personally just learned a lot too so selfishly i feel much smarter on everything that uh everything that's happening in the space and i am uh i'm bullish on the future for you guys man it's so so cool yeah it's an axi world and we're just living in it exactly thank you so much thanks guys thank you hell of an episode man that was a lot of fun great conversation it's like pretty cool just how open he is about their vision and talking about the whole story around it and it's a really ambitious vision so i loved it what was your one big takeaway from it i'll give you a couple takeaways number one he started off as a community member and then became a co-founder i knew you were going to love that i was my community guy no but honestly like that that was really cool um and it just goes to show you that like you're not just joining a community like you you potentially could be joining uh something that's gonna change your life by joining one of these discords so super super cool cool to hear that and the other thing is that game domestic product is the new gross domestic product i liked that a lot too i loved talking to him about this whole infrastructure and startups and businesses that are being built adjacent to axi like they have nothing to do with it and they're all these entrepreneurial people who are attaching themselves to this fervent community and building really cool products profitable products and businesses alongside it and that to me is like a very cool framework for people in our community to think about is like when you find a fervent community it could be actually infinity players it could be harley-davidson riders what can you go build for that fervent community that matters to them and that will attach to them that can be a great profitable business there's so many opportunities out there and that was really cool to me to see and also just the next 10 years i'm really looking forward to seeing this vision that he explained actually play out and see is he right is it going to be a billion gamers worldwide doing this play to our own thing it's a big vision so i'm excited about it i had a blast i just learned a lot let us know in the discord what you think about play and earn yeah and uh and let us know if you got any play planner and game ideas yeah we want to get in there we're going to chat about it we'll bring jiho into the community after he's stoked on it he wants to invest in the in the platform too he said afterwards so we're looking forward to it let's jump in there and jam today's episode is brought to you by market or hire with

really just about surviving and taking your little idea legos or whatever you learned and molding them around but like yeah surviving another day and like making something interesting and like surviving the crucible of like that that idea maze of like i don't know if this is gonna work let's try some stuff you know dude did you see the pe ratio in chop i don't know we've we've had this discussion before right what is that 28 30 30 is that but like what does that mean actually you know like i worked in finance what does that mean what is that supposed to be like good to me or bad or like what's my reaction supposed to be to 30. all i know is that 26 is the p uh p ratio s p 500 and in the s p 500 there's a ton of value stocks so the question that i and by the way i'm not in finance so yeah but like the question i have is is basically like do i think shopify is going to outperform the s p in terms of growth like it's a growth stock like and i believe that it's going to like grow yeah so i'm like uh probably yeah we're recording by the way i think so yeah none of this is financial advice um but what like what is the bull and bear case i mean i guess the bear case that i could make for shopify would be like macro based it would be like interest rates are going to be rising inflation is terrible consumers are going to have to tighten the bootstraps all of the shopify stores that have thrived over the last two years and benefited from the fact that consumers have so much money and are flushed with cash are going to suffer because they're not and people aren't going to be spending money on like random [ __ ] that that you might buy on shopify and so like the the bear case to me is like macro consumer economy um struggles inflation's super high and people tighten their belts the bowl case is like pretty clear to me right i don't know ecommerce is going to continue eating the world shopify is like the elephant in the room um and enabling small e-commerce to work and thrive and they're going to continue to roll out feature sets that make it stickier and even better for people and toby and harley are like absolute master tacticians that um i would just put money on to win but if you believe if you're investing for the long term which you want to do like we're talking about five years or more like even if we even if it goes down another 100 200 300 bucks don't you think that it's it's in five years gonna you know be a lot worth a lot more than it is today yeah i mean this is all this is like an interesting general topic because it's like when people disagree on different investing stuff it's usually just that they're like risk tolerance or risk tolerance or time horizons are different and you don't really disagree when you like when you um align those things because like if my if my risk tolerance is super low because i'm a 65 year old person about to retire and i need this cash i might say like i don't know that this is the best bet but i'm 30 and i'm investing anything i buy right now i'm never planning to sell like i'm gonna borrow against it in the future i hope uh but i'm never gonna sell it and so yeah i'm perfectly comfortable just like you know buying more and more shopify as it goes from 640 where it is right now to like it could be at 350 and i'd still be buying on the way down right um because i believe it's going to be worth a whole lot more in the future just because i frankly because i trust and believe in toby and harley to lead a ship that's going to be doing really well but i think when you align time horizon and risk tolerance a lot of these disputes that people have around like different names and different stocks tend to just come into alignment or like go away totally agree i also think that as investors and also people we're just so focused on instant gratification that like when a stock goes down or it's not going as rising as fast as we think we're like we start to lose hope like we see it in a different light it you know what i mean yeah crypto did that to us by the way like the the idea that you like should like multiple x something very very quickly is so ludicrous outside of um you know in like mainstream finance traditionally but all of a sudden that's like what we're like desensitized to it right like a 20 gain in a year is incredible if you do it over and over and over again that's what warren buffett did he just had staying power on like 20 average annual returns but that sounds so boring to our generation to like generate 20 returns maybe in a week i want 20 returns on my like crypto portfolio but the longer term view is not one that people are familiar with the other thing that you hit on there is like everyone says they're not going to panic when stuff drops until stuff drops and then you're like you start to feel this terrible sensation in your body and you wanna sell um no matter what i mean like everyone is a steel man until they're actually put to the test on these things at which point i generally find that people just start to panic today's episode is brought to you by market or hire with marketer hire you can get expert marketers on demand it's easy and fast what's marketer hire simply put marketer hire is a marketplace for marketing talent they built a network of expert marketing professionals pre-vetted by top marketers from

danny's joining soon i think um i i saw this really funny article which i do just oh there he is look at that hair man oh wow good morning gents how are you how are you now i feel really upset that i wore a hat because now i'm like getting shown up by both of you guys in the hair game i mean 90 of the reason why i invited danny was to just show off his vibe so if you're listening to this you need it on spotify or apple like that's why you need to watch youtube this is like it's worth it just to get a glimpse of it's for danny's hair and for your headset make sure to smash that like comment subscribe button down yes smash the button right here you can check it out i don't know where the button is but it's you know on mobile but dude my uh my only face-to-face interaction with danny so far has been looking at his twitter avatar and we've somehow failed to meet in new york even though we've overlapped several times so now i'm a little shocked and thrown off because you have this like clean cut look on your twitter avatar and now you come on and you look like a flowing vibe guy like like a hobo and and and i think i don't know were you i i don't know if you want to say it out loud but there was a friend who threw a birthday party in la with one republic uh i was there i i was there too but i was also i was wearing a beanie i was wearing a beanie and uh just i was not of sound mental state me maybe it's possible uh if if if if council is watching uh i was i may not have been a sound uh state either but uh i can't confirm more than i can just say that a great time and by the way one republic one republic um when that friend of ours said that one republic was playing at the birthday i was sort of like scratching my head um i was like man one republic like i haven't heard them in a long time and one republic was freaking amazing man i thought they were so good deep catalog also i mean i i forgot that he the one republic guy on his own made all that those like edm traps the lesso like uh what's his i don't know his name i feel really bad but i was like oh you know when you hear it and you're like yeah dude i mean like he's like a writer for all these other songs so he's saying those i i thought it was amazing i was really blown away by that i was like team one republic i told the guy i was like man i don't care what anyone else says about you i think you're great do you okay you know who i i recently came across mike posner oh have you been have you been following mike posner's journey since dude no since duke he was a dude since duke oh yeah uh so i i found you know i started just following him on uh tick tock actually and he's got a crazy story so he for for people who don't know he's the i took a pill and a visa guy no he's the you're cooler than me yeah man that was the jam but way before it took a pill and it became like no it was the giga mesh the gigamesh remix of cooler than me that i remember that popped it off as like the banger anyways the guy it was banger after banger after banger this is what we're talking 2006 maybe to 2011. i want to say 2009 2009 it was around anyways i remember he blew up also this is very internet nerd stuff but like of what community he blew up on there was a place called like fratmusic.com where like kids would choose the like top playlist so like whatever compete on like the top whatever and he blew up on fratmusic.com which is like people say oh you got big on soundcloud it was like no you blew up one and like there are modern producers today that blow up with the kids on tick tock on like college fatty tick tock or whatever that like whatever that guy disco lines there's one that did like a taylor swift remix anyways getting mad nerdy is this the guy yeah is this the walking meditation exactly so so basically the i think the pinnacle of his career was i mean i don't know you know pinnacle he's he's got a bright future but he he was super super popular you know i took a pill and ibiza with avicii that was you know he he did that and then i think he got really burnt out and he was like i'm out i'm like no longer doing music i'm done which takes a lot of courage to like basically be like at the top of your game and you know being tom brady and retiring at like 23 basically and he decided to walk all across america and it and the craziest part of the story is he got his leg bitten off or something did you hear about this you gotta not hear that wait what happened by like a gator or what so some reptile like went and like ate his foot or leg okay oh [ __ ] dude i'm seeing pictures of it oh my god yeah i know it's serious rattlesnake dude rattles my rattlesnake rattlesnake and he was in the hospital and the doctors like told him basically that like i don't know if he was gonna be able to walk again or he you know shouldn't be walking uh there's like a picture of him in a wheelchair but that did not stop mike posner that did not stop it he came and he walked to the end and there's this beautiful tick tock of him like at the pacific ocean and he's like you know tears are kind of coming down uh mike posner is like the inspiration of the week for me forget one direction this is like one republic you know when i when i signed up to do today's episode and we were coming on and like danny's gonna come on we're gonna jam on different business ideas i never thought we were gonna end up sharing a picture in the chat here of mike posner's swollen rattlesnake bitten foot but i did just share that around and we will add it to the show notes that is a remarkable story um before we get too derailed oh yeah before we get too derailed uh greg you want to dive into our list here i know we have uh a few things that we wanted to uh wanted to jam through today yeah let's do it and i think uh the reason i wanted danny to come today danny tran d trin d trizzy is dt ricky tan is because he he comes from consumer social um has been you know he's one of the in my opinion don't blush turn off your your video if you're watching on youtube if danny blushes but he's one of the uh if i've got a consumer social idea i'm calling dt's my first call um he's like literally og you know number one he knows his stuff inside out when it comes to consumer social social behavior and consumer social is the equivalent of mike posner basically walking from east coast to west coast like you're gonna get your rattlesnake you're gonna lose a limb and and dt is danny's you know here to tell the story so yeah i just thought we'd talk about some ideas with danny yeah well hell yeah man thank you and i feel like that that that's that's the truth of it is like anyone's consumer social for too long it's really just about surviving and taking your little idea legos or whatever you learned and and molding them around but like yeah surviving another day and like making something interesting and like surviving the crucible of like that that idea maze of like i don't know if this is gonna work let's try some stuff you know um so thank you speaking speaking of surviving or rather not surviving can we just spend a few brief minutes to do an r.i.p of fast so i i like this this is i don't want to say my favorite cause there's a lot of employees um who are really you know harmed by this whole situation and it's really sad but the the collapse of fast is one of the most fascinating things that's happened in the last couple of years to me and i i want to just like recap it and i want to get your guys reaction so basically fast for anyone that doesn't know was one of the one-click checkout companies you know you've probably seen it recently because um our friend ryan breslow at bolt waged the uh you know the war against yc and the stripe mob that he alleged existed fast was actually the company that he claimed you know kind of got propped up by by stripe and yc to take down bolt and um fast raised like 120 million dollars or something crazy from stripe from index from addition from all these amazing players um it also had one of the most outlandish ceos i think i've ever seen personally and now as of i think it was yesterday or april 5th they um they announced that they're closing their doors they were running out of money raining ran out of money rather and literally like on friday is the last day that they're going to be open all the employees have to go find another job all you know like a bunch of the employees got hired by a firm a bunch of the engineers and the ceo released this thing saying sometimes trailblazers don't make it all the way to the mountaintop um and i just i have to check receipts on this greg because you're in this group chat where literally i think it's almost a year ago like august of last year there was this product announcement that fast did i actually have no clue what the product was that they were announcing but the ceo came in in a uh in like a stock racer car that was branded and fast came into the press conference doing like spin around [ __ ] in the in the parking lot and then got out in like a pink blazer and got up on stage with this whole like fireworks going off and [ __ ] and he came up and said this whole thing and i sent a text to our group chat saying is fasta fraud and i'm gonna i'm gonna post a picture of this because i think it's hilarious i said it's fast a fraud this has the most theranose vibes i've ever seen in my life and now i'm checking receipts on it greg i mean you caught that one as soon as i saw the news i was like sahil he definitely he got that right i mean i don't think it was a fraud by the way but like just a bad business yeah yeah i know i think uh your your spidey senses of like you know is this a real product or you know have they raised too much money is it like is this pets.com vibes was definitely on point well danny i'm curious for your take danny because um i see so first off fast is like a back end unsexy product like one click checkout should sit in a place where no one really sees it like it should blend into everything and then doing a press conference like that is like the most showy um like consumer socially type vibe and so i was like part of me the alarm bells were going off of like why are you doing this when your product should actually be seamless and in the back end with no one knowing it i feel like i get i always get really wary of just over funded hype announcements that have like details to them that have nothing to do really with the business of the announcement and i remember do you remember when airtime launched in like 2011 2012 and it was like just this cluster mess of like overspending on talent but it was like your snoop dogg and then jimmy fallon and it was almost like the title announcement actually where they got they they put everybody out on a line and you're like okay this is either going to be amazing or this is going to be like a really really tragic and so i didn't see that last year but if i imagine if i saw someone in a pink blazer get out of a car that was doing wheelies with the company logo on it i'd be like the spidey sense is dangling on oh yeah on where this is gonna go because there's nothing to do i'm sorry there's nothing to do you know then again okay maybe this is also a rest in peace with glass it's like remember when they're they're trying to launch google glass and they had two guys jump out of a weather balloon uh and like bike into moscone center it had nothing to do with google glass i think this is one excuse that people parachute and and go into moscone and you're like what does this have to do with google class at least it's like a consumer product and you can justify it as like okay hype is important but like a b2b sale of one click checkout like where is the hype necessary greg actually your friend parker klingerman uh is in that video because he was the guy that drove the car he must have gotten hired by them yeah i i saw that uh he graduated crypto college so he spent a bunch of time with him um but yeah he's uh i did see that i'm curious his take on it he's the best i mean he's the best he's a great great guy for me the lesson is um if your founder is uh is coming in to a press conference in a pink sport jacket and doing like tokyo drift style spin outs in the parking lot in like a rally car you should start polishing your resume i think yeah i think the question is like if you're a founder of a venture back startup how on a scale from like zero to fast like in terms of being like super public and super audacious and super like marketing stunt driven like where should the where do you two think uh a founder should sit i i don't know if it's my call i think one what the one asterisk worth uh putting down here is like the hindsight's 2020 right and i'm sure there have been some really crazy audacious consumer uh hype stunts that like worked out for really great products like uh like the super bowl ad for for the mac you know i'm like okay that's the craziest like one of the craziest ads of all time iconic but you're also like what does 1984 i mean okay i kind of get the message but this is over the top you know uh also the mac was it didn't work out so hot so maybe that's a bad example uh okay all i know is you know i think it comes down to the person it comes down to the founder of can they stomach it are they shameless enough to stomach it living with them for years like sam altman uh the double popped callers on stage wwdc when he did loops it was neon and neon green and neon pink i was like how are you going to be next to steve jobs in a double popped caller uh you know that's going to be etched into history you know maybe some people forget it but like most of us that have been around remember that forever and so yeah you can try to do this like revisionist like image polishing and like let enough time pass to like you know clean it up you know and become fresh it's just yeah if you're gonna go crazy uh you know just know that it's always gonna be on the record books you know uh in this case there was hot pink but also green on top of the hot pink so maybe that's the fast founder should have worn a green blazer over the uh over the pink you know they would have been fine i love it i love it well anyway i'm glad that we got to cover that because that has been uh grabbing at me for over a year now and uh hopefully those employees all land in a great place and honestly wish nothing but the best to the people that uh that were there but what a crazy situation to raise that much money and then also shows that just because you have a high valuation doesn't mean you might not go out of business literally tomorrow so what's happening to them like the are they just closed or like there's someone picking them up or like you know is there something like closing their doors on friday from what i can tell i mean it literally dropped yesterday all the news on it so i'm sure they're still developing but if you go to like the ceo's website it used to be this crazy website now it's a google doc of all of the employees names and like what that whether they're looking for work and what they were doing and stuff like that um so it seems like it's just shutting down maybe i don't know maybe the technology gets acquired by somebody but um it's pretty crazy let's um let's jump to the next step on the list man i know we have some some ideas too to uh to jam through i do want to get your guys take and greg especially yours um since we talked play to earn on the show uh quite frequently the the big news in the play to earn world over the last couple weeks was this massive hack that uh that hit axe infinity um you know two billion dollars plus in revenue that they've made over the last couple of years probably the predominant plate earned game at least the number one that people know about or hear about became huge when uh you know there was like the news article in the philippines that there were a bunch of people that were making a living wage off of it and um pretty amazing i mean massive hype cycle to danny's expertise around you know around consumer social and um they definitely wrote a massive hype wave and they've come down way off of it i mean i think daily active users are down 50 from the highs but then a week ago they get hit by i guess hack is actually a loose term here what really happened was that someone got access to the private keys that um stored the funds that existed in the like ronin bridge that was kind of between between currencies and into the game and someone took 625 million dollars worth of funds that were yeah customer funds you know like player funds and put it off into you know a bunch of a bunch of their own wallets literally just took it and it took six days for anyone to realize which is wild to me um so reactions thoughts here i mean look we're as as an industry and as a space for people to build you know we're still in the earliest earliest innings right like 10 years from now we're going to look back and be like damn that things got crazy back then huh but you know and and obviously we're in the wild west and it's like yeah if you do anything in the wild west you got to be comfortable with some growing pains and i think it's it's a little tragic because you know i think they they really blazed some pretty crazy norms and like cut like really kind of validated a space that other people were quick to laugh and brew at you know um yeah i don't know too much about the hack all i saw was that it was they they claimed it was a combo of social engineering plus they did this thing they took over the majority of the validators and then like washed away i saw something yesterday that was pretty sad which was like they only announced 150 million dollar recovery fund for the 640. that's sad which is like no like if you're going to do it you got to go one-to-one on recovery like find like in this space you can find the people to do it you know um like that's sad i hadn't seen that yet and i don't want to boo at that because look finding 620 to like is a large amount of cash to cover but it's just like you kind of lose a lot of that player loyalty and that player trust uh when you know when you get compromised you don't actually fix it you kind of say like here's 20 cents on the dollar back you know um yeah because yeah it's like you know now no player can really it's it has that like little tarnished reputation which is sad because i think you know that's such a killer team and i think it's a killer space and you only hope that people continue to build more and that players more and more players adopt it and what's sad about the hack is now everyone that ever tries this stuff is gonna be like oh but you don't you know be careful there's that one time where you lost the house you know um yeah and so it's uh it's a step back but i i i i have a lot of faith or i really like a lot about that team um and i hope they continue to go forward i think there was a point in which like more people in singapore had wallets than credit cards for axi and it's like holy like they're on to something so yeah the other thing that i saw that was interesting with it was um right after the hack happened someone took a massive short position against the um against the currency um against the ronin currency and it was like you know it didn't get discovered for six days so it was funny because someone took a massive short position so it was like are the hackers trying to like double dip assuming that um this was gonna come out and it was gonna drop but then it backfired because no one found out for six days and so the short position actually got liquidated because currency went up i mean these are some truly degenerate hackers i mean like this is like there's levels of degeneracy and it's one thing to like punch punch a man that's another to like then trade on beating that man you know like totally it's like oh god it's just like levels but i think you know did you see recently there was another wallet there was something where someone stole 150 million dollars or something and they actually created an anonymous recovery service where users could apply to get their money back if it was under 100 000 or whatever i need to find this i'm like totally blanking out what it was but i'm like the hackers these days are just getting degenerate and weirder you know which is also the space that we're in like it's it's just crazy degeneres you know um it is really hard though like now if you're these hackers i mean everyone like crypto has this reputation of being the place where like criminals go and this is like degenerates and all these hacks and stuff but it's really freaking hard for them to actually do anything with this money because you can see exactly where it came out what wallets it went to and where it is now so like they can now you know do some like elaborate laundering you know through little exchanges and tiny amounts of money but with like a 600 million dollar hat it's really hard i mean it's the equivalent of like you go steal a hundred million dollars from a bank vault and now you have a hundred million dollars of cash and you need to figure out how to use that it's not easy like it's actually quite difficult with 100 i'm looking forward like 30 years from now when when narcos on netflix is covering crypto uh and they're they're like you know we have pablo escobar now but like it's gonna be whatever it's gonna be some combo of like showing off tornado cash plus this like 17 year old at home being like i think i should take a short on this game you know and they're like oh [ __ ] like they're at dinner and they're like oh i got liquidated you know there's that great netflix documentary that just came out about the um uh about the canadian guy that had the exchange that like yeah you know was died in india uh of some like crohn's disease related thing but now people are like is he actually dead it's called trust no one it's on netflix it's actually awesome i started watching it with my wife it's so good um and it's like as wild and crazy of a story as you can imagine yeah i mean so that's uh that's the player in space yeah it's uh listen don't don't uh don't go to the wild west for uh for a spa weekend that's the lesson i mean i i think what what's exciting to me is if you look at axi i mean with all due respect to the people behind it and the folks who make that game it's it's okay game it's a you know there's a lot of stuff that is really pi that they pioneered i just hope that better games come along you know and i know there are many many more coming along and i hope that yeah that they um that they make things are interesting personally for me not my cup of tea but it's really interesting as an example to point you yeah i don't know if anything they were advancing it yeah they're working at it right like their whole plan and the road map was really to make the game more immersive over time because i do i mean they they readily acknowledge that like if the game is not an immersive playing experience it's very hard to have durable sustainable financialization within a play during game yeah and i think they know that there's really smart team um greg and i both know jiho there yeah who's great um but it's a challenge man and now this is like a new thing i personally think of all of this as like the the other edge of the return sword you know like everyone gets so excited about crypto and they're like yo i 10x my portfolio i did this and that well that doesn't come with no risk right and so every now and then you're gonna get your [ __ ] stolen or like something crazy is gonna happen that you didn't expect like that risk or that uh that return you got was not free it wasn't like you uh you know you found some world where you could get 100x plus returns with no additional risk the other piece is just expect volatility to go both ways it doesn't only go up you know i mean i mean we love up only energy but like uh like sometimes it goes to zero real fast you know and like just with the nature of literally playing in this if you play player and like you just expect things to get spicy though uh yeah that said i'm i'm a huge maxi i'm just hoping pokemon wakes up and if anyone the pokemon company is listening out there i just really hope that they get into this space because that's when that's when the fireworks start you know um let's let's talk about that for a second like if you if you were the the ceo of pokemon like what sort of what sort of ideas trends concepts would you be thinking about like what would you be doing i i got into this debate the other day with someone they're like oh you know pokemon has niantic whatever and i'm like no pokemon owns the pokemon game literally every few years they introduce a new pokemon set of games and like add another 150 pokemon to the universe like they it's almost like star wars like they they have a storytelling engine and they control the ip right and so to me it's like pokemon has been no stranger to like all kinds of experiments with like bad games like they don't have to be these crazy franchise like these crazy you know like hulk triple a quad quadruple aaa game releases like they can do a ton of experiments and i'd say like if i'm pokemon company or now i i would be fast tracking a few parallel tracking a few experiments you know like remember they made that like pokemon picture game for nintendo 64 where you hit like you could talk about snap yeah pokemon snap and you know like you know do i remember what do you mean do i remember yeah of course and then pokemon pinball on gameboy with like the actual they introduced the rumble cartridge you know and like it was like the only you know one of one rumble cartridge whatever and it's like yeah pokemon has been no stranger to like experimenting with new technologies that may go bust and they go to zero but i'm like if you're pokemon like you're sitting on some of the craziest ip like i think it's the third largest media franchise ever um don't call me on that but i think it's like they're ahead of hello kitty or but there i know i think the crazy thing is they're ahead of mickey mouse and i'm like yeah like go experiment you know um and i'm sure they are so well all i'm saying is i'm just adding more gucci out there to hope that they do it faster what do they do you guys might know this so i've never really like researched the pokemon company um and the fact that it's an independent company is interesting to me um and the fact that like disney hasn't gone and just tried to acquire it i'm actually shocked that i mean maybe now it's just too big and it'd be too much of a big swallow for them but like what are they doing greg on the ip front like we've had the discussion on the show before around um you know companies like disney and how they police their ip you know with an army of lawyers and lobbyists etc and like mickey mouse keeps coming up for um for coming into the uh into the public realm public domain and they keep changing copyright laws in america so that it doesn't reach the public domain um so there's companies on that end of the spectrum then there's this whole thing around like cco that a bunch of you know the nft projects have have pushed out and focused on like is pokemon on one end or the other of the spectrum are they like policing their ip really tightly the the pokemon company is a joint venture between pokemon i believe game freak and creatures game freaking creatures are video game development studios um nintendo also is involved there um so nintendo oh so nintendo game freak and creatures have a joint venture that oh yeah sorry exactly so they it's an interesting model um that they're basically like okay here's like three really big companies who have you know different skill sets let's come together create some like incredible ip use that ip you know in the case of nintendo use it in in you know video games but also license it license it out for movies for collectibles for xyz um from what i understand they're very uh cagey with who they license their stuff to um but they're very entrepreneurial in the sense of like like what's the relationship between um what's it called uh uh megan quinn's company yeah so what's the relationship between pokemon and the antic i mean i i don't know the exact terms but it's not like they have an exclusive i mean i'm sure they have some super forms of experience right yeah it's almost like a branch they have a branch they're just a branch of the pokemon universe you know um and like i think that's something that's been really been on my mind i know greg like it's actually something that i've been obsessed with recently is like storytelling engines and like these dynasties of storytelling which is like if you look at disney you look at like like you know having pixar lucasfilm uh marvel you know like the dynasties that like create more and more and more and like as their surface areas bounce off each other they make even more possible like i think another good example that people don't think of as a storytelling engine is like lvmh where like whenever they they're doing it right now where they're trying to rehabilitate tiffany and co and they acquired it they tried to dump it then they had to like buy it fully but if you watch what tiffany cohen is doing it's like 4d chess you know they have jay-z and beyonce rocking crazy jewels from the vault whatever it's a storytelling engine to like make it relevant and cool again you know and so i think of the pokemon company i'm like yeah like they're this this this storytelling ip universe that is endured and found all kinds of ways to come to you like not just and games not just digital games like the cards themselves are like that's its own crazy fan base that's like just out of control you know uh into it and so yeah like you know they have the ar stuff niantic you know but like you know in this in this day and age like there's so many more places that they can go you know like i grew up on the pokemon tv show you know movies the movie remember the movie where you got the the mew card that was like yeah can you talk about that like explain explain that moment explain that moment in time explain the card explain because i feel like some people there's a lot like gen z yeah and older generation watching but for us millennials that was like yeah that was monumental well it and this is the same air as harry potter but like the coolest thing about pokemon was it hit multiple surface areas at once like i literally begged my mom for a game boy color because i needed to play and it was almost like choosing a gang of like oh you chose either pokemon red or pokemon blue same game-ish but you were definitely like gang colors like i'm red or you're blue right then same time every day you're coming home from school there's the pokemon show and they would teach you the pokemon like they would show with the outline of a pokemon like who's that pokemon before the commercial break and you'd be like i think it's uh that's to be clefairy i think you know and then bam after the commercial like i got him that was clefairy you know and then the cards it was like this like status ladder of like okay can your family afford a lot of cards because if you get a holographic charizard you're basically a local warlord you're like yo i roll i roll i move differently i have a holographic charizard and then it culminated in this moment that was such a status flex by the way that was like the modern day lamborghini like if you rolled with the holographic charizard you were such a badass in your little clan you're like no prove it like if somebody can't be like prove it and they'd show it and you'd be like oh my like that kid is different that kid oh damn you know just built different you know and then it culminated in this moment though the movie came out and it was like yo okay hey and like this is like there was like they were there were 40 chests they were like if you go to this movie we'll give you the pokemon mew you know i think you know i'm gonna it's you know there's mum youtube but like maybe this crazy holographic car that looks like it's an ancient ruins you know like whatever and everyone that shows up gets it and i remember they did the the for the full court press it's like mcdonald's or burger king or whatever like you could like get the happy meals with the pokemon and it was like this thing where pokemon they told their story on every surface possible all at once and it was like it was impossible to be alive and a kid and not like know 150 pokemon which is like that's pretty crazy though you basically talk like a bunch of kids like all these all these like an entire like species you know uh so anyways yeah it goes to i mean it goes to just this like broader point of storytelling and the power of and i think brands are finally starting to realize it again like it's sort of i think like the the era of like ads and like social you know buying ads on facebook and google and all these places sort of like put um sort of put storytelling on the back burner for a while where people were like dude the arbitrage on just buying ads is insane so we're just going to say screw it and just spend money to acquire customers and it's such a good return who cares and now you can't do that and so the businesses that are thriving that are going to continue to thrive in the coming years are going to be the ones that actually have a story to tell and tell it really effectively like i saw toby from shopify tweeted out this really funny thing recently where he was like um you know it used to be that you could go type something in and like basically have no one competing against you for those ads like and google adwords and he's like now i'm pretty sure you could like smash your face into the keyboard and roll it around a little bit and have like a hundred people betting you know bidding against you on those adwords um and it's just a sign of the times but it now creates this massive opportunity for companies that storytell effectively and pokemon you bring up as an example of it i do have to shout out by the way on pokemon cards the most hilarious thing on pokemon cards is greg our friend josh fabian the founder of medify his sons are ranked like top 30 in the world at pokemon cards they're like nine and and there's no age restrictions on those things so like the kid is like top his older son is like 12 or something and he's top 50 in the world in pokemon and he goes to these competitions and like pokemon cards against like some 45 year old who clearly has like a different level of mental faculties because he's a grown man and so josh was recently at a tournament watching his son play and some guy sat down in front of his son to play him in like the championship and was like oh this should be easy and now this like 11 year old kid dismantles him it's amazing and at the end of the match like threw down the gauntlet card and literally looked at him like crossed his arms and was like guess it won't be so easy huh yeah it's so good man i want to see but one like weird like linking multiple threads of the conversation together like this is maybe my my big takeaway is that like the ability to storytell meaningfully is what separates to me the companies that endure or like especially consumers like the things that endear the things that don't like if you think about it like look at youtubers like competing on youtube like if you're mr beast or any of these people they story tell so well and they do it with persistently weekly like crazy and like if you compare that to like the fast guy doing like i'm gonna do pop wheelies and wear a pink blazer that's like a cheap story it's like like oh look at me look at me well like the story doesn't endure it doesn't really resonate it's just like this like flash in a pan you know you don't really you like you yeah it's like memorable but like it doesn't touch you you know and it's like these other things like these pokemon like youtubers whatever like the the things that really endure the ones that can do it consistently and like leave something with you you know um and so yeah i think if you look at consumer founders today like the ones that are killing it the best are the ones that are really really leaving you with something um i also i also think they uh when i think of brands like pokemon nintendo etc they do such a good job at storytelling from like an ecosystem perspective like everything kind of like uh you know a is connected to b and b is connected to c and c is connected to d and it's all like intertwined like i think like to your point around like what pokemon was doing around basically onboarding people to the game via questions and teaching them is like it wasn't like it was very deliberate so i think like deliberate storytelling um in addition to deep storytelling are like way underrated 93 of your life is spent indoors but so many of our best moments are outdoors that's why i'm so excited to share with you outer outer makes the world's most beautiful comfortable and durable outdoor furniture when i moved to new york last year and got a new place one

at marketer marketerhire.com again that's marketerhire.com and tell them sahil sent you yeah and it just has to be woven into the dna of what you're doing like if you're a company and you're growing and you're not thinking about storytelling if you have any sort of consumer facing angle you're going to struggle long term because at the end of the day you just cannot like even just like mechanically when you're starting as a company your first customers are your lowest customer acquisition cost that's like the people that you get early the true believers and over time you have to find a way that your customer acquisition cost doesn't go nuts and doesn't go through the roof and for most companies it does and they don't go out of business that's why they're not around 10 years from now because it it you get further and further away from your core and it becomes more and more challenging to acquire customers storytelling is how you cut through that and storytelling is actually how you find dynamic where your customer acquisition cost either stays flat or comes down over time yeah um you know it's like network effects with a consumer business you know similar dynamics but storytelling is so powerful for that type of thing and any company that's not thinking about it and thinking about it in the context of the community they're building and the ecosystem they're building to greg's point i would just be short the one thing i add is you know toys are like the prelude to big ideas and like you know i think a lot of folks mistake youtubers being really silly to the point about stunts being like flash in the pan i'd like to actually add like a little riff that like if you do do stunts make sure they have a story behind them that's repeatable and consistent like some of my favorite youtubers there's this guy named arak who like literally i feel like we watched go from zero to a million and his big stunt was that he could sneak into anything and so he began as a fanboy he would like sneak into logan paul fights whatever but he would keep doing it like he'd sneak into the super bowl he'd sneak into the floyd mayweather like crazier bigger and bigger bigger things like with people that followed his story are like oh my god this guy's hilarious and now he's diversified his channel and this does a lot of other stuff i like that's what his thing there's another really funny youtuber this guy gideon like one of my favorite pranksters he like has no shame and like you feel the second hand awkwardness when you watch him do these hilarious stunts but he has a storyline through it where he when people ask him for his name when he's like getting arrested or kicked out he'll be like i'm demarcus cousins and he has this video where he actually ends up like his star has blown up and like he's cool with carl anthony towns he actually meets demarcus cousins and all these kids at like a rockets game are like losing their [ __ ] watching him meet like demarcus cousins and it's like this story where you're like what you feel like you're with him even though he's like a prankster and that's doing like like flashy hilarious stuff to grab attention and so like yeah i think it's even if even if the way you tell your story is like loud pranks find a way to keep it consistent and not just like look at me i'm in a pink blazer you know uh which like doesn't really last again i don't mean to beat up on the fast guy because i think also you know great team whatever like unless unless you're maybe in like the blazer business though you know like yeah there you go that was that yeah that would be how you do it totally i mean it was kind of it was kind of a sick blazer i'll give him credit for it i wouldn't pull it off but some people can um i want to spend we've got like 15 minutes left i um i want to do a little bit of like rapid fire on a handful of ideas um so maybe we can just open it up but like random ideas we've been thinking about jamming on would love to like just kind of bat him around can i can i bring up an idea that i s an app that i hear is trending in the new york area that i'd like danny's opinion on um okay danny have you heard of a app called particle i know let's put it chat i just pulled it up too this feels like a really good like if particle turns out to be an app that you're working on this is a really beautiful segway what do you mean you haven't heard of that particle's the top app in the game greater than the tri-state area so what is it i've got the website up it's get getpartiful.com p-a-r-t-i-f-u-l a friend of mine told me about it basically um as you know people are trying to get back into events now with kovitz subsiding a little bit um and you know facebook events used to be the sort of de facto way to organize um around events um but you know gen z and millennials don't really use facebook that much there's been a thousand attempts at social events um but this particular company um which basically is a mix of kind of like a facebook type event but you can also see photos from the party too and they also have payments so they manage the payment so let's say i want to create a house party and i want to invite 50 of my friends and i want to charge 20 they handle all the payments and then people can take photos and then they can share it so it's like a group camera roll um and it's starting to take off um in like the 18 to 24 year old demographic in new york city um so curious if you think you know a what do you think about the idea b what do you think about social events is this a a big business or you know what do you think i feel like i i i'm looking at their instagram right now and it's being it's followed by a bunch of younger folks i know and so that's always a good signal i feel like it's always negative signal if you go to a company's page and it's followed by like old vcs and you're just like yeah they would like to have like a hype round going but like no kids actually [ __ ] with them you know so it's cool that like a bunch of young kids i know in new york that aren't necessarily so techy or like you know following them you know um yeah and i mean also a killer idea right it's just like what's the atomic unit like truly don't you don't need to build an app it could just be a basic website that's super that's easy to share and has to mess you know um i like the vibes on their their little uh you know on their page i i did i just hit on when you just said that atomic unit thing can you just explain what you mean by that well i think typically like look maybe this space also i like i've hacked in this space quite a bit uh of like how do you get people to hang out together in person a bunch people try to build everything right they think if i'm gonna make a party app i need to rebuild facebook pages which means a website with like sign in or like sorry like an app that like has all the stuff and like bam bam bamboo it's like no maybe what you only really need is just what will the end recipient see which you know if you're if i'm inviting you a party i'm probably doing it on on text you know if i actually like you uh you know and and so yeah it's like okay the atomic unit of what you're the the recipient is going to need here is just a link to click on you know because this other competitor is just a flat text it's like greg i'm having a party tonight here's the address can you make it which is like you know a ton of stress to manage once that party gets out of control you know um and so you know i think it's cool i i i think i've seen a bunch of folks try this where they like make really high party pages or even like really cool stories for instagram or snap to like make a really cool graphic that like has all the details on it um so i'd be like look they might be in a semi-crowded space so it's really going to come down to the network right of like literally who or like what parties are on particle you know like yeah and and if i'm them like i saw they're messing around like the dyspo energy of like disposable cameras that like they send out and mailers prepaid mailers it's cool um if i'm them i'd find a way to like maybe bankroll some really cool parties or unlock some really cool venues but but also hey look god speed to them like i'm talking like an old man who's like haggard and like just you know would not touch this space with a you know with a 20-foot pole ever again uh but but yeah i wish them all the best though so like truly i'm like good sheet of them like i hope i hope it works out there's a couple things that are interesting about it that you hit on like one it's kind of like a it's like an infrastructure rails bet on the like return to normal too like it's been so in vogue to do like remote this hybrid that like we're all gonna spend time apart we're never gonna live together and this is like the ultimate everyone's gonna be back in new york city this summer and it's gonna be lit and we're gonna you know create structure around that that enables people to go and kind of have the best experiences and then like document those incredible experiences and i generally think that's really interesting the other thing you said there at the end is like consumer social is such a graveyard um but if you do it and you win you're like a god um you know the people that have succeeded in consumer social um even on a small scale and like reached exit and had that you know number one in the app store moment it's incredible it's got to be the most incredible thing in the world have have they blown up or is it it's still like young like you got it it's actually like young non-tech new yorkers who are using it but to me like your intuition like that's a really good signal um yeah yeah the um did you guys ever read do you know sarah table um she's a benchmark um i think she's still at benchmark like an investor writer etc and she had this amazing piece on like the hype cycle in consumer which we should link to in the show notes that i thought was so good as a mental model for evaluating these things where basically if the hype cycle outpaces the kind of features and capabilities of the platform you're dead and you can almost never come back um and i'm sure you have a long list of companies you've seen where like it got so cool and everyone loved it i mean clubhouse candidly it's sort of like that where it was like so cool so much energy but it wasn't quite there yet from a product standpoint and now they have a really tall task at coming back and being cool again when everyone has already left um and so i just like i think about that constantly when i look at these consumer social businesses of like where are they on that hype cycle curve and are they building out enough so that when they do have their moment hit if they do they're ready for it and can kind of capture it and also like have that value accrue to the platform into the users and it's especially in clubhouse it's actually worth highlighting you know twitter for the first time like it gets like spaces is doing quite well you know um and it's it's cool to see cause remember like vine era like it's cool to see twitter finally be like hey like hey like we're gonna take something awesome to like apply our network effects to it and same for like i'm looking at a particle i'm like okay the switching costs like you could go like i do wonder like truly if someone said me a particle link versus another link like what's my you know you know like what's the real difference to me you know um like like a party's a party if greg's telling me there's a party i'm like well greg i'm in my guy like you know it's not like oh greg i'm only in if you house in a particle you know right like you know it's uh and so i do i do wonder like how you know uh you know how how defensible some of this stuff is but but you know godspeed yeah it has to be i mean app fatigue is very real and it has to be like incrementally multiple times as beneficial to use that new thing than it is to just do the janky equivalent with the incumbents and like it's not ten percent better it's not twenty percent better it literally has to be like multiples better in order i remember yeah i remember nicholas reichenbach i don't know if you know him but he started a company called flow water and do you know flow water is like a boxed water um publicly traded company oh yeah probably in like every whole foods and stuff like that doing really really well and he invited me it's actually really interesting he basically had the idea and then he invited like the his like smartest friends for like to brainstorm the idea which is something like is it actually i know i got invited but it was like i i shouldn't i should stand there i couldn't resist like the other guy who was there was like the president of fiji water you know and i was like i don't even know anything about water um this is many years ago and one of the things that we came out with was um and this all relate this back to particle but one of the things that uh we came out of that weekend was if we could make bottled water like walking around with like a plastic bottle of water like be a negative signal to others then flow water will win so it was all about you know that like crunchy sound like crunch um that you you do when you you know with a bottle of water yeah a lot of water it was all about like making people feel bad that that crunch existed and it was about this environmentally friendly choice that you could make with flow water and it got me thinking about like the signal that you have with all products so if you know particle if sending a particle link is a signal that like you know a certain signal then there might be longevity there you you just made me think of greg like this uh this article from last year actually almost like a year yeah literally last year about how and runyon the like the cool swag is like designer water bottles i remember reading this last year thinking this is ridiculous and then like turning it turns out like there's a little bit of truth to this piece and it's crazy to me what people buy for designer water bottle just to signal to other people like yeah i you know just ripping the charizard hologram man you gotta flex on the the consumer product i mean not to bring it all together but if they made a water bottle that had a like an original charizard in it i mean that sounds like something mischief would make that that would be kind of you know or black my favorite yeah my favorite new sweatshirt that i have is a crew neck with a large popeye the sailor man on the front like you know with his muscles and that rowing blazing growing blazers make that wonder it's um it's noah no one no no yeah noah did like a popeyes like yeah yeah they did the public collection and i was like the nostalgia effect in consumer is so real man like i want anything like that and i want to get my son's born in about a month and i was like guys can you make me a baby version of this so that i can be matching in my little popeye crew neck with my son that would be the dopest thing ever that's awesome or you could be a little can of spinach although yeah yeah that's pretty good too um guys last couple minutes um let's just do a quick rundown of takeaways um from uh from the episode i feel like we covered a lot i guess mine would be um don't wear a uh a pink blazer to to a press conference no but in all seriousness with that one you know i it's a sad story with fast it's also one where it's like if you're a b2b product company and you're kind of in the background you know match the hype cycle of what you're doing and you know the hype around what you're doing to what you need to be doing right it's like kind of an execution focused back office thing and so there's a little bit of like red flags that go off with that um what else did you guys have i think you know maybe my takeaway is the way you tell your story is everything and if you're gonna do it to be flashy do it consistently you know um and the best of the best whether or not it's pokemon uh find ways to do it and reinvent it continually and you hope that you hope they do it especially in this new era um yeah and then some of the ones that tell their story really poorly history remembers too and uh it's sad to see my other big takeaway is be like mike posner you know be that honey badger that that can walk across the nation step by step day by day and if in the reptile i don't know what happened who bit him but even if a snake gets in your way you will make it to the pacific ocean you know uh be mike poser so that's my i'm going to listen to cooler than me after this you know i think i'm gonna i got uh i've actually never heard the term storytelling engine so just you know create your storytelling engine and create your storytelling map to me is like biggest takeaway yeah i love that one actually and i thought it wove into almost everything we talked about actually the importance of storytelling as it relates to business building as and as it relates to creating durable value over the long term um so i love that dude this was awesome this was a blast thank you guys for uh for taking the time danny thank you yeah i have to have you back on for more of these yeah come back if people if people like danny as much as i like danny let us know and uh yeah just get that like and if you don't and if you don't like that exactly if you didn't like him on the show on twitter that's the best place to find him yeah yeah and if particle wants to throw any parties now that we hooked it up i'm in new york man so hit me up wait i'm in new york i'm in new orleans right now i'm flying to new york tonight we got to kick it maybe i'll send you oh it's kicking man i'm around man i'm not traveling i've got the baby due next month so i'm uh i'm around greg you have to fly and you'll go to raul link yeah this i'll look for it you know get particle dot co slash let's do it where it happens i want to thank our sponsors get if particle.com sign up today uh referral code d trend you get one one each for your party so get particle.com thank you exactly exactly right thank you guys i appreciate cause they just it you in that same old predicament misery love the company think on it prey on it sip a cup of tea

what's up man how you doing wow look at that hair holy [ __ ] that is you look amazing i heard we uh i heard we have a big guess coming on later like a tall so i figured i can use a couple extra inches yeah i mean that's like you must be six nine with that hair right now that is good tall hair it's like it's got a little bit of like a jimmy neutron johnny bravo vibe to it someone on my team actually was saying how in in remote culture because you don't know how tall everyone is everyone's constantly thinking about like how tall is everybody have you had the incident yet i've had this several times in the remote world where like you meet someone and they're dramatically different height than you expected like the the little difference is you don't notice that much but the ones where like someone you assumed was kind of short ends up being super tall or the other way it's really it actually throws you off in your first in your first in-person interaction with them yeah i actually think that's like a fun blog to create like people who sound tall but in reality are really short and vice versa it's kind of me like there's something kind of underlying me like there's a there's this friend of ours who i think you might know sieva um who i think sean poorie originally introduced me to he's amazing he's like an amazing investor business builder great great guy and we had zoomed and um you know we like vibed i really liked him a lot and then we planned to meet up and we met up like a few days later in person and the dude's like six seven or something like six six and i felt like it changed the entire power dynamic of our relationship not that i felt like i was like the dominant one or anything over the zoom but it definitely like i saw him and it was like he bear hugged me and i was like this tiny little human and i'm like 6'2 or something and i was like this little mini human um in his arms when he hugged me and i was just like this was so far and he says he constantly gets it but it was so far off what i had expected that it was pretty hilarious well it sounds like a humbling experience definitely one that i uh that i wasn't expecting um dude we have a lot to cover today um and we have an amazing guest who i'm really excited to have on it's taken a while to get him on in large part because he was playing in the super bowl uh so i'm looking

but for the listeners maybe explain what the craziness that that occurred okay so you know just to set the stage on it um tara is a stable coin ust is the ticker luna is the token that that backs it um you know when people talk about currency like crypto currencies it's a little bit of a misnomer because no one really uses bitcoin or ethereum as a as a currency today maybe in the future they will but right now both because of how tax authorities treat it and because of the volatility you wouldn't really want to pay for things in it you know you have the situation like the pizza uh the bitcoin pizza story of the guy that used bitcoin to buy a pizza now that would be worth you know whatever 100 million some absurdity so people don't really use um a lot of cryptocurrencies as currency stable coins are kind of the solution to that ust tara is one of the biggest stable coins one of the most widely used in a lot of like in korea i know a lot of ecommerce stores actually accept it as payment because it's a lower fee than what their credit card transactions cost um the feature here is that one ust can be swapped for one dollar worth of luna and that's kind of the swap mechanism between the two which as a feature maintains the stability of ust which should be sitting right at a dollar because if it drops below a dollar someone is going to come in and buy it as a way to get arbitrage they'll buy it at 98 cents and swap it for a dollar worth of luna and when that happens it buoys the demand on ust and brings it back to a dollar so it creates this kind of price stability mechanism but there's been this ongoing debate about luna uh and about tara that it's a ponzi scheme um basically that it's like this massive rug pull waiting to happen um and it's in large part around this whole like yield protocol and the overall supply and demand function within it so you have this thing called anchor where basically they're offering 20 plus percent yields on your luna you can put it into the protocol and generate this amazing yield that leads to a lot of people that are scrambling to put money into this and lock it up and it's a little bit unclear where the yield is actually coming from and so bears out in the market have consistently been saying that tara is this massive rug poll waiting to happen um luna and tara both and that it's like uh the bit connect of this crypto bull run bit connect was like this famous rug poll from back in 2017 which i actually got rug pulled in and lost uh ten thousand dollars i think uh thanks to a friend who got me into that so uh i've been paying attention to this because i think it's interesting to follow um but maybe you can explain too what you saw with this bet that just went down uh and we can chat about it in that context yeah i mean well so a couple things you want to clarify so why people use so terra is the blockchain um and then ust and luna are essentially the coins the reason why people use it is uh as many of you know processors you know visa will take two to three percent um tara takes one percent so that's the the big you know value add and the other big value at as you mentioned is the whole stablecoin sort of sort of thing yeah and there are real people using it um like i had read you know a bunch of ecommerce stores in korea which i mentioned actually accept ust because of the fee being different um people you know around the world are using it for transactions like there's actually a real life real world and crypto world use case uh for the for the tokens and there's a ton of uh there's a ton of people in the crypto community just very excited about luna our friend sean poury writes about it a lot on his on his email the milk road i first basically heard about it when my friend phil toronto um sent me a video in the morning on a saturday morning and he wrote greg i think you should get into luna you should buy some luna this is financial advice and i was like what is he talking about um and he sent me this whole deck about why luna is so is so captivating and i think that's kind of the vibe that you get from a lot of people in the crypto community is um you know this is the future so yeah so maybe you want to pull up the tweets uh yeah back and forth yeah yeah so it's like this raging debate though um to your point there's a lot of people that are super excited about it including some like big silicon valley venture firms that have backed um that have backed tara and luna and that have you know put funds into the company to kind of um continue to grow it as they continue to create real world use cases and then on the bear side there's these people that are saying it's one of the biggest rug pulls of all time and that it's a total ponzi scheme waiting to collapse um so what i saw was that in the last couple days there was a really funny back and forth that got created on twitter an account called al god trading sensei al god tweeted luna is the bit connect of this bull run printing 20 apy out their asses once apy drops and demand goes down luna will also spiral having to bail out billions of ust um and then he upped the ante basically saying i will be willing to bet a million a million dollars to anyone who is willing to take the bet with me that luna is going to be worth less a year from now than it is today um and this sparked something really interesting where one of the founders of uh tara uh dokwan who's stable quan on twitter came in and said basically okay i'm in uh he said cool i'm in and then he said that he actually would rather bet 90 percent of uh sensei al god's net worth rather than a million dollars but that he was willing to accept the million dollar bet so they actually made the bet um each one of them sent a million dollars to uh kobe who's a big uh big twitter crypto influencers wallet um and basically created a you know two million dollar escrow that is going to pay out uh one year from now depending on where the price is i think it's if it's below or above uh 89 right around where it's currently trading um someone else another anonymous crypto account actually got in on the action and came in with a 10 million dollar bet and said he wanted to make the same bet uh as sensei al god but with 10 million dollars and duquan met that bet as well and so then another 20 million dollars got sent into the same uh into the same account as uh as the first one so now there's 22 million dollars of of uh cash riding on the price of luna uh so what did you think about all this greg and where's your head on it well so you know i hope i'm pronouncing this right duquan it was a reminder to me how legendary of a founder like he's putting his money where his mouth is and he's got this reputation of really being a baller like that i don't know if you saw him you know maybe it was five or six months ago he was on cnbc or something and it was around the right did you see that video where he was on i haven't seen it now he was basically like um they were like so there's like a bunch of like us regulations that are you know potentially gonna outlaw like your business like how do you feel about that and he like looked at them and like we can put the video in the show notes but yeah he looked at them and he was like yeah i don't really care i i like i don't really care about the us basically was that was the like paraphrasing he was like it's just not not that interesting like the world is more than just the us like for this to work like i don't need it to work in the u.s and then there was this like awkward silence between the interviewer like and she was like uh so i mean the fact that he's putting his money where his mouth is was really cool that was one kind of takeaway the second takeaway is like i don't know is this a sign of like the top even though we're kind of like going down right like where people are betting 20 mil 20 plus million dollars with strangers on the internet seems wild yeah i have so many thoughts on this so first off i need to look up that video because it sounds hilarious and i love awkward interview stuff where like an interviewer gets caught off guard by someone's someone's response but my couple of thoughts on it number one you know as an investor it's funny because people get really offended uh investors get really offended when someone wants to take the other side of the trade uh but by definition in order for there to be alpha like in order for there to be significant upside to a bet there has to be someone that is betting the other direction on it like for every startup we go and invest in um you know at a 20 million dollar seed valuation there has to be people that think that that is going nowhere things that think that it's a bad idea by definition in order for there to be upside and so like i personally just think at every point in time there should be a balance trade otherwise it would just go perpetually up and it would only go up to the right and the price would go through the roof and there would be no returns to be had in that investment so on the surface level i don't really worry about this kind of thing like when people are really bullish on luna and they see this you have to believe that there are people on the other side of the trade that's actually why you're going to generate you know if you think there's a 10x return in luna that's actually the reason why because there's still people that don't believe and they're being told it's it's off the other side of me says it kind of does look like a ponzi scheme like if you're looking at it from the outside outside in i could see the case where you would think uh this looks you know suspect because basically there's this massive way above regular market apy getting printed and the yield being generated is significant there's this swap mechanism where if suddenly that yield starts to drop or if they're not able to maintain it if people start selling rather than buying luna and if you have a bunch of people swapping uh it does create this market spiral right like there is a real risk of something like that happening um and so while i don't think it's like you know a ponzi scheme in the context of like a bernie madoff where you actually had someone that never went in with a desire to build something i can see why people would worry about that kind of downward spiral that could happen if if you start to have kind of significant downward momentum it is you know the if you're luna and if you're tara if you're dokland your bullish case is that you're going to keep building real world use cases of this and if people keep needing the stablecoin and keep buying the stablecoin to use on real-world use cases not just on anchor where they can generate yield that creates significant demand right to go from here to where it's a widely used currency in the future that's a massive surge of demand and you basically never have to worry about it so his bullishness i imagine is driven by that idea that they can continue to drive real real world use cases um that will lead to you know significant long-term demand momentum yeah i think um so so have you looked at olympus dow no olympus dow was was very popular maybe four to six months ago because it gave 1100 apy um and then there was also a fork of olympus dow which was called climadow which i believe was backed i think by uh in large part by adam newman um formerly of rework and that's a basically olympus down version which is supposed to like uh you know remove carbon or buy carbon credits and that had like 40 000 api um and recently these the you know both olympus um and cli oh i know olympus for sure has gone down because i bought some has gone down like 80 or so percent maybe more um and generally i generally uh think of these things as like if it seems too good to be true it probably is um and like the whole money from nothing thing i actually think is what gives a lot of people the heebie-jeebies about the crypto and web3 world is that you're like what do you mean forty thousand percent or two thousand percent or whatever when like my savings account is generating you know point zero one percent um it like something doesn't compute and even for me intellectually i'm just like from where it's just is it just coming from new demand because that's the definition of a ponzi scheme like new money that's coming in is paying me my return that's what bitconnect was doing um from what i understand and that's how i lost money on it and so now i feel like because of that instance for me personally i'm like ultra on guard for these feels too good to be true mechanisms around uh around crypto stuff i think uh you know if you're listening to this and you're trying to figure out hey is this olympus dow or is this tara thing legit or not the way to think about it is um it's okay to actually incentivize an early stage of a network so it's you know if you think of paypal like you know we often forget but paypal started off like sign up to this there's like five or ten or fifteen dollars in your account like it was incentivized great analog on top of that they created real real value um so i think you know fast forward to today the question with tara the tara blockchain and luna is are these you know short-term incentives gonna bootstrap the network aka get a lot of people into into this um ecosystem but is there actual real value in the ecosystem like ie are there real like web 3 applications crypto applications that are being built on top of uh on top of terra such that they can basically wean themselves off of the incentives and it could be a self you know self-fulfilling flywheel that's the question with olympus dow like it was like a straight up like hey like give us money and we're gonna get you know and this none of this is financial advice but it was it was basically like give us money and we're going to give you this huge apy but there wasn't a huge ecosystem built around it versus the interesting thing with luna and tara is there is real world applications as you're saying yeah that's a brilliant analog actually you know the one you drew around paypal and i think you could apply that to any web 2 company that's been built in the last 10 years right like uber at the very beginning was offering kind of teaser rates doordash you were basically buying things for under the price of what it cost the restaurants to make because they were incentivizing early usage and you knew that it was eventually going to go away but those companies were doing it in order to create a bunch of demand acquire a bunch of customers who then get hooked on whatever it is and so to your point i think for all of these companies that are doing it in some way shape or form in the crypto world is there a real world application being built um that is going to sustain and that is going to be you know have a network effect to it where it actually creates meaningful long-term value expansion over time i think that's a great way to think about it actually you put it put it very well there i remember i remember taking an uber from santa monica in la to venice in la which is like three miles or four miles or five miles and it was a three dollar and fifty cent uber ride and it was like in a mercedes and i was like there's no way that this makes sense for the driver and it was just the vcs subsidizing yeah 100 100 and in this case it's interesting because there it was the vc subsidizing it here it's not clear who's subsidizing it like is it early users subsidizing these returns and then you're like they're benefiting from it in the appreciation of the luna price from new users that are coming in it's like a much more circular mechanism which is what at least for me intellectually it's where i get a little more challenged with it but i think coming back to is there real real world application being built um that can create real meaningful value for all new users that are coming in um is the right way to think about it it's the same with the plato and games which we've talked about in the past you know a lot of them look on the surface when you apply an analog mindset to them they look like a ponzi scheme because you have that same dynamic but is there an actual game being built in a game experience in a world being built that is creating real value for the users because if you go create an ecosystem like a fortnight where people just love playing whether or not they're making money from it that's a meaningful long-term value appreciation so i think that is a good frame of reference it's a great framework great mental model for thinking about these in future more broadly than just this one um so to close a loop on ontara luna um where are you on it which side of the bet would you take and that none of this is financial advice to your point but which side of the bet would you take i mean it's hard to bet just you know we were going back and forth on twitter today where i tweeted about how facebook groups um you know is kind of an unsung hero and they've got almost 2 million active users and and i'm kind of bullish at these prices of facebook and you responded do you remember you responded about zuck yeah i said zuck is a wartime general and i wouldn't bet against him and that's kind of my take with duke quad like he's a wartime general hard to bet against him so i'm uh i'm on the on the luna side yeah i am a small holder of luna um and i guess i would take that side too i i think i do think they're building at least from the diligence i've done on it personally i do feel like they're building something real i also one of their major investors is someone i'm very close with um who i think extremely highly of the crypto fund that invested and um i've had conversations with them and i just i believe in the long-term vision of what they're trying to build do i think they're going to be bumps along the road though and that it's going to be you know rocky along the way absolutely um so i actually don't know where i would land on the bet for one year from now but 10 years from now i like uh i like the duquan side of it i wish i wish they didn't do 12 months and yeah they did 10 years because i think you know and we've talked about this in the past where like we look at investing in crypto as like angel investments like seed stage series a angel investments where we don't see our return in seven to ten years and that's how you kind of have to think about this yeah well let's um let's bring our guest in and um and transition a little bit here because i know he's in the waiting room um and i don't want to keep him waiting because i'm nervous about

love it welcome to the show we are so happy to have you and so grateful for your time um let's just dive right into it man i mean you're a pretty remarkable person um you you are um a savant i suppose in a number of areas now um and you know i think the the two of us greg and i have gotten to know you through twitter over the last year but most people have known you for a long time due to your exploits on the football field so we'd love to just kick off with a little bit of like your lessons learned from your experience competing at such a high level as an athlete what has that taught you what are the lessons you've brought from that that are now playing out in your life as a businessman as an investor as a father yeah i would say well first and foremost it's great to talk to you guys uh it's it's been always something i know we've been trying to set up for a long time and finally getting to it so my apologies there especially during the season but overall for myself in the correlation between sports and business has really been quite similar i came into the sport of football pretty pretty green uh and found a passion in it and i was bigger and stronger than most the kids when i was younger so i had that that going for me but just having the curiosity and the want to to learn the game understand the game and really find a way to change it to where my particular play is now seen as something that is uh of greatness and for me that's just a lot of hard work uh determination finding the right team which is a little bit of luck or a lot of luck i got an amazing performance director got amazing physical therapists and naturopaths and people that have helped me along the way and i think that's where it's been able to be in the same way for me in the business side of the world i'm super curious i always loved real estate my dad and my both my mom and dad were into real estate as a young kid and my main job was to cut lawns and make sure i cleaned up all the trash around it but as i got to understand all the different nuances that went into kind of creating these different opportunities for us to go play um soccer travel soccer travel basketball all these different pieces that's where my supplemental income came from because my mom was just a teacher and my dad was self-employed so those were the different pieces that allowed me to say all right it's okay to be curious and it's okay to push yourself and not just be coined as just an athlete and that's something i pride myself on all the time i never want to be just an athlete and i really want to be more successful off the field than i was on the field how did you end up at nebraska i've been wanting to ask you this for a while because i i realized you grew up in oregon right and it's a long way from home and it's a very different climate very different environment obviously a phenomenal football program um but i'm just curious like what led to you making that jump going far away from family from friends you know out of the comfort of your of your hometown yeah truthfully it was just kind of being curious and taking that leap of faith and understanding art one everybody in portland and went to my high school they either went to oregon oregon state and i really wanted to go to oregon state but i said to myself man do i really want to just see half my classmates that i just left high school with and then meet some new people that decided to come to oregon state and i was like no not really and then my sister um who's older than me went to mississippi state she decided to go all the way to the south and so a coach at the time was her boyfriend's at the time um defensive line coach and he my sister was like you should recruit my little brother i think he's going to be good and he started to recruit me and he ended up leaving mississippi state and going to nebraska and i'd have always heard of nebraska and oklahoma that big thanksgiving game and all this different stuff and then being able to say all right bill callahan got a great coach got a good relationship can play football earlier play play early and it's a major organization and really conference in school that i could play in and play early and so that was really my excitement uh on the football side of things and i can also knock out my engineering degree which they were a top five program when i was there i think they're still probably top 10 in the engineering side of things of construction management so it was a win-win situation and it was probably one of the best decisions i've ever made in my life and it led to a lot of interesting things in your life that probably were a little bit unexpected as well i mean the football side of things i've talked to greg about this greg's not as much of a football fan as i probably was but i've talked to him about your your performance in the championship game back in college which i i still regard i think is the best defensive performance i've ever seen um that was more expected i would say the unexpected and the interesting thing is something i've read recently which is your relationship that was kind of sparked out of your time at nebraska with um a very famous investor warren buffett uh and i'd love to just hear more about that i mean it's an example to both of us of like this engineered serendipity idea we recently had matt mullenweg the founder of wordpress on and greg and he were telling and exchanging stories of that concept of like manufacturing luck um you made this jump to nebraska you were there omaha is obviously where you know buffett's kind of hometown and what he's built and you ended up sparking a relationship through that with him that has played out through your life can you talk a little bit about that relationship and what you've learned there yeah it's been an amazing relationship and one that i had never at a young age fathom i will be able to earn and really have and so it started back in my senior year and he and mr buffett came to my senior my last game he was our honorary captain and so i met him in the locker room and they they uh the front of the front office guys were like hey do you want to meet warren buffett and do you even know who he was and i was like of course i knew who he is and i mean i'd love to meet him i'm getting ready to go beat up on oklahoma but why not so uh we we met briefly and then later on that spring i was preparing to to go off and train for the combine and a friend of mine said man you should really reach out to warren buff to see if he would be a mentor of yours or just even just get a meeting and so i reached out to tom osborne who was our ad at the time and i knew they were super close and that's why he came down and was honorary captain and he said i'm happy to to make him put in the call but trust me i can't promise you if whether or not he'll meet with you and i said no problem i totally understand i can't imagine he's super super busy all the time so he did it and then uh all of a sudden i got a call back in an email and say he'd love to meet with me and i went and sat up probably about three hours before our meeting in his office just waiting and i wanted to be on time want to be more than ahead of on time and and really sat down and had an amazing conversation we we talked for at least two three hours and it was like talking to my dad which was amazing ever since then our relationship has continued to blossom and usually try and get get a hold of him or talk to him on a quarterly basis and obviously participate and go to different events that he has and that that i'm invited to especially around berkshire weekend go ahead i have a question around meeting your heroes and pinch me moments you know i'm sure you've well it's you know you've been in a lot of you know situations where you meet your hero and you have this opportunity to spend two three four hours with that person um could you share a little bit about how that feels yeah um i would probably say obviously warren is somebody i've always looked up to and have known about and seen a success uh another person that i would definitely put in that category were two people um one is michael jordan uh and then two is barack obama and barack obama was probably the most like eye-opening of saying i've kind of made it and i've never looked at myself that i've ever made it and think that i'm some sort of celebrity but when he gets off of air force one and i'm sitting in portland oregon because i'm i was a buddy of mine as a federal agent and he said hey potentially you could meet obama he's coming to portland i'm doing some of the security detail and we can have friends and family come in and sometimes he stops sometimes he doesn't and he stops and i'm right at the front of the rail and he's like in dom concert like what are you doing in portland oregon and i was like man aren't you supposed to be training somewhere right now and i was like man i'm from here uh and born and raised and we just had two three minute conversation just talking about a bunch of different things and he was like man uh we definitely have to stay connected i wanna uh i love the things that you've been doing and seeing that you've been working on especially uh on my philanthropic endeavors and so he was he was that was probably one of the most eye-opening and surprising pieces that i've seen like meeting uh a heroistic heroistic person that's such an amazing story salad i actually have eaten at the restaurant carpone which is like an italian restaurant and i went with my family one and uh you know at the table next to us was michael jordan and yes i might not be a huge sports fan but i'm a big enough sportsman to recognize greatness and and to recognize what you know the person is so i've got the utmost respect for mj and i just remember i was eating this spicy rigatoni and he was eating spicy rigatoni and the pinch me moment for me was here next to me is the greatest you know one of the greatest people in history and he is eating the same noodles i am eating and the unlock for me was you know i always kind of put these people on a pedestal but in fact they have the same that you know they're very similar and especially when you get to know a lot of these people they have insecurities they they don't have you know they're not super 100 super human in a lot of senses do you agree with that do you disagree with that no 100 i agree with that and i think jordan and being around him as much as i had been around him and being able to spend time with him he appreciates when you talk to him as a normal person and you don't put him on this huge pedestal he just wants to have interactions with you as a normal human being versus like oh my god this this and this and and making it really awkward and i think that's where like at any at any particular point in time when you come around somebody who has some sort of celebrity and is well known it's when you treat them no different than you would treat your best friend and talking to them and that's what they really appreciate versus it kind of being something else uh outside of the box and obviously you want to respect their space and time especially when they're eating and then with their families and whatnot but just keeping a cordial in in kind of like that high and by and or just like normal conversation like i really appreciate what you've done in the past and so forth and so on like that's where i've had my best interaction with people and i know i'm a little bit jaded because people don't always kind of look at me as a everyday person but that's how i look at it it is a great point that you're both making of you know these people are people that you put on these pedestals that are the most successful people in whatever field right we're talking about athletics in the context of you or michael jordan or um you know others in politics with barack obama and business with elon musk or jeff bezos a lot of these people are actually common people that have uncommon focus uncommon drive uncommon resolve determination there's like something that is uncommon about them but at the end of the day they're just people and it is a big unlock for young folks you know greg it sounds like you had you know a moment of feeling like oh wow you know there's someone sitting here that is they're just like me and i can go and accomplish great things because if i have you know and develop that same level of uncommon focus or resolve whatever it might be maybe i can go accomplish great things too there might not be something that is uniquely different about those people that i've put on this pedestal my whole life so i do think it's quite a liberating um liberating feeling when you when you realize that yeah and and the one thing i would add to that is just saying it's like the biggest thing for me to to take away from it is just saying all right i really just look at them as an everyday person and i want to learn from you and the best things about athletes and why they've been able to reach such great heights and really even people uh like you said they think differently and have different abilities to focus differently it's the ability to compensate that's what really makes people the elite they're able to compensate at different levels and higher levels that not the everyday person may be able to do that which allows them to reach other heights what do you mean by compensate there so compensating like for example you somebody may have like there's a professional athlete that i know that has like some of the worst eyes i've ever seen uh in like testing and the ability to compensate for that is what makes him elite and he's he's able to focus in on on these other areas and be more in tune to other parts of his body and that allows him to reach those different heights so that's what i'm saying that over compensation and that's what makes athletes and people that are that we see as special they're able to compensate in other areas to take them past their their inabilities because most people that's a fascinating yeah most people i love that who couldn't compensate they usually all right they just see it as a barrier and that's what it is and then i just kind of go on with my life no most folks are like all right this is in it this is something i struggle with but let me find a way to get over that hurdle and over compensate somewhere else so i can get ahead yeah said another way it's like these people have figured out what their actual unique advantage and edge is and they relentlessly exploit that and rather than like worrying about the things that they're deficient at that they're not as good at you know the challenges they have etc they sort of leave those and they just go and relentlessly and ruthlessly exploit their unique edge and whether that applies to business and people who have figured that out in business or athletics wherever it is you can go do that but you have to be you have to be strategic in figuring out what your edge is and then you have to be strategic and kind of setting the table so that you can go and and exploit that in in a you know in a deliberate manner on the field or whatever your field is as it were um i'm a boston guy so i have to ask you about this i you know grew up in boston and cheering for the patriots and tom brady um just recently announced his own retirement i guess he got sick of um of nfts and everything he was doing uh on that front maybe he's still doing it on this side but he's uh he's coming back to play another year you know you're someone now you know we've heard warren buffett you have a relationship with um you know you've been around michael jordan around um around barack obama around tom brady obviously over the last couple of seasons um what did you learn about about tom brady about how he goes about his business on a daily basis and how does that play through as a leader i i tom is a very methodical and very detail-oriented and and i have a lot of respect for that because i'm wired that same way uh he's found what's been able to work for him and uh seeing the guys that he has around him that helps him reach his heights he obviously tr has a tremendous amount of trust in them but also he's not afraid to put in that work each and every single day and so those are the different pieces that i see that influences a team and allows them to infiltrate quality locker rooms quality habits and being one of the first guys in one of the last guys out that is something that you you force upon other people especially if they want to win and obviously you weed out the folks that don't want to be uh in that particular space and going the extra mile and i think for me being able to see that at his particular age and where he could easily say like and i've been successful all my all my career and they've done this like i can kind of take a back seat and let you guys do the work he's probably one of the most hard working people and competitive people that i've been around i mean we still compete and have competed on on the practice field and i mean i enjoyed playing against him but i i'd much rather have him be on my team beyond like hardworking ambitious how important is you know meditation mindfulness to people like yourself the bradys the michael jordans and i asked because i had a session a meditation session with someone named kenji summers this week kenji told me that he learned all his zen practice from the person who taught michael jor you know was michael jordan and kobe's guy zen guy and it got me thinking that i bet a lot more professional athletes and just like elite people in general have like a zen coach than they talk about have you heard a lot of of athletes doing this sort of thing yeah there's no doubt about that and i've actually had a sports psychologist that i've worked with in the past and i think it's an amazing thing for somebody to do not only to just talk about the different things that you're going through not only in the locker room on the day-to-day basis of playing working through in your games and finding ways to ultimately create a routine that allows you to perform at the highest and i think that's the biggest thing that i took from the time that i worked with my guy and then obviously where i'm at now where i don't necessarily need him but i've been able to keep those same principles and work through those different pieces as i'm older and i can kind of self monitor my things and see how i want to work through those it's kind of the simple case of a db saying all right you got to figure forget about that last pass that was just thrown on you and move on to the next one but let's revisit it when we get on the sideline and understand what mistakes we've made and i think additionally for me like one of the things i love being able to do is saying all right i'm i go into the season i understand where our schedule is i understand where our breaks are and where we have different pieces and where i can find times to find additional gains and then also mapping out how i'll prepare for a monday night game a thursday night game a sunday night game a one o'clock game or a four o'clock game there's so many different tools and setups that i have getting ready for each and every single different nuance as i'm going to season and that's where i think being sharp in your mental state and being prepared when something's thrown at you that's you can't you're not expecting whether it's in game or out of game or throughout the week it allows you to stay that much more sharper because your mental focus was already dialed in so when something else got thrown into your way it's easy to navigate through that particular piece i had a founder describe it to me recently like the power of meditation for founders for business people as um reducing the amplitude like meditational as you reduce the amplitude and he was talking about it you know in the context of a wave like you have you know a big amplitude it's like these wild swings from high to low and you have these high high moments and then these super low lows and that meditation has allowed him to reduce the amplitude so that he never gets too high he never gets too low around things he's able to keep that even keel so important for athletes i mean i remember it from back in my baseball days like you give up a home run you have to forget about it and get the next guy out because otherwise you're [ __ ] out of luck you're going to be dead i think it's a really really powerful concept and a great takeaway that a lot of athletes are doing that um talk a little bit about competitiveness and what it what it means to you and what it's meant to you during your career i mean you're you're somebody who for a lot a lot of your career um you know you were known as like a mean guy on the field and now having gotten to know you personally and seeing the way that you write how eloquently you share and educate on twitter um it just strikes me that like my perception of you from what i knew on the field 10 years ago is very different from the person you know i think you really are um you know off the field so talk a little bit about competitiveness competing and and what that's meant to you during your career yeah for me and my career being super competitive at everything i do whether it's playing spike ball in the off season with my my training mates or going and playing tag all these different pieces are playing on the football field like i want to win at all times and i think people fail to realize that for me to be successful at my job it's to piss you off if you're a fan of that offense so you being a boston fan and a patriot fan like i'm supposed to make you upset because i keep hitting your quarterback i keep knocking down your running back i'm in the backfield all the time and i'm not supposed to be a well-liked guy and i i embrace that i actually enjoy playing on the road and hear people booing and saying like man we like we hate you like going to raider stadium back in the day and then throwing stuff and doing all this stuff that riled me up like let's go like i'm gonna get after your quarterback and we're gonna uh go have some fun and you're gonna have to say i'm oh i'm sorry like yeah we lost we can't talk we can't talk anymore trash so i think people fail to unders to really realize those different pieces and like that's where my mindset is most of the time when i'm on the football field but when i'm off the football field like i'm normally an introvert keep to myself hang with my close family and friends and obviously i've grown out of that to a lot of respects to get to know people and being curious and understanding the world and obviously the platform of the nfl has opened up a ton of doors so but i'm not the same person that i'm on the football field when i'm off the field yeah it's like this idea um that i think you've taught me of like if i'm competing against you you're actually not supposed to like me yeah you're gonna hate your life during that day when i'm competing against you i thought it was so funny this past year i think it was in the nfc championship game uh when you guys were playing the rams and um early in the game you know matthew stafford who was previously your teammate i'm sure loved you know playing with you because you know he had you on his side uh attacking the other team you had kind of an interaction with him at the beginning of the game and it was like this fiery interaction and moment it was that exact example of like you might have liked me when we were teammates now we're competing against each other you're going to have a tough day you're not going to like playing against me today um i love that i mean like it really fired me up watching it um but it was a very specific example of that exact thing like i'm gonna i'm out here to compete i'm not out here to make friends yeah there's there's no doubt about that i mean between the white lines unless you're wearing the same color jersey as me we are not friends and i've had plenty of friends that are quarterbacks as well as uh running backs that i've had to hit and have enjoyed hitting them and taking them down like one of the best ones is uh my boy stephen jackson when he was still playing in the league like i got interception and he tried to take me out and i was like yo i respect you for that because like we're yeah we're friends and we're super cool off the field but like it's a whole different ball game uh when between the white lines we're gonna have to find a clip of that we're gonna put in the show notes a clip of that and then also there's this iconic picture of you um arm wrestling warren buffett that i feel like i've seen a few times that we gotta throw into the show notes because it's amazing yeah that's so so good that was a while ago uh i think we were doing um a segment on cnbc with becky quick that we we had a little fun uh with arm wrestling he always he always challenges me and that i think that was like the third or fourth time that he challenged me to an arm wrestling challenge so always always fun times around him it's good that he keeps coming back for more after uh after every defeat relentless mindset i suppose for someone like that um i have a question for you related to competitiveness on the field business which is a form of uh is a game is a sport when people say business isn't personal do you agree with that or do you disagree with that i i agree to disagree um because i think you have personal relationships and you want to work with people and i always say i want to be on the same side of the table as my close friends and family and but if one happened to not be i'm going my mindset is to do what's best and i have the fiduciary responsibility to do that for not only myself and family but also the investors and people that i work with and so that's where i think it's not personal uh even though it may be we have to take kind of that context of saying artwork depending on what the situation is yes we have a friendship but i can't i can't give you the friends of family deal when it's it's not beneficial to the overall best of the company and so that's where i think it's when you can have that concept and it really just depends on every particular situation that you're getting into and what what the topic may be at hand yeah i feel like it would it the phrase itself came up as like a cop-out right greg is like you know people would say like oh it's not personal it's business man like i'm screw you over here but like hey it's not personal it's business like i feel like that's where the phrase came from i'm not about screwing people over it's yeah i know you're not yeah no there's no problem you're an integrity guy right like you i mean i i what i've come to know about you as i've spent more time with you and read all your work and we've interacted a lot obviously and we're working together on some things which is great um you're i mean you're of the utmost high integrity that that i've seen and i've come to really admire that about you in particular is just i feel like what you know what you see is what you get and you're going to you're going to kind of play everything above board and you're a competitor and you want to win which i love and so you're going to make decisions that you feel like put you in a position to win no but those are the kind of people you want to work with no and i definitely appreciate it i think that the simple way to put it is that you may not like me but you'll respect my decisions at the end of the day and you'll respect how i i my thought process it'll be very crystal clear i want to be super transparent about it at the same time just so you understand like where i'm coming from and why i'm making a particular decision if even though it may not be in favor for something that you want yeah you you might be friends with warren buffett but you're probably not going to let him win the arm wrestle [Laughter] it's not like you're going to like you know the people listening i'm kind of like really throwing you know the arm down you're not gonna like do it super hard it's like hey you i know we have a little bit of the age yeah we have a little bit of an age different in a little bit different size and biceps but i'll take it down slow yeah i mean but even he like he's a perfect example of this fact right because he's a very nice cordial warm-hearted person you've had this experience with him yeah but this past week he did a deal for allegheny and he structured the deal and he said i'm not paying bankers a dime in this deal and he cut the deal price by a certain amount because he said i am not paying goldman sachs a dime on this transaction so there you know there's a lesson in there too right like he's a businessman but he is ruthless when he needs to be to you know drive his fiduciary responsibility and and create value for his shareholders so um a lot of lessons to be taken from from that type of mentality on life before we lose you i know we're running up right against the end of time um i have to ask because i've seen now the photos of your um your two little twin guys um you're a recent father i'm about to be a first-time father i've got a little guy due in about a month any lessons or advice for uh for an expecting dad on what you've learned from the experience patience uh make sure you love your wife to death and all the things that she's going through like just be there as a supporting hand i think for my wife i've always seen it as a standpoint of me being really a center i got to control the traffic i got to be the protector i got to do all the different particular pieces for her and really just whatever and she needs at her beck and call and i mean our boys are going to be a year on saturday so uh it is a lot of patience and and really try and get on a routine as early as you can i think that's one of the best things and the kids love it because people say yes they control your schedule and it's true they definitely control your schedule especially early on until they start getting to a level where they go down for consistent naps and different things like that and but they also love that routine and it's a matter of like i know in the evenings like when it's five six o'clock and we haven't gotten them to get down for dinner and haven't started the bedtime routine like they start to let us know like hey it's time to to put me down like and if you don't do it i'm gonna i'm gonna do it myself and go yelling and screaming until you help me get it done i think i've got a lot to learn sometimes i think you can't figure these things out from reading a book you're getting advice from people you just got to get into it it's like like a lot of different things in life so um man thank you so much for taking the time with us i know your schedule is crazy with training and everything you're preparing good luck with all of the training and contracts and everything that's upcoming this off season

hugo labs then had this like slew of value that was created for the initial kind of mentors and owners of board api club i saw a tweet yesterday that just said if you bought and hold a single board ape from that initial mint which was .08 eth 230 dollars at the time you would have gotten one ape which is now a floor of 93 each 263 thousand dollars one mutant tape because that was the spinoff project you got access that's a floor of 19 eth one kennel club ape which is 7.2 eth and now the ape coin that they airdropped to all ape owners uh you would have gotten 13 848 ape coins which is worth around 200 000 so the 230 dollar initial mint to get the first board ape that you got would now be worth well north of five hundred thousand dollars and that's the worst case scenario right that is the worst that is the floor the floor so it's totally possible that you meant something rare and it's like a gold ape and you're sitting on two million dollars this has to go down by the way is one of my worst investment misses of my life at this point now that i'm looking at it because i had friends who talked i don't think i would have gotten in the initial mint but i could have bought one at like you know i don't know probably one eighth realistically um at the time i think you talked about it i shared it in the group chat yeah and i just i at the time i didn't know what an nft was i didn't have time to think about it but completely whiffed [Music]

embarrassed for you because it's so high just look at the product like you said there's no way to not offend you with the answer here because either i go high and you're like oh it was am i that rich haircut guy or i go or i go low and you're like does it look bad um 80 bucks 18 canadian dollars wow 13 us dollars oh no haircut inflation in in in canada these days huh nice yeah nice i dude i i i still i think i pay 65 for a haircut which feels high but you kind of get like a whole experience out of it like i get you get a like shoulder massage you get the like warm towel finish and stuff so it's a little bit of like it's almost like a spa day that you're paying for um and i don't know i like to treat myself with it it's one of my guilty pleasures totally well what do you got what do you want to talk about today oh man well we have an awesome guest coming on ryan wyatt who is sort of a microcosm of this whole like web 2 to web 3 shift in transition i mean he's a web 2 senior senior executive at google youtube he was the head of gaming and now has like fully red pilled and joined uh polygon studios as ceo so we have him on and given that fact i feel like a good lead in as we have to talk about some cool web 3 [ __ ] that's been happening and one of the latest which i wanted to just pick your brain on was around this whole hugo labs acquisition of uh the larval labs ip so yugo labs being the board api club's creators um acquired the ip of crypto punks and me bits which are under the larval labs umbrella and um i want to talk about that and then i also want to talk about stripe stripe crypto because that's a big deal so which one do you want to uh which one do you want to start on let's start with stripe okay so for people who aren't familiar stripe um i mean massive behemoth right now like i actually recently got an opportunity to invest in a secondary sale at stripe which you and i and others in our friend group have been joking about for a while was like something we were trying to do but the most recent valuation i saw was like 215 billion dollars um so i i passed on it personally i'm probably going to be an idiot for passing on it but the old like this has to become a trillion dollar company for me to get any sort of good return on it just not for me personally um so it's a massive like payments behemoth um they're kind of like the rails the infrastructure rails of payments globally their whole mission is they're going to expand the gdp of the internet um which i really like they're an amazing founding team um but recently they rolled out and entered into crypto and they did it in pretty prototypical stripe fashion which was they didn't roll out one tiny feature or feature set and say like hey we're in crypto they kind of threw the whole [ __ ] thing at you and went into everything and it was a big deal i mean they rolled out um everything from like kyc exchanges wallet enablement to um you know all of the kind of fiat to crypto on-ramps basically full support for crypto businesses so i'm curious what your thoughts are on it and what it means for the space i mean so when i first saw it i was well first of all pleasantly surprised uh what it means for the space is like i mean it's huge for the space like stripe 200 billion dollar company basically giving these sets of apis is like you know a huge stamp of approval for like so many big companies so love that it's like the equivalent of um shopify doing shopify nfts um and them going into that so i i i feel really good about that i also remember a time when stripe okay straight this is not the first time that stripe has gone into crypto okay stripe has gone into crypto i think it was initially with bitcoin in 2012 and then again in 2014 i believe and then i think they shut it down maybe in 16. um like the tldr in it was uh the fam the ceo i think his name is john collison is that his name uh patrick collinson's the ceo his brother they're they're brothers patrick and john i don't know what john's title is at the company patrick's kind of the face of the company i think i remember john saying like when they shut it down that we're just like not ready for it like it's just it's too early we tried we like experiment and it's too early interesting yeah and in 20 i want to say 19 or 20 there was a bunch of job postings on the stripe website basically alluding to the fact that they were hiring a massive crypto team i remember this that had to be like 20 mid late 20 when that was happening because you and i were already friends at that point i remember us all texting about it exactly so interesting what i love about it is they like dabbled a few times they they they cut it short and then they were like okay 20 20 hits it's here we believe in it we understand it we're going like we're gonna build the swiss army knife for crypto and we're going like all in um i just hope that we don't find ourselves in 12 months from now 18 months from now and they're just like we tried it and we're not gonna you know support it yeah yeah it's interesting i mean the the industrial logic behind it is very strong for them you know they probably saw what a lot of us have seen that the number of businesses building on web 3 rails or building crypto native rails has like 10x or you know there was some stat like the number of developers the number like however you look at it it's massively massively scaled and they are probably looking at it as both defensive and offensive move right they don't want someone to come in and be the like stripe of crypto and come in and build a better set of rails and infrastructure that kind of push them out from what could be a massive burgeoning market so that's kind of the defensive side and then the offensive side says um you know we we can go out and actually expand the space and be a huge driver of new companies you know with actual fiat on-ramps today and companies that have built in the fiat web 2 world coming into web3 and actually drive you know to their point on the expansion of gdp on the internet internet the the core mission statement for the company they can actually help promote that within the crypto world and so like i think of an example i heard it i think it was on the bankless podcast they talked about um they use sub stack for their newsletter or convertkit rather you know for a lot of people like i'm going to be switching over to convertkit soon for my newsletter and the rails of that for any payments or are stripe um that's what you're collecting payment through stripe had previously never enabled crypto payments and so you know i have plenty of friends that are doing crypto newsletters writing about crypto um and they want to be able to collect you know in crypto right like there are people that are subscribers that want to be able to pay in crypto and that was never enabled through sub stack convertkit anywhere but now with stripe offering all of these new crypto features these traditionally web 2 business models actually have an opportunity to now integrate with more web3 features which becomes more inclusive it you know you're going to capture more customers there's new growth opportunities new levers all of this stuff that suddenly becomes becomes open so i think it's a really interesting step forward it's also just an example of stripe being just maniacal in terms of their execution like what what they rolled out here in one fell swoop was super super impressive and i think there's more to come on that same bankless podcast when they talked about it they were saying that they tried to get the head of stripe crypto um to come on the show and um he or she delayed it because they said there was more coming and so they wanted to come come on the show after that all got rolled out so i thought it was super interesting and clearly more to come from them on it yeah i think when i think of stripe i think of just like flawless product execution like everything about about them is just like so well done you go to their website you go to stripe atlas like you know the animations are amazing so you just know that if they're coming out with a product it's going to be amazing they feel kind of like the apple of payments yeah when when i think of paypal i think of like old guard clunkies or interface um 90s and on paypal you can send you know buy and buy crypto right and send crypto so it was kind of wild that paypal was quote unquote ahead of of stripe in in 2019 or 2020 when they launched it that's a great analogy too because i do think like everyone's heard of the paypal mafia you know you had like elon musk peter thiel all these guys that that came out um of paypal uh i think the stripe mafia is probably like the today equivalent of that like if you look 10 years into the future stripe engineers that leave and are starting their next thing you're lucky if you can get in under like a 50 post money valuation into those companies because they're in such high demand because that system is just breeding this unbelievable product design product management focus um driving things forward and this is an example of that executing so um that's a great one super excited to see what comes from them let's uh before we before we run out of time before ryan gets on here um let's talk about uh yuga and larval labs yeah i mean that was that was huge yeah i think like it was huge on so many levels like the fact that the two you know behemoths in this space became one overnight was just is just so big and there's just so many downstream effects of that happening like people didn't know what was going to happen and yeah people don't know what's going to happen and just to set the stage on it hugo labs is the creator of board api club um which i think they meant it originally in like what march 2021 or april 2021 um april first actually something like that yeah okay okay um and it was you know it was a it was a big deal at the time people that were real observers of the space realized there was something different that they were doing it was kind of one of the first like uh of the 2021 rush of pfp projects and like something different that kind of got you unique access uh community etc um yugo labs then had this like slew of value that was created for the initial kind of mentors and owners of board api club i saw a tweet yesterday that just said if you bought and hold a single board ape from that initial mint which was .08 eth 230 at the time you would have gotten one ape which is now a floor of 93 each 263 thousand dollars one mutant tape because that was the spinoff project you got access that's a floor of 19 eth one kennel club ape which is 7.2 eth and now the ape coin that they airdrop to all ape owners uh you would have gotten 13 848 ape coins which is worth around 200 000 so the 230 initial mint to get the first board ape that you got would now be worth well north of 500 000 and that's the worst case scenario right that is the worst that is the floor the floor so it's totally possible that you meant something rare and it's like a gold ape and you're sitting on two million dollars this has to go down by the way is one of my worst investment misses of my life at this point now that i'm looking at it because i had friends who talked i don't think i would have gotten in the initial mint but i could have bought one at like you know i don't know probably one eighth realistically um at the time i think you talked about it i shared it yeah and i just i at the time i didn't know what an nft was i didn't have time to think about it but completely whiffed um so i'm pretty embarrassed looking at it but the the point with this acquisition that was interesting beyond just you know this incredible growth of the board ape ecosystem was i think this ip thing which which we've discussed in the past um in the context of disney and and old world versus new world and there's a little bit of that happening here yugo labs has been um from a commercial standpoint much more open with the ip so any board ape owner if you own a board ape um you actually own the commercial rights to that ape meaning if you want to put your board ape in a tv show or in a movie or in some art you own that and the value comes to you you actually accrue the value that your board ape might create in that world crypto punx which was a larva labs product didn't have that the ip was still owned by larva labs so if you owned a punk which is really the like first pfp you know amazing pfp project the commercial rights to that are actually still owned by larva labs and so in this acquisition the big deal i thought was that hugo labs acquired all of the ip from larva labs around both crypto punks and me bits another project and then actually gave all the commercial rights to the holders of the punks um to the holders of those assets and so suddenly it was like you took this old world strategy which is a little confusing to me that crypto punks had in the first place and it actually just gets brought into the new world where everything is all of a sudden open and you own the commercial rights if you own a punk i try to comment on that piece the end piece what would have been the only thing that would have made that more badass would have been if they gave uh all punk holders cco which we've talked about on the pod before public domain where all of all of the punks are now in the public domain and and basically people if anyone wants to print a t-shirt with on it they could um and that's not just to clarify so cco um is different from what yooka labs does right so like they uh board apes are not cco technically right like i can't um sell a t-shirt with your board ape on it right now that's right and and that's why and this isn't financial advice but that's this is like why i'm so bullish on cco like i actually think that like the next generation of big pfp projects and big nft projects are going to be cco so that's the one thing i would have changed well let me push back on you there because because i think this is an interesting actual point of debate so so with cco i guess i totally agree with you that cco is part of the future if the like brand level continues to benefit from it so like if crypto punks went cco and everyone's allowed to put punks on billboards and everywhere and it doesn't matter it's public domain you can use it in artwork etc the broader punk ecosystem i think benefits from it but my punk that i own i'm not actually getting any value from that maybe i am indirectly i suppose through the like ecosystem growing but my punk someone's just using it and showing it everywhere so like the um the provenance i feel like might get deluded in my in my mind versus what this is which is like i can commercially sell and use my individual pumpkin so if i want to go get t-shirts made and sell them with my punk on it i have the right to do that but at the broader level no one else can use it so i guess i'm wrestling with like it's a broader it's a broader play and a broader perspective on what kind of value expansion and value looks like in this cco world when people explain nfts to people who don't get nfts the example that most people use is the mona lisa example and i think you've used that example in the past where you say like you know yes i can go and take a picture of the mona lisa and i can go print uh a print of it and put on my wall but there's only one mona lisa in the louvre in paris france it's the bullish case for cco says uh a very similar thing which is you can go and print as many crypto punks let's say it is cco you can go and print it everywhere and the idea is that the more people the more people see the meme the better it is and the value accrues to the whole project that as a whole very much so um that's actually great i'm changing my mind on it in real time as you're explaining it actually because um if you say that like being part of this community so say it's board apes um being part of this community has value uh right now you know maybe there's 10 million people in the world i don't know pick up a number that that understand board apes and the value of it you go cco with it suddenly board apes are in movies there's a comic show there's um content being created around it there's billboards there's events whatever you actually owning one and having the provenance of the single one that you own still gets you access to that community but suddenly that community has a lot more prestige around it because it's everywhere everyone is seeing the logos the images all the pictures all over the world and so suddenly you being a part of that community actually has more value than before because it's being so broadly memed and disseminated um so that actually is starting to click for me a little bit more yeah so to use that analogy of like the board apes movie for example like maybe it's yeah anyone can go and create a board board apes movie but there's incentives for the people creating uh let's say it's you know um mr tarantino who wants to go and create a board 8 movie i don't know if he would but let's just say he would and he has incentive to go work with the board ape community to get them involved because they have all the culture and buying and stuff like that so maybe every board ape holder is an executive producer of that film yeah it um it's starting to click for me a lot more it also kind of continues to speak to me about like what we talked about with gary vee um on the show when he was on i don't know when that was two months ago um about how most nft projects are going to go to zero and that there's a lot of downside pressure in all of them and it sort of makes sense right like 99 of movies go nowhere and make no money 99 of songs uh get zero listens right like the top point zero one percent of singers on spotify actually get any meaningful revenue from it and so i just think that's kind of the same right like it's the analog here is that 99 of these art projects are going to be worth nothing and zero and that's fine there's actually nothing wrong with that but for these ones that are end up being the premium you know premiere projects um there's going to be massive massive value created in the same way that like you know there were probably a million things that were created at the same time as star wars but only one of them ended up being star wars and george lucas is a billionaire because of it um so that's kind of how i'm starting to think about this space as i've like personally wrestled with it over time well i i'm glad you're coming along a little bit there um i don't necessarily sorry just to add one more point that doesn't necessarily make me like an investor in the space because um it speaks to the point that like i don't really understand what makes these projects um you know winners versus not i rely on smart friends like if you send a thing again and you say hey this looks really interesting it's an interesting project i'm probably gonna go like buy one of those things because i'm not doing the board ape thing again and actually that did happen with like cryptos that you tipped me off to that i ended up making some money on not this kind of money but um that's an example of it for sure and that's a great example because cryptos is cco and one of the reasons you were seeing it everywhere was because it is cco ah interesting yeah so it all comes full circle the last thing on the board apes thing and the you know you collapsing i think i'm sorry the eucalapsing and larval labs thing is you know money this is this is gonna you know go down as like the google you know buying youtube moment or the facebook buying instagram moment um you know it's just going to be such a pivotal time in nft history and i think that also coincided with the leaking of i don't know if you saw but they leaked or someone leaked the hugo labs fundraising deck it's like 95. um which i encourage everyone to go check out and it basically outlines what their whole strategy is what they're going to do with apecoin which is what which is what they dropped which is the in-game currency um with what they're going to do with virtual land they're going to sell like a cup you know i forget i forget how many but thousands of uh virtual land pieces um and what their profit margin is which is something crazy like 98 profit margin fascinating i got to pull this up we should add it to the show notes when this drops um super super interesting i think we've got ryan in the waiting room so let's uh let's bring him in and dive into uh to more of this stuff there he is what up guys what's up how you doing how you doing man i'm doing well thanks for asking how about yourself doing great we just had a full conversation with your chair that was a lot of fun

exciting than me so hopefully you're ready for this uh i would yeah i'd push back against that we'll find out though i guess yeah yeah if this ever gets uploaded we'll know real quick 93 of your life

we wanted to dig in dig into with you um would love to just start with you know you are someone who if i track your career and some of the things you've done it strikes me that you've consistently been out in front and kind of on the frontier of things you've like been been one of these people that has you're going to call it luck but like this special ability to see into the future and i think the first iteration of that was with you know your role at google and youtube and gaming and kind of um esports streaming it wasn't really a thing when you when you joined so we'd love to just hear about like what called you to that how did you land there and what were some of the things you saw happening um that led to you making that jump do you want to do you want a rather long-winded explanation to some of that that provide content yeah as long as long as you uh as you see fit i love it okay so um what happened for me was um i was playing when i was in high school i played uh counter-strike competitively and i really liked that and i wasn't really good at it but i was still playing in like tournaments and really going down that that rabbit hole and that was very early days so this is let's say 2002 3 right like very early counter-strike was kind of still in its infancy but half-life had taken off the mods had taken off i i also played baseball in high school so i had this huge like deep love for sports competitively yes love that and um um gaming right and so i was like wow esports like this is a cool world i'm like it's kind of all the stuff that i love that intertwine and so after the introduction of that um i kind of like always became very enamored with with uh you know games being played at a higher level um when i was like yeah go ahead can we just talk about that moment for a little bit i confess as well i was a counter-strike you know esports player i participated in the world cyber games in 2000 oh nice yes um and i you know played uh cal premiere do you remember that yeah so cpo cal days were the best they're the best right so i know 99.9 percent of our listeners don't know what we're talking about but i want to talk about esports back then and how wild west it was and and and how you know because how i got into communities and internet communities was through you know irc yeah you know websites like got frag.com internet communities like that so i i think like tell that story because no one you know no one talks about it no that's funny greg like uh it's even nostalgic you even bringing things up uh like some of those like sub communities back then um yeah i mean basically what happened for me i got really into uh the different mods like team fortress classic and then counter-strike and then just started searching where people were coming together and so the cpl um obviously that's where players were playing at the highest level and i was not playing in that right um and that's where some legends like you know fatality come from where the cpl and wcg were really big and it was really the the dawn of uh pc esports in the united states of america right like you had already seen it you know happening with starcraft and south korea and so forth so it's really kind of coming to western english-speaking markets um and you know counter-strike and quake and a lot of these other big games are really starting to crack the surface here um and so for me i was like this is so cool right like look at this like people are filling out ballrooms they're playing video games for money i mean it was just like what a crazy experience and so you know as like a 14 15 year old you know i'm like oh yeah i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna be one of those guys one day right um and so i have you know you start in cal which was basically the cyber amateur league this they already have this great system on like how you could kind of go through the funnel as a you could be a terrible player and start in the open league find your rhythm find teams find organizations find community right and just find people that you want to play with and get along well as same skill level and then as you went through these tournament brackets you could go into like cali which was invitational and so forth ultimately leading to like what the what you know the top one percent of the one percent which were the ones that were playing in the tournaments so this is just my like i got introduced to this whole world you could watch the broadcast on half-life tv right so they basically would allow you to kind of like queue up as a spectator in the game and watch the game through the client which was like yeah i mean you're really starting to get into the like oh now you're broadcasting and watching other people you know you'd have like 100 people fill a room and watch it uh but it was just like it was really really cool times and cool experience and and you really saw the the the groundwork being laid for what the future inevitably would be of just watching people play video games but it actually ironically started with the most hardcore niche part of what the gaming video industry is which is hardcore competitive esports it actually represents a very very small amount of the total percentage of gaming watch time when you think about it but it is now the most premium and upper echelon and so it gets a lot of praise but um yeah i kind of went in at a very like in that way my take uh my take is like if you want to see the future go to silicon valley but if you want to see the future also go check out what hardcore esports gamers are doing yeah that's like my background yeah silicon valley is overrated now man going to silicon valley i don't know allows you to uh to see if you i think there's probably more of the future in like discord servers um than you can find in actually on the ground in silicon valley these days i think that's right and i don't think that's a bad thing either i think that's just like the natural maturation of silicon valley that now has become so big right you know if you look at like 20 years past right you work there because it's on the cutting edge we don't know what the internet's going to look like these are the companies that are pushing it forward and they did right like you know when i when i even joined youtube like eight years ago it was you know 500 million users it was so big it wasn't two billion plus now right and so you do get to a certain point where it's like you know um i don't necessarily know that big tech is or should be responsible for the next iteration of innovation right i think it will i think it goes back full circle and belongs to the community much like you think about how silicon valley started in a lot of ways so i think it's an exciting part of the the loop right now yeah i agree with all that i mean i think like bellagi um who we all know and i'm sure have read you know his his various writings or tweets or whatever it was i think he was the first one i saw say that like the next silicon valley is going to be in the cloud uh and i thought that that was just like a very short punchy way of saying it that like you know opportunity is no longer geographically confined and it's been distributed and a lot of technology now is following that same path right where like a kid born wherever has the same access to things as someone born in silicon valley or in you know palo alto or wherever it is so i i agree with you that i think it's a great thing um you know it more evenly spreads opportunity at a minimum um and at a maximum it opens up a lot of collaboration that previously never existed as well yeah i agree honestly i think the best part about all of it is like the democratization of the tech because now everybody can get involved and i mean i think that's like a fun part about being polygon like we're already so global and the company started in india right and was able to get to the size that it did and that's um you know that's incredibly impressive and now you you see talent you know our our teams are distributed globally we're working remote and obviously we get to see each other you know at all these events because there's no shortage of uh crypto blockchain gaming events uh but yeah i agree i think there's a lot of good in that can we actually talk about that polygon founding story for a minute um i read a thread that i found on twitter recently um about the about one of the founders um uh jainty uh jante kanani and it was you know this whole breakdown basically of like it was the son of a diamond factory worker and gujarat founds an 11 billion crypto startup it's a pretty amazing and inspiring story um and it's a great microcosm of exactly what you just said of like this global collaboration and the ability to interact with people all over the world and go build something you know like builders just being able to build and not being confined to your geography or to your set of circumstances um any thoughts from like having now worked with this team um or kind of takeaways from that that um you know that have played through and how you're thinking about the future oh i mean i look the the founding team played a huge factor on joining polygon i mean the biggest thing i could say is like i just really you know i um i kind of always operated with a chip on my shoulder sometimes warranted sometimes like self-manufactured but i always have loved working with people that have one right i think it's it's fun it brings out the competitive side in me it brings out like i love i love being a part of the underdog in a lot of ways um and so what they were able to do with the conviction that they had against all odds and now be where they are today is just so impressive and i don't know how you can't wake up every day and work for polygon and not be so inspired by what they've been able to do uh you know a lot of people talk about like what you do you know like what motivates you wake up i mean that alone is is is enough right for me um and then there's probably a million other things i could add to that list too so yeah i love working with that team um and they were i mean honestly it was a huge huge driver for me joining polygon have you ever heard the phrase um josh wolfe is the first person that i saw say it chips on shoulders put chips in pockets i i think that's such a good it is good though yeah he says that i've seen him say it in a few interviews i'm always like it's it rings so true and so when you talk about it there it's like exactly i mean you even said for yourself you had a chip on your shoulder can you actually talk about that you know we had a quick back and forth twitter exchange the three of us before recording and you mentioned you know some of the kind of blue collar upbringing and you know maybe that that's part of the chip you feel like you have on your shoulder and that's driven you to succeed can you talk a little bit about that and and kind of what motivates you yeah and i don't even know if that's where the chip comes from but yeah i mean look i uh i was born in uh the suburbs of cleveland ohio um i you know my mom was uh my mom was a nurse my dad was a police officer my uh my mom was a delivery nurse which later i'll tell you was very helpful when we had a baby but um they got divorced uh when i was three years old i was the youngest of three uh my dad ended up moving away a couple hours away i didn't get to see him all that often growing up because he was in columbus which is like two and a half hours away from where we lived uh and yeah i mean i had uh there's not a lot of [ __ ] to do in ohio right so what you do when you're in ohio is you play video games and you're a big sports fan right so unfortunately i'm a die-hard cleveland browns fan cavs fan and indians now guardians fan uh that obviously hasn't you know there's been a couple bright moments you know uh since i was born in 86 but there's not a lot to certainly not on the brown side um and so yeah i mean i think like when i looked at there i i became like i told you very you know enamored with gaming and in the interest in gaming and so when you're in cleveland ohio there's not like video game opportunities out there and so i just became really adamant on on what i would need to do to create that opportunity for me um that took me through into college right i was like well everybody's doing that right it's like we're done with high school we go to college and what do a lot of people in ohio do they go to ohio state right that's like what we do you know so we traveled down you know and i went to ohio state and really loved going you know being there right the energy of being a uh on campus and you know the sports program being so big and how much that's important ohio was all awesome and i had a blast there but um i was a terrible student right because so much of my time was spent you know in the video game world and not just like playing video games by any stretch of imagination it's like how do i actually create this opportunity for myself which is where i started to dabble in being a broadcaster and you know doing volunteer work for major league gaming while in college and so that is actually where i think the chip started to get into a manufacturer because everything always was kind of like oh i don't know like that this is going to be a thing you know try telling people like you know all those years ago was a 16 17 years ago like oh people are going to want to watch people play video games you sound insane right like truly sound insane it's like people can't even sit still when someone has a controller in their hand let alone you're gonna actually think like a business is gonna be built around this and so i think that's it's that doubt that kind of continued to happen which is where i started to get you know uh maybe a little bit stubborn and adamant where i'm like i guarantee you there's other people out there like me so ultimately um we went through the recession right you know there's a huge huge uh kind of you know kind of a a recession that impacted a lot of jobs out of college right when i was in my junior going into senior year of college so i had buddies that were older than me and they were moving back home with degrees right um and like you know they didn't know what to do and these you know like look there these would be really hirable people that just could not get a job because nobody was hiring nobody knew what was going to happen i mean it was pretty scary times at the moment and so i was basically doing a bunch of volunteer work for major league gaming and then and you know and some paid work as well like the commentating and running tournaments and all of that and machinima called and so machinima was this kind of like you know aspiring to be like the mtv of gaming and they were a business built entirely on youtube they only had about 10 or 11 employees this was kind of their their aspiration and they called and they were like hey you know do you want to do you want to come work at machinima and and you know be a community manager there's like a but we don't really know like there's a bunch of rules that need done we just got you know our series a like we're trying to hire some folks and i was like oh you know like that's i yeah that's a dream job but i have a another quarter left of college you know so i can't do it they're like oh that's too bad well you know let us know when you graduate and like if we have a job like maybe we can you know extend something and i was kind of like timeout hold on the whole reason you go to college is to go work now i'm like i have this dream job opportunity i'm like in [ __ ] ohio and now i can finally get out to los angeles work at a job work in the gaming industry and so i immediately was like you know what like i'm coming i don't know how i'm gonna land this conversation with my mom but i'm like i'm on my way you know so i'll make the move and so dropped out and uh had to communicate that to my mom but that's kind of how that's maybe how a lot of that stuff started to begin on like okay like uh you know i really gotta prove that i can do all this and make a career out of this there's this um there's this great framework that you reminded me of while you were while you were speaking there on you know what you said about like trying to convince people that gaming esports was going to be a business and industry that like people were going to watch people in stadiums all of that sounding completely [ __ ] insane yes um at the time when you were trying to do it there is a i think it's paul graham has this kind of framework that that i love which is like if someone tells you um something that sounds like a crazy idea you ask two questions one are they a domain expert like do they really know this domain and then two do you actually know them to be a pretty reasonable person and if both of those answers are yes then you should probably put some skin in the game on that idea because it's highly likely to be like an asymmetric bet on the future and this is such a perfect example of that like i feel like people told me that i knew were really smart and i knew were pretty reasonable that gaming and esports was going to be this huge industry and i was like that sounds crazy i'm not you know not going to get involved whatever it is but consistently if you follow this framework i think you end up with a bunch of really attractive asymmetric bets over time so this is like yet another example of that kind of coming through and that was really like if you think about bets that's the first life one i really had to make right you know all this other stuff i had been doing playing competitively doing the commenting all that was so hedged because you're in school right so it's like this doesn't matter i'm like just i'm tinkering i'm discovering myself my interest where my passion is this is the first time it's like this is a this is a life decision that you're gonna have to make and you alone are gonna have to make this one and so it was the first time you know you're actually putting skin in the game right uh and it was equally terrifying and exciting at the same time and i had a long drive from ohio to california to think through all of it uh on the travel out here and i moved to los angeles i'd never been here before right like i'd never been to la in my life and all of a sudden i'm driving to go live there so it was pretty wild yeah what was the uh conversation with your mom like how did that go you know my mom um she's italian so she's uh she could she she's very animated and no shortage of candid uh opinions right i'll say that um she actually surprisingly was more supportive than i thought because i kind of pitched it as like here's the deal i only have a couple classes left we're gonna knock those things out like don't worry about it of course i'm gonna graduate of course i'm gonna get my degree it's like but this is an opportunity i'm gonna go and so i think because i kind of preface it that way she was a little more supportive obviously i didn't go and get that degree or finish but um i think now she's okay with it but yeah not yet yes you're on the honorary degree track now that's what i'm going for and i'm hoping that that can like you know i i can finally kind of come through with my promise to my mom uh that i would i would get a degree it just might be a little different than she thought um so she actually was uh for me i was i was really nervous to tell her because look like you know we didn't have we didn't you know we didn't want for anything but we didn't have we we definitely were always like very mindful of of money right um and so she definitely put money up towards my education and all of a sudden and it's like for what now right and so i i was terrified but she was pretty supportive the one thing my mom was so good at always was harnessing the passion in the right direction right so it's like if you like video games and you want to work in video games here's a couple options like you're gonna have to learn how to make them but they also need people in marketing they need people in finance they need people in business right so it's like you gotta like you gotta point your efforts this way so she did a really good job of of always putting up like bumper rails for me to make sure that i stayed on on the beaten path to kind of pursue that so part of it part of her was definitely like frustrating and annoyed but the other half i think she was like really proud that you know that kind of came to fruition because she knew how hard i was trying to aim in that direction so she took it pretty well i think it's one of those funny things too about the education system like you went through three and you know two-thirds of your college degree yeah and for some reason you know i think it's called the sheepskin effect like the reality is all that matters from a job standpoint is like actually getting the degree it's not actually the learning that people are valuing otherwise you would get you know three-quarters seven-eighths whatever of the value that you were supposed to get by doing that much of it really all that matters is like staying long enough to get the little piece of paper that tells you that you're like a functioning member of society and it's total [ __ ] obviously we all know that but the sheepskin effect still is very real and it's cemented in our parents minds and so like that is viewed as dropping out versus like oh he went and got seven eighths or you know eight ninths of the value that he was supposed to get it's true i think um and really it's that first job only right like i mean yes every you know the jobs that i went to after did ask but you know at that point they're putting way more stake in job experience than that degree right and so um yeah i mean that was the other thing like while at machinima i got an offer you know from twitch to go work there and stayed at machinima that probably wasn't you know in hindsight maybe everything happens for a reason but that might not have been the best decision financially at least um and so like once that started to happen it further then moved me away from like oh i really don't need to go back right like now i'm getting calls to go work at other places that are great companies to work for and so it then continued to further reduce that fear that i don't have one because you definitely move it like you certainly operate for a while in fear not having one right like machinima goes south all of a sudden i'm unemployed without a degree like that doesn't sound great you know so i was definitely nervous about that the first couple years coming out here it's such an interesting juxtaposition like the three of us even on here greg and i have very different experience sets with education and like what track we were kind of on i i from a young age just like i sort of my dad was an academic my dad's a professor um you know my mom is indian and academics were very very important and i just remember like from a young age i just knew okay what i was supposed to do was like i'm gonna go to college i'm gonna do four years i should probably get a master's degree and then i'm gonna go get a stable job and i'm just gonna work in that and like entrepreneurship was never on my mind it was never something that i kind of learned about or was around greg you know obviously you had a very different experience like you from a young age were doing entrepreneurial things diving into it college was not necessarily on your mind in the same way that it was for me um but it's really brave ryan that you had that like you you sound like you were closer to my track like you were supposed to kind of do that like stable thing and at a young age you were brave enough to just take that leap and jump into something that you were passionate about and excited about and it took me until i was 30 to do that and kind of have the courage to do something like that um and it's just it's just really interesting to see kind of when different people come to that realization of like being willing to take that leap into something new that they're really excited about yeah and i don't even know like classifying it as brave like because i kind of you know for me i felt i think it felt pragmatic whether it was or not it might be another thing but i was like look this is what i'm like boom there's that opportunity i've been waiting for i'm like i love that you know like grabbing that right like been waiting for that thing that door to open so for me it was like i'm out you know it was snowing like eight inches of snow out uh in ohio it was december when i moved out i'm like i'm out of this place i'm gonna go work a gaming screw all of you who said that gaming wasn't ever gonna be a thing like you all are living at home with your moms and parents and i'm on my way to los angeles like bye right so uh i think it was actually more that chip on the shoulder speaking than any bravery but yes by the way cleveland ohio i have to throw it in there is in my top five uh most underrated cities in america my top three i went there for a wedding like in november and it was cold there's like the downtown area is all right there and like the stadium's right there uh marble room the steakhouse like that place is awesome there's some cool hotels i was actually i was blown away by cleveland it's total aside but i feel like i have to throw some positivity because we're uh i feel like we're sitting here crapping on uh crapping on cleveland l.a super overrated by the way this is super overrated i'm moving to san diego no i actually like cleveland um i love cleveland we'll always be super near and dear and i think they get too much black you're right like downtown they've done a great job they put a ton of money in restoring that and yeah you have the you have the the cavs are right there the browns are right on the water right so it is really cool um yeah cavs are right next to uh um uh progressive stadium and so yeah that's great i love it there i love going back there i try to go back you know three or four times a year my mom still lives there so we have to get to the red pill moment yeah um it seems inevitable on every web three pockets yeah it has to it has to be um you know a core part of your story now especially but you were you know you rose through the ranks in your in your prior career you were a senior senior executive at one of the largest and most successful companies in the world running gaming at youtube huge deal massive burgeoning industry you and i had actually connected while you were in that role we had chatted um you know shared some deal flow different things that were happening and then i see this news you put out this thread which went super super viral um you know was all over the place greg and i shared it with each other um when we chatted about getting you on the show so what what was your like first or like your purple pill moment and then what drove you to the kind of full red pill um you know decide to make this transition and join polygon studios as ceo yeah it's a good question i think i got you know taking a step back going about like when i joined youtube as well right like i think i had this passion that you know gaming video was going to continue to be a big thing that bet was starting like you were starting to see that now right like you actually started to see product market fit and the idea that people would watch gaming video so when i went to youtube i was really excited because um a big thing i always want to be able to do is have like a high impact on things that i love doing right like that's at the end of the day it's always been that it's like if you could just focus on how you have a high impact in an area where you're passionate about a lot of things kind of just fall into place now you could call that luck hard work persistence some of it is probably all of those things to be honest with you uh but that is always where i focused on it so it was never about job title it was never about money it literally is always that right i'm like put me in a place where i can have high impact and so when i came into youtube i was like i can have a ton of impact here they don't know anything about gaming it's this growing business um i have the opportunity to kind of set the strategy hire everybody i had definitely a little bit of imposter syndrome because i was like 27 years old coming in aside of gaming um you know so that kind of that was a motivating factor it goes back to even the chip kind of conversation on the shoulder and so um every day there you're you have people that um you know some people get it but some people are like you know this is ridiculous right like people watching people like do is this what we want our company to be about like do we even want to embrace it why does why should we care about people watching people play video games almost as if it was like the equivalent to cat videos and like hurting the overall brand and reputation right and so thankfully susan our ceo at the time and still is is like no this is like what are you talking about right like gaming is huge right like we're gonna focus on it and so she was always such a huge advocate but i had to do so much educating and evangelizing in those early years to get people to understand the opportunity and so for me what happened was like now segwaying to actually answering your question about a year ago i started to see some you know people that i know that are developers from big prestigious studios and publishers you know riot games and activision and ea and they're like oh yeah leave them like believing you're gonna go do it's like oh start my own studio it's like oh what's your game about it's like oh it's a blockchain based game like what the [ __ ] is that you know um and so all this entrepreneurial like spirit was being elevated because there was so much capital really for the first time in the gaming industry right there has never been this kind of capital being deployed to entrepreneurs in the history of gaming he's obviously seen publishers get involved with studios and like it wasn't like non-existent um and you have like mitch lasky and some legends that have definitely like paved the way but this is like now you're talking billions of dollars because you've untapped gaming specific funds consumer funds and like crypto based funds so it was like boom this this huge amount of money so it's like if you're an entrepreneur game developer which is the untold story really that's of the shift because that happened like started happening a year ago all these people are like oh yeah i'm starting a new studio and starting like uh you know blockchain based games so i asked the question and i'm like like what does that even mean because i had traded in and out of like ethereum and bitcoin and but has zero interest in d5 and more just because of the the like oh you should have some money in this and blah blah blah put it aside from like smart friends but never got into d5 never got into crypto any of this and so when i started to see some of these games come up and then people talk about you know like look like we can have these free open thriving marketplaces and there's a lot of like you know equity in this digital ownership and like all of these kind of core concepts of blockchain based games i personally just started spending time learning it right i'm like oh i'm ahead of gaming at youtube like i think this cannot be a blind spot for me i kind of was like thrown off like i'm the guy that's supposed to know all the stuff happening in gaming right and so the further and further a time i spent on that i started then uh look at like okay advisory rules like how can i get in the space how can i help facilitate all of this you know and where is youtube's role in all this what's my role in all of it and as i started to pursue that you you would think that that actually satisfies the itch that you have but it exasperates it 10x right um so like poison ivy when you start itching it too much and you're spreading it everywhere it's like that actually itching did not help and all of a sudden i was like i gotta i gotta get into this space full-time i have done what i've wanted to do it at youtube loved the company love the people i work with have nothing but great things to say about that experience there but you know i'm 35 i had a ton of energy to go do something else and like still very much a builder and was not really ready to do the like you know kind of uh vest and rest and coast you know for the next 10 years at google so i had to do something with this fire [Music] the hard part about web 3 is that there's there's so many shiny objects that it's uh it's really it's it's hard to see when there's just so many shiny objects right so like what made you [Music] go fully into into polygon and what was that process like yeah so agree very much with the shiny object thing so the what you want to do so i that was like the first thing i decided too many shiny objects so how do you actually hedge that is you work a platform you go hor you go very very broad very horizontal which is l2 l1s would allow for that right so then all of a sudden you're like okay my my my expertise is building out scaled teams working with developers focusing on how to go to market all of this right did it with gaming creators and then gaming developers so i was like where where is that skill set most valuable it's definitely on like the immutable solana polygon avalanche side right so now it's like you get familiar with kind of the different platforms and what do you want to do there as far as you know making your next step right and so polygon from i'm like ethereum is here to stay gonna be here to stay so i'm like i'm gonna start making that bet okay now let's look at that where would you want to be if you were working to help the developer ecosystem as it relates to ethereum and polygon kind of came into the fold here and then obviously having that bra visibility across all these you know gaming fashion entertainment sports news right you see all kind of what appears as shiny objects and they probably aren't or may not be or you see a lot of things that are not appearing in shiny projects that could probably be like the next minecraft right and so it was fun to say okay that's the kind of visibility that i'm looking for across the industry it gives me a lot of reps it gives me a lot of exposure to see a lot of different people and try to help as many people and it has the highest level of impact that you can possibly have on this right so um it was the impact role it was the broad visibility and kind of working for a platform and then it was the founding team that really sold it for me so it was a combination of all those things but that that's a little bit of like how the criteria kind of rolled out um and i wasn't necessarily fully certain greg that i'm go i was gonna make a move right i was like i'm gonna go explore this but you know you're leaving like this i think had a gaming youtube is like one of the coolest jobs in the gaming industry right so sure this is a big this is a big decision i'm leaving that yeah and how i i mean when you when you think about the studio's role relative to the broader like how does studios interact with the mothership at polygon so if you think about studios it's basically a conduit for helping developers on board and sustain success on polygon that are web 2 web 3 and it excludes defy exchange wallet right so that's part of the overall kind of macro tech so if you're if you're building an nft project or a marketplace or you're figuring out how to enter web 3 you'll come through studios so our partners are everything from like the usual hitters of you know zed run and crypto unicorns and open c but now it also is you know draftkings and nfl and ticketmaster and ap news and and so forth uh and obviously web 2 companies who are inevitably entering the space as well got it so you're kind of like i'm trying to think of like what an analog is for it's basically we're like polygon yeah okay got it you're like the connective tissue that kind of brings other things with into the polygon universe developer ecosystem all of that and kind of promotes and fosters the broader growth of the polygon ecosystem that's right and so much of it right now is onboarding you know it's like people with this huge intrigue to build on chain apps and so like a lot of us that but long term you need to set the company up to be able to handle these partners that are on three or four years and how do they think about go to market with the creator economy how are they thinking about you know tokenomics how are they thinking about you know uh you know when they start to be in the wall how can we help them get out of it and provide them feedback and analytics and data just ongoing like customer success of developers if you will and so right now you're looking at like seven to eight thousand daps on polygon like you gotta be ready for eighty thousand eight hundred thousand and eight million over the next five to ten years all of that sets up now right because if you really think about it um these great like so if you look at games today you know their financialization first they're pretty rudimentary on the game side like obviously those are the easiest games you can get out to market really quick but if you look at these games that'll actually create a material inflection in web three and blockchain in general will be these like high polished aaa type games that are gonna take three or four years to make right so i'm obviously not betting on web 3 and blockchain games based off of what the available offering is today but like what i've seen in the games that are coming that are on the horizon and you've got to build you've got to build a system in place to support that long term too many things that i'm seeing right now are like oh let's get this partnership oh go build a polygon like next up right and that's fine like that's how the whole that's how all the l1 and o2s that are focusing on this are doing it we cannot operate like that long term and we need to make sure that people find like long-term success and real partnership could you could you talk a little bit about some of the games or applications that uh you think are doing a really good job let's talk about games for a second because i you know there's a lot of people who look at blockchain gaming and they're very bearish and yeah they don't believe in it i'm bullish on it um you know you mentioned you know crypto unicorns i would argue that that's a you know pretty good execution around a game maybe you can talk about crypto unicorns what that is or and and why you think it might be interesting i think too so yeah i'll take us there's a couple questions in there i think the one thing to look at and this is oftentimes a mistake i see across very particularly like the gaming industry and gaming conversations is there's three billion gamers right so we have to have a tremendous amount of nuance when we're talking here just to be like blockchain games and how they work today is super super dismissive because it actually is working for some areas of the world and some gamers right and really what you're doing is right now the the aperture of of offering is very narrow to that three billion gamers and what's out there today and play these player games um that is going to continue to get bigger over time as people are developing different types of games where they're not maybe they're not necessarily play to earn they're just a really high polished tactical shooter that looks like valor or counter-strike that actually just has a free open thriving marketplace that allows for art to be developed in different skins so like some artists can come up and be like you want to do an ak-47 skin here you can drop a thousand nfts with these dimensions and it's a cosmetic item only and you sign and kind of do that and like celebrate the artist and you own that and so there it there's not going to be a one-size-fits-all blockchain games is going to serve a significant size of the total gaming audience but not all of it right and north i would say a lot of games have no business being a blockchain based game no interest doesn't do anything for it not helpful not productive right and so we just need to be really mindful when we talk about games in general um it it's very much like if you try to talk about music and you were like tell me you know tell me about that artist uh drake and in hip-hop right and like and being very dismissive of everything so that's what i'm trying to take a step back from because even in these conversations on twitter where it's just so polarizing it's like people get get nfts out of my game like we don't want it there's no place for it here right and i'm like i think everyone's just talking past each other one and then i think we're talking about different time frames and time horizon like i joined like i said you know for games that are gonna be three or four years out it'll be fun to work with all these games uh over the next couple of years yeah it's interesting i mean you raise it right there but like i i've definitely noticed as kind of you know i'm sort of an outsider to all of this i think greg is much more native to it than me i'm kind of a curious observer i would say like not fully red-pilled on all of it and you know try to kind of take a balanced view still because i haven't fully you know kind of dived into the space i wouldn't say but but one of the things that struck me with gaming in particular has been like the animosity that a lot of the core gaming community has around nfts in particular play to earn some of these things um and it's just been interesting to me to see because so much of it feels core to what gaming is um and kind of a logical extension of it but you have this like core community that's pushing back against it and so i've just personally found it interesting to to see that and experience it yeah i think there's a couple things to consider there i actually think some of the outrage towards it is warranted and valid right because i think if you look at it and you're not well versed on it you're like okay i'm open-minded tell me tell me like what's out there that i'm not being mindful if you're like oh okay well we have these like jpeg monkeys that are selling for a million bucks uh we have this game called axe infinity that you know it's like a lot of people do enjoy it but if you're like you if you're thinking about a lot of this like argument of like polish like this is not a game that i would play and so and then they have obviously there is carbon footprint issues yes that stuff is changing over time but it hasn't yet so if you look at it you're kind of like the [ __ ] are you really selling me out right like i don't want any of this stuff i don't want like to see my game turn into like this financialization first thing i don't want to see in order to buy a digital item i have to spend 800 bucks in order to get into the game i don't care about these jpegs that are you know uh subjectively not great art that are selling right and so they don't they don't get it right it's like and it's uh and what they do get isn't exciting to them and that's like totally cool right i i would say the product offering that we have out in market for gamers right now it's pretty underwhelming right it's like here's version 0.5 and that's okay you got to start somewhere all of these companies are great first movers they're going to continue to build and innovate they're going to continue to learn look at like axes done a great job as well right they their success actually really caused market issues for them and they're learning how like how do we burn like what kind of things do we do with the games how do we change the mechanics how do we balance it right all of this will be great learnings um so i just feel you got to give it time right the backlash i think is justifiable i also think you had a lot of people in web 3 in the crypto space that really weren't gaming like just like you know drive pedaling like blockchain games should be the universe in the world and everything else and it's like maybe we like let now like more gaming thought leaders kind of try to like find the balance between all of this because both sides have really really valid points and we need nuanced conversation over time frames and where we think this will be but yeah i think there's there is not a blockchain game that is like totally hits my hardcore gaming right when you release a tactical shooter that's on chain and i have this marketplace and all the things that i was just talking about i'm gonna be all over it and i think that would be the real indication of success when you just play a game because you love the game and it just has this financialization uh you know part of it that you enjoy participating in um and a lot of that stuff is in the background because the the real the on-ramps will be really easy and all things consider like think about using the same tactical shooter example valerian i love it right if you want to play ballarat you know you're buying basically riot points those ride points have a perceived value you buy those digital items and now you'll start to add well now those right right points actually is a fluctuating price you know instead of static it's dynamic which is cool right you can get in early there's monetization opportunities for you there uh like now you actually own these digital items you can resell them you actually know how many there are right you have different artists that are doing different things right so it's like it opens up um it opens up a lot of possibilities i think people will come around to in due time ryan do you remember uh 2003 when steam came out um and counter-strike moved from being you buy you go to a store you buy a disc you put in your disc you install it you play the game to now you you know you you go you download this software it's like in the cloud what is this cloud thing um do you remember the backlash that occurred yeah i mean because you still first of all you still have kids that were playing like on dial up so they're like this is not even this is like absolute [ __ ] right it's gonna take me six days and first of all you're migrating all this stuff over to steam right so it created a lot of um yeah that was kind of crazy and then obviously there was still a lot of sense of ownership and pride of like oh you know i own the disc right i bought these discs i bought the cd i have them right i can install it like that you know now i'm having to do these internet you know uh this this internet platform instead of just being able to locally install it was crazy yeah it's super interesting i mean it's um you know my my play to earn take um which i don't know that we've talked about greg in depth you know my like having now spent a bunch of time around it is probably very similar to to ryan's which is basically just that like play to earn in the absence of having a game that is engaging enough to play for free and to just play for fun becomes like it some totes towards becoming a ponzi scheme because if everyone is purely playing to like make money off of the game i think then you're just relying on more and more users coming in to like pay the early users and those people need to get paid by the next people so in the absence of like a highly engaging game that people are just playing because it's really [ __ ] fun um you're gonna have a really tough time making the model actually work at some point it's just like you're waiting for the fall because then everyone starts flooding out it becomes this like downward vicious spiral and so i i agree with you like we need and i think actually there are people that are entering the market now that have very positive intentions around building this there will be a financialization component as you say but it'll sit alongside beautiful immersive amazing gaming experiences that draw people in for any number of reasons yep and i think the thing that people don't really speak about is in like three or four years because of how much capital has been injected into the game developer ecosystem there's going to be so much optionality for gamers right like there will be so many different gaming experiences across web 2 and web 3. and that's great right so that's why i'm just so much more open i'm like what has happened that's so great about gaming is it went from being this very very specifically targeted to like male teenagers you know to now offering something for everybody which is why you start to see billions of people come in there's still a lot more room to go on all of that and there will which is why then i think you start to talk about like metaverse and digital worlds because now gaming is starting to like infiltrate all aspects of everyone's life where it's like is it even video games right like are we just these are just like now digital experiences that people are participating in and so i think you basically get to a point where it's all encompassing globally and so there's going to be a huge subset of people that are going to want to do these kind of on-chain game experiences and and that's what it's all about i just don't think we should my big issue actually with all the nft backlash isn't even the backlash because i think some of their points are well met i just really hate the gatekeeping of the gaming category because it offers so much to so many people and i don't know like why any of us have any like any right to stand on and be like this has no place in gaming when it is technology right like okay like you don't need you don't need to participate in it and yeah i can see like a lot of people just want to play video games and not worry about like seeing if their account value went from 800 bucks to 200 bucks because like the token price went down and i totally get that right that's why there's like god of war and that's why those games will always be around you know so anyway i digress no that's great um and you know i know we're running up against the end of time and you're gonna go catch a flight soon so um there's a question that we love to ask people especially like you who have consistently seen into the future and and proven that you're good at it that we like to close with which is basically just like if you were to have a few predictions for the future or one prediction for the future you know five ten years out what are you seeing like what are you super excited about what do you think um what do you think the future looks like yeah i kind of is like alluding at that with the the digital world like that's the big thing i think you've got um you've got young generations that grew up from day one on their phone in very immersive digital experiences right and they're really just like those individuals um don't think much of it like having you know playing with your friends in video games like having your community be digital oriented right like looking for those things i don't i think there's a lot there's a stigma in previous generations and so you don't see them kind of be able to wrap their head around worlds that look like this or perceive like this but that is really the reality of it and so i'm excited for that i think the digital worlds that we're talking about will be everything from like what you know as video games into just like actual digital worlds where people like i would hate to be doing just this video call in five to eight years and we're just like still doing zoom calls to have conversations there's got to be more immersive ways for us to feel like we're getting together and i'm i'm adamant that you know with where like unreal and the engines are going and the world is going and technology is going we're going to see those worlds and that will be much more fun to have those conversations in there right uh and so because of that people will put more of an emphasis on their capital being deployed in digital worlds and then you want that to feel valid you want that to feel justifiable and warranted people like peacocking they won't have a problem putting money in digital environments gamers get this really well we just talked about how everybody's becoming basically a gamer which means they understand these basic concepts so i think all that's going to happen i'm really excited for how like big brands pivot into web3 and digital even if not web3 just like their new digital strategy maybe that's like uh maybe that's a little bit more of a subdued way of saying it instead of it always being you know the hyperbole of web 3 and blockchain but they'll have a new digital strategy and it will be their participation will be how you figure out how to be a part of all of these digital universes you know just like we have these top platforms that take a bunch of people's time you're gonna have this new shift of top platforms that take people time and more immersive experiences and we'll laugh at like phone apps as being like super rudimentary in 10 to 20 years like oh my god you like actually called you know your a car service from like just a basic app with your address and like from your phone and people like my you know my kids are going to be like oh my god you're so old um so yeah i'm excited for these kind of like transformative experiences but it's important you know there's a lot of hype around metaverse and digital worlds here that's fine but like we are we should be very honest with ourselves that we are in like the first inning if you will like we got 10 15 20 years of this digital transformation and we are at the very beginning of it um and so i think it's tempering expectations like you know two years from now rock and i'll just be like you know it's not ready player one and i think people need to understand too kind of what it's gonna look like so yeah i'm excited about all of these digital worlds and then the behavior that people have and what is required from a technol technological standpoint for that to be enabled that's why i like polygon as well too so much yeah yeah i mean i'm just wondering if you had a chance to see well i'm sure you did i know you saw the uh board ape leaked deck um yeah their metaverse strategy um curious what your perspective is on on that project and where they're headed yeah i mean i'll probably like refrain from commenting specifically on that project but i do like seeing um projects that start with like profile picture nfts actually start to materialize into something bigger it's a different way of game development and now a lot of people are getting rugged on that way right like this idea of like you know we'll start with profile picture nft arts that has a bigger like mission honestly 99 of those projects are gonna be complete [ __ ] but this is really cool to see a very reputable brand and company be like we actually got a long term strategy here and so i in general people that can build that way although they'll be few and far in between it's a very exciting new way to develop that we haven't seen before there's a lot of the the top down or venture funded initiatives like you normally see so i'm excited that that's like really coming together in a credible way we were just before you came on we were just talking about this exact thing that like 99 garyvee came on the show a couple months ago and said this exact thing like 99 of nft projects are gonna go to [ __ ] yeah and they're gonna be worth nothing and the analog i have is like 99 of songs that get released never get listened to 99 of pieces of art never get seen or purchased or aren't worth anything and so it's actually not surprising that 99 of like these nft projects will be worth nothing i think the difference was that it became like sort of this meme of like a cash grab during the particularly like summer fall of 2021 where there was a perception that there were a lot of people just throwing this out because it was like a free money run as fast as you can and now there are a lot of people that are going to be you know under pressure and pushed but now i think a lot of that speculation and insanity that was around nft has actually subsided and what you do have is a lot of people like you labs in this case or whoever it is um that really are trying to put together concrete long-term road maps of how they're extending from this like you know initial whatever funky pfp into something much more meaningful and and hopefully impactful from an ip perspective oh totally like it's like the you know modern day gold rush and then people just thinking you can grab like a pickaxe and like be rich right it's like not the case you know there was obviously first movers that got that benefited from it right um we're gonna see a pullback that's gonna be great because it kind of gets the noise out there it does it does kind of you know create awareness around the community of what projects they should be associated with what they shouldn't be what success looks like what it doesn't look like look when you kind of go into this world where um it's like it's you ask for a tremendous amount of freedom in blockchain environment right and so there's good and bad that comes with that the bad of that is you put money in and you very much could lose all of it on on bad calculated investments and you know you you kind of make that an even bar for everybody right and and that's the beauty of it but uh it does come with consequences you know and that's that that's part of innovation to be honest with you yeah well i mean and for true believers you know when you're looking at investing in these spaces and you've done a lot of diligence and done your work these pullbacks are the best thing in the world right you get to accumulate at lower prices like we joked about it you know you i think we had originally scheduled for you to come on like a couple months ago and then we we delayed and uh i remember messaging you and just saying i was just gonna buy until uh until you came on i was gonna buy a polygon some of the matic and it's been great for me because i've been able to accumulate at lower prices and i've obviously done a lot of diligence not financial advice say it outright but um but you know for people that have done the work and dug in on these projects when you get to accumulate at lower prices just buying good things on sale for sure and we want to make sure we're giving value to all matic holders so we'll keep doing it literally well i'm bullish on you and uh really really excited that we were able to have you on and have this discussion and i like betting on my smart friends so this is a this is an exciting opportunity for me to get to do so and um really excited to release this conversation and have more people hear it and learn from it i love it thanks for all you both do for the community in the industry thanks for having me on it was my pleasure thank you so much join our free community at trwih.com [Music]

Today, the platform powers approximately 30 percent of the entire internet, and its businesses employ more than 1100 people across 60 countries. In this episode of Where It Happens, Matt discusses the future of work, why a distributed workforce is the most effective way to build a company (if you do it right), and how you can manifest serendipity to influence better outcomes.

feel like it's been a week or two since we've uh gotten on one of these so i'm glad we're back totally what uh i've got a list yeah you got a list i've got a list man i mean well first off since we last recorded the world has exploded you know in a lot of ways in a lot of tragic ways um as i'm sure everyone is well aware at this point with everything going on in in ukraine and russia and um a few things related you know on the kind of the more the business side of that that i was hoping to chat with chat through today um but i had an interesting conversation last night that i want to start with because i just thought it was like i don't know it's kind of random but it was pretty interesting i have this close friend who um he works right now at mckinsey and he's really like an entrepreneurial guy and he you know previously founded a business he probably wants to found another business he's like deep down the crypto web 3 rabbit hole and i was asking him like dude why why the hell are you at mckenzie like what are you doing and he was trying to explain the rationale to me of um you know it's like a high-paying w-2 job and it made me start thinking about and like the analogy i gave him was um you as a person i'm curious for your perspectives on this it's like you as a human being imagine yourself as like a pile of cash like a million dollars of cash you're just a pile of cash and it's not always that you find the like perfect thing to invest that cash in like to invest your resources in and so sometimes you need to find the like high yield savings account to store that cash in while you're waiting to find the big opportunity and so i presented that to him as like that's what you're doing mckinsey in this case in your life right now is like the high yield savings account like you're getting a return on your money you're getting your w2 income you're getting this like prestige it looks great on your resume but as soon as that thing comes along that you know is like a 10x like opportunity on that cash the cash that is your life you're going to like take it out of the high yield savings wire it into whatever that opportunity is and let it rip and run and i thought it was such an interesting analogy when i put it together because i was like it's really how i think about a lot of different opportunities in life like you need your kind of like storage place where you know you're getting yield and you know you're getting a baseline return so that you can wait and have the luxury of waiting for what those big opportunities are so that you're not just like constantly running between you know things that you think might be runaway opportunities what do you think well i think people romanticize entrepreneurship in general so and i think i see a lot of people who like jump into building when they have no savings and they get into debt and it's actually it's quite sad um so i think like it's easy to knock on this like essentially mckinsey bro um but i think it makes sense as long as he's spending his nights and weekends and he's actually like building stuff launching stuff nothing wrong with a paying high paying job yeah it's sort of like find your find your version of that high yield savings account i mean it's like it's great it's a great insulation sometimes in life and you can park your cash like you as an asset there while you wait for what that thing is that grabs your curiosity and gets you so excited to jump into the next thing it was just something i was thinking about you know like in real time last night when i talked to him so i wanted to i wanted to bat it around but let's um wait let's jump into the list yeah yeah it reminded me of like this concept of mailbox money you know that concept it's like making money that you know basically pays your bills your like lifestyle and if you can do that automatically like it comes in the mail and i actually set up this affiliate campaign um that would provide me you know a few thousand dollars every month and it's been going live for years and it's actually the thing the high yield savings account basically that allowed me to actually go and build a lot of the products i wanted to go build mailbox money is a cool concept i've talked about that with um nadam kong soo who we have coming on the show soon actually he talks about it a lot in the context of athletes and how mailbox money is so important because they're making this like super high salary but it really only lasts for a few years and so deploying that salary into things that generate mailbox money for the rest of your life is you know a really good insulation from potential future disruption um i completely agree it's like you know it gives you the flexibility to go pursue those high upside opportunities because you're not worried about the downside yeah so there's one one way to do it is get a job at mckinsey high yield saving savings account other way to do it is build some sort of passive income or mostly passive income product that just pays you yeah the one thing about passive income that a lot of people don't talk about like passive income has become this meme where like you know everyone on tiktok is like here's how to generate ten thousand dollars a passive income a month whatever the thing about past passive income that i've found is like it's never quite as passive as you think there are very few things that are truly passive every now and then you know maybe you come across something or you've been very elegant in designing something but most income if you want to keep it going there's like more time involved than you think and so the other thing i would just caution people against is like the idea of passive income is almost like a misnomer in and of itself there's going to be some time and some at least like headspace allocation that you have to that you have to put towards it so be mindful of it as you continue to build um totally dude we don't have a ton of time um and we've got a great guest joining us for part of the discussion so i want to dive in to um dive into our lists i know you've got a couple things i've got a couple things um you want to just jump right in yeah let's you you lead us off all right so i've got a few things on my list i want to start with um crypto and ukraine um and i don't want to wade into the territory of people trying to opine on military strategy or you know anything that's happening from a geopolitical context but the crypto side of this is fascinating to me um and really what i'm referring to is the fact that crypto donations have been accepted by ukraine and are flowing in and insane amounts um into supporting ukraine in this in this battle against um against russia and i think the most recent numbers i saw before we were recording was like something like 60 million dollars um of crypto assets had been raised and like people had donated someone donated a crypto punk um gavin wood the founder of polka dot donated like six million dollars of crypto uh so it's this amazing um show of force from the kind of web 3 and crypto community and coming together and supporting this and it's so counter to the broader narrative of like crypto is for fraudsters scammers criminals you know degenerates etc so i'm curious for your thoughts on it well i think and it actually goes back to what we were talking about around passive income and active income which is people just like to bucket things into one category it's either active income or it's passive income it's either for criminals or it's not for criminals and everything's black and white everything is black and white and the reality is that everything lives on a spectrum so what you know what i think the 50 plus million dollars going to ukraine has taught you know mainstream a mainstream audience is that the spectrum is now enlarged in a lot of people's brains now a lot of people are like okay like i you know yes you can use crypto for bad but you can also use crypto to for good and i think what this is actually gonna do is it's going to uh inspire and a whole set of entrepreneurs next generation entrepreneurs who are gonna be building crypto products or crypto companies that are social cause based so i'm pretty excited about that yeah it's really interesting it's a great it's a great point you make i mean some of the stuff that's happening is just pretty inspiring like broadly just from the outside looking in like you know even not being someone that's super involved in the community i mean you had um there is uh polka dot founder which i mentioned uh chain ceo um deepak dapi thapliyal um donated like 300k there's this gaming company like a ukrainian gaming company called holy water that launched an nft gallery from all ukrainian artists and i think they had raised like 40k by the time that i was um that i was checking it out there's literally like really amazing things there was a russian national actually um living in the u.s who recorded a video burning her russian passport um and was auctioning it off and donating the proceeds to the uh to the struggle in ukraine so i think it's just this amazing thing um of like you know innovation kind of coming together um with this situation where it's opening up new inroads to to supporting people i've seen people like paying for airbnbs in ukraine i mean using these different vectors to support people is is just a really interesting thing that's happening i also just think and i texted you this or texted our group chat this earlier how crazy it is that i i think vladimir putin is uh probably the highest dislike to like ratio um in human history like if you were to go you know there's seven billion people in the world or whatever the number is if you were to go ask people like do you dislike or like him i think he probably has the highest ratio of dislikes to likes in history which is like being the most unpopular human being in history is kind of wild yeah it is wild i mean well well deservingly uh for sure i think yeah um what about what about the big tech side of this um that's like the other side that's been in the news a lot is like how tech companies have responded and how business um has responded in general and kind of pulling out of russia like you've seen you know apple um announced they were closing operations within within russia they don't have any apple stores there but they were shutting down you know sales through any kind of third parties i think google was stopping ads facebook actually got shut off by russia um because russia claimed that there was misinformation on the platform which is which is rich um you know and you had tick tock i think just announced that they were going to shut down streaming in russia um because there was some law passed by russia that said like fake news couldn't be disseminated on the platform so tick tock shut off there's all this like you know reaction from the tech community the cynic in me says um yeah well the ruble the you know russian currency is basically going to be worthless and so doing business there actually doesn't make sense and so you can take the pr win of like hey we're not doing business in russia when the reality is you didn't really want to be doing it economically um but the optimist in me says it's great that the you know that the kind of tech and and business community is coming together and rallying um against this um you know against a dictator to to go do this um so what do you think well first of all i saw today that um wework ceo uh is one of the companies that you know he i'm pulling up the quote wework won't exit russia where biz does quote-unquote incredibly well so you know the theme of the theme of this episode is is spectrums and i think like you're you're also seeing people go on the other side of the spectrum and they're doubling down which is uh you know i hadn't seen that but i'm pulling it up now that is crazy do you know how many look i want to look up how many locations they have because the same thing happened with um with mcdonald's which at least as of now i think it has like 847 restaurants in russia um and i mean they they're refusing to close them and i think like that would be a big show right i think it's like one of the most popular fast food chains in russia uh but mcdonald's is keeping them all open a lot of them are company owned as well so they actually have control over them um pretty crazy yeah and it's like it is crazy you know it's it's absolutely it's bonkers i imagine they're gonna get enough pressure from the public over the next couple of weeks if this situation continues that it's to be a lot more difficult for them to justify that i mean we work it's like man what are you doing like with mcdonald's i'm like almost more sympathetic to it but i still think they should shut them down and kind of you know continue to gather momentum around all of this but um we work that's crazy i was just pulling it up it's i mean it's it's wild um so what do you what do you have on your list dude um that was that was the main stuff i wanted to talk about before we have our guest in okay so new nft project um tai lopez launches nft project did you see it who is ty lopez tyler looks like a motivational speaker right he's famous i mean i know he's famous but like yeah what's he famous for you may have just seen tai lopez because he used to like he basically had these ads on youtube where he would be like this is my garage and this is my ferrari and and this is my house and like let me show you how like you can have this and he would okay he would sell stuff you know courses okay like that now fast forward to today is i think he he runs a company that goes it's like a pe firm basically they go and they buy uh old brands like radioshack etc and they bring them online i think he bought pier one imports i think he bought like the e-commerce business of pier one yes okay so that's you know tai lopez might might be you know vladimir putin is the most hated man in the world tai lopez might be the one of the most hated people on the internet uh really and he's also really loved like he also has this like massive fan base of people that are obsessed with him right he's just polarizing he's polarizing he's definitely he's very very polarizing um and i don't know enough about like tai lopez if you're listening to this like and i know you follow me on twitter so like um you know nothing you know i don't know enough about the situation to be like you're a bad guy or a good guy but there is that perception around that he's kind of like a schemer well that's like dude i mean i don't know i have a push back to this because i think that is a broad perception that has been created around like online courses online sales you know anyone that's like marketing their skills um to like teach you how to do something rather than doing it there's like this broad-based perception against it right it's like grant cardone tony robbins garyvee gets for that kind of stuff um and but like tai lopez has a million and a half subscribers on youtube like you must be doing something right um and the thesis around buying you know dated consumer businesses modernizing their ecommerce stack and you know kind of reviving them is actually like a pretty sound fundamental thesis around business yeah i think uh yeah no comment on tai lopez good guy or bad guy what i wanted to comment about is his new nft project so did you see it no i haven't seen it tell me about it i'm gonna pull it up while you're talking so it basically it's called original garage and basically what it is is you buy an nft and you get to do things with um with tai lopez so i pull you know i'm pulling up uh a tweet that i saw it's a you know from this this guy eddie is kong's hey at tai lopez legit question why would i pay 30 to 40 000 to watch a movie with you or 80 90 000 for your whatsapp who do you think you are you def have a shady reputation and doing this only adds more fuel to the fire i respect anyone wanting to add value to nfts but this is just not the way so he got a huge blow back from the crypto community around you know why you um selling you know these very expensive nfts to go and hang out with me and faroq faroq who's an amazing follow on twitter if you're not already following him it's just apharoc um he's the founder of rugradio he's really well known in the crypto community and he um got in a fight with tai lopez on twitter um and here's the tweet um basically well basically faroq was saying like was kind of being like this is very cash grabby and then tai lopez tweeted but if you buy my nft you can come to another one of my pool parties at faroq and there's a picture in 2016 of faroek and and tai lopez um at this party um so a lot of drama in the crypto twitter space uh what do you think i have a lot of thoughts here so i i don't know tai lopez at all i think he follows me on twitter um i get you know like there's a lot of um general animosity towards like people that have made a lot of money selling courses and you know talking on the internet et cetera and i i don't know anything about tai lopez i've never watched any of his videos um that plus there is a lot of animosity in general towards cash grab nfts right like the um the nft boom um that happened in the like earlier days of nfts you know like um kind of earlier part of 2021 that precipitated a bunch of people to do these like there were cash grabs lots of cash grabs and i feel like now we're kind of into a place with the nft landscape where at least for me i don't see as many things that i'm like wow there's nothing to this most of the nft stuff that at least i'm hearing about or that's like generating buzz it feels to me um is more unique like at least has some edge there's some road map there's some like something interesting about it or like brands are trying to drive interesting extensions or work on things it feels more like an ideal laboratory to me now than like a cash situation where people are just trying to make money and so i think this situation is like it's a a collision of two really hot button issues like one being you know tai lopez's perspective reputation you know around like how he's made money and what he's done which already people have animosity towards as you pointed out and then the other being um you know nft cash grabs and people perceiving the like collision of these two things is a very very uh you know it's a combustible situation and so i i can see why this would be a situation that would have that and i'm like you know i'm looking at some of the um some of the kind of tweets that have come out against it like there's ox beans i don't know if you follow him uh 0x underscore beans he said like he pulled up the code base from it he said hilarious the tai lopez nft immediately siphons out the funds into their team's wallet when you mint just so they can scam your eth just a little bit faster so it seems pretty clear that there was like a lot of pushback and blowback within the uh within the nft and crypto community broadly towards this and i think look um sorry my final thought on this is it behooves the crypto and web 3 community the like real believers who are going to be here for the next 10 20 whatever years um to police this kind of stuff internally if they perceive there to be you know rug pulls scams any bad behavior because anything that you can do to weed out that behavior and police it is helpful towards building a reputation of um you know more legitimacy around this over time and everyone knows there's still this negative reputation around crypto web 3 as we talked about in the context of the ukraine and russia um uh donations so any like it's it's encouraging to me to see the crypto and web 3 community policing things that they perceive to be below bar yeah and i'm happy you said that i think like you know one of the things in this in this nft collection is uh you know i think the gold pass it meant for between 80 and 100 each you know that's which is you know 100 and a couple hundred grand um just for access to this nft and you know i think there's that's a that's a lot and that's exactly why a lot a lot of the uh there is a lot of blowback from a lot of these projects um because you know you could buy this thing for 260 grand and then three months later tai lopez could be off to the next shiny object so um we're seeing that a lot a lot right now from um the nft community which is high mint prices um are our big faux pas so uh interesting to see we'll see you know who knows maybe tai lopez ends up making this like garyvee like like a v friends and it ends up being being an amazing collection um or maybe you know we come back in 12 months from now and it goes to zero yeah what's your guess um and you can be honest i don't i don't know i it'd be great to get tai on the show someday and and ask him these questions directly but if we don't that's fine so do give your honest take i mean if 97 of nft projects go to zero it's just more likely that this project goes to zero yeah the base rate is pretty bad that's true um i don't even have a percent like i have no perspective on whether it goes to zero whether it's valuable but looking at it it certainly feels sort of absurd um the flip side is like if there are people that want to hang out with him that much that they're willing to pay that much in u.s dollars um it's kind of the same thing i just don't i mean like warren buffett auctions off a lunch with warren buffett every year um it gets donated warren buffett does not need you know a few hundred grand or or whatever it costs but i need to pull it up i think like um i think a crypto person paid like a couple million dollars to do the lunch with him um one year uh and it regularly goes for like many hundreds of thousands or into the millions of dollars um to have lunch with warren buffett warren buffett much more impressive than tai lopez no offense tai lopez i just it's warren buffett like i kind of get it and warren buffett is auctioning it off um but this type of thing generally exists where people you know auction off time with themselves in order to go do something i just think it's typically someone that's like made a ton of money and they're donating the proceeds to charity versus putting it in their pocket if i was if i was tai lopez i wouldn't have created such a big collection i think it's like 8 600 or something like that and i would have just focused on like 300 people like his odds of success would have been way higher higher if he just would have taken the club cpg model crypto goods by our buddy chris cantino which basically he minted 300 of them he created a telegram group at you know he's in there 8 10 12 14 hours a day he's like the community leader he's doing all the right things and now the floor price is like 12 16 12 69 eth he's adding value um that's what i would have done if i was tied to 300 and then added as time went on yeah and if i were i'd probably flip it and just have all proceeds donated to ukraine at this point like if he wants to have any hope of reviving this situation i feel like that's got to be the uh that's got to be the move at this point um but yeah i mean the warren buffett thing by the way i just looked it up the the last one sold for point five six seven million dollars uh justin sun the uh the crypto uh the tron guy um bought it for uh for 4.6 million dollars bought a lunch with him i think he wasn't actually able to attend it in the end there was some whole thing but the year before that it went for like 3.3 million so there's definitely a massive market for the warren buffett charity uh charity lunch but i don't think tai lopez is quite on the same level as it um and to me it looks like uh looks like a cash grab cool you know it's like the duck test man if it uh it's like if it looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck it's probably a duck uh that's kind of how i feel about it so i'm hoping to be being proven wrong but i don't think i am interested in investing in commercial real estate but not sure where to start me too well lex has

guest coming up don't we yeah so we have and and we'll we'll let him in once he gets on but i'm super excited to have this discussion because i've been wanting as you know you know one thing that's been on my list for a while to talk about like future of work talk about the return to the office return to work how different companies are managing it you know how the market is going to decide whether fully remote or fully in person or hybrid is the right model and what works best for startups for big businesses etc and i couldn't really figure out who the right person was to have the discussion and then it came to me when i read this wall street journal article about matt mullenweg who i think you know um or you've met at some point in the past but matt you know he was actually the creator of of wordpress so he's like an open source og um has been around for a while is like an amazing entrepreneur and now he's the founder and ceo of automatic um and uh and the company's i don't know it's what like a multi-billion dollar company today has grown incredibly but i recently saw this article that was entitled this ceo lets his employees work whenever they want from wherever they want and it was like the future of everything section in the wall street journal and so i just realized this is the guy we have to have on to uh to have a discussion around this yeah absolutely i'm excited to chat with him um i met him many many years ago so we'll see if he remembers me yeah he's um i mean he has an incredible incredible background i actually looking it up automatic is actually the company behind wordpress so it's not like some new iteration he's continued building um off of that open source foundation yeah i think what i what i'd love to learn from him is you know he's been doing remote since before remote was cool and i know that he's got a lot of like processes in place for meetings and just running a smooth you know operation so i think a lot of us listening you know and i run a remote company and i'm always trying to figure out how can i make it you know as as fun as possible and is and yeah and i i know that he's done that successfully so i'm here to learn yeah it's um it's such a hot button issue right now too they'll return to work and how people are thinking about it like there's it definitely feels like this black and white camp of um you know if you're not back in the office uh you know you're dead like i saw uh keith keith reboy um the founders fund and you know amazing entrepreneur investor um tweeted out this morning uh you know in response to a tweet saying that startups so someone tweeted startups that buck the trend and commit to in person are more likely to hire great young talent i'm seeing talented young engineers say they are quote done with remote and keith responded true uh replied back to him in his in his typical punchy fashion um that he operates on twitter so i thought that was an interesting backstory to it too yeah [Music] amazing first of all um amazing response oh what's up matt hi hey matt what's going on i'm doing pretty well thank you so much for having me today where are you uh where are you joining us from actually houston texas nice nice so you haven't hit quite the like swampy summer months yet within uh within houston no it's chilly rainy and cold oh man well thank you uh thank you so much for making a few minutes of time i know you're busy and have a ton going on and um the world is in a lot of flux right now so really appreciate it um you know this is super casual we don't consider this an interview show by any means um we really just like to have amazing people like yourself come on and join us to jam on interesting things and so one of the things we've been talking about a lot has been the future of work right like what what happens upon this like reopening of the world that it feels like we've been talking about now for two years by the way and finally maybe now we're starting to get to it um but i first came across you um in this wall street journal article that you're probably been sent a million times that was talking about your perspectives on where the world is going and it was talking about how you let your employees work asynchronously from wherever they are in the world um can you just start maybe by giving us like a little bit of background on where that ethos came from like greg pointed it out you've been doing remote since you know way before remote was cool and in vogue um so we'd just love to get your perspectives on like where that ethos came from and and um you know and how it's kind of played through the automatic story yeah sure so the company i'm a ceo of is called automatic but we were born automatic was born out of an open source project called wordpress that lives at wordpress.org it's all volunteers and like many open source projects um it was developed online from people all over the world so myself the co-founder had never met in person he was in the uk i was in houston texas where i am today and um that was actually not new for open source if you look at the linux kernel or mozilla or all these sorts of things they were typically passion a community is a passion that came together from everywhere so uh although that was new for companies and we got a lot of pushback once i started a company in 2005 2003 when wordpress started open source had been doing this for 15 20 years so it felt very natural yeah it's sort of like the um you know when people point out the like evolution of the internet and everyone talks about web3 now um it's kind of like what's new is also old because you know the web one ethos of all the open source protocols that were developed is very much the ethos of what we're talking about today it's just there's new you know adaptations of it in this in this new world um so it feels like this is kind of the natural extension of that as you talk about it matt did did you ever have a did you ever have a stint in san francisco was there ever a point where you moved the company to san francisco because i do remember a um presence a big automatic presence uh like on the bay somewhere yeah so my story i i had um gone to university of houston for two years and then a company called cnet paid me to drop out moved to san francisco in 2004. so this is about year year and a half after wordpress started but about a year before i found the company and definitely you know part of founding the company was going out there it was amazing for me to meet people and be influenced and like san francisco is definitely where my tribe was you know people who are passionate about building the web passion about technology so i still love san francisco i think i'm the last one like i spend time there my mom's out there right now like i i actually really love san francisco so and we uh at first had like a desk in our investor's office so true ventures had a spot on pier um you know instagram was upstairs there was it was a fun spot and um and then later that expanded office next door came available so we we had it but it was always like a lounge like we've never actually ever done permanent desk or places but we did want a place for people to get together and to host community events and do wordpress meetups and so like i'm a big believer in in person and physical space a big part of automatic culture is actually meetups where we bring either the whole company or teams together a few times a year but it just felt like the best most talent in the world was not in san francisco regardless of all the smart people was meaning it felt like a very small pond efficient so we were trying to compete with the googles and facebooks of the world like we had to fish in the ocean not the same pond they were fishing in so by redefining the game particularly in uh hiring talents it allowed us to flourish even though we had much less funding and you know typically made a lot less money than these other companies especially in the early days how do you think about scaling the kind of serendipity that comes from being in a location you know and i say that in the context of san francisco because i think part of the um you know the glory days of san francisco if you will there was this amazing vibe of serendipity where you could walk out on the street and you'd run into the person that you ended up co-founding your next business with because there was just this like incredible entrepreneurial vibe energy i went i was at stanford and i was kind of at in school during those years and you know even after when i started working going to the gym like you just run into these amazing entrepreneurs you know investors founders etc um how do you do that like where is the serendipity in this more remote or hybrid world how do we how do we find that uh twitter you know like you know the exchange of ideas now there is something to be said for like your kids going to school with someone else or like that is cool but i think for the like exchange and debate of ideas that moved online 10 15 years ago you know because through blogging at first and then micro blogging with twitter and like all these other things like that was where the ideas were shared and debated and everything and where the fun was and so now like even like i'll go to dinner in san francisco and people were talking about the essay they read online they're not talking about what you know marc andreessen said to them at the gym they're talking about the thing he posted or the new article everyone's talking about or um the latest newsletter that's that's what's uh i think pretty exciting about it the latest podcast like we're on right now you know that you don't have to be in san francisco to listen to this i do have a confession to make so many years ago um i met you actually at a jazz show how cool so i met in sf so i i was living in montreal at the time and you were there for the jazz festival i presume yeah and i met you and it was like the first time what you were one of the first people that i you were like i was you know i live in san francisco i work on this thing called wordpress i knew about it and that serendipity actually happened um and actually what ended up happening is you i think you might have introduced us to someone on our team on your team we ended up doing we ran an agency and we did we helped some companies actually move from their custom cmss at the time to wordpress awesome and one of the projects was techcrunch redesign i don't know if you remember that project and we worked on it and that actually is what put our agency on the map which helped put me on the map helped like steamroll my whole life what a cool thing yeah so well like so i believe in the serendipity of the internet and i also believe in the serendipity of like in person like what are the odds you know it's all about i think and and you know i'd love your reaction to this it's all about like increasing your probability of you know these encounters to happen and these encounters can happen in san francisco today or a jazz show in montreal but could also happen on the internet so you know what advice do you have for people who want to increase serendipity um say yes go to parties go to events go to conferences go to jazz festivals you know i actually used to spend every summer in montreal because it was an amazing city it still is i think and they had the jazz festival just for laughs the something foley i think there was like a french festival it was just an amazing city to be in so i'd always rent an apartment there for like a month in the summer um but we also you know a big part of the wordpress uh ethos is something called word camps which are community organized so that was also a reason i went to montreal so um inspired by bar camp which i was uh kind of a co-founding associate of um we said hey here's a template for running an event do it wherever you want just follow these rules make it free or cheap and there's been hundreds and hundreds of these in cities around the world and i actually early on i used to go to every single one because i was like if someone's going to do a conference about wordpress i'm getting on a plane and go in there so i'd fly hundreds of thousands of miles per year go to every single one and that was part of bootstrapping our community so that's i think you can you know like fortune favors the prepared um serendipity favors folks who are out there and meeting folks outside of your normal circle you just have to balance that i think also with you know deepening the relationships with the people you care most about and that was probably what i didn't do as well in my 20s in particular is because i was always on a plane you know and so when i go back to san francisco my friends would be like oh you're in town sorry we didn't know i write about this a lot i actually recently wrote a piece um uh about how to i mean i call it expanding your luck surface area or like expanding your serendipity surface area like you can actually i kind of think there's two types of luck there's like the very pure and raw form of luck which is things you truly cannot control you know where you're born who you're born to the kind of like baseline level of circumstances that you are given which is totally out of your control and then there's this more like amorphous fluid impure form of luck which is really the result of these like thousands of daily micro actions that result in this macro thing that we call luck um and i think about it in the context of have you ever seen interstellar yeah have you guys seen that movie the matthew mcconaughey movie and so so in that movie there's this um scene where they're talking about that tiny little planet that was next to the black hole and how they're talking about the the lack of life on that planet and there was a concept that they talk about which is basically that it's very low likelihood that a planet right next to a black hole can have life and it's because the black hole sucks up all of the lucky events that could have struck the planet and been the seeds of life like the random collisions the chaos theory the asteroid that has a seat of life on it etc the black hole just sucks all that up and i think about that a lot in the context of my own life because so much to me of getting lucky is just getting rid of the black holes that are in your life like negative people or you know pessimists who are around you like all of those black holes that are kind of the anti-luck and then also just expanding your own surface area like opening up your aperture so that all of those lucky things can strike and to your point matt like saying yes to things saying yes to everything in your 20s is a great way to do that you can't get lucky watching netflix on the couch at home you can if you go out and you meet people or even if you're in a discord and you're engaging with people in good faith you can get lucky doing that um and so it's like deliberately taking actions that expand open the aperture expand your serendipity surface area um feels like the path to going and kind of making your own luck as it were i love that i'll have to check out that essay and how cool that that's an essay and i think even of people that we now think at the very top of their game um use online to connect with others you know like it's kind of funny when i first moved to san francisco i was introduced to mark hendrieson to invest in automatic but at the time this was before he had written his amazing blog post he hadn't really like had his blog and so i viewed him totally wrongly as more like a an internet 1.0 guy who was like didn't really know what was going on but wait i was totally wrong um and later once he started publishing i was like wow this person is is a genius you know like what would injuries and horror words be without mark's seminal essays and ben's amazing books and essays you know like their writing is part of how they they disrupted the vc model and became injuries and horowitz which i would take for granted remember that they were like newcomers to the scene it is a great point you know writing in public sharing in public sharing your ideas and insights is such a powerful way to go you know attract growth and luck in these opportunities because if i'm sitting like i'm sitting here recording this from my house and in new york in the new york area i kind of like my reach physically is very small it's like this room right but with the internet my reach is literally global and if i put ideas out there even when i you know when i started sharing on the internet i had zero followers and i just started sharing and you kind of develop it consistently it starts growing you're like casting this net of magnets out into the world that you know with your ideas with your insights with whatever you're sharing that really can attract millions you know billions of people at scale um who can come and find your ideas be attracted to them maybe be repelled by them and push the other way but you're really casting out into the universe in a much more kind of vigorous and broad way than was ever possible in history the best hours i have spent in my entire career are those writing and publishing and i'll pitch wordpress here too have your own site you know if it's a medium essay or something like that people just remember that was on medium they don't remember your design your name your everything so it's really nice to have a differentiated presence online yeah right before this we were talking about keith roboy had this tweet um or he was just talking about how uh what was it sahil like basically someone had tweeted you know that startups were starting to buck the trend um and commit to more in person and that there were like a lot of talented young engineers who were saying they were done with remote and keith responded saying he thought that was true um and so greg and i were chatting about that kind of having a debate about it like is it true that young people are going to buck the trend of remote um you know and why like is that going to happen or not and and my my pushback to that whole like energy is it the core assumption there is that it's very first of all it's a very us-centric point of view so not everyone has the ability to apply for a job move to san francisco go work in miami you know we have a lot of listeners in india and nigeria and kenya um these are these huge opportunities aren't just as readily available to walk into these doors and apply and start working so i think writing um is such a great way just to attract um opportunity and just building right i mean for engineers your code is your code and it's a universal language and if you're building and developing amazing things you will find amazing opportunities in this era i think it's fundamentally changed right it used to be um very much the case that talent was evenly distributed but opportunity was not i think we're slowly moving towards a world and we're not there by any means but we're slowly moving towards a world where opportunity is evenly distributed and that if you're a kid born on the street in india but you have the internet and you teach yourself to code or to develop or write you'll have as many opportunities as a kid you know born in greenwich connecticut that goes to private school and gets into harvard and i think that's a noble mission that we should all you know be in favor of uh you know a world where everyone has kind of equality of opportunity we're you know i'm a capitalist and so i am all for um unequal outcomes because i think that you know performance and doing well like you should be rewarded for outsized performance but equal opportunity with unequal outcomes and i think companies need to evolve to take advantage of that new global landscape so something we didn't do when we started but we switched in like 2012 2013 was paying the same salaries regardless of geography right it's the same work it's the same job you're creating the same value for the company and the um and the customers so you should make the same pay uh guess what that's an amazing innovation actually there was a i don't know if you saw this map there was an article in the atlantic maybe like two three weeks ago that was all about tech companies trying to do the like um geographic discrimination on pay you know like someone in san francisco would move to nashville or move to boise and um the companies would cut their pay and that was like the original assumption of big tech post right when covet happened and then i think a lot of them got a ton of pushback to it now they're adapting to it by saying like you're not going to get the same pay increases so you're not going to get cut down but you're going to have less opportunity to accelerate and grow because there's going to be like pay bans based on where you live and i agree with you i just feel like it's a very myopic view of the world and of kind of how we're developing as a society great i hope they do that so we can hire more people but also think about it that if you're like let's say you're hiring out of india as an example if you're going to pay the global rate you're going to get the very best people the most connected et cetera in that country maybe if keith company keith's company is not he's not going to get the best person out of those countries and i think in the war for talent it's not about in in office is the future or distributors of future anything i think it's about giving people the choice and the autonomy so at automatic you you can work wherever you want in the world or you can work in san francisco too if you love that environment go great by all means move to san francisco if you want to work from home great if you want to go to an office guess what we have a co-working stipend we'll give you 250 per person per month to go to a we work or a coffee shop or wherever you want to go so you you can be around that energy you can go to miami and be at the same co-working spaces keeps companies if you want like that's fine so it's just about giving that choice and that's where i think people really thrive because some people do want to be in an office environment great they can work for automatically in the office environment we allow people in the same cities to pool together so again pre-covet people in the same city would often like get together once a week or something have lunch that's all things the company can support it's not like uh it's not like some you have to choose one way or another and that you're wedded to that forever you just have to listen to your people what do they want the cool thing about a lot of this too what you pointed out is the market will decide right they're going to be companies that do this there are going to be companies that say no you have to be back in the office five days a week and work you know synchronously and uh the old way you know the kind of industrial era style of work and then they're gonna be companies that like automatic you know take a much more forward thinking perspective on it and the market will decide you know that the best talent will flow to the places where they want to work where the environment is what they want to work in and the companies will either do really well or they won't and we'll know you know in the next five 10 15 20 years we'll know what the future of work looks like because the market will determine it in a lot of ways um you know talent can vote with their feet as it were which is a really cool thing i think by the way we're talking about companies like their monoliths but it could also be within teams or divisions within a company you know we're 2000 people now uh we hired 700 last year by the way so you can scale this quite a bit if a team wanted to be in person or get an office i'm fine with that that's an experiment we could run and maybe it could sort out maybe there's already 10 people living in a city and they want to go into an office every day sure they can try that that's what they want to do i'm not i'm not like religious about these things it's about getting the work done and serving customers it's not about how we got it done how do you think about time zones and time zone working a lot of people have teams where they'll have you know some people in europe some people in east coast west coast i know some companies like shopify will basically create teams remote but in certain time zones so you you know only est pst but they don't care where you live how do you think about time zones and synchronous versus async i think for teams it's good to be in a range i'm actually okay with a range of up to seven or eight hours so like europe and us is okay because you can still overlap for an hour to a day and that's that's usually plenty if you need a lot more you're probably having too many meetings but we did make the mistake and no longer put teams that are spread across you know kind of like asia pacific americas and european time zones because that's just bad for everyone but i think it's great for a company to have that because by the way that makes 24 7 coverage way easier for things like support or anything you know systems or anything you need responsiveness and 24 7 coverage of which every business at scale does for certain things it's it's fantastic to be international it's been actually for example we acquired a company called tumblr that was primarily in the new york and actually richmond region and a big thing we've been doing is trying to increase the responsiveness of their support by hiring more folks internationally they would uh develop much bigger queues on weekends and outside of the u.s uh east coast time zones hours and so that also meant that bad guys would start to take advantage of the eastern hours you know they knew that there would be longer response times they did things in the middle of the night in new york no longer can you talk about tumbling for a second i was like a tumblr kid so when i you know i saw that you all bought bought them i was just excited to see that you know some some tlc was was gonna be put to that platform so i'm just curious is there is there anything you can share around why you bought tumblr and and why and maybe some plans of where you're taking it well one tumblr is really cool it's social blogging done right so it's got the best of a social network and the best of blogging um it is majority so 55 uh under 24 and under so it's a young blogging network which is neat it's different than wordpress's demographics it's primarily mobile 85 on mobile it's still doing tens of thousands of signups per day very active and um it's actually the i think the the queerest social network it's about at least a quarter lgbt plus so it's it's a really fun creative space for art and artists and um we took it to turn it around and actually you know some news as of february 1st i'm running it personally so i'm day-to-day running tumbler a ceo um working on the product working on design working on the tech working on everything and so hopefully we can accelerate the pace of uh iteration and be something if you haven't used it in a while i strongly encourage you to check it out reinstall it and try it out again it still has a purely chronological feed so we need to make that an onboarding experience better but when you get your feed dialed in it's one of the funnest places on the internet so before we um before we let you go matt i i'm um i'm curious to just get your perspective you know the ceo of a massive you know multi-billion dollar company now which you've grown super fast from a team perspective um but you're not a um loud showy you know jump up on stage pound your chest type guy it hasn't been to karaoke that's true i'd love to go to karaoke with you actually um we'll do that sometime i will come visit houston we'll do that i've actually been to a great karaoke place in houston that i'll send you but um you don't strike me as that type can you just give us um a couple of like your kind of realizations or lessons on leadership um that have allowed you you think to be successful or what you've learned along the way maybe that you've changed your mind on um as it comes to leadership yeah i know we're at time but the i guess the main thing is that i am not like the rah-rah running around on stage ceo and i used to really try to change myself to be and it just didn't feel natural didn't feel authentic but that's the whole point of an executive team is you can hire people who are great at the things that you're not so as you grow your team your company um you know i've especially looked for folks who are maybe a bit more outgoing in that way or a bit more like certain in how they talk about things where i might be like a little more soft-spoken or nuanced or academic sometimes in my speech so yeah just look for that um and just but do do you it's a great realization so when i tried to change it wasn't as good it's a great one yeah i apologize i gotta run thank you so much yeah no i appreciate it i thank you so much thank you so much for joining us join our free community at trwih.com [Music]

our culture is a you know instant gratification culture and deal making and deal finding couldn't be less of that it is like massively long-term-ish pain for even longer long-term gain because you know yeah saw hill and greg you could go buy a company tomorrow great but like probably not the best company if you can close in 24 hours so um so i think the hardest thing is really just the fact that you have to look for deals for a while everybody's like anybody who's bought a house recently who's had like an awesome experience in house fine like oh my god they're so cheap there are plentiful deals all around no right everybody's like this is a nightmare i'd rather have an actual colonoscopy so that's what it feels like to do a deal i think it's brutal so that's the bad part the bad part is it sucks to get deals done it takes a lot of work and you have to realize that um it's not like content where it like grows little by little it's like it's miserable miserable miserable and then you do a deal and you're like oh this is awesome and one deal can offset an entire salary or make you independently them see your wealthy cause they just want you in that same old predicament of the company think on it prey on it sip a cup of tea

i was really burned out and but the crazy thing about finance i think a lot of people connect with this these days with the great resignation and stuff you guys have talked about here before um i was like man i'm making really good money but i am so tired i don't even want to use it i have more points than anybody could ever have but i don't want to get on another plane and so i started trying to think about my access strategy and in finance we don't really have that many skills like we can look at numbers and like i guess we can sell people things uh at varying prices but i was like what could i go do and at the time um i was investing in a few private equity deals and we did one deal that made a ton of money uh for the investors and it was actually in the hvac and plumbing health services space and i remember like helping them finalize this deal and i can't remember what the exact number was but at the end of it the guys who ended up closing this deal repackaging the stuff and then reselling it made tens of millions of dollars and i made whatever i made at the time did well but not tens of millions and i remember thinking god this business is so straightforward and i bet there are other businesses like this for sale and why am i like making money for all these other guys why couldn't i just go do this deal by myself and so um i started thinking about what would be like the laziest way to buy a business and have some roi on it that didn't mean that i had to understand how heating and you know cooling units work because i didn't know how to do that or go clean somebody's house because i didn't want to do that and so i stumbled upon literally by accident laundromats um and we ended up buying one that wasn't actually the first deal we would have i did a slew of them and when i say we i've had varying deal partners anytime i start on a new venture i always try to partner with somebody else that's done something like it before so i don't lose a bunch of money but um laundromats car washes um things like production services for like this podcast for instance i just started saying well if i could do these big deals in finance private equity why couldn't i do them by myself and i started my own little mini holdco company back when i didn't really know what that meant don't don't let them see your joy cause they just want you in that same old predicament company sip a cup of tea it of the

[Music] every single time we get on i'm obliged to make fun of greg's headphones and headset um so let me just register that as something for today i'm two whiskey's deep i'm not i need to make fun of greg's headphones i'm actually no i'm i am i am one pre-workout drink and one and a half dunkin donuts large cold brews deep though oh my god how are you not having a heart attack see this is what i was saying cody before we started recording you said oh isn't sleeping on a bat isn't sleeping on a soft bed bad for you and i said maybe but like there's a lot of things i do that might be bad for me and there you have it there's one please no i don't i couldn't do that not to mention like weren't you a pro athlete isn't this what's going on here uh yeah well i mean caffeine was a huge part of that though um i mean i the the reason that i have to drink this much caffeine is actually because of my athletic days because i so i'd hurt my shoulder at the end of my career and in order to go into a game pain-free i literally was taking um not to mention the things they would inject you with and whatever like you know anti-inflammatories but i was taking um four excedrins which i think each have like 100 milligrams of caffeine plus drinking a large rock star before going into a game and that was at like i was a late reliever so it would be at like nine at night i would pop four excedrins chug a rock star and then go into the game and there were a few times when i got on the mound and i literally couldn't [ __ ] see like the catcher would be putting down signs right there like doing the one two three whatever and i would have to tell them like no you have to do body signals because we had body signs that you could do because i cannot read your fingers because like my vision was sort of shaky that sounds like a good idea yeah it was a blast it was a blast but that's why i have to drink so much caffeine now because i feel like i blew out the receptors i don't know about you guys but i've had a pretty bad relationship with sleep for most of my life i never had much of a routine around it and honestly my performance suffered my ability to recall information to think clearly to think creatively suffered because of my sleep but now i've found something that changed the game for me and that thing is beam dream a functional sleep product that has really changed my life i'm excited to get to share it with you all today and so that you can get a special discount to try it 98 of people surveyed fall asleep faster when taking beam dream and 99 percent of people

me just water i'll be the healthy one on this podcast well we uh we're just so excited to have you because first off i have been an admirer from afar for a long time prior to us becoming friends of all of the content you put out the different things you write about and also how you're actually like a doer greg and i talk about this a lot there's a lot of kind of idea people out there and i probably bucket myself into this you're actually a doer because you're going out and getting this [ __ ] done in uh in a real world and then talking about it and teaching people along the way so kudos thank you sometimes you know best days yes for sure yeah and it's it's new right like i feel like you're not just um regurgitating other stuff on the internet and putting it out there like you know people like you nick huber um people like that who um are talking about you know boring quote unquote boring businesses um and just like spreading the gospel there um you know we all thought you know at least i thought like okay you know if i'm going to go into business i got to go raise venture capital i got to go do this whole thing i got to move to san francisco um and you're and you're teaching people that that's not the case and so it's really cool to see well thank you yeah it's been fun i was just talking to a bunch of investors today about it although i get why you guys all moved to san francisco i thought you were nutty back in the day you couldn't have like paid me to live there during the heyday but now that i'm in austin i do get it i get the power of place and that when you walk out and you have investors and people everywhere i get i get it i get why san francisco existed in its traditional form before like right now actually i think san francisco i'm gonna go short san francisco um and it's like trendy to be short san francisco so it kind of pisses me off that i am um like you know if you go listen to keith a boy who i think is awesome or you know some of these other uh miami folk that are like very short san francisco vocally or you go to the like vc crowd in san francisco who is actively um talking about how bad san francisco is now i just think the um the previous allure of living there i lived in the bay area for 12 years so i lived there until from 2009 until summer of 2021 when we moved to new york now and we're live in the suburbs outside new york um but the allure of san francisco was exactly what you said it was that you could walk outside and there was like venture capitalists here amazing founder here you know you go to the equinox in palo alto i met some of my like most amazing mentors at this random equinox in palo alto because you were just in it and it felt that way but that has just fundamentally changed about the place and they haven't done anything to promote the cost of living being better i mean it's so [ __ ] expensive to live there and you pay extraordinarily high taxes the weather in san francisco is kind of trash the bay area is super nice around it and really nice but san francisco is really cold and people have left i mean now that you can work from wherever and you can live in austin all the tech companies have amazing campuses in austin people have moved to miami people are moving to new york you just have other options if you want to be a founder or you want to go build something you don't have to be in the bay area in the way that you had to i think 10 15 years ago now i totally agree although you know what cracks me up about this being trendy now to say this about san francisco like i was listening to the all in pod which i really like but i was giggling because you know a bunch of them were like ah that's terrible newsome whatever i'm like i know that if i looked up the voting record of you guys most of the people in tech are the reason why it is where it is today because i think we should just start off by like taking off at least half of your listeners and that's probably good for your show um but like i find it really funny that now it's like all silicon valley people are leaving like it's a surprise what's happened there so i don't think you're um you know while it might be trendy to say it i think you know a lot of us have probably be been in the weeds kind of like doing the work trying to make businesses more profitable and not simultaneously talking out of both sides of our mouth so i always that always gives me a giggle i'm like well yeah i mean i'd be curious greg for your perspective because you you lived there um for a period you came that was like the gl that was the golden land for you right like you came from um living in canada and that was like where you had to be that was the mecca so like what was your experience with it and would you live there now like would you start a business there yeah i mean when i i left canada because i had to um you know not because i particularly want to all my friends and family were there in canada and but what happened was i knew that if i wanted to increase the probability of success i needed to go there so i went there and when i was in my 20s i was like you could you know let's just let's put it this way you increased your odds of success if you went to san francisco if you're in a third or fourth or fifth or even second tier city um so it's like the surface area thing we've talked about this greg like you expand your surface area for luck to happen if you're in those environments because you're on the street there's random people that you that you see building so you think that's changed so like for example one one of my first trips to san francisco you know i was at a party and i ended up meeting the ceo of a company called stumbleupon and um you know he was like i want to buy your company basically at the party um like that only happened in san francisco at that time um now you know the center of gravity is the internet in my opinion and the most like if you want to be really efficient with your time like you know bang out a bunch of zoom meetings um organize your day you know i just feel like travel time and it's just you know it's just it really i i believe and this might be a hot take because i know everyone's like all about going back to the office go to places like new york go to places like san francisco but i do believe that the most efficient use your time is to be internet native and internet first yeah i do so the thing with the um to just like connect to your point on the internet is now the new standard like i am short on two sides like i am short the um i'm short san francisco like i think san francisco is dead as a city i just i think san francisco is super overrated as a place to live and i get [ __ ] for this all the time people yell at me my sister-in-law lives there and she's amazing and awesome and enjoys it a lot i think san francisco is like a pretty crappy place to live nowadays i'm also short the idea that you literally don't have to be anywhere in order to um do amazing things like i still think that human connection and being in person and seeing people and being in it still matters to some extent so what i think is the future is going to be this like hybrid where you're either in a city where you can still you know kind of have some more level of connection or you just spend more time going to the places where you can do that because i still i still think human connection like our bias is to be connected as humans and to actually experience touch of a physical human in a real way um that you just can't replicate in the internet metaverse whatever people want to say i don't think you can replicate it okay i want to respond to that real quick and then cody curious your perspective so all i'm saying is if i had to pick a default default being san francisco in south of market like you're in it um spending you know spending 24 7 there or my default being like anywhere else basically and spending you know meeting people maybe once a month in these like short high bursts kind of like you know if it's like eat denver if you're in crypto or you know there's just so many different like conferences and and sort of south by southwest things like that where you just like come in and you're like hey i'm a real person i swear um i'm long that that world i actually totally agree and i think it's gonna be more like deal vacation at the same places like i mean i think it'll be like me running into sawhill in miami like we did i was there for something he was there for something we both ended up being at the same hotel and we're like oh yeah by the way we should probably do a pod we should do a thing what are we like oh yeah i met you before at another conference um we don't live in the same state but like i probably text you randomly more than i do a lot of friends that live here in austin so i think i'm long on that i think in the future we're going to uh we're going to live where we used to vacation and we're going to just go work where we used to live and that will be the the default mechanism i saw it massively i was just in santa teresa costa rica and the place is booming jack dorsey's got a spot we got gisele and you know brady's down there there's dirt roads there's like no infrastructure and we have this massive tech scene that's happening in santa teresa costa rica where the wi-fi is enabled by a bunch of tech tech dudes and so i actually agree with you i think and then there's also this other thing we split time between austin and san diego unless you're the irs that i'm only ever in austin and um the reason that we do with uh with san diego is because when you're in austin there's so much going on right now that i get fomo and then i actually miss the deep work and so it's nice to jet in and out as opposed like i couldn't operate like you guys do in new york there's too much going on yeah you hit on a bunch of interesting things there first off i think the infrastructure like just from a business idea standpoint the infrastructure that will enable that future that we're all kind of surrounding around as being the future is very interesting first off starlink and what it's enabling in terms of being able to live wherever and have high-speed internet is [ __ ] amazing and so like people can say whatever they want about elon musk and hate him love him whatever but starlink is [ __ ] incredible and the ability to go get high-speed internet access in the middle of nowhere in costa rica or the middle of nowhere in nevada you know iowa wherever you want to go build a place and a ranch and have an escape that's incredible and game changer developing world it's going to be a total game changer all of the things that are going to allow you to kind of do more short-term stays cost-effectively and kind of convene these groups are going to be really interesting i'm investing in that space a little bit but it's hard to see like exactly what's going to work because right now short-term rentals still very expensive it's hard to actually manage as a lifestyle for most people on most kind of living salaries and wages a lot of interesting things though happening there um and then to your point on deep work i've never really thought about that i've never considered the fact that like you need a place to be able to escape and do it greg you have your place in montreal i think that's probably a cool example of it there's not as much going on there as there is in miami i mean i really i'm sad we were literally just texting about this right before where i'm an unhappy person unless i have big blocks of time devoted to like deep work like you know some people you know don't have caffeine and you can just like read it on their face and they're just grumpy me it's like the deep work time um was that a was that a shot at me right there do i get grumpy on you when i don't have caffeine greg no you don't actually you it's funny when i get text from sahil it's either he's highly caffeinated or he's one or two whiskey's deep and there's basic that's basically like 99 of my life bro and i love it you catch me first thing in the morning or like i don't know i mean by the way i don't drink that [ __ ] much like no i'm i'm realizing my mom is like texting me oh like are you drinking too much because i'm doing these threads on sunday night when i have a couple drinks and i write and it's freeform and it's fun for me i really enjoy it but it's leading to this perception i think that i literally am just drunk all the time and i need to figure out how to like balance like i do i enjoy whiskey and i really like having whiskey um but i'm also i work out every single day and like i eat very healthy and so i don't know i think i think i need to like drive a balance in the branding here i don't know i think the rocks proved that you could basically talk about your tequila brand ad nauseum and nobody thinks about you that way so i think maybe it's just a whiskey brand the next step and then you can have an excuse for talking about it so much you know can we um i want to just shift gears because i have one thing on my list that i do want to talk about before we get into a bunch of stuff that we had for cody um this openc hack um because i think we have an interesting group of people right on right now like greg is my web 3 guy that i learn a lot from i'm kind of like the i don't know curious observer trying to learn a lot etc and cody i feel like is more openly like questions all of these things from a first principle standpoint so i feel like we need to talk about it so openc just to set the stage like over this weekend this past weekend before we filmed this openc um had a hack um what was what was reported initially and a a hacker came in and stole hundreds of nfts worth you know well into the seven figures from a bunch of its users um to his credit open c ceo um co-founder devin finzer who i think we know greg i think you know him really like took control of the situation immediately came out and put together this great thread kind of laying out what their investigation was showing and basically what it sounded like happened was that someone duplicated an email of openc that looked like an opencv email and it was a phishing attack so anyone that kind of clicked into it um and connected their wallet thinking it was open c actually these hackers had access and the hackers were kind of smart in that they basically got access a few weeks ago and then did nothing they just sat there and there was they had access but didn't do anything right away so that it wasn't immediately obvious and then what they did was they went in and they stole a bunch of high value nfts and they sold them immediately at kind of like below market prices so that they would move quickly because my initial question with this ship by the way is like how do you steal an nft because now like it's an nfc so you can't display it because it's like oh that's the stolen nft um and you also can't sell it because it's like dude that nft is stolen like we all know that that's stolen it's the one image um so i'm curious to get perspectives on this because i think it's interesting it's interesting in the context of like decentralized versus centralized and the puts and takes on all of this um and also like what do you do with stolen funds on the blockchain because it's all public like i know where those funds are in the wallets that got the funds from these sales so greg maybe you go first and then i want cody's stake on this okay well first and foremost i want to say that when when this happened i think it was saturday night it ruined my my whole night my night was completely ruined so here i am having dinner you know some steak a glass of merlot i'm like kind of like relaxing you know at the end of a long week you know time off all of a sudden you know i'm walking to the bathroom i pull up twitter while i'm walking there and i see like openc hacked openc hacked nft is gone like ethereum gone and i'm like having heart palpitations like going into the bathroom um so i end up you know trying not to think about it put my phone in my pocket airplane mode you know aka panic mode and i get back to my apartment and it was just like two to four hours of me just trying to figure out what is going on and it was it was tough i didn't go to i basically did not go to sleep that night because i didn't know if my wallet or set of wallets basically were compromised um i think so that's that's how i felt that's the first thing the second thing is um we're gonna see more of this this is just gonna happen again and again and again until we figure out playbooks and you know yeah playbooks for security etc so basically it wasn't a hack everyone was saying you know openc was hack open2 was hacked opencv wasn't hacked people were being fished and the difference between a hack and a fish is you basically got this email that looked like an openc email and they basically said hey connect your wallet and when you pre when you connect your wallet you know connect your wallet to go do this like basically housekeeping thing and when you connect your wallet it basically like wiped out your you know or it's yeah it basically had access to your wallet and then it wiped it out so cody what do you got yeah i think greg feels so stressed about this man i feel sad well yeah well i'm still recording i'm recovering i'm recovering from it and i didn't get fished you didn't i didn't get fish i didn't get fish but i did see that original email and i and i could tell that it was weird so i think like for everyone listening like if it's if it's weird if it looks weird like don't click that link like don't click links honestly like don't click links and crypto's not going to be mainstream until people could click links period yeah but that said i mean people get phished in their bank of america bank account today so like my take is like that will always exist no matter how intelligent the software gets and in fact i think it'll probably just get more and more difficult i mean you guys know this because your name's on the internet too but the amount of text i get every single day that's like cody you want me to invest in this crypto phishing or this crypto investment scheme and i'm like no that's the 332 fake profiles that are on instagram that text you from my account that look like me and so um you know that happens i think all the time and then imagine like what will happen once deep fakes start becoming real and somebody can pop up inside of you know greg's twitter dms and it looks like saw hill's video and he's like dude check this crazy thing out that i just got for this new shares like you gotta buy it right now on openc and then you click on it and saha literally told you to do it because it's a video of him um but it wasn't sahil it was a deep fake and so i think it's just going to get even weirder um the difference i also think you're like almost living in the metaverse right now how wild is that that open c could not even actually happen a hack to you but you could have a visceral reaction to it from something that didn't happen in reality the difference with mainstream that like with the traditional finance i agree with you you can get fish in your bank of america account but you're gonna get that money back um and if it happens like you'll be either insured and they will recover the money i've had that happen actually like i've gotten like sent a wire to someone that you know did a like asked for a wire and it was the wrong wire and you get the money back and like the fbi gets involved and it's there's like real due process around it with this there's actually no way to get these nft back nfts back in like a traditional way right and so that's the challenges like it's not fdic insured it's the the kind of the downside of decentralization in some context is that um you are self-custodying all of this there is not a bank that's actually holding this for you you are the bank which is a plus and it's a feature and a bug right the bug is if you're not really strict and good with security this kind of [ __ ] can happen and it will continue to happen i think there are going to be some like cool features and platforms and things that rise so that people are better about their own security and managing it but it is a unique challenge as an aside to this i got scammed which is a funny story with all of this it is like a watch out for it i want to see if i can actually just share my screen to show you guys this because i literally got scammed on an nft scam where i connected my wallet to something for a friend and lost like one eighth or something like that i actually don't here let me see if i can um let me see if i can share my screen because it's actually pretty funny so um context to this is our friend josh fabian uh greg and i are texting on like a saturday night uh josh is the founder of this really cool business metaphy he's like you know it's a 100 million plus business amazing um and josh hits me up he's like yo there's this dope nft drop of this clonex thing it's you know it was rtfkt um which late like a few days later got acquired by nike i think um it was super cool and he's like hey um you know i want to i want to buy one of these but like the money hasn't transferred to my meta mask yet like can you just get me one and i was like yeah sure i got you and so i buy him one and send it to him and then a few hours later i'm in bed and i get texts from being like dude they're doing a clone drop of the same thing but much cheaper we should get a few more of these and he sends me a link to this you know to the website and so i pull it up on my phone and it looks kind of normal on my phone and you know there's the normal like feature of connect your wallet to buy one and so i connect my wallet and i you know buy three at point three each each at the time i think eth was like four thousand or north of 4 000. and i click it and it goes through and then suddenly it's like hey put in your seed phrase uh in order to access your nfts and i remember being like that's [ __ ] up that's definitely not right and so i closed it out and deleted it and like disconnected my wallet um but the eth was gone right like i sent it to this thing and the ether was gone and the reason it happened well first off i gave my buddy a bunch of [ __ ] and he had to pay me for my lost eath and it was hilarious but the reason it happened was here i'm gonna share my screen if this works i don't know if you can see this um but this was the original site and it looked like beautiful it was beautiful design it like i took a screenshot of it it was like gorgeous really nicely done and then this was the um was the fake one and it wasn't even like size enabled like it wouldn't shrink it just was like really bad and shittily done um and i fell for it and it was like i don't know if anyone could see that uh on the thing when i was doing it but it was like very obvious if you were on a computer not obvious when you were on mobile and so i fell for it and it became this you know i lost four thousand dollars sending money to a scam has anybody ever recovered any of this stuff like is there a cyber crimes unit that goes after these sort of things and have they ever won well the bitfinex thing the bitfinex thing just happened where um you know that couple uh just got arrested like a couple weeks ago for like the four billion dollars of stolen bitcoin that they were trying to launder which is [ __ ] hilarious too because like it was 70 million and laundering 70 million feels doable but all of a sudden it appreciated and laundering 5 billion is literally impossible but they did recover a bunch of that from those wallets and so i think that's going to either be returned or go through some process but it's very difficult the most famous example i think was in 2017 or 16 with the dao um have you heard what happened there with the dao and the ethereum hard fork oh yeah tell that story that's an interesting story actually it's the original dao it's the original doubt it was like dow number one so these people had like the idea for the dow basically create the dao um raise like i don't remember 70 million dollars millions of dollars end up getting millions you know i think was like 40 50 60 million hacked and vitalik and this was all in eath and vitalik uh the co-founder of ethereum basically was like we're not gonna let these hackers get away with it so he basically forked ethereum so there's ethereum classic which is the original ethereum which is where the hackers they the hackers owned some of that eth and then the current ethereum which is ethereum eth uh you know so he basically happened yeah exactly hack never happened so he was able to you know that's the most famous example i think it's so funny and cody i want your take on this because like so i come from like a more traditional mindset on these things and i think it's so hilarious that you literally can have a world where you're like i don't like the thing that happened in the light in the like actual universe that was happening so i'm actually just going to be like record scratch like rewind actually no that didn't happen that path like that can keep happening but now i just created this alternate universe where like here's the [ __ ] that happened and we're gonna like go down this different path don't worry about over there um and the fact that you can do that programmatically and like create a world where those kind of things didn't happen is mind-bending and also kind of hilarious to me also i mean maybe shows my naivete but i'm not sure that i would want if what i want is decentralization and not having you know autocratic tendencies uh an individual to be able to do that either and i know there's this critique already about ethereum and um i don't know if it delved from this originally but i also don't love that i i might rather they get away with the hack then yeah the uh the free market mindset would be get away with that you got the hack like you you kind of in a capitalist sense you like figured out and exposed some glitch in the thing and you got away with it and got out but yeah i mean this is the big pushback like bitcoiners hardcore like bitcoin maxis um think like point to this as a classic example of like if it's possible that vitalik can literally just stand up and be like no this did not happen and move in the other direction with his like you know big whatever i'm imagining him like putting down a saber whatever those [ __ ] things a staff like no you shall not pass and we're gonna like go in the other direction if he can do that what else can he do um i don't know interesting anyway i feel like i went down this rabbit hole with cody that was so far off coin laundromats that i wanted to talk about that's bad i want to i want to circle back because that's way more interesting by the way cody yeah i don't know well we can happily talk about well i'm sure that'll be out of uh actually i was just looking at this atm deal totally random um investing in atms and there are funds that can do this and you can own a route of them and whatever um but i had to actually take the model and put a negative assumption on it that like in seven years you know this might not be necessary you know or unfortunately what does that look like in ten years um and because how these models work is you really make no money for the first three to four years you basically break even and then after it you can start to have a pretty nice little return but my thought was wow if we do it right we probably won't still be printing coins um and using them in that realm can we just like set the stage a little bit on you and your experience set so like i first came across you from a twitter thread that you wrote about you know you started it i was burned out in finance working on someone else's schedule tired of having my time tied to money so i started investing in cash flowing businesses not sexy startups but boring businesses one of my favorite small deals netted sixty seven thousand dollars a year and a hundred thousand at close with quarters and it is amazing thread i encourage people to check your twitter out at cody underscore sanchez um but it's an amazing thread about laundromats that you invested in and how you were making money off of it can you just like set the stage a little bit on who you are and how you came to be the like boring the queen of boring businesses on twitter tick tock all of the platforms that you're dominating now so funny um yeah making my father proud one quarter investment at a time um so uh i you know i was similar to you so i like we've talked about this before but i was traditional um investment finance background you know how do you know anybody worked at goldman they tell you immediately so like i did that whole thing and um and basically for a long time when this first happened i was running an asset management business in latin america so that was actually kind of fun we built up a business where we sold investments and structured investments for big governments sovereign wealth funds that type of thing so i was a young gun flying all around latin america and trying to talk them about different ways to invest and to be frank you know if anybody's worked in finance you know really long hours non-stop um and then really long plane flights like 13-hour red eyes where then i go have like 10 roadshow meetings the next day about equity deals whatever and so i was really i was really burned out and but the crazy thing about finance i think a lot of people connect with this these days with the great resignation and stuff you guys have talked about here before um i was like man i'm making really good money but i am so tired i don't even want to use it i have more points than anybody could ever have but i don't want to get on another plane and so i started trying to think about my access strategy and in finance we don't really have that many skills like we can look at numbers and like i guess we can sell people things uh at varying prices but i was like what could i go do and at the time um i was investing in a few private equity deals and we did one deal that made a ton of money uh for the investors and it was actually in the hvac and plumbing health services space and i remember like helping them finalize this deal and i can't remember what the exact number was but at the end of it the guys who ended up closing this deal repackaging the stuff and then reselling it made tens of millions of dollars and i made whatever i made at the time did well but not tens of millions and i remember thinking god this business is so straightforward and i bet there are other businesses like this for sale and why am i like making money for all these other guys why couldn't i just go do this deal by myself and so um i started thinking about what would be like the laziest way to buy a business and have some roi on it that didn't mean that i had to understand how heating and you know cooling units work because i didn't know how to do that or go clean somebody's house because i didn't want to do that and so i stumbled upon literally by accident laundromats um and we ended up buying one that wasn't actually the first deal we did i did a slew of them and when i say we i've had varying deal partners anytime i start on a new venture i always try to partner with somebody else that's done something like it before so i don't lose a bunch of money but um laundromats car washes um things like production services for like this podcast for instance i just started saying well if i could do these big deals in finance private equity why couldn't i do them by myself and i started my own little mini hold co company back when i didn't really know what that meant so i have so many questions here um first off you're you're crushing it in terms of actually explaining these things to people in a way that everyone can understand which i'm just obsessed with like i i often write about like feynman and you know kind of abstracting complexity and being able to deliver things in a simple way what you're doing is not simple and you make it feel like anybody can do it in a simple way and honestly you've probably empowered a lot of people to go and take control of their own lives this way which is very cool and you should be you should be very proud of can you talk about some of the um i don't i hate saying hacks but like the tricks and kind of um things you've done along the way that have made it um really attractive financially i've seen you write about like qsbs as an example is something that everyone should understand um anything there or with the like holding company structure you know a la warren buffett and berkshire hathaway like things that people that are listening to this should be thinking about if they're interested in going down a path of like acquiring and operating these operating companies yeah there's so many things well first of all everybody talks about real estate and real estate's ability to create wealth and offset taxation and it's true except that if you think about it a higher level where you make all the money is before the arbitrage happens right so like in the beginning of the stock market people made a lot of money when they could invest in primary with individual stocks because there wasn't a market that was democratized that was really easy to trade access on same thing with crypto people are making a lot of money while there's hacks and fail points and difficulties right and then over time what happens is those arbitrage opportunities um or the difficulty of doing something decreases which means the return typically decreases too and so this has happened in stocks it's happened in real estate um it will happen in crypto but i think we're very early stages and it hasn't happened yet in private deals either and so you know when we think about buying businesses my favorite part about it is that it's not normalized yet it will be um but for right now people still when i say well i buy businesses for a living what do they say to me must be nice how much did dad give you right like and there's also some sexism there by the way like a lot of sexism yeah yeah um but i think the the real thing that people don't realize is you don't need millions to do this to your point if i was going to give like two quick hacks on how to buy a business let me say to my car salesy voice like how to buy a business with little no money down but basically without the tick tock headline oh man i know but it's you know gets the people right about no it works anyway so um there's like two things that i think people should know about one is sba loans and so if anybody takes anything off of this podcast i think it should be go reach out to your local sba loan office they're all listed online and just take a meeting with them and say can you explain to me how i could buy a business using the government's money without having to have great credit or a lot of capital on hand and if you say that to somebody at the sba they'll explain to you the varian sba loans and that's the small business administration okay yeah so the sba is the small business administration you can go online and find they're basically banks that are sba bank that are sba partners and so they're kind of registered with sba and can make these sba loans and you can go anyone can go and apply to have an sba loan and they're extremely attractive terms for people that are going and taking them out right like really long duration low rates um really attractive they are personal recourse though right yes which means that you have to put your name on the line your money is on the line um but i would say like the thing that surprised me and a lot of people is they think well i have to have millions or i have to have a really strong credit and actually that would be true when you buy a house right you bet buy a house based off their prediction of your future cash flow that's what a mortgage is but when you go and buy a business they do it kind of the same way they buy you buy a business based off the future cash flow of the business or the assets of the business not you this is the coolest thing about private deals so i you you know this cody i spent seven years working in private equity and it wasn't a perfect fit for me i always wanted to invest in like the future kind of venture businesses but the coolest [ __ ] thing about private equity about private deals like what you're doing and it feels unfair and when i explained it to my dad he thought it was he was like wait what you're doing what you're literally buying a business with the business which is like the most absurd thing when you break it down in your own mind but you are buying the business with the future cash flows of the business so literally when you're going to buy a company you go and take out a loan that is underwritten based on the future cash flows that come from the business so you're getting money up front in exchange for the future cash flows the business and you're taking that money that you just got up front and buying the business with that so you can go in i mean in the context of some of the deals you're doing you get an sba loan you can get seller financing so the com the person who's selling you the business will actually finance part of it like you're going to pay them an annual kind of return on the money they're loaning you to buy it so in a lot of cases you can go in with so little down i saw a thread recently of someone that was like buying a business for fifty thousand dollars like a million dollar business he was putting in fifty thousand dollars to buy a million dollar business the return on that equity that you just put in can be exceptional if you run the business well and it continues to cash flow because you're literally buying a business with the business that's exactly right i mean that's where you get crypto level returns people joke but i mean you know like that laundromat that i bought the cash flows 67 000 we bought it for 100k and people were like no way that doesn't exist and i'm like oh my god you guys go to biz by sell which is the worst place to buy a business by the way like you never want to go onto public marketplaces sorry if they're listening it's always better to find the deals yourself but these these deals are everywhere they're everywhere it's totally normalized um the average price when you buy a business is two to three x profits and then go and look at the average you know um multiples or or earnings per share of some of the stocks that you see in the stock there's nothing for two to three x profits not revenue um and so and to your point sahil sixty percent of small businesses are sold with seller financing that used to happen in real estate doesn't happen anymore um really but in small businesses it's very normal i mean i bought a i bought into a a video production company with ten thousand dollars that does three hundred thousand dollars in revenue a year and about 150 000 in profit and i bought forty percent of the business for ten thousand dollars um and and the reason i did is one um the the business owner needed to get um credit didn't understand how to get financing and credit for the business overall so i did help in that value-add and then two i said hey i bet i could take your revenue and like double it with a few tweets um or like a couple newsletters so how about i give you 10k because you know we're buds and if if i don't bring you anything else decrease me where 10k is like pro rata like what i should actually earn for investing in you but if i do increase the business i want to have a percentage of equity tied to how much increase in business buy which is how i got the 40k the seller financing point i do want to just re-emphasize so that people really understand it this is like cody you want to buy my business for a million dollars i tell you i will finance or you pitch it to me but i will finance half of that and basically for me the benefit is like what am i going to do with that 500 000 where am i going to put it i don't know maybe i'm going to put it into s p 500 by the way like selling it maybe i'm not going gonna get i'm gonna have to pay taxes on it so it's not gonna be 500. so if i provide seller financing to you for half a million dollars you tell me you're gonna pay me an interest rate of eight percent on that in cash now that five hundred thousand dollars i'm you know now making what like 40k per year uh in actual cash income interest on that loan that i just made to you and i probably have a more tax advantage situation on the fact that i just rolled that to loan it to you and so for a seller it's actually pretty logical like where was i going to go and get eight percent in the market today um you know as a stable kind of like dividend income type situation not in a lot of places so it's a pretty cool thing that actually is uh logical for a lot of sellers to do totally yeah and i think you know i don't know what the average listener is for you guys but you can scale this up or scale it down so like if your wife uh let's say is coming back into workforce which is increasingly happening in large numbers and um you know can't find a job that allows for child care and the things that she wants to do i talked to a lot of women about okay why don't we buy a business you used to be a hair stylist you don't want to go have to do that the whole time why don't you buy this lawn here's how it would work you could buy a salon very cheap you buy a song for like 80k here in austin that does more than 80k in profit because they're hard to sell not everybody wants to go run that type of business and so i think you can do it at a low level and you could get all that seller finance or you could do it at high level which is private equity guys like me and you back in the day used to do you know 100 million billion dollar deals right so it's very malleable and then maybe the play for greg is we overlay web 3 on top of it somehow uh and we blockchained my laundry mats that's probably where this goes well i think uh you know i i have a question for you well while i have your time cody um so late checkout which is our holding company we've got an agency a studio and we've got a fund where we invest now we want to do more m a so we want to buy community based businesses what advice do you have to someone like me who you know is seeing a lot of traditional businesses that could basically apply this you know this new world uh on top of it be it community based or web3 um yeah just what advice do you have to me to give to me well first of all i think it's brilliant i was just on the phone with somebody talking about this one of the guy's name is alex hormozy i don't know if you guys know him he'd be good to have on your pod he's um he's become a friend but he just sold like 40 this is public but excuse me if i [ __ ] up the numbers he just sold like 40 of his company for something like either 40 or 60 million dollars to a pe firm and it was called gym launch and what it was is um education platforms to scale your gym up six figures and they did 85 million dollars in revenue um and he just sold a portion of his business and now he's starting something called acquisitions.com where he's basically buying unsexy community businesses and then helping them scale so the first thing you should do greg is definitely should let me into all your deals i'll definitely be value-added which is what i told alex hormozy too um but the second thing is um i think it's brilliant like my play i'm looking at one right now that's an accounting firm accounting business with 300 ultra high net worth uh um clients and i was like wait do you have educational uh products like layered on top of this it's an eight million dollars a year business he's like no i'm like oh my god here's the products we could do that would definitely juice you up to another four million dollars so i guess my point to you would be like don't just look at the sexy community businesses because those people are going to over inflate the value and you might be buying into a hype cycle um but i would say look at a lot of like the unsexy community what about like the dentist the accounting firm you know because there are those communities all over facebook all over everywhere that you could apply really intelligent community marketing and upsell of product on and make a big difference and then simultaneously for the sexy businesses how do you get them into the more boring things so we could like case like do you have one that you've already invested in um like that you could talk about i mean there's not not right now on on this pod but definitely want to bring you back to like go through it um but i think um you know there's for what we're really interested in is community lives in a bunch of different ways like it doesn't need to be a crypto thing it doesn't need to be like um you know a facebook group or a paid group like to your point like community could live in physical locations it could be like um you know we looked at buying like um as an example like a tennis magazine slash physical event business you know it's like it's been around for 40 years and it's it's you know this geography this interest these amounts of events but like what does that look like if you put you know nfts on top of it or or education or or uh you know what is the intersection between digital and physical look like totally well one thing we're doing too is i've never taken sponsorship dollars before and i actually called sahil and asked his opinion on this stuff and you helped me out so thank you we um just did our first sponsorships where we just cemented them we haven't put them out yet and one of the things that i'm requiring from people that we do sponsorships is one i want to invest in like whatever it is that i'm doing so i'm trying to get equity for every deal i do sponsorships with if at all humanly possible so that my content creation community can actually create a simultaneous hold co which will hold all the equity of the deals that we do inside of the sponsorship aspect of it and i don't think enough people are doing that like think about i talked to sam parr like another mutual friend of all of ours from the hustle um and i was like man how many you did sponsorships with x and y and z and he was like yeah guess what i even bought some of their stock at the time and i was like you did totally wrong totally wrong you should have 100 asked for private uh shares in these deals or some access to buy or warrants or options on it so that you do a deal with them and that you even buy in or give them money in exchange and then you have this hold of other equity in businesses that you partner with i should do that so this is brilliant so i have you know i have my newsletter my newsletter's smaller than yours cody mine goes to right now i think like 72 000 people and i have a team that sells the sponsor slots um and i they're all cash and it's great cash income i should really especially in the interesting companies i should just be taking at least i should be taking 50 equity and the 50 cash um should just be to cover the taxes on that and so if my tax rate is 50 which don't even get me started on but i live in new york and it's absurd um and i haven't figured out all the nicki we haven't had nick huber on or someone to tell me how to stop paying so much in taxes but if my tax rate is 50 um i could take 50 cash 50 equity deals use the 50 cash to pay the tax um and then have equity and a bunch of interesting companies it's sort of an interesting idea if they can find a way to do it yeah well i mean think about how did tim ferriss make most of his money he did like some really smart angel investments right into some early stage deals and i i don't think those were tied to sponsorship dollars but now i would imagine that he has equity in most of the deals that he talks about um joe rogan did the same thing um it's really not that dissimilar to what private equity firms require too hey we'll give you some investment some debts and et cetera but we're going to ask for a little icing on top we're going to ask for warrants for or some equity options in case you do really well we want the option to buy you so what um what are the things that you most like i'm i feel like we're painting this great picture of doing this you know buying boring businesses um you know the amazing financing the tax arbitrage all of these cool things um what are the like most common one or two or three things that people [ __ ] up like because i can see myself doing this and then being like oh my god that was such a headache and i need to get out of this and they're not super liquid so it can kind of be a pain like what do you if you're gonna go do this what do you need to be sure of what are the biggest screw-ups also paint paint like the the dreary picture of buying boring businesses like where does this go wrong yeah exactly well the first thing is is our culture is a you know instant gratification culture and deal making and deal finding couldn't be less of that it is like massively long-term-ish pain for even longer long-term gain because you know yeah saw hillary and drag you could go buy a company tomorrow great but like probably not the best company if you can close in 24 hours so um so i think the hardest thing is really just the fact that you have to look for deals for a while everybody's like anybody who's bought a house recently who's had like an awesome experience in house fine like oh my god they're so cheap great multiple deals all around no right everybody's like this is a nightmare i'd rather have an actual colonoscopy so that's what it feels like to do a deal i think it's brutal up front you're like comey i mean i went to this we almost bought this dental uh manufacturing company in chicago and so i fly out in chicago and like so they do like caps and like retainer things i think my friend justin ringo works for this company i don't actually think he does but he works for like a dental implant company that this made me think of that shout out on sexy businesses yeah so so we fly out it's like negative 12 in chicago it's miserable i asked for a salad for lunch they take us to portia pillows or something and so it's like cakes and pizzas like it's just my nightmare i'm lactose intolerant i'm like so mad that i'm spending my saturday and sunday there and then we're like combing through if you've ever been to a dental manufacturing plant imagine the inside of an office then imagine you take like a bomb of like dust and you exploded everywhere and like that's what it looks like because they're like sawing these implants so there's just everything's like caked it's just not a pretty situation and then um so i'm combing through financials like in the dust and um and i realized that the company the financials that they gave us i wasn't fraud necessarily i don't think but they basically were either fraudulent or their books were so horrifically tracked that every single dollar amount that they told us was wrong to the tune of like two million dollars and so they went from a company that was profitable to the tune of two million to barely break even at like a hundred thousand dollars and so you know and i wasted three months on that deal on like 20k in legal costs so that's the bad part the bad part is it sucks to get deals done it takes a lot of work and you have to realize that um it's not like content where it like grows little by little it's like it's miserable miserable miserable and then you do a deal you're like oh this is awesome and one deal can offset an entire salary or make you independently wealthy there's also just got to be operating you know expertise to it in my opinion like one of the things that i always saw in my pe days was like when you had a great team you always felt like a genius and that you could just do this forever because they're just great they figure out a way to win they figure out a way to grow or just continue to kind of produce margins and stable cash flows and when you find those teams you really want to press it and like go roll other things up and build underneath them because they're great but if you don't have a team or [ __ ] hits the fan it's a headache man owning one of these things because like if you if you buy a you know dunkin donuts franchise i love dunkin donuts shout out um and you don't have an operating team like it's not easy to run one of these places a coin like you know you're actually talking about one of the things that's beautiful about the things you're talking about is that they're actually not labor intensive and you can run them without having some amazing expertise buying a restaurant franchise requires a lot of operating expertise and you need people that really understand margins and food waste and you know all the labor etc and so you need to think too i think as part of all this about what businesses are not going to be an operating headache like what are these businesses that are recession resistant to your point that you make in the original threat about laundry people need their laundry done car washes have always been one that people really liked for that reason you always get your car washed even if there's a recession they're also a great place to launder money apparently according to breaking bad um but that's the other side of this to me is like you need to make sure that you're you know what you're getting into from an operating perspective with all of these can i add to that as someone who's run a lot of businesses and and as and as someone who's gotten slapped in the face so many times because if you run a business you're just like it's gonna hurt you know like we talked about the open sea hack and how i was in pain and nothing even happened to me like imagine like you running a car wash and all of a sudden everyone quits or you know so anything you know if you're gonna buy a business know that you're getting into business and if you're getting into business know that you're gonna get punched in the face and if you're gonna get punched in the face know that it gets hurt to get punched in the face so that's one thing i want i wanted to say the second thing is you're on you know if you are going to do let's say sba financing you know you're on the hook for that right like so my advice would be for for folks is um you know if you're interested in in buying businesses start by buying small businesses and and sort of grow from there so cody do you like did you start by buying smaller like doing smaller deals and then go to medium-sized deals and then larger deals yeah totally i mean i agree with you two things i'd say is like one i think the best business to buy is the adjacent business to what you already do so if you're an accountant you like being an accountant you want to keep doing the thing but you'd like to own the company that would be a good business for you to buy you already kind of know how to run sort of let's say that ecosystem maybe there's an operator in it so you can just replace your job with ownership so i think that's a good way to decrease risk two is certainly for every deal i'm always asking myself if the worst possible thing happened to this business what would we do do we have plans and so um you know if i don't know if my laundromat operator quit do i have a backup um and the when you start you're not going to have a lot of layers because it won't make sense your deals won't be big enough eventually you get to a level you know even definitely past me where you have multiple operators who run multiple businesses and if one goes sideways they can sort of they can you gotta you got gotta bench right you can tap in the next picture um but i would say in the beginning yeah you don't wanna i don't i've never done a deal that could bankrupt me it's probably why i'm not like massively massively wealthy i just haven't been comfortable with those risks but i've never done a deal that could kill me and so i think starting smaller that way even taking investor capital because you can have multiple people on an sba loan it doesn't have to be one they just have to close disclose some stuff so think about how to decrease your risk simultaneously you could buy a business with no recourse no loans and do it with equity other people's money then if it goes sideways not your problem or you could do revenue share and profit share so you just take a percentage of the business based on your ability either increase sales or decrease costs those are a couple ideas so i have like three takeaways from this i know we're running up against the end of time my three and i'm curious for yours um my three would be number one uh zig when other people are zagging which i just think is like core to a lot of the things you're saying which is like this is an area that has opportunity because not many people are doing it thinking about it or want to spend time on it it's like super sexy to invest in venture growth crypto whatever so returns get squeezed zig when other people zag and like do the thing that other people aren't thinking of um the second one would be uh running a business is getting punched in the face over and over again and figuring out a way to get back up kudos to greg for that one because i think that's um that's a great overall point um and you know then for me i guess the third one would be there's no such thing as a free lunch so we're giving all these tips um seller financing sba loans and to greg's point you're on the hook um and when you go do this you have to be accountable and you have to own it when you're going and doing one of these things and so like as a broad economic point there's no such thing as a free lunch if something's too good to be true it probably is and you need to figure out how to actually go and deliver against these things because at the end of the day you're on the hook and you have to be accountable for it i like it i like it i think you nailed it i've got a i've got my three number one there's more financing than you think out there like i feel like uh you know a lot of us you know work at companies and we're kind of just like oh i wish i can buy this thing i wish i could do this thing but i can never do it well actually maybe you can that's number one number two is cody you kind of alluded that you know while there's opportunities on marketplaces public marketplaces a lot of the deals are private like straight up like calling you know knocking on doors and pounding the pavement so um i would say my second takeaway is like a lot of action and private deals don't be afraid of pounding the pavement and my last is probably just get started you know small it's okay to do start small too you know i think like you don't need to be you know warren buffett and be buying massive companies from day one like find something that you know is feels maybe uh makes you a little bit uncomfortable but not too uncomfortable and and just get started yeah i mean berkshire hathaway uh right the original thing was like a cotton mill right wasn't it yeah it was like a textile mill so to your point exactly like warren buffett started out buying small unsexy businesses that's right yeah one thing which is i think about buying businesses like i think a lot of people think about buying stocks you know how you're like oh man um i'm drinking out of this yeti cooler and i just paid 70 for it and oh now it's publicly listed this is a bad example it's not public but you know something where like hubspot oh i use it as my crm and it's publicly listed but man it's so much cooler than anybody's giving it credit for and you go and buy the stock that's the best way to find deals it's like oh man i'm talking to my landscaper and he says his son doesn't want to take over the company but he services like all the people in my neighborhood plus his prices are really low i wonder what he's going to do when he retires that's the way to find the boring businesses this is um did you read one up on wall street peter lynch this was like one of the first books i ever read on finance i highly recommend it to people it's short easy read peter lynch who's like amazing i think fidelity mutual fund manager um but he writes his in this amazing book one up on wall street he talks about this exact thing which is like invest in what you know and his example was haynes in the very early days this is like way back when i don't know 60s 70s 80s or something like that and he like saw tons of people going in and buying these haynes pantyhose and his wife kept talking to him about it and so he went and invested and it became like a 100 bagger for a you know 100x return on haynes but that whole book is about investing in things that you really deeply understand that you see that you know so it's that exact thing i totally agree with it i think it's awesome i i could talk for hours but i'm actually meeting a founder of a play-to-earn game um who we're talking to about you know maybe acquiring so i'm gonna use these lessons and uh we need to hopefully it goes well episode on on play to earn with cody because i i need to get our hot takes on that too thank you so much cody where can people find you uh twitter cody underscore sanchez instagram tick tock the same and country follow her on tick tock because yeah that's like my my my feed is like 30 cody and i wish it was 70 cody that's how good her her like short punchy videos are so she gets to teach us her ways on tick tock we'll figure it out thank you so much thank you so much you're the best thank you i don't know about you guys but i've had a pretty bad relationship with sleep for most of my life i never had much of a routine around it and honestly my performance suffered my ability to recall information to think clearly to think creatively suffered because of my sleep but now i've found

new employee joins late checkout you basically send them a box of swag and it's awesome because people feel welcomed and and it's just seamless for like the company we don't have to like think about it yep you're a bootstrap business is that right for now yeah can you talk more about why you bootstrapped it and how that experience has been yeah for sure well first off like it wasn't meant to be this huge company you know like when you're an entrepreneurial kid you start lots of businesses like i had you know started when i was five years old selling things outside my house and it evolved into like ebay buying sewing trading cards and stuff so this was just one of many different things that i started and it just so happened to really take off over time but in the beginning it was just like startups love swag and there's not the go-to brand in the space to you know that every startup goes to you know because if you think of business cards everyone went to moo you know stickers everyone goes to sticker mule but swag was a much bigger market you know corporate gifting is a 200 billion dollar market kind of cause you there how did you realize that like when p people that are listening to this they're young they want to go build something they're ambitious what did you do to actually like happen upon that exact realization that swag was a big industry and no one was doing it well yeah and i don't know anybody in this industry or anything like that you know the the reason i i got into it and learned about it was in college me and a buddy launched an app so again just another one of the ideas or businesses that were started and the app was called click and it was basically a way to find kids on campus that are trying to play volleyball or you know doing this or that and you can see a feed of live events going on and in the process we want to put custom flags in the dorm rooms because you know i saw barstool sports had done really well by promoting on campus putting flags up in parties and stuff so we want to get flags and they were 140 in the u.s to just get like a polyester rectangle and i was like this is crazy expensive and then i got introduced to alibaba and found a supplier over there for eight dollars to get these custom flags so while we were launching the app i was like why don't we just get a little side website going and resell these flags from overseas suppliers so that's how i first kind of forayed into custom printing and then you know fraternities would be like hey can we get t-shirts from you and stuff and then you know i learned i knew the people that did trump's campaign merchandise too and i i went on their site one day and i saw on the bottom that was like powered by this you know network of distributors or suppliers and i went in there and you can see like there's all these suppliers you can get hard goods from like bottles and notebooks and so now in the back of my mind i had this like whole supply chain that that i was aware of um and i didn't do you know swagger wasn't then the natural progression after that but i always had that in the back of my mind and then i ended up you know i dropped out of school became business partners with an nfl player this guy and the giant steve weatherford oh yeah and we started the most jacked guy in the nfl insanely jacked yeah we were leveraging that persona to build like a fitness brand around him so we launched like training programs physical products and stuff and even with that we were bundling the digital programs like physical items like shaker cups and you know resistance bands and stuff so still in the back of my mind i knew about that stuff and then i ended up leaving that and joining a vc firm in new york city for like three four months a family friend of mine and this is where kind of startup and so i came together because i'm around startups every single day and you just realize like they're coming in they barely have any traction but the first thing they have is like t-shirts and you know mugs and all this stuff it's the first thing you do you get fun and you make a logo you get swag and you know if you there was just no company that stood out as like the startupy version of a swag company you go on these sites and for imprint and vistaprint and stuff and these sites look like they're from 2003 or four and they throw you into a sea of like way too many options and i wanted to build a brand that kind of resembled you know stripe and the types of you know platforms they're already using you know from a software standpoint but in the swag world so so one of the things you hit on there that i think is really actionable for people that are trying to find a new business idea like oh i want to be an entrepreneur they're entrepreneurial maybe they did lemonade stands like i read about your background you had done all this stuff since you were a kid which i always admire by the way because i was like [ __ ] around playing sports and to this day i'm about to have a son like what am i going to teach him and do i want him to like be [ __ ] around playing sports like me or do i want him to be doing entrepreneurial things and starting businesses and poking around with stuff and i always really admire it but one of the things it's clearly part of your ethos but that people can take away from it when they're starting businesses is like that curiosity that you had where you were starting something totally different click and you were going and looking at the flag and you were like well [ __ ] man this doesn't make sense that this costs 140 here and it costs eight what can i start with that well i could resell the flags then someone else asked you a question can you make t-shirts and you're like hmm yeah like the curiosity to say hmm maybe there's something bigger let me go ask a couple more questions about it like what else might you need how could we do more with this that is a really cool thing of like if someone is just trying to go start a business just start asking questions about the stuff around you that people are struggling with to like start trying to find those little you know nooks and crannies it's so much easier now to start things you know like the you have to get over that initial hurdle of like zero to one of like just getting something started once you've done that a couple of times then it doesn't seem scary anymore you're like oh it's very easy to start this website start that there's free tools to make you know sites and use zapier to connect them and all this stuff and a lot of the initial swag up site that did millions of dollars was all just hacky bootstrappy free stuff so i think it's you got to get into that creation mentality where it's very easy to you know start you know seeing problems and creating solutions versus thinking about all the reasons it's not going to work or why it's too hard to do it you know we were talking about this earlier so i want you to talk about this too of like the whole like i don't know i call it lego blocks as a framework but basically we live in this world now where like with low code and no code you can just go build you know hack something together to as you said like you go test your minimum vial minimum viable product you can hack together over a weekend probably with like developers in eastern europe and like a bunch of low code no code stuff so like do you have any reactions to that i mean my one of my takeaways is is you started with the community right like it's not like you're like hey let me go build swag for everyone you had like a particular community in mind that you defined like a particular type of startup and then from that you use the lego building blocks of no code low code to piece it together and then tell a story that really resonated with that group of people yeah the one of the books that i read leading up to swag up was the purple cow from seth godin and it's all that idea of like if you're gonna stand out in this world that's so noisy you have to be like instantly remarkable you know if you walk by a farm and you see a purple cow you're like holy [ __ ] like that's a purple cow like i've never seen one and the first thing you're going to do is you're going to take a picture you're going to share it on instagram you're going to call somebody and be like i just saw a purple cow and the idea is that you need to embed like this purple color nature into what you're doing so that when people see it they instantly are like this is different than anything i've ever saw and that was the the idea first around focusing on high growth startups and ones that are looking to you know buy their time back that are looking for modern solutions to problems but then we niched down even further and focused in on like the swag pack concept that's you know i called a trojan horse or a mouse trap into the door with all these companies and because i was always looking for like how can we even dive deeper than that because with the custom flag business i learned about the supply chain but i also realized that you can't build a successful business just being like a cheaper provider of these products you need to figure out like who what community like you said do you resonate with and what's a specific thing you do better than anybody else in the world and that's what we've focused on there's been so many times where we could have diverted the attention and you know do new product lines or focus on other areas and we constantly kind of try to stay in this like lane that allows us to grow really quickly and then then move out of it over time this is a great business building framework in this of go find a massive industry so like the swag industry big fragmented tons of money flowing around no one's really doing a great job find an underserved community to your point in this case startups and basically just deliver the best product like exactly what they need no more no less and just go in and create the product for them you go talk to i i bet you could literally do it you go find that industry you find the community you want to focus on go talk to a hundred startup founders i mean you also don't even initially need to build the product for them that's the that's the hack that no one talks about which is if you could tell a story that resonates with them they'll bear with your product that isn't all there yeah say that again like what do you mean go deeper when you go to vistaprint as an example um i probably haven't been to visit prince in 2004 or whatever either but if you go to it um it and you're a startup founder it doesn't resonate with you when you read the website and when you see like the story that they're telling that you'll you'll look at it and be like okay maybe i can figure this out maybe i i could like it feels like amazon right there's just like so much option and it doesn't connect with me if i go to let's say swag up um it feels like it's speaking to me and that's like a uh it gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling so i think that people who create warm and fuzzy feelings basically as a way to to storytell is is the huge unlock when it comes to marketing you mentioned purple cow i think that there's if you want to learn anything about marketing there's only two books you need to read the first is purple cow i've never read it i need to go read that i said go did you're gonna read it tonight you need to read it tonight yeah it'll tell you how to stand out i wonder where you're going to say the cycle and i wonder if it's the other one i know it's inte it's also a seth godin book actually it's tribes by seth godin have you read that i have it but i haven't read it yet well it's a short read it's probably from what i remember like a hundred pages okay community building before community was a thing yes that book changed my like changed my life basically i read it in probably like 2005 maybe is this what originally got you into community as an investment thesis and as a business building thesis i i had always like been into community like i feel like people who are into community like you don't choose community community chooses you um so always like into like internet forums and stuff like that when i read seth godin so eloquently describe tribal nature basically and how why people come together and how you can use that from a storytelling mechanism that basically told me that hey like this isn't just some fun thing that like internet kids could do this is something that like real like seth godin he's like a new york times bestselling author he's like maybe 15 times and he's a real a real trusted source that is telling me at the time 15 year old kid that this is the way so that's what made me believe that you know it gave me the confidence to be like maybe i can have a career out of this there's another book similar to that called fizz that's really good it's about where to mark where to mouth marketing and virality there's a really big viral nature to our business and then another one that's like a classic marketing book is called positioning by al riese and jack trout which is all about like you know planning your business in the minds of people and tying it to something they already believe in and so that you'll be remembered and it's very similar to purple cow you know nature can you talk about the viral point that you just made because i hadn't thought about that until you just said it but like your product is visual your product is also surprise and delight because companies are sending this stuff and you're getting it and you're like oh holy [ __ ] one of the benefits of having a physical world business yeah where like they want to tweet a picture or post a picture on facebook or instagram or snapchat or whatever of like holy [ __ ] this new company i just joined just sent me this swag pack so how are you like how is it clear that it's powered by swag up when that happens or is it just like implicit because it's a startup doing this and you know there are customers there's a few things i mean we have a channel in our stack called swag in the wild and every time we see one of these out in the wild we'll throw it in there and we make newsletters out of it we'll show our customers as like social proof but there's a lot of it you go on twitter you go on linkedin you'll see a lot of it and i think one of the most interesting things that we've accomplished is that swag up swag means something versus just swag you know like you can buy a notebook and a hat but if you're a startup that didn't get at swag up you almost took like the cheap router you didn't go with the brand that companies go with and even without us prodding you'll see people on linkedin sharing like oh we just got our new hire swag packs from swag up like at the end of the day we're selling a commodity why are they tagging us they're tagging us because there's some sort of value and brand like around what we do that showcases that hey swag up is the best they do it the right way and we're proud that we work with the best type of company i think if you can build that connection for your brand that's like a huge huge unlock because now it becomes this sense of like you know ego in a way like we need to be working with them or else it means something about us like we don't you know and that's the focus of when you work in a tight community everyone knows each other you know and one they start telling each other like hey we work with swag up you guys should too but also like if they if they see you working with another company maybe they think like oh they don't work with swag up like why is that but then the other viral nature to your point is like our products are out there in the world all the time we every customer we get has an uh exponential growth in terms of how many packages are out in the world yeah that people get and naturally if you get a package from a company you know let's say you really love ramp and ramp sends you one of their packages that we made for them like swag packs you're gonna go to kareem or eric or somebody at ramp and be like hey these are awesome like where'd you guys get them like how can we get them and you and they'll say oh so i got they're the best reach out to them we also put our logo on the bottom of every custom printed box so if you flip it over you'll see a small swag up logo on the bottom of the boxes so that also helps a little bit but it's almost like type form you know powered by typeform they have that there and gets people to want to do that product like product like growth i was just gonna say exact thing because we've talked about this a lot of like the most amazing product led growth that we normally see it in like software and tech products where you see like superhuman have the sent by superhuman email mercury uh is amazing with like their wire sheet is just beautiful and it's an amazing wire sheet a beautiful product great product like growth this is a really cool example of product like growth in physical products where it's out and because it's like integrated into what is naturally already a pretty exciting process of like you've joined a new company you typically announce that on linkedin or on twitter or facebook wherever and now you're tying it to a physical product that these guys are integrated into it's like a really cool natural acceleration high k factor activity one of the other digital components is like we do these redeem pages where companies could build out a little landing page and send it to the the people the recipients and those also will say powered by swag up towards the bottom so like every new customer leads to more new customers i don't know the exact viral coefficient of like one equals 1.8 or 1.9 but every incremental shift like one leading to 1.5 and one leading to 1.6 has a huge exponential difference so if you can drive that let's tie that back to bootstrap businesses so what you're what you're talking about is like the dream of any vc right so now you started this bootstrap business um you're hitting some scale i don't know if you can share like what sort of scale you're hitting um tens of millions and bootstrap also makes you do things like this you know because the constraints you don't have to the capital to just pour hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars in the market so you have to look for the ways that you can drive growth in a way that doesn't cost you anything you know so we've always focused so much on like the user experience the customer experience so that they can become our advocates if like because then you know that if you pour money on top of it it's just going to have an exponential effect versus oh you're just so relying on capital to get new customers and they don't really love the product they just you know you were able to buy them basically is would you ever consider raising venture now that you're at this point of of scale and yeah for sure i mean there's so much that we want to do long term from a technology standpoint to just change how this industry operates you know and be more of a supply chain api layer and that requires like the best engineers in the world the best product managers in the world and it's just going to be a slow slog if we want to keep going down this path and and it's like one of those things like it might not even make the most financial sense to to raise money for me personally as a founder because i own so much of it my life is like nice and chill you know we run the business i can keep doing it and we'll build a several hundred million dollar company but at the same time i get more enjoyment out of like seeing the vision come to reality than just like milking a business like for cash flow or something so you know we've always reinvested all the money back we've always taken low salaries we've always be you know we're growing two to three x a year you know we'll like for a sense of scale we'll do 55 million plus or minus this year next year we'll do over 100 this month alone we did eight um so things are moving really quickly and again without raising any money and we're always like redlining like we're always at the very you know edge of like how hard we can go and you know the resources we have and what we can do with them and like i said it forces a sense of discipline and i think that bringing capital into that environment in such a scrappy environment we can use that capital so much more effectively and efficiently than another company that's so used to buying their product like solutions or paying away their problems um you've learned capital allocation from the ground up like you've had to be an extremely efficient capital allocator because of the fact that you didn't have capital and so now bring capital into that you already have built a really efficient capital allocation one dollar is not the same for everybody sure you know one dollar for us might be six dollars and one dollar for could be you could be very different it could be 20 cents so i i think we have you know we've proven that we can get a high return on capital when yeah when we have it now that doesn't mean we're just going to raise 100 million just you know to get a good article out of it if it's going to sit there you know and i think there's also a big use of debt too you know when we have a physical business that's relatively predictable you raise some equity but then you follow it on with debt or you want to buy companies or vertically integrate the supply chain just raise debt you know these are predictable businesses i don't think enough founders understand how debt works or you know they get spooked out of it by equity investors like oh debt's bad don't use that you know it can be bad if you don't know what you're doing can you talk more about that like i feel i feel like you're totally right like you know a lot of the founders that i know when they're thinking you know they're running a technology business they're just they only think venture um so how do you you know what's your advice to to founders and and how did they learn more about debt or how you know how did they use that to their advantage well first off i have a finance background you know i went to school for finance i worked at a hedge fund when i was 18 you know as an intern that was the path i was going down so i think there's a really big advantage to understanding finance in startups if you're going to be the ceo or leading the company because every business you know and keith or boy will say it and others it's like an equation you know the whole business is just one big you know algorithm and one big equation there's all these inputs and levers and leads to outputs and you need to be able to model that out and understand how that works and and then when it comes to fi you know resources and capital for these businesses you know different types of capital are good for different things like if you're taking bets or long-term you know investments in the future debt is not a good idea like you need to be able to cover the cost of that debt over time and there's a chance those investments don't pan out but it's when you have predictable cash flows that are going to be derived from the investments then it's just an ass a measurement of what's more expensive is is the dilution more expensive is the cost of capital more expensive you know the cash that you're pulling out of the business in the meantime but if you're let's say you're buying a cash flow positive business like for us we want to let's say we want to buy a screen printing facility to vertically integrate it would make no sense to raise equity capital to purchase that business it already has cash flow we can just get debt at a very cheap rate we know the cash flow from the business is going to cover it you can even spin that out as a separate entity that doesn't impact you know the main swag up business or something so you just have to be really smart about like how you structure the business it's an important concept so i similar background yeah so i spent seven years in private equity and so got very familiar with that because leveraged buyouts were the game in private equity and we didn't over lever things in the way that like barbarians at the gate and people think of private equity but one thing that i learned intimately was the whole idea of cost of capital and when you think about the cost of debt capital versus the cost of equity capital like equity investors expect a 20 plus percent return on their investment debt right now you could probably get yeah yeah depending on what it is four to seven percent four to six percent depending on how risky and where does the founder go and find that debt well if you have investors coming in on the equity side it's very easy because then you have like the stamp of approval from an equity investor and you can raise on the back of that like svb won't even talk to you unless you have you need that equity although mercury is disrupted like there are companies now that are disrupting that where if you have a bank account you're doing other things like mercury has now branched into doing venture debt because they can disrupt svb with that companies like that i think are very interesting like uh pipe cap chase these companies that are doing like clear co doing revenue financing where it's mostly for sas companies so they haven't quite branched into stuff we're talking about with physical but non-dilutive revenue financing another interesting like paradigm shift within um within these markets that again can be much cheaper i'll give you two more unlocks too one is local banks you can actually go to and they'll have you know very loose easy terms for small amounts like fifty thousand a hundred thousand hundred fifty thousand and there'll be maybe no personal guarantee they won't want the first position on the debt and you can stack them you know so you can go to this bank and get 100. you go to td bank and get 150. you go to this bank and get 50. and now you just got 400 000 in lines of credit and and debt that didn't really you know at a four percent five percent six percent rate and they don't care if they lose 50k they want your business as a customer that kind of stuff so we did a little bit of that that's interesting in the early days and then the other thing is if you do let's say you go to like a santander bank like a local bank and you get 100k and now you want to get 300k in a rev like a line from them or something me as a 22 year old at the time or 23 year old is going to be very hard-pressed to get santander to give me another 300 000 they're going to say first off the business doesn't have a lot of credibility and you're 23 years old so what i did early on was i brought in a partner into the business that was the finance person you know the back end compliance finance legal all that kind of stuff artem and he already had small banking relationships so i inherited his credibility into the business and he can go to his banker who he's worked with on other businesses and be like hey you know we've worked well here i'm now part of swag up can we you know can you help us raise raise a little bit of debt and you know that's that's like a cheat code i think is if you can inherit people's credibility to get their relationships otherwise it could be hard you know if you're just starting out like not many people want to give 200 000 you know lines of credit or something to some business that has no revenue and it's started by a 23 year old the sba loans were like the original genesis of a lot of this like people would go get an sba loan but a lot of times those came with a personal guarantee and so if things went sideways you were stuck for the next 12 years whatever having to like have a portion of your income go towards paying it off my main idea when i was starting it once we realized it was going to be somewhat successful and there's a whole entire idea of like cash conversion cycles and when you have to pay out and when you get paid that is a huge component of how we were able to do it first off um but the the idea i want to talk about that actually sorry so i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna pause you on that because so cash conversion cycles is a super interesting business concept that i don't feel like people dive into enough but like the whole idea of a working capital cycle and being able to actually collect cash on a faster cycle than you have to be paying it out to your vendors or your suppliers that is a huge unlock it's going to be the difference between two businesses that do the exact same thing and one that grows at 100 one that grows at 20 or goes out of business because growth so the actual math of it is that if you have negative working capital when you're growing you actually are funding the growth with the cash that's coming in from this and you don't need to put money in negative working cap or a positive working capital business means like i have to pay for inventory before i'm receiving cash for my customers that's a typical apparel business because they have to pay vendors on 30-day terms and then they receive cash from their customers on like 60 day terms and that's really bad because when you're growing you're actually just bringing in cash much slower than you're having to pay it out your business three legs for cash conversion cycles are how long it takes you to pay out your vendors or how long you get to to pay out your vendors how long it takes you to collect money from people and how much money or how many days you have of inventory sitting there how much cash is sitting in inventory for us in our business everything is just in time manufacturing so the inventory component is out so that's a you save 10 20 30 days insane of working capital there that most businesses have to put out and then it's a matter of you know selling the story to the vendors and and trying to get get credibility with them to give you as far out terms as possible net you know in the beginning it might be hard you'll get a couple net 30s the rest will be like no we need you to pay until you start to build up credibility but at least it's still only when you collect money you know and then we try to collect as much as possible up front the good thing about working with startups is they're not amazon walmart and facebook where they're going to be like no we only pay net 60 you know screw you guys we and since we're doing custom goods where those goods aren't really useful to us afterwards we can say hey no you need to pay us right now before we start because we don't want to sit on a bunch of you know stripe hoodies that are useless to us now after you know because you didn't pay us um so you know really thinking about that is super important i think we have a negative like 16 day cash conversion cycle so like you said as we grow we get to sit on you know every million dollars for 16 more days so every you know as we keep keep growing we're able to fund more and more over time i mean it's it's this is like the maximum iteration of this is like warren buffett and berkshire hathaway like having insurance companies having a float where you collect premium up front from all these people for something that you're not gonna have to pay out until a much later day so you have all this cash that's just sitting there that you can do things with in a business like this you have all this cash coming in from your growing customers and you can use that to invest in things you can pay all your employees with it like you have all of this capital that you're actually as you grow amassing and accumulating that you can reinvest in things you got to say like a lot of people are like oh they just want to go straight to the software and just build software that's very expensive and the payback periods are long but if you take a business like the one we have it can become a bank for you to build software you know one you get to learn about the customer you get to understand the problem so it's almost it's like the agency style you start with an agency you build tech later because you under you get paid to learn the problem and you get customers out of it and they're giving you the capital that you can reinvest without deluding yourself so i what i was trying to say before that i couldn't get out was every day you can push raising money out you're saving yourself lots of dilution because the the risk in the beginning is so high you know investors are going to want 20 25 on a seed round because you haven't proven anything so every every little thing you can de-risk you're gonna save yourself five percent ten percent that equity is so important and so if you can if you can be really scrappy don't spend a lot of money personally get a few customers in the beginning you're going to save yourself tens of millions hundreds of millions of dollars down the line by just saving you that five percent ten percent fifteen percent um versus just the easy route of just going straight to raising the money because you know you're going to use that money just you know figure out the problem you're trying to solve or you need you know and some people aren't in the same position like they need that capital to get out of their full-time job or something but the more you can avoid that you're going to feel much better about it like two years down the line can we talk about this whole idea of apps abstracting away complexity as a business like twilio is the best example that i can think about as a public company of doing this they took messaging which was this super messy thing that startups and small companies didn't want to deal with it was like really hard to set up and hard to cobble together and you just didn't have time to do it and they took that messy back-end process and abstracted it away into this simple api first company you've done that with this industry can you just talk about like how you thought about that where it came from yeah it wasn't the natural like inclination from day one it was the you know over time understanding the problem and the way the industry is set up in the supply chain you start to realize like what is the best way to solve the problem in the industry so you know as we started to gain scale and get a lot of customers you hear the same problems over and over again about how they deal with it and that helps us build like the front end but then you also realize it's so fragmented there's 30 000 swag companies 30 000 that's basically do the same exact thing 90 of them are doing under two and a half million so if you just think about you know that's that's a 30 billion dollar industry and like i said corporate gift things like 210 billion so if you think about that network you have you have 30 000 swag distributors millions of customers and hundreds or maybe thousands of suppliers so if you think about all the nodes in a network like that it's hundreds of millions of one-to-one connections and they're all reinventing the wheel over and over and over again you have a swag company in milwaukee that has their own warehouse they have their own tech team they have their own designers they have their own you know relationships with these suppliers the suppliers have to have 100 or thousand people sales orgs or account management orgs to deal with all the volume and it's just wildly inefficient for for the world in general and it's you know it eats the margin in in the industry because there's so much manpower involved and if you think about the the biggest swag companies some of the biggest ones they're just private equity roll ups you know they there's a company called halo they do like 850 million and they just buy all these smaller slide companies but they don't unlock any sort of real efficiencies or scale dynamics and they don't use technology they just aggregate all these people so there's 10 000 people that work at halo you know 5 000 people whatever it is so to me there just seemed like a much better way to utilize shared resources you know and i you'll have to give credit to dak our cto as well because when he came in he also saw this and he decided when he was building you know the first version of our internal and external like platforms to start with apis and then build around it so it wasn't it wasn't meant for external users yet but it was like let's start let's build those apis it's the right way to build our infrastructure knowing that one day people might want to tap into that you know directly and build something else with it or build the same type of thing and compete with us or whatever so you know then i started to do the research into companies like twilio and plaid and stripe and how they're set up and how you know they're able to scale so so greatly and how they're able to enable creativity at scale because they take care of the boring hard stuff that it's really inefficient for people to continue to solve that same hard problem like let one company solve it so but those principles haven't really been applied to the physical world as much the physical world is still so messy and hard to deal with um so you know as i started to think about the competitive nature of the swag world like we can keep going with swag up.com and be the best swag management platform and stuff and we'll continue to do that but to me everyone it seemed like everyone was running away from the supply chain you know that was the hardest problem and nobody wanted to deal with it and even if you see companies like um you know like sendosos and snappy gift there's all these like both sales enablement platforms and sales marketing and also like employee experience platforms and they want to leverage swag in some way but they all want to partner with a company like us because they don't want to touch the physical part of it because they just like you know being the software layer making it really simple and not getting in the weeds with it so as i saw everybody running away from that part it's like that's where the real value is that's where like the mo and the big opportunity is if we can just kind of consolidate this industry aggregate all the volume coming through us as this central control point both the supplier and supply chain side will be much happier because it's one centralized place to interact with all the demand and then on the demand side and the distributor side they now have best-in-class technology to scale their business and they can just focus on customer relationships you know partnerships expanding revenue within the accounts they have and not worrying about the actual fulfillment of orders execution running a warehouse running a tech team and a lot of these companies don't have the capital or even wherewithal to know how to do those types of things you know so we we feel better about empowering the industry and making it more more efficient at scale than being the one that's going to go out and acquire every customer and also that's very expensive to acquire all the customers there's you know there's so many different niche types of users that utilize swag for different reasons and the way that i think of it you know there's a swag company probably in michigan that's really good with like the hospital systems in michigan they really understand that market they have there's still a big relationship component to these types of sales too like i know i know the director of you know hr at you know university of michigan hospital system like are we going to try to spend all this money trying to acquire that customer and break that relationship or why don't we just empower the you know the people that already have those relationships and just be the one that all the volume is flowing through and we'll take a take rate on the entire industry and we'll work to drive our costs down so that we can get as close to the industry margins as possible and still give them the margin they need so that's how we think about it so there's a lot there um and i guess a couple things a couple reactions i have one is just like looking into the future the takeaways from that for me if like if you're a builder and you're going out and you're wanting to create something there's so many interesting insights of like where can you go do that so swag up is a perfect example like you you found this big like very inefficient industry you abstracted away all of this complexity you did all the like grunt shitty stuff that you had to do and it's still and you're dealing with the supply chain you're dealing with transportation you're doing a lot of stuff like what other industries if we want to get tactile and we want to think about the future and brainstorm like where could you do that what industries jump out to you guys as places where this could happen to me i look at financial services as a huge one where i'm like busy we talked about it actually at the beginning taxes for like founders for startups for entrepreneurs i look at that i'm like this is a huge market that is somehow massively underserved like all of these founders are selling equity getting into these things not optimized at all from a tax perspective huge opportunity to go and do something that's just like really simple seamless plugs in like offers a great experience for them i look at transportation and logistics like right now i mean we all know about the supply chain issues that are happening i'm sure you know it intimately probably too intimately and that's one to me where i'm like there's no clarity no company wants to deal with it i'm on the board of a few consumer companies that it's like dealing with freight forwarders and the entire experience awful the whole thing flexport is trying to do it and ryan's amazing and he's going to come on the show actually too and they're like phenomenal and they're trying to do that they're trying to abstract away a bunch of the complexity um what other industries or places you think about that might have some similar attributes i mean the way i think about it is start like i start i start with a community of founders so i think about what do founders do on a daily basis and what do they do in the life cycle of a startup and i think the way to think about it is you just start mapping out what founders do hiring team members um you know paying them like all and you and you just i think like the challenge i would have for our community is you know if you feel like you have an edge in a particular community for example founders map out that life cycle and then through that map out the challenges and then through that map out what a product that abstracts the complexity away that you could make api first community first you want to look at common themes of what are things that all these people are doing in a way that's like very manual or they're all doing it in some sort of different way that's a pain in the ass for them and how can you be the one that kind of consolidates and does that part for them i think another i think deal is an interesting one d-e-e-l yeah where they're kind of you know taking over the whole compliance and payroll for overseas workers and you can easily embed that into lots of other platforms and they don't need to be the interface layer for that i think notarize is really interesting so good you know that one like to this day i look at it and i'm like why didn't i do that pisses me out like it's the dumbest thing like docusign is the perfect example of this where you're just like it's the most obvious business that should exist i mean notarize can be plugged into so many different transactions and platforms and it's so much better than the old way when you but you bought a house before like the notary process oh my god you need i i refinanced my house during covenant and then i sold a house and bought a house during covet and the amount of time i spent with a notary physically in person during those three processes i mean it's insane like i spent more time with them than i probably spent with my parents because like they have to come and you have to do all these stuff the promise of eighth grade is like you take something that's really annoying and complex and become the best company in the world that's solving that problem over and over again and then you just let people access it as easy as they can access anything like making a text or calling or whatever it's like and it's so efficient for the world because it's one company solving a hard problem and letting everyone else focus on the problems that they solve and you're going to see so much more of it because if you think about what happens with swag up at scale is as we continue to you know take on this really complex supply chain and make it available through apis now just like twilio you're able to like handle the whole communication stack through an api you with us you can tap into the whole physical world you're sourcing blank products sourcing decorators sourcing you know the ability to kit and assemble the ability to store items fulfill them we think of our supply chains legos and and building blocks in an entire kind of physical supply chain so if you just want to procure the blank merchandise the the notebook you you just want to procure the ipad you or you you want the ipad you want to put the logo on it or you want to build a membership subscription box that taps into our sourcing capabilities and our assembly and our storage and fulfillment capabilities like you can build those things as a kid in a house in you know michigan or wisconsin without ever touching the physical world without ever figuring out the supply chain without ever building relationships all you're doing is looking at different apis and i want this part of it i want that part of it's like a menu and you put them together to be building blocks of a business without having to re-figure out the things that everyone else has already figured out and it's just it's just so much more efficient for the world to have expertise you know that does it once and other people can use their creativity on top of it versus trying to figure out the logistics and then their creativity is dead by the time they figure out the operational component if you talk to people that you know people that loved baking pies and then they start a pie business they end up hating baking pies because they had to deal with the operational part that's been solved many times over and that's why i'm a big fan of like private equity versus venture capital because i think it's much more interesting to take businesses that are bad at the operations and that part and and help them scale that because that part's repeatable versus the creative side and the product market fit size the hard part you know this is that's so interesting first off super hot take on liking private equity versus venture capital which i love i love a good hot take and i love this like find the annoying thing framework like hiding the ugly stuff or like find the annoying thing because it's so easy if you just open your eyes on a daily basis to go find annoying things and it doesn't have to be things that annoy you everyone's like everyone loves the you know find a pain point like what's something that you find annoying or find a pain point if you literally like sit in an uber i i've tried take a lot of ubers in new york and every time rather than sitting there on your phone and texting if you just talk to the person and ask them or like people on a daily basis go to your like landscape or someone that's at your house or service workers whatever you just ask them like what's annoying about your job what do you find annoying on a daily basis what do you have to do it's like sending invoices whatever whatever they say sending invoices finding enough rides collecting money collecting money there's no better skill than being deeply curious oh you know you just look at everything you're talking about you're talking to the curiosity chronicle yeah it's true man i mean this is my thing it becomes a sickness like you're just so curious like i spend so much time reading on my phone and talking to people and you know even in an uber i'll ask them like what's their life like what are the pain points with uber all these things because you just want to know like how can you make it better you're just interested genuinely interested and those types of people end up building the best companies because they're solving very real problems i think another one is an example of a type of business like when i worked at a pizzeria it was my first job i was a bus boy for two years in new jersey every friday night or sunday night or whatever mike dino orders his ingredients he's got a list of all the things like i gotta get three bags of sugar i gotta get 20 pounds of flour all this stuff like it's every pizzeria is doing that why wouldn't that just be embedded in the pos system as you sold 30 units of this pizza automatically reorder flour from this centralized distributor and it gets sent to me oh like it's just taking those things that are happening in the physical world that people like don't really like to do and how can you do that once and let other people tap yeah and what could he be spending time on rather than that when you when you compound that over five years could he have opened up different locations could even improve the experience i mean it's like when you play that out actually economy wide there's something incredible in terms of the value unlock that happens when people do abstract these things after 10 years 50 years 100 years that incremental 5 back that people are getting keeps adding instead of gdp going here it goes here yeah you know it is a really powerful thing i mean i i love this the whole like the power of just being insatiably curious that's going to be my takeaway from today because it's the biggest thing i try to find in like people we hire yeah are they are you curious innately curious how curious are you how do you test that how do you like interview someone like practically i try to see like have they started something on their own like do they have a podcast or they have a blog do they have a book club do like just have they done something from zero to one and started it for no reason other than they just wanted to you know that that's like the biggest telltale sign and then it's just you have to product do you read like how do you find information like what are you interested in like why did you even apply to this company you know did you did you do research on swagger before you got here like just because you're genuinely interested in it like so it's not it's not cut and dry like you never know 100 but that's the number one thing i try to look for because startups you don't have time to be on top of every single person and you have to hope that they're just gonna self-motivate themselves to find the answers and ask the people the questions they need and stuff and be proactive like the worst thing you can have at startups is reactive like we call them like passengers because they they don't get anything done and you don't really get leverage as a leader because you have to keep prodding them to do things so that's really interesting passengers i've never heard anyone describe it like that but it's so true like you you want drivers not passengers yeah we talk about all the time so i bet if you took an index of people who talk to their uber drivers and ask them questions about their life i bet if you put an index on those people you would do really well like a financial index on people that do that yeah i mean if i was a seed investor the only thing you're really looking at at that point is the characteristic traits of that type of person that's leading the company because everything else doesn't matter you know the business is probably going to change you know they're going to have a lot of hardship it's like is this person going to make it through are these people going to make it through do they have the right skill set to interact with each other you know people matter so much so maybe this is the venture fund of the future you like get a fleet of 10 uber drivers and you have them like strategically pick up the founders of the people that you're going to be going and backing and assessing and you see like how interactive this reminds me of like the things like hedge funds do where they send people out and they get like a clicker on the road like how many trucks passed by or go stand in line on a new apple launch you know a new app are you going to buy this what are you going to buy how many are you going to buy are you going to buy in the future it's like some associated hedge fund yeah it gets harder and harder to find your edge yeah in the world especially as ai comes in and stuff like what's going to be the unique edge that you can the insight that you can draw that nobody else can you know interestingly curiosity is still an edge to this day curiosity and community yeah yeah yeah community is always going to be community becomes more important as the hype as the world gets more digitized like we've seen it over the last two years people have flocked to like communities in this world where they were so you know away from their you know the people that they've seen on a daily basis and every brand that's been successful now over the last three four five years all has a community element to it you know and that's that's why i've always said that swag matters now more than ever because it helps bind bond communities together you know and the theory that i have is that if you go back 10 20 years before it was like companies had all the power you know whether it's employees or their customers from a customer standpoint there's not a lot of solutions out there you are the one or two or three main solutions as an employee you can you only have a few companies to work at if you're an engineer back in 1985 you work at like ibm or you work at ge or whatever now today the power shifted to the employee into the customer and stuff you have so many more choices of companies you can work at you have so many more choices of companies you can buy from so when you choose to work at a company you choose to buy their product you have some sort of connection to that brand in a deeper sense than just the product they're providing in the paycheck that they give you you know like if i if i'm a developer and i choose to work at stripe i chose stripe over 100 or 500 other companies i could have and i didn't just choose it probably because the money there's something deeper about stripe that i resonate with the british the mission the type of people there the values and swag becomes this physical kind of embodiment of that connection and it binds the people together and if i if i'm going to bar an sf and i work at stripe and i see someone else with a striped hoodie i instantly have a connection to that person the same way that if i went to stanford and i saw another person wearing a stanford hoodie you instantly are connected because you have these shared value systems so that's why i think not only have we executed well but we're also hitting a stride where community and building bonds between people and communities is more and more important and doing swag right really helps do that well um and that's why i think it's more valuable than ever would you ever explore doing digital swag for teams so for example like late check out we're like 30 people we are actually we like we we actually just realized this that we're a customer and uh but not only do i get like a welcome box for new employees but we also get like an nft that i can use as my profile picture for example yeah yeah we thought about nfts and how we can integrate them into the experience but i don't i'm not a huge fan of nfts to begin with yeah just unless there's some sort of practical value not to say that it has to have real world application but like what if we introduce nfts how is it adding any new value to the experience and if we can come up with a way to where it is then great but if we're just going to throw it out or like tie the word nft to what we do to get some sort of like credibility or something then that's not really something i'm interested in yeah but if we can figure out like hey this is actually really valuable like you get the one of one you know representation of the branding in this year's swag pack for something and it's a collectible or it gives you access to something at the headquarters or something like that that makes it interesting um but also i mean it's not for us it's for our customers so if customers come to us and say hey this is how we leverage it we were talking to one of our bigger customers last week about it so we're open to it but it's kind of it's got to be there needs to be utility into it yeah yeah well i'll introduce you to our uh the late checkout agency maybe they can help you out all right yeah super interesting um cool this was awesome thank you so much to time man thank you so much for the time this is super interesting casual i love i mean the story of what you're building is just like so so cool and i like that you like private equity rather than venture capital all right greg what was the one big takeaway from that episode for you i had several so it's gonna be tough for me okay what do you got all right so number one um the whole idea of abstracting away complexity from a bunch of like very messy ugly processes doing all the dirty work in the background and building a business that has built around just taking all that messy stuff and making it clean and easy for a customer in a community was just an amazing idea that i think is very broadly applicable people can go build that around financial services you can go build it around transportation and logistics that was a really cool insight to me the other one for me was like just being insatiably curious as a huge competitive advantage michael's a perfect example of that like he thought about the idea of swag up because he was out there seeing different things he was starting something different a totally different business that he talked about and then he saw this flag that realized was so much more expensive in the us than it was in asia and it started making him ask questions it started making him dig into it and that has led to a what did he say a hundred million dollar close to a 100 million dollar business which is insane yeah i mean the scale that he's been able to hit as a bootstrap business to me was mind-blowing my big takeaway was that starting a bootstrap business really allows the founder and founding team to intimately understand the business and all portions of it unlike when you raise venture capital at you know the early stage so i actually think that and it was a great reminder that don't be so quick to raise venture capital if you can bootstrap because that is a huge competitive advantage yeah i mean he learned very early on about capital allocation it's something that we don't talk about with startup founders and with builders is like the power of now for him to go raise money he has learned so intimately and deeply what capital allocation means and how to efficiently allocate capital that if you went and gave him 10 million 20 million today i'm extremely confident that he would know exactly where to deploy it with really high roi and high efficiency where a normal startup founder that just goes and raises that right out of the gecko they don't know where the high leverage spots are in their business yet because they haven't built them so i i agree with you i think that's a really really powerful one and especially the product led growth stuff like all those so cool so cool like how does he think about implementing you know this was created with swag up and all the different ways physical physical world super smart um you're gonna love this episode let us know what you think in the discord yeah let's jump into the community after i really want to go deeper on where else could you do this where else could you take a messy messy industry fragmented industry and just abstract that away to go build something beautiful for a niche community customer base so we're going to jump in the discord we'll be chatting about this later hope you enjoyed it are you and your team still using your personal phone numbers for work do you call customers partners or candidates with your

and i will tell you like my observation has been that many scientists that are working in primary research they're really focused on that problem in front of them you know how do i identify and evolve the science but typically the application that can transform the market is non-linear to where they're thinking and where they're looking and often that requires an understanding of the markets themselves meaning like how do you actually take that discovery combined with several other points of view to form a novel business concept and a novel strategy that can go and change that market um and so it's typically you know if it were very linear everyone would do it right if it were all about like hey here's a discovery here's the obvious application of it boom we're done you know i don't think that when you know humans invented the ability to to do optical scanning we would have realized at that time that it would ultimately lead to dna sequencing which is the primary technology in dna sequencing and so the person developing a cmos sensor or ccd sensor initially wasn't like hey one day we could figure out a way to like you know take nucleic acids and isolate them one at a time and image them and you know do it super quick and do it in this like chopped up way to create high-throughput dna sequencing and make dna sequencing super cheap that was not on anyone's mind right and that's the interesting thing about technology is the most value can be created by seeing maybe a few steps ahead of where the confluence or the non-linearity arises um and so that's a big part of what we do i say that our job is to connect the dots connect the dots between science markets and people so you know what is the market telling us what's the science showing us the possibilities are and who are the people that can help kind of execute against some some novel point of view

[Music] thank you so much for joining i mean we're we're thrilled to have you and have a chance to talk about a bunch of things that you've been writing about doing building um all of the above and definitely want to get deep down the rabbit hole on molecular molecular beverage printing technology and everything you're working on there i would personally love to just kick off um with a little bit of just background on on you and um and how you kind of got to where you are today i mean you have a insanely uh interesting career you know everything from quinoa to metro mile car insurance and now you know changing the world with with climate tech so would love to just get a little bit of background on you i don't know about you guys but i've had a pretty bad relationship with sleep for most of my life i never had much of a routine around it and honestly my performance suffered my ability to recall information to think clearly to think creatively suffered because of my sleep but now i've found something that changed the game for me and that thing is beam dream a functional sleep product that has really changed my life i'm excited to get to share it with you all today and so that you can get a special discount to try it 98 of people surveyed fall asleep faster when taking beam dream and 99 of people experience better sleep quality the results are in the data if you have an aura ring like me you can actually track it and see the impact of when you're taking it and when you're not it's very real and if you don't love it there is a money back guarantee get your money back guaranteed if you don't love it for a limited time you can get twenty dollars off when you go to beamorganics.com room and use code room at checkout again that's b-e-a-m-organics.com room and use code room for 20 off at checkout i guarantee you're gonna love it um sure i mean i you know my uh my origin story uh as i've come to write it is i was born in south africa i moved to la when i was a kid i was six years old my parents immigrated to try and make it in hollywood they're documentary filmmakers so so i grew up mostly in la and then i went to uh um school at the uc berkeley where i majored in astrophysics my uh interest has always been in science and mathematics and so that was kind of my um you know my focus and then you know i was working um sorry i was working at the lawrence berkeley lab in the hills above berkeley which is a government department of energy lab which was a pretty boring job i worked in a basement doing mathematical modeling and like you know i'd go in by myself and leave by myself and not talk to anyone and work on a computer and nothing and the project i was working on would maybe turn into a particle accelerator system 20 years from now so it wasn't really impactful or meaningful work to me um and meanwhile like the dot-com bubble was happening across the bay and throughout silicon valley there was a dude in my dorm freshman year who started a website that he sold uh to cd universe or for for a million dollars it was like this incredible outcome for a 19 year old kid and i was like man silicon valley seems pretty amazing like the whole world is changing and it's all happening from silicon valley and i want to work in tech so i started applying for jobs and ultimately got a job out of college at an investment bank that focused on technology mergers and acquisitions and i'd never taken a business or finance or accounting class so for me that was like a big um kind of learning curve you know coming out of college like i had to kind of learn business and learn finance and that was also when the market crashed so the dot-com bubble imploded you know i started with 11 people in my analyst class there were two of us left at the end of two years it was a pretty crazy time i worked on probably 20 deals most of which were companies being sold for less than cash right they were like they were such distressed businesses they were burning through money and they had no business private equity firms were coming in and buying them for nothing so um anyway that was my experience out of college i i ended up joining google in early 2004 and i left a couple years later to start the climate corporation so you know that's kind of the the main the main arc of the story yeah well it's really interesting kind of how it's how it's come to where it is today too and and you know what i think you're doing in a lot of ways if i'm zooming out is really kind of reimagining and reinventing the way that transformative science is funded and like with the production board which i which i definitely want to get into the way you've kind of created this foundry model and you're funding people scientists to go and kind of ideate on transformative technologies and then you know have a mechanism through which you can spin them up into big businesses and kind of spin them out to go raise money etc it sort of reminds me of like an iac of the future right like going and building a um you know holding company foundry model that can spin these up and fund these amazing swings in a in a different way um so it strikes me as very very cool what you're what you're doing and how you're approaching it well i wouldn't say that our objective is to fund science um i would say that our objective is to solve big problems and more often than not the way you can solve big problems is to use kind of the the best tools and the best techniques and technologies that are available much of which emerges from you know discoveries being made in science as well as kind of you know new and emerging sub-disciplines and engineering so you know our orientation is much more about what are the big problems to solve what's the best way to solve them what's the confluence of technology typically that we can use to solve them and then build businesses from there and so i think to be most impactful and most transformative it's important to remain kind of abreast of what are the emerging discoveries what's the science showing us what's what's leading the way and i will tell you like my observation has been that many scientists that are working in primary research they're really focused on that problem in front of them you know how do i identify and evolve the science but typically the application that can transform the market is non-linear to where they're thinking and where they're looking and often that requires an understanding of the markets themselves meaning like how do you actually take that discovery combined with several other points of view to form a novel business concept and a novel strategy that can go and change that market um and so typically you know if it were very linear everyone would do it right if it were all about like hey here's a discovery here's the obvious application of it boom we're done you know i don't think that when you know humans invented the ability to to do optical scanning we would have realized at that time that it would ultimately lead to dna sequencing which is the primary technology in dna sequencing and so the person developing a cmos sensor or ccd sensor initially wasn't like hey one day we could figure out a way to like you know take nucleic acids and isolate them one at a time and image them and you know do it super quick and do it in this like chopped up way to create high throughput dna sequencing and make dna sequencing super cheap that was not on anyone's mind right and that's the interesting thing about technology is the most value can be created by seeing maybe a few steps ahead of where the confluence or the non-linearity arises and so that's a big part of what we do i say that our job is to connect the dots connect the dots between science markets and people so you know what is the market telling us what's the science showing us the possibilities are and who are the people that can help kind of execute against some novel point of view could you talk a little more about what motivates you to do it um so i know you know you mentioned you know solving big problems um i feel like making the world a better place um but you can very much you know hang out in the bahamas on the beach you're in a very nice place yourself you're in marin so you know you could just kind of hang out but what drives you to after all those successful businesses that you've created um get up and and and take on this really big challenge i think everyone's got um uh call it conscious conscious motivation and subconscious motivation so you know we typically have some sort of subconscious driver that's motivating us with some form of energy and then we rationalize what we do consciously right there's a great book called the happiness hypothesis the author kind of describes this as uh the human conscious is like a little kid riding an elephant and the elephant is the subconscious so you know we could probably talk for hours uh you know with therapists involved on where where individuals motivations arise from um but for me my you know when i was in seventh grade i joined the environmental the ecology club at school um because it was pretty evident that you know i you know the world is in trouble right there's a lot of things that humans do to the planet that don't seem right and that seemed net destructive for our benefit and you know that this can start with just kind of like ruining the environment with uh pollution and you know the the common kind of nomenclature of you know anthropogenic climate change i think is is the hit azure and an important one because it really is an existential crisis right like like humans have this tendency to kind of um you know want to get so indulgent uh to the point that it doesn't matter what happens around us um and i think that's really where we find ourselves is this kind of existential moment so from a young age i was really inclined to kind of think about ways that we could do good for the world um and you know how do we kind of solve these crises and solve these problems um so you know i i don't generally do well sitting on the beach i'm an intellectually curious person and i'm also an action-oriented person so uh intellectually curious in the sense that i have to constantly be learning new things and exploring new things and action oriented in the sense that if i'm not physically changing the things around me or doing something i i get uh you know pretty pretty unhappy so you combine those two facts with this you know overarching kind of problem that we face as a species and the sets of problems we face as a species and i think this is just naturally what i can and should be doing with my time doesn't mean i can't also once in a while go to a beach but you know i don't really do that very often especially with three young kids um but yeah look i i feel like um let me just say one thing that's really important i'm an extreme optimist so i look at the crises that humanity is facing and we really if we did nothing you know we would likely wipe out our species and all other species of life on this earth or maybe there would be a very hard ugly reset that would take place over the centuries and millennia ahead but fortunately we have incredible technology and incredible tools as a species to theoretically reinvent all the things that got us in this problem in the first place and also reverse all the problems we've created we have the ability to truly engineer life we have the ability to re-engineer systems of production and we don't have to make compromises to do it so big part of our thesis is that sustainability is not about cutting back and doing less and eating less and and so on sustainability is about driving technology forward meaning can you make the same products that everyone wants more of and can you make them cheaper but can you make them without carbon and without pollution and the answer is yes we have the tools across the board to do all of those things so you know now it's an interesting question of what do you tackle first what are the biggest problems how do you address them but really from genomics to hardware to software to biochemistry the human tool set is is un is is profound like what we can do if we put our minds to it and there have been many times when our species have been trialled and challenged and we've risen to the occasion i think we are being trialled and challenged today and i think we are rising to the occasion and we're playing a small part or trying to play a small part in that effort one of the things you hit on there is a really powerful mental shift i think and it's it's a um it's a generational shift in how people think about sustainability that you that you touched on which is you know when i was growing up and even when i was in college so not that long you know tennis years ago sustainability was about you know uh shower heads that had less water running through them so that you'd save a little bit of water when you were when you were taking a shower which i don't think is a bad thing by the way but it was things like that it was how do you cut back to be more sustainable what you're talking about is a fundamentally different thing it's you know not constraining your your usage and continuing to live in a world of abundance but do it in a different way where we have technologies that can fundamentally change it make more water you should your shower on longer right and so like if we can make more water using some alternative system or you know source water using some better system uh then you should be able to do that now here's here's a fundamental philosophy about humans um you know the the buddhists call it uh uh doc it's um it's it's desire uh humans have desire as the root of of our kind of motivation as a species right it's what's made us so successful desire is not about an absolute condition it's about wanting wanting wanting more always and so um you know again this this book i mentioned happiness hypothesis has a study in it which has been challenged but it's really interesting which shows that the more income humans make or a typical person in the united states the happier they are up till they make about 60 grand a year thereafter income is no longer a predictor of happiness you know what's the biggest predictor of happiness your change in income so how much your income goes up from one year to the next suddenly if you win the lottery you're thrilled fast forward two years you're burning through your cash you're going to be pretty unhappy no matter what kind of yacht you're sitting on yeah it's like the hedonic treadmill right it's exactly right that's exactly right and so so evolutionary biologists psychologists even some of these you know religious uh dharma lectures from the buddhists speak to the same point which is that humans really are motivated by this principle so how does that principle play out over the last 10 000 years well it's played out in this non-linear trend in consumption so every human is only happy this year if they eat and consume more than they did last year uh and when i say eat i just mean like in terms of consumables things that we have in our lives and so you play this out over 10 000 years and you actually end up with this geometric increase in consumption of as a species and this geometric increase in production as a species which arises from producing you know using energy and that is what we need to solve so you can't just say hey stop all people stop what we need to do is figure out how to meet the trend line using better technology that uses less resources yeah you had an amazing quote i think it's on your on your website and kind of one of the foundational pieces that said um over the past 500 years the human race has seen our global population increase 14x while our consumption has grown by 115x and our production has increased by 240x um i thought that that was such a powerful statement of what you just said yeah you know it's something that folks have talked about so look this is the point about sustainability you can't just tell people and think about this by the end of this century ninety percent of the world's population will live in china southeast asia and africa ninety percent that population those populations are coming up the income curve right so even in china i think gdp per capita has increased by 7x over the last couple decades it's extraordinary as that population moves up that income curve they're not trying to consume less they're trying to consume more so you can't see a world shift from people that are mostly impoverished to people that are now mostly able to sustain themselves and ask them to consume less the driving motivating force of our species is to consume more and so as we seek to consume more we have to give those people we have to give the world all the things they want all the cars all the experiences all the food all the protein whatever it is that they want we just have to figure out how to make it better before we get into um sorry go ahead greg yeah could you i mean so your base assumption and just help me understand this your base assumption is that we can come up with the technology to consume more sustainably and better well i i want to believe that's true because i love consuming like you know and but can you explain what makes you so sure in that um so on a first principles basis we can look at for example all of these systems and assess the energy and resource needs to produce the things coming out of these systems so take animal protein as an example right so so cows beef there's about 30 times actually let me just speak to the whole animal system the whole animal system to make all the animal proteins that we as a species consume requires roughly 30 times the energy going into that system as the energy coming out of that system okay what is it what are we making well we're making these proteins these proteins are definable right so first principles assessment we can look at what these proteins are we know how to make them we know how dna makes them right we can code for those proteins using dna and then we just have to find a better way to make those proteins using that same dna sequence and so today there are incredible technologies that are emerging in being able to produce those proteins using what are called recombinant dna systems so you take the dna of the chicken or the cow or the fish and you can put it in the yeast cell and the yeast cell you put in a fermenter tank like you make beer or wine you put sugar stock in the fermenter tank and the yeast cell eats the sugar and it spits out the animal protein take that animal protein you can turn it into ground beef you can turn it into chicken you can turn it into milk eggs whatever that's a very simple naive explanation it's a little more complicated than that but that's generally a principle that we have the technology to do that today there's a lot of engineering stuff we got to get over to make it work at scale which there's about 150 companies doing today but they're going to succeed and as a result we're going to be able to replace all of animal agriculture this century um and by doing that the energy efficiency of that yeast cell the amount of sugar it requires and you know if you look at all the total carbon footprint and everything that goes into making that that protein using the yeast cell it's about one and a half times the energy that you consume so suddenly we went from 30x energy consumption to one and a half x energy consumption that's just one slice of the pie and we can go all the way around the pie and talk about all the things that humans make that are totally inefficient and crazy and talk about the tools that humans have to make them differently and better and it's extraordinary and that's really why i'm so excited and so optimistic i'm not like oh my god the world is over it's that you know like and it's not just me i'm not going to be the person that's going to solve these problems there's like a whole group of entrepreneurs that are this market-based you know incentive to go and solve these problems and it's happening all around us we've also just done it over and over and over again throughout history humanity i mean i think back to like learning about thomas malthus right like uh who kind of hypothesized that there was a fundamental limit to the global population and he kind of had a number associated with it and we've proven over and over again that we had ways you know like norman borlaug came along with the green revolution and fundamentally changing the way that we produced crops which you know some people think saved a billion lives and now there's a lot of questions about you know sustainability and non-gmo etc but an amazing uh an amazing thing and an amazing innovation so i also just look to i prior success is not a guarantee of future success but there's certainly something to the fact that we as a species have been able to do this um over and over again throughout history totally agree i mean there's a great book uh if anyone's interested called the alchemy of air i don't know if i ever mentioned it but um you know it's about the haber bosch process that was um you know the book opens up with this great uh anecdote you know humans the reason our population swelled in the 17th 18th 19th century is because farming you know the the kind of agriculture industrialization of agriculture took hold and the way that worked is humans started to apply fertilizer onto crops onto farms fields and the plants you know grew grew bigger we got a greater yield per acre we got more food when we applied fertilizer and the reason is fertilizer has potassium phosphorus and primarily nitrogen which are key elements uh in in producing plants producing life um and the way we got all the fertilizer is uh off of these guano fields off the coast of chile and so you know there were these clipper ships and this was the biggest industry in the world for a while that went down there scraped all the bat poop off of and the bird poop off of these um these rocks brought it back to europe and then we grew crops and fed the the population of the population swelled well guess what eventually you run out of poop and so we were running out of poop and there was this big challenge which was a forecast that was made that showed if we actually run out of poop when we think we're going to run out of poop to fertilize all the crops the whole planet is going to starve to death and we're all going to die and these german physicists chemists figured out that you could take 70 of the atmosphere is nitrogen and so it's a gas and it's n2 so it's really hard to break a nitrogen bond with two nitrogens are stuck together like that and these guys figured out that if they could compress nitrogen gas to 200 times atmospheric pressure run it over an iron catalyst and zap it with electricity it would break the nitrogen bond nitrogen would then stick to hydrogen and you'd end up making ammonia and um they basically synthesized ammonia today synthesizing ammonia accounts for somewhere between three and six percent of global electricity and all of the food that all of us eat is fertilized with synthetic ammonia and that saved the planet and it was just a you know a stroke of engineering ingenuity uh that that enabled uh that outcome by the way i wouldn't say it was just a stroke of ingenuity because much like the wright brothers and thomas edison it was an iterative engineering project it was all about trying and and and editing uh experiments over and over and over hundreds and hundreds of attempts to eventually figure out how to synthesize nitrogen ammonia and um and that outcome saves the planet and there are many examples like that and i think you know we're going to see a lot of them essentially it's that it's a remarkable that is a remarkable story i love that i've never heard that i need to go i need to go do some research on it now but i think it also brings us to you know one of the main topics that we wanted to talk about with you which is canna um and this this new big swing that that you are a part of and helping helping to build and and can you just talk maybe at the start of it about why the beverage industry grabbed you like what what about it what features of it made you think this was a pressing big problem to solve and and you know that'll i think lead us into talking about the solution that you guys have developed yeah so just by way of background as i mentioned before you know the production board we operate as this foundry uh so you know we're a holding company meaning you know we hold uh interest in a lot of different businesses we're not a fund we don't earn management fees or have carried interest we basically have a bunch of capital in our balance sheet from our investors and we get to use that capital to you know run research experiments try stuff if it works awesome let's build a company and then as we build the company we eventually scale it up and other investors might come into the company with us um so so that's kind of how we operate so as i mentioned before part of what i spend my time doing and our team spends a lot of time doing is understanding emerging science and then thinking about applications of that science so i on a completely unrelated topic i was actually meeting with a professor to talk to him about microbiome research over dinner and so you know we're really interested in kind of the microbiome of the gut and soil and that's a whole other conversation we can talk about in the future but um is that how you learn when you say like earlier you said you love to just think about big problems and learn and you're intellectually curious do you do most of that by seeking out and getting together with amazing future thinking people or is it more reading or is it kind of a combination of the of all of the above a lot of reading so you know i subscribe to a lot of science journals like nature and science and and all of the related publications and um and just follow interesting people on twitter and then i go down tangents you know like someone posts something interesting and then i go read about it and so yeah i would say number one is probably scientific journals number two is insights from interesting people over social media number three is reading a lot of books and number four is meeting with people so i try and do dinners with scientists and you know we catch up with with smart people have we have tech talks in our office that kind of stuff so very cool very cool sorry i cut you off and encouraging for people listening because number four is actually physical like getting together and access to people and the first three are anyone could do yeah totally yeah and um no and so there's nothing special about access i have by the way like i literally have the internet and so does everyone else so um you know learn learning is is is your own mission um and so yeah i was having dinner with this professor and he was like we were talking we're we're at um i think we're at tarquin in san francisco and he was telling me like we were talking about the food and why it was so good and he was telling me about this research scientist in germany who basically took um a bottle of wine and he was trying he's a flavor scientist and he was trying to figure out what are the molecules that make the wine taste the way it does and if you take a wine it's 88 water it's about 12 ethanol which is the alcohol and less than one percent is all of the molecules that make up all the odor color flavor and mouth feel right it's insane just one percent and the same is true for every beverage oj soda beer they're all water a tiny little bit of ethanol or sugar and then less than one percent is the stuff that makes a taste smell it look and feel the way it does so that one percent the scientist took the wine and he ran analytical chemistry on it and he showed that there was about 500 individual molecules in that wine that made up the flavor and he started taking those molecules out and then putting them back in one at a time and getting consumers to taste the wine and see if they could tell the difference and he was able to reduce the wind down in just a few dozen compounds and then he did it with another wine and another wine and he kept showing that like you don't need hundreds of compounds to synthesize the wine you just need a few dozen and uh and he published on this so i was like that's super interesting because if you could really and then and then the other the big breakthrough uh kind of that he pointed out was that the same compounds show up over and over again so theoretically with less than 100 chemical compounds you could recreate oj wine you know tea coffee all these different complicated beverages that's an incredible kind of point of view so immediately i said to the guy dinner i'm like why don't we make the star trek replicator like this would be so thick like we could just take those compounds and put them in a machine and you could just make whatever you want and so that was kind of the genesis now you know this is not as easy as it sounds because we've spent three years and over 30 million dollars and you know we haven't yet launched the product it doesn't sound easy for what it's worth yeah but um in principle it was an easy statement to make you know why do we just write the star trek replicator um but ultimately uh it required actually running an r d cycle so there was a guy named lance kaiser who's our chief scientist at canna and lance you know previously worked at amorous and ripple foods and so he's a flavor chemist and so we started running these experimental plants where we started trying to make wines and make beverages in-house using just the the raw chemistry so we would take water we would take ethanol and then we would take the flavor compounds all of which by the way are commercially available they're all food grade you can buy them in fact people don't realize this but most of the commercial wine you buy today is actually flavored it's not just the grapes so everyone from constellation brands to gallow they take grapes they turn it into ethanol and water and flavor and then they add other flavors to make it taste really good oh my gosh yeah so there's a whole world of flavor chemistry that exists and nearly every beverage you drink has some amount of flavor compounds added to it so there's a whole world of this stuff so we can just buy all these chemicals we buy these these these what we call ingredients and we started combining them with water and ethanol and we basically recreated a bunch of different wines and we're like holy crap this can actually work separately we had a hardware engineering exercise which is how do you make effectively an inkjet printer for beverages and so what's the dispense system how do you get it down to sub micro liter volume because again when you're talking about one percent of a beverage being the flavor compounds and you have 60 different compounds going in you have to dispense the tiniest fraction of of a milliliter to be able to make sure that the flavor is not overdone or under done and so getting precision control being able to do it quickly and being able to do it with lots of different viscosities of different compounds this was all a hardware engineering track so we did a lot of research on that we did a lot of research on the chemistry and then we started scanning we scanned thousands of different beverages so we analytically um break down what are the components of most beverages and then use that to recreate using heuristics our formula of what is the right dozen compounds of three dozen or four dozen what's the right formula to recreate that flavor and that's how we create our flavor library and our and our beverage library um so that's what we've been working on at canada for the last couple of years and we've now got you know we've done multiple iterations on a full hardware prototype of a device that goes on the kitchen countertop and a big part of this is again going back to my principle i spoke about earlier you can't take things away from consumers you have to give them more and so part of our principle is how do we make it cheaper than what you buy at the store and tastier and a better experience and so the product development cycle on top of all that is trying to solve those key problems right like what's the supply chain going to look like how are we going to make the cartridges how are we going to get them to your home how are we going to make sure this all works out economically how do we charge you so that it's cheaper and how do we make it incredibly awesome um and so that's a lot of the basis for canada this is a fight by the way like that last point you made about it actually having to be significantly better than the alternatives for consumers in order for it to proliferate the way that you want it's a debate that i have constantly with greg on this show and outside of the show by a text about the whole like web 2 versus web 3 world where my my perspective on it is that the web 3 technologies and platforms actually have to be fundamentally significantly better than the web 2 alternatives in order to actually see any sort of you know material shift in the long run so the way that you set it there as it relates to this you know hardware and um technological innovation makes a lot of sense to me on the just on the climate impact of something like this you had some interesting stats in the article in your kind of medium post when you released it or announced it around the impact that something like this could have and i think you said there's 60 liters of water required to irrigate an orange tree to make a single bottle of orange juice 600 liters of water to grow the grapes to make a single bottle of wine can you just talk a little bit about what impact you think this has and you talk a lot about decentralized manufacturing talk a little bit about about that as well yeah sorry that was your question i went down this very weird tangent so um the origin story but uh look the bottle beverage industry is friggin insane if you think about it okay it's so messed up if you were to land on earth today and look at what humans are doing to like create beverages that we consume you'd be like what the hell is wrong with these people and it's really a remnant of the industrial revolution so consumers on earth spend 2.3 trillion dollars on bottled and canned beverages a year okay 2.3 trillion dollars we um we consume something on the order of a hundred billion uh plastic glass cans more than 100 billion it's really hard to track all this stuff every year most of which 95 of which ends up in landfill okay it's about half a billion tons of co2 being put in the atmosphere every year because think about what you're doing you're taking a bunch of water you're putting it on a plant to grow what is mostly water an orange is 93 water less than seven percent sugar and less than one percent is all the chemicals that make the flavor color odor mouth feel and nutrients of that orange so we're using a bunch of water to reduce it down to make a little bit of water then we use carbon dioxide machines to squeeze that stuff put it in make plastic and glass and canned you know containers and then we put what is mostly water 93 water on a truck and then we use carbon dioxide to move that water around to a warehouse more carbon dioxide to move it to a store more carbon dioxide for you to go get it from the store and put it in your in your kitchen more carbon dioxide to keep it cold in your fridge and then you throw this plastic or glass or can in the trash mostly ending up in the in the landfill so the whole system is bonkers like we're wasting water to make water we're burning co2 to move water around and every home in the industrialized world has a line of water so if all beverages are mostly water and all we need is just that one percent of the components that you know kind of change the water into any other beverage let's just solve that problem that way like we've already got the water pumped into our homes we don't need to have this insane system of growing plants we spend about 120 million acres of farmland a year to grow the you know fruits and stuff that we convert into beverages and it's something on the order i don't even know the how accurate this is but something on the order of 500 trillion liters of water a year being pumped around to make these beverages um and to make the plants that that make these beverages so the whole system is crazy and it's and it's two and a half trillion dollars to spend a year we could save people money we could save co2 we could make it tastier we could make it personalized now think about this every supermarket every store you walk into there's only so much shelf space right there's like space for 150 brands let's say of juice soda coffee tea wine and beer 150 brands is nothing you guys remember when we would watch like you know i don't know how old you guys are but like you know nbc on thursday night was like network television it was like there was like two slots and everyone would watch eighty percent of media consumption was those two slots and then um you know cable came along and suddenly there was like more slots and nowadays we have youtube and tick tock and you know most of what's consumed 99.9 of what's consumed every day is that long tail of content it's not created by the two content producers on those two slots so if you move away from the retail store model and you no longer have 150 slots but you have the ability to have infinite slots because the beverages can now be printed dynamically and they're all digital now you have an infinite variety of beverages everyone can get a beverage that tastes better to them and no two people love the same beverages so you know what's happened in the beverage industry over the last hundred years is really what i think we would argue is the lowest common denominator of flavoring and branding so what is coca-cola and pepsi it's just a nameless faceless brand it means nothing to you it means nothing to me and the flavor of coca-cola and pepsi has been designed to appeal to the largest number of people possible but that doesn't mean that it's the most appealing beverage to any individual if if you were to get your own bartender he would make you a drink that would taste a lot better than a coca-cola and so think about it that way like when you have the ability to print when you have the ability to be dynamic in terms of what a beverage can be you can find a drink that's better for you more tasty to you than anything you could find on the store shelves there's only 150 options there and you can find brands that actually matter to you that actually appeal to you and theoretically you could personalize it you could add sugar add alcohol add vitamins add caffeine take stuff away and make it your way which is exactly what starbucks does and it's why starbucks is so successful everyone gets it their way so the other thing that's interesting to us is i think we want to kind of blow up the landscape for brands and beverages because branding today is like 100 you know it costs like three million dollars to start up a beverage brand you know you gotta come up with the packaging logos you gotta print the packaging you gotta make the beverage you gotta fill up the packages with co-packers then you gotta go find stores to carry it for you on that 150 sauce you got to convince them to put in one of their slots and then you got to market the consumers to go into the store to get it that's crazy what if sahil had his own beverage brand that he could create cost him nothing to make the logo is digital the formula is digital and you promote it on social media and you put it on canada and now anyone that buys it you get rev share on that cost you nothing to make it and your rent share will probably be greater than the revenue share you would make from selling those beverages on the storage shelves it's like um ghost kitchens but for but for brands you can just immediately go start something up like this like when mr beast did the thing with his burgers and you could have you know ghost kitchens all around the country like what whatever travis kalanick's got cloud kitchen it's like doing that but in the home that's why you immediately are in the most important place and you have shelf space in the most important place in these people's lives um that's a really really cool concept i i hadn't appreciated that from the from the article it makes it makes a lot of sense i don't think that there is you know like maybe there's a hundred brands that make up 99 of beverage sales in any category today i think in the future hopefully it's a hundred thousand brands and you know any individual can find a perfect brand for them like imagine if your favorite anime character is a brand right you would choose that anime character over coca-cola i mean what the heck is coca-cola or your favorite athlete you know maybe like the the bench player you know someone you play baseball with right is a brand and that's something that appeals to you more personally than you know whoever's on the wheaties box this week so um so i do think that there's an opportunity to find better one-to-one matching with consumers and for consumers to find stuff that matters more to them than what's available in the brand landscape today and so by moving this model from centralized production to decentralized production you enable yeah and do it just in time you know you enable and digitize it all you enable this proliferation of branding that totally transforms the landscape so what do you think you know james quincy he's the ceo of coca-cola i hope he's listening i don't know if he's listening to this but if he's listening to hear you know hearing me speak what do you think is going through his mind well look um when when incumbents face technology threats um they often discount the um the effect it will have on their incumbency and they're right because more often than not technology adoption is kind of on an exponential curve it looks very very flat for a very long period of time and then slow and then all at once and then all at once and that acceleration is when they get hit upside the head and so they are right for years everyone was right about tesla for years and then all of a sudden they were really really wrong and i think this is this was true with apples when apple came out uh with the personal computer and you know their adoption cycle was such that it took them a couple generations before they were really able to get production up you know this is always going to be true with all technology it's the incumbents first of all it's it's a little bit hard to grok their whole existence their place of being no one ever likes to be told that you know your existence doesn't make sense anymore um and so i think that there will be you know for a long period of time and they will they will be right for a long period of time this will not move the needle and then all of a sudden it will um have you heard of dornbush's law dave no dornbush's law says that it was originally around currency crises but it applies to this exactly which is um these these changes take much longer to happen than anybody thinks but then when they happen they happen much faster than you ever thought possible and that's exactly how i feel about this type of transformative tech yeah and look at what media companies kind of said about you know netflix and youtube and you know it's like all of a sudden you know they they command like i mean youtube i think does more revenue now than all the uh production companies combined or something um you know it's insanity um and uh and same with netflix i mean you know and everyone poo-pooed the quality of the content on youtube everyone said netflix is just using second-rate stuff i mean there's always a rationalization why the existential threat against you um can be kind of dismissed there's always options for dismissal and you know what in five years whoever's running that big company they're gonna be retired and they're gonna be wealthy and they're gonna be happy and they're gonna be hanging out with their grandkids they don't have this motivating force to defend and protect founders don't sit at the helm of big 150 year old companies and as a result their incentive is really to keep the trains on on time they're not to kind of jump the train onto another track which is a whole another project you know you can look at how disruptive it looks like mark zuckerberg is at running you know facebook today but um you know i think he sees the threat uh he sees the risk to his core business and he's able to make the change and he's not ignoring it um but you know incumbents generally that are not run by folks that started the business um and could kind of have authority over that their job is to serve the shareholders keep the dividends flowing etc it's why the um the icarus paradox applies so closely to these big incumbents like what made them successful for a long period of time actually ends up being their their ultimate demise as they're unable to see these things coming i want to ask you um two questions so so one on canna when can we buy one um when can i get one of these in my house um and uh and then i want to ask you on a separate thread so let's start there yeah so um the first 10 000 devices will be sold for 499 the pre-orders begin march 3rd for 99. um and so you can uh place a 99 deposit refundable if if for whatever reason we don't ship the devices or things blow up and it doesn't work you get your money back but you know hold your place in line um we are working on our production cycle right now so the plan is to ship these in early 2023 so it's a long time away for me might be a short time away for others but um uh you know that that that's the current plan um and then you know when you get the device uh there's a a cartridge system cartridges are delivered automatically so you it's a per drake pricing model you don't pay uh for consumer you don't pay for the cartridges they show up at your doorstep automatically as you're running low the machine knows the device is connected and um and so depending on what you consume through the device you're charged variably each month and so the prices range from you know 29 cents for things like sparkling water or soda water or what have you um up to 299 depending on the on the beverage that you're purchasing which is like a a nice cocktail or something okay so it's canna.com for anyone out there listening i will certainly be pre-ordering one of these um yeah c-a-n-a-com um i have to ask you before we lose you here about a another interesting future thinking technology that that you've written about recently you wrote an epic thread um that started the greatest source of value and wealth creation in the 22nd century could be driven by terrestrial nucleosynthesis this is a topic that well first off you're going to need to explain it to me like i'm five but this is a topic that i've talked about recently with josh wolfe who i imagine you've come across or know at lux capital um just on the need for a branding change around uh you know nuclear technology and nuclear energy and how it's gotten caught up in people's minds you know with like hiroshima nuclear war etc can you talk a little bit about this and where you view the future of it going and how how and why it's going to be so transformative yeah so this is a this is an extension of a technology that's that's in development um in my view um so there's a couple of points you made just look at our time here um okay so um [Music] all electricity on earth today is made by um you know spinning turbines and so you heat water up and you use that to kind of spin these turbines except for uh solar right where we use um uh photovoltaic cells uh to create an electric current um and so you know nuclear technology is instead of creating that heat from a system of um burning something like oil or coal or natural gas you create the heat through the kind of reaction on an atomic scale nuclear reactions so nuclear energy as it's termed today primarily refers to nuclear fission and so if you take very heavy elements right so if you guys remember physics or chemistry hydrogen is one proton it's got one electron spinning around it right helium is two protons uh it's got some electrons spinning around it and so on you know plutonium is this very heavy it's got a hundred plus uh protons a bunch of neutrons and um these these heavier elements are unstable um when they smash into each other they can actually form smaller elements and release energy in the process and so if you get enough of them together close enough that creates a chain reaction and that chain reaction is the the nuclear bomb that you know that we all know the technology from uh used in 1945. so um so nuclear fission uh or nuclear reactors use these uranium and plutonium power sources where they actually control the breakdown of you know uranium and plutonium into into lighter elements control the energy that's released and then use that heat uh to create water and the the magic of nuclear energy is you can use a very small amount of material to create an incredible amount of heat for many many years using just one rod that rod can last for years and years and years and create enough heat to power a small city it's an incredible technology the danger being that these are radioactive materials meaning if they get into the environment if they escape they can cause widespread damage as we saw with fukushima so now let's talk about another technology so that's that's an interesting technology um it's really powerful the other technology is what's called nuclear fusion nuclear fusion is what goes on in the sun and so when you get enough small small atoms together like hydrogen and you squeeze hydrogen close together it actually starts to form helium by all those hydrogen atoms smashing into each other and if they smash into each other at a fast enough rate with enough density they fuse into helium that's fusion and they release energy as well in the process so while they might form helium they also release some energy and that energy can be harnessed in different ways and that is what our sun is our sun is burning primarily hydrogen into helium and over time stars all over the universe burn hydrogen into helium through this fusion process and by the way the way they get so close together all these hydrogen atoms is through a very powerful force called gravity so if you get enough hydrogen together starts to coalesce coalesce it eventually collapses and it gets so tight that it fuses and that that's the magic of stars and the magic of physics uh in our universe and so um helium actually can burn into bigger elements and so on so um again as these elements start to fuse they release heat they release light so what we're trying to do with plasma fusion systems on planet earth is to recreate those conditions on the sun is to basically take hydrogen plasma and get those atoms those those protons to smash into each other and in the process release heat release energy capture that heat and energy convert it into electricity and use it as a fuel source and the magic of this is there's no radioactive materials involved but the challenge is how do you squeeze the hydrogen down to a tight enough density and make it go fast enough make it energetic enough that you trigger that fusion reaction and get it to sustain itself and so the current state of the art is what's called tokamak system tokamak are these donut shaped systems and inside that donut you got a bunch of magnets on the walls of the donut and the magnets are designed to keep all the hydrogen together in a close enough little uh circle and you pump energy into it you get this plasma to spin spin spin spin spin and if you get it tight enough boom it fuses energy comes out that's the simple statement of what is probably the most complex thing humans have ever tried to do there's a big research program in europe called i care they're spending about 60 billion dollars trying to make the first demonstration system of plasma fusion now what makes plasma fusion so amazing and miraculous if we can do it if it works it will produce more energy than is put in to start the fusion there's no radioactive materials and it uses hydrogen as a fuel source hydrogen is everywhere it costs nothing so we can literally pull water out of the ocean pump it into a fusion system and create energy create electricity that humans can use that's the promise of fusion and it's decades away but it's been decades away for decades every year there are these amazing breakthroughs and we've had a series of breakthroughs over the last year i won't detail them all now but we're clearly making progress now what i was highlighting is if you really extrapolate out and i was saying like think non-linearly now let's say we've got infinite energy and let's say we've got this ability to actually control plasma there's a combination of things that you can do that can unlock potential for us on this planet that i think we're constrained by today so we talked earlier about um fertilizer we're gonna do this full circle now why'd it pull back yeah so one of the one of the inputs in fertilizer there's nitrogen which we talked about there's also potassium and phosphorus phosphorus is mined out of the ground there's only so much phosphorus on this earth all phosphorus is made in the explosion of stars billions of years ago that's where all the phosphorus on planet earth came from it wasn't made here it wasn't even made in our sun it was made in other stars billions of years ago billions of years before our solar system even formed and some of that phosphorus found its way into the area of our solar system some of it found its way into the rock that became earth into the molten rock and some of it's in our crust of our planet and so all that phosphorus every strand of dna uses phosphorus so without phosphorus life doesn't exist on earth so we need phosphorus to grow plants and to eat and all this stuff we're going to run out of phosphorus in about 100 years that's how much we're mining out of the ground and how little there is left how the hell are we going to get phosphorus well we're going to have to come up with some solution to recycle it but generally speaking there's a whole bunch of these heavier elements you know heavier elements being things heavier than call it iron that are really hard to just make um but sorry that are impossible to make that we just have to find and then mine and then use lithium which is what we're using to make all of our batteries right um uh like i mentioned phosphorus some of the heavier elements that are really uh called rare earth metals that are used in battery technology and semiconductor systems and superconductor systems we're gonna have to figure out how to get more of this stuff in the future if you have infinite energy you can do what stars do in the end of their life and during a supernova which is to actually pound a ton of neutrons into a heavier element and when those neutrons hit that atom they basically there's a an interesting kind of physical reaction that takes place they get converted into protons and a bunch of energy is released and that is such an energy intensive process it only happens in the in the few seconds when a star explodes all phosphorus is made when a star explodes so it's not even made in the star it's only made in the moment it explodes that's how much energy it takes to make phosphorus and just jam all of those neutrons in there so theoretically there are systems now where we use petawatt lasers these are lasers that are like you know quadrillions of watts we turn them on for a picosecond and they pump plasma shoot a bunch of neutrons into an atom and convert that atom using the same nuclear synthesis system that happens in supernova and we're doing that in labs today on earth there's about five or six labs that do that the challenge they face is it takes so much energy to do this it takes so much power when you combine the unleashed energy potential of plasma fission systems with the theoretical laboratory scale potential of nuclear synthesis that we see in labs today and you fast forward 150 years i think it's theoretically feasible on a first principles basis that we could see nuclear synthesis becoming an industrial process on earth the math pencils out it's going to take a lot of material that you convert it to energy that you then use to drive neutrons into atoms to make stuff but it's going to be possible and i think it's just such a profound way to think about our place in the universe not only were we editing genomes and changing life forms on earth today we could theoretically be engineering individual atoms and changing the elemental composition of our local area of space and uh and you know the human ingenuity and the tools we have could allow us to just take this chunk of molecules we have sitting around us that we call planet earth and convert it into anything the heck we want right we are on a spaceship and we can make that spaceship our own holodeck and you know that's like the the couple year a couple hundred year kind of principle of where i think these technologies take us of unlimited energy and all this capacity to engineer things absolutely incredible um we've taken up enough of your time i know you've got to run um this was amazing i feel like i owe you money for coming on because i just got like an unbelievable science technology futuristic master class over the last hour so thank you so much i'm going to fly out to california and buy you a dinner no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no just just continue this just just buy a can of device tell your family to buy a can of device pre-orders on canada.com march 3rd we will we will all do that so a dot com canada.comcana.com dave thank you so much for joining and everyone can tune into the all-in podcast as well where you are uh one of the co-hosts which we all love so thank you so much this was amazing thanks for having me in the podcast i guess anything is possible because that's definitely the vibe when you talk holy [ __ ] [Music] that was a uh that was a crazy conversation that was definitely one of those um i can't believe i get to do this as a job or for a living type conversations what'd you think um well first okay so here's my like unedited raw kind of opinion so basically if i understand this he's created this thing called canna that basically can make any beverage through a combination of chemical you know chemicals it sounds like one of those things that's too good to be true um that it could taste as good as like any beverage possible and then it instantaneously can create it i i'm like that's what the skeptic of me says um so we'll see right well how do you think about that relative to like beyond meat impossible who are saying they can do these things you know to reproduce molecularly something that tastes like meat and they're you know high-flying big companies now i mean i was i was skeptical yeah i just needed i think i do think that they had you know that was a huge task at hand it's like how do you recreate meat with just you know non-meat um how do you create a fire that didn't require doing it in the house that's the other thing that's so hard here is like they're saying decentralized right like they're going to put one of these in your house and you're going to be able to do it with just water and then these little you know capsules yeah so i think like i'm a i'm a believer in tech technological change so i'm default an optimist but i do think that when i hear something like this i'm like well yeah that sounds amazing like sign me up um take my 99 but like you know jury is out so our jury isn't out sorry um i'm interested to see so that's that's one p that's one big sort of thing the other thing is i don't know if i feel dumber or like i don't know if i feel like dumb um after listening to him talk about nuclear fission for in astrophysics like i don't know if i'm like living my life wrong like you know like i feel like i haven't heard the word phosphorus since i've been in eighth grade um and maybe i've been living under a rock um but i think that like that was really cool because i you know i did learn a lot um i feel smarter but i also feel really dumb uh when it comes to a lot of these big problems that he's solving yeah so i have a few i have a few reactions i guess my um my first reaction is i [ __ ] love dave um i thought he was amazing some of the stories he told from you know his experience or how he wound around to different things he's done i mean he founded metro mile like he's founded all these different things he's like the quinoa king um all this different stuff he's done but he's very personable and the fact that he can kind of feinman technique things like he's explaining a lot of this stuff you know to us like we're five and i think in a lot of these areas we are basically five like when he got hunted i mean he i preface it by saying like he's obviously super smart and and extremely smart and one of the smartest people i've ever spoken to in my life but i don't like when he was explaining nuclear fission like i would never it's impossible to explain nuclear fission basically to a five-year-old like i i didn't totally get it so if you're listening to this and you didn't totally get it it's okay i think i i disagree i don't know i think i think i understood that more than i understand most people that try to explain web 3 and like hand wave a bunch around web3 stuff and that's not to say either one is like gonna work or not gonna work but when he was explaining it i mean he he literally explained it in the span of like three minutes so i wanna also give him credit for the fact that like he tried to squeeze that in before the end because i asked the question really late um but he broke i thought he broke it down in a way that was like much more understandable than what you would get from you know an astrophysicist that you just asked on the street about this stuff i'm not saying that he didn't do a great job of explaining i'm saying that ex you know maybe the five-year-old sahu bloom was smarter than five-year-old greg eisenberg but you know i i think it's okay if you're listening to this and you didn't quite get it i think it's like it's what what level did you get it on right like i'm not gonna go start this company or like really you know go read a research paper and understand every term but like the general concept of what he's breaking down or trying to get across i think you can like understand on an intellectual baseline level after listening to him talk which is that's more my barometer like einstein explaining relativity to me i'm not going to understand and go be able to go do the formulas and the math but do i understand the general concept around it like what he's getting at with that last piece is if you remove the constraint of energy which has historically been a constraint because there's never existed technologies to make energy truly abundant if you remove that as a constraint you unlock unbelievable non-linear potential with all of these other things in the world and he was giving the example of phosphorus which maybe is over all of our heads but there's a million examples of things where when something has historically been a constraint you remove it through some amazing technological innovation like what he's talking about with nuclear um with with the nuclear technologies talking about there's amazing amazing non-linear potential so i thought the like the broader idea and the ethos behind it was amazing i also just i [ __ ] love optimists and so like his techno optimism and like the can-do attitude around solving massive problems whether or not it ends up happening in my lifetime is a separate question but i can't help but come away from something like that with just like an amazing feeling about what the future looks like yeah i mean he i asked him i think i asked him a couple tough questions you know um and i think you know the biggest question i have is this sounds really perfect and i hope you're right but actually not but like i hope you're right that that's what i'm my big takeaway you asked me what my takeaway is my takeaway is i hope he's right and i'm glad that he's working on this i thought your skepticism and some of the questions were were great i usually play the skeptic on this show when there's things coming up around web3 that sound extremely optimistic or future thinking and so i thought it was really interesting to hear the questions you asked and and especially around you know some of the hardware questions of like actually going and doing this and the timeline for actually making it real and tastes the same i also think there's an interesting question around like do people care about the provenance of beverage like wine right people care about the label of the wine people care about the winery the vineyard the story of where it came from like you can go i always saw it with nfts you can go replicate the mona lisa down to the molecular level it can be exactly identical to the mona lisa but it's not the [ __ ] mona lisa and it's never going to be worth the same as the mona lisa even though it is molecularly identical to it because there's provenance and that matters and we've talked about it with art and with nft world and why an nft is worth something and so i think about that in the case of wine as an example here of like is there enough um that people care about the provenance of their wine that people will have an apprehension around it with beverages that are more commoditized like an orange juice or you know coffee i actually think people do care about the provenance but with things you know that are more commoditized could i see something like this working and being a big part of a household sure could i see it in the next you know two years probably not 10 yeah i personally could i mean i would use this i'm gonna go pre-order one when it comes out um but i thought it was fascinating man i just like i really came away just saying like holy [ __ ] i can't believe i just got to have that conversation for a job totally yeah i i also think it's just like additional inspiration to work on harder problems and work on sustainability and try to incorporate a lot of this thinking into into the stuff we build you also brought up i would just close with this you brought up one of the most important points um from the whole episode which was a micro point and i think i i want to reiterate it because i don't want it to go unnoticed when when i asked him about um how he was learning how he was being intellectually curious and gathering all this information the first three ways were all things that are openly accessible to anyone in the world you know he was like science journals reading following interesting people on twitter then it was meeting with interesting people which maybe meeting with interesting people you know in physical worlds is challenging or there's access points that make it you know something that not everyone can do but the first three which is what you pointed out are something that anyone in the world with an internet connection now has access to and so i thought that was a really cool empowering point for anyone that's out there wanting to take these big ambitious swings um was that someone like a dave friedberg who's had tremendous success is actually consuming the same information that you all have access to in the world that we all have access to so there's no um constraint on the on the access to this information it's a constraint on your motivation and your intellectual curiosity to go and pursue these things totally i mean the first time we met this guy or the only time we met this guy was on this pod you know and this pod is publicly available like you're in like uh we're in your ears right now the room where it happens exactly so um that's why i mean that's why we started the pod and and so i'm glad that you brought that up it's a great place to great place to end it that is exactly why we started this podcast to give people access to these kind of conversations so i'm glad you said that um this was awesome you like the pod get out right now and tweet out that you love our pod and links to the pod we're trying to grow it as fast as possible um and we want your we have like a strangely low amount of youtube subscribers um i think it's kind of our faces we're faces for radio man maybe that's the case um but i think it's i think we've got like 4 700 uh youtube subscribers so go on youtube give us a subscribe go on spotify and apple and tweet us like subscribe i love it thank you so much man that was a that was a blast um so much fun i hope everyone loved it and looking forward to seeing everyone's feedback on the episode cheers i don't know about you guys but i've had a pretty bad relationship with sleep for most of my life i never had much of a routine around it and honestly my performance suffered my ability to recall information to think clearly to think creatively suffered because of my sleep but now i've found something that changed the game for me and that thing is beam dream a functional sleep product that has really changed my life i'm excited to get to share it with you all today and so that you can get a special discount to try it 98 of people surveyed fall asleep faster when taking beam dream and 99 of people experience better sleep quality the results are in the data if you have an aura ring like me you can actually track it and see the impact of when you're taking it and when you're not it's very real and if you don't love it there is a money back guarantee get your money back guaranteed if you don't love it for a limited time you

[Music] what up how's it going man ah it's early for us uh i feel like we normally do these in the evening and i i drink alongside them but it's like the rare morning recording that we're doing right now yeah so but i know you're like super caffeinated so i feel like you're ready to you're ready to go well i'm not as caffeinated as i otherwise would be you know for context but this is like you know morning after the super bowl so i'm like you know a little hungover um got into it a little bit last night and it's it's early i'm this is actually my first cold brew of the day which is pretty rare and i'm only like a third of the way into it so i actually i feel like i need to need to get some energy going here what do you got for me today to give me a little energy i mean i'm still thinking super bowl um favorite super bowl ad obviously the qr code the bouncing around qr code give me your take on that so for people that don't have context or didn't watch the super bowl there was an ad basically it was a black screen and there was a qr code which some people know what they are some people don't but basically this qr code was just like ping-ponging around the screen in different colors um it was a fit it was a coinbase ad and if you popped up in your phone and scanned the qr code it took you to coinbase um and it crashed the site like within two minutes the site was down from all the traffic from you know 100 million people watching the super bowl and presumably a bunch of them logged into it at once and it took down the site so what was your take on i mean so i'll give you my macro take and my micro take so my macro take on the bouncing around qr code is it's an ode to like you remember in school when they used to like bring in a tv and we'd wait for like a video and it was that basically this like bouncing around image and it never hits the corners and i think there's like an office episode actually that like talks that there's like a clip of it maybe we can put in the show notes where like the whole office um is like watching uh the screen and they're just kind of waiting for it anyway so the whole point is um it's an it's a a nod to nostalgia and i think like the macro thing is that nostalgia is one of the most powerful sales techniques of all time and we saw that everywhere that was the theme of the super bowl in my opinion like the winner was nostalgia so for example like the halftime show like was nostalgia you know to the max um so that's the macro and then the micro which is uh this particular ad um [Music] you know i just think it's a brilliant way to get you know if they're gonna spend seven million dollars on an ad and they're trying to get like a hundred thousand sign ups like yeah it makes sense to put a qr code and then it's like yeah it does make sense to like combine direct response plus nostalgia so the stats on it are pretty staggering by the way i completely agree with you nostalgia the actual stats on the ad which i looked up this morning are crazy because they spent 14 million dollars for the 60-second spot during the super bowl it was literally 60 seconds of this thing ping-ponging around and uh it crashed the site within a couple minutes because of all the people going to it the app went from being 186th in the world to second in the world overnight from running this ad during the super bowl and so 14 million dollars and the return was that that massive jump plus all the earned media of people just talking about it constantly we're sitting here talking about it all the news articles this morning i actually tweeted out something saying if i were gonna go drop a bold super bowl ad i would probably pre-program my site to be down like two minutes after the thing dropped because i personally think that the earned media of saying oh we crashed the site with our super bowl dad that we ran is more valuable than the site being up and people being able to like do something on the site when they go to it because i think it extends the half-life of that overall kind of ad impression for much longer than it otherwise would have been yeah i thought that was i i agree with you i also think that like you mentioned like the app store charts like one you know one thing about app store charts is once you hit the top of the charts like other people basically will be like oh what's you know we'll just be discovering the charts and be like oh what's coinbase and so there's a certain amount of staying power that happens when you hit up in you know and and you do what's called a you know that's called like a burst marketing campaign where you you go up and there's a certain amount of staying power so overall like coinbase i mean my guess is they crushed it on those ads in terms of numbers um it makes it makes me think like you know for late checkout and our clients like should we be like taking out more tv ads like and throwing up qr codes um are tv ads undervalued are

digital advertising has gotten do you go back like to the point of nostalgia do you go back to doing the old way i mean we've seen it in consumer i spent a lot of my time in consumer in my old job and the re-emergence of things like direct mail and catalogs within consumer was fascinating because it was like what's old is new right um you had all these people all of a sudden realizing it was so expensive to acquire customers online and spend money on google and facebook and all of those things and so they went to sending direct mailers and like these beautiful catalogs that were really immersive and interesting and that became the new way to acquire customers it was the same thing with small footprint retail like three four years ago all these stores realized that it was more expensive to acquire customers online than to put up a small you know store in soho and have that be like a billboard plus a place for them to create an immersive experience um but this feels like the next emergence of that it was also very clear that crypto was kind of one of the themes of super bowl ads this year you just have all these crypto companies that have raised so much money and needed to find creative ways to deploy it and it was kind of a cool coming out party for a lot of like web 3 crypto the nouns thing that you've talked about in the past that ad where they made an appearance in the budweiser ad um it was pretty cool it was cool to see definitely definitely cool to see um i definitely had like moments where as a crypto person i was watching that and my you know my heart warmed a bunch of times um i think going back to like tv ads as a medium in 2022 i think like why super bowl ads work um is because people tune in to the to this to super bowl ads like i bet you more you know more people prefer the halftime show and super bowl ads than the actual super bowl itself the dif and the difference between like regular tv ads is it's interruption you're just like you're there you're like okay you know clorox you're like in my face like get out of there so i think that what works is you know traditional tv advertisements or traditional advertising in in channels where people are tuning in not tuning out so that's that was a small takeaway i had yeah i think that's a really interesting point it's also an interesting point on the halftime show because i don't know if you've ever seen the mechanics of how that works but basically the nfl contributes like a million dollars towards the halftime show and any other amount that the artists um want in order to create an amazing experience at halftime show is self-funded by the artist so like last year the weekend i think invested seven million of his own capital into making an amazing experience a halftime show this year dr dre put in six million dollars and so they spent seven total in addition to the one um and the the rationale behind it is pretty interesting because it's basically a 15-minute ad for that artist to go and hook people on what their the content that they are creating and so relative to like spending coinbase spent 14 million dollars for a 60-second spot dr dre spent seven million dollars for a 15-minute spot of all these artists might not be quite as relevant for uh dr dre snoop dogg eminem maybe they're not touring as much but for the weekend last year the amount of um roi that he got on that seven million dollars is probably astounding in terms of you know tour ticket sales merch uh spotify streams all of his songs ended up on the top charts in the days that followed that's worth a lot of money um so it's pretty fascinating when you think about the mechanics of these halftime shows as well it makes me think like is there an opportunity to do half-time shows but for other events so obviously super bowl has 100 million people watching or more um but there's tons of events that have a million people watching 100 000 people watching 10 million people watching where you can create a business that basically creates these tours and you can combine these artists you combine the brands and then you sell it to the nfl the nhl college whatever thoughts yeah it's kind of interesting i mean i the the challenge is would you still capture as much attention as you do during the super bowl that's your point the value here is the fact that there's i don't know 100 million people watch this how many of them are tuned in specifically for commercials and for the halftime show and so you know you have this massive captive audience when you're delivering that content could you start to shift the narrative around these other events and create a place where the halftime show is actually drawing people into the other event maybe and you could i mean effectively get a discounted rate um from the fact that you're actually contributing value to the main event via the halftime show so it's it's sort of an interesting here's what i like about halftime shows so and by the way this is a stream of consciousness so let me know if this makes doesn't make sense so halftime shows are for everyone games or for some people so if you could create interesting you know halftime shows and create cultural statements and and bring culture to events that are beyond just like hardcore sports um i just think that there's in a a it makes the game like richer and more con and more interesting to folks and and b i think it it gives artists a channel to um to access audiences and to you know be on their tour dates or beyond like shows that they're gonna do it also brings communities together i i don't think it's crazy what you said it brings communities together because i mean you think of the case the super bowl the amount of super bowl parties people that come together cool moments that that creates and that's because it's an immersive and welcoming environment where it's not just you know men watching the super bowl it's um everybody my wife loves to watch the super bowl because of the commercialism because the halftime show and she likes the football and gets engaged in it and it's a fun experience for us together so i don't think it's crazy at all i think uh like post pandemic that these super bowl type events are going to get a lot bigger and the ecosystem events around a lot of these events are going to get a lot bigger so yeah yeah it's a cool it's cool to think about what how you could build a business around creating i mean you kind of alluded to it earlier create um halftime shows or similar events short like 10 to 15 minute events that are really immersive that can be um inserted into either physical or digital events uh because these these gatherings are going to be uh more and more prolific and at more and more scale within the digital world right you can just get so many people versus in a physical place um and so how do you insert how can you like aggregate and insert interesting content into that um in a profitable way i think it's interesting cool yeah i mean i i think uh that was my light bulb moment last night nostalgia and halftime shows something there yeah so i was thinking more and more it kind of got me thinking more and more about these ideas that i've talked about around creators and owned audiences you know we were talking about the the kind of owned audience effect of people tuning in for the super bowl and um how it's a good way to capture a bunch of people at once and it's effectively priced in right they priced the super bowl ads and so you're not really getting a deal on it per se but if you do something really splashy like what coinbase did coinbase did you can really win and you know there's this whole concept um now that creators are kind of the future of of brands and advertising i was talking with um alex one of the founders at morning brew recently and he was talking and he's been tweeting and doing videos about how he thinks that creators are really the future and and um you know the fact that they have an owned audience and the fact that they have a really fervent and passionate audience and a community built around them that that is the future of consumer consumer brands distribution etc and it got me down the rabbit hole on mr beast who i'm sure you're familiar with but like one of the most prolific youtube creators i think we've talked about him in the past in the context of that squid games reenactment video that he did um which i think now has like 200 million views or something like that something completely insane um but mr beast recently launched this chocolate company and that was like a light bulb moment for me personally as i was thinking about it because look this is a 23 year old young man he has 90 approaching 100 million subscribers on youtube um i think 15 billion plus video views to date 40 million in revenue or something like that in 2021 um that squid games reenactment video did more um generated more revenue than the original which is completely insane to me um and i think he grew by like five million subs from that one video which is remarkable as well so mr beast has gone and launched this chocolate company called feastables and they've done it in a very uh interesting way where the whole launch was tailored around this like willy wonka chocolate factory type deal where you had like tickets like golden tickets in there and so there's a chance to win his actual chocolate factory there's like a million dollars um in prizes you can be in a mr beast video if you get one of the lucky tickets um and it's such a fascinating case study of like the future of where these consumer launches and brands are going because he has a massive owned audience i mean imagine the number of people that are going and buying this because they're seeing him holding it in their videos they're seeing him interact with it talk about it etc it's a good product you know they're like doing the whole like very few base ingredients i'm sure it's kind of best in class in terms of a formulation standpoint and they brought in a really legit team to help run it because they know that immediately this has scale to it it's not like a consumer brand that you need to get off the ground and slowly build a base he has this enormous embedded community and audience around it um so i've just been thinking more and more about this and like what are the opportunities to um to build at scale around this concept like it's great on an individual level that a mr beast can go do this um but what are the business opportunities that exist around this general trend that is developing have you uh have you heard of knight media no okay pull it up um yeah so i know about these guys because we work with them on some projects um and basically is it night as in like a middle medieval or like night like it's it's night time it's the website is night. okay i got it yeah so basically they manage talent including mr beast they oh this is a dope website by the way um they're a venture studio so they basically partner with operators so like you sahil bloom might partner with like a top you know youtube creator that they manage to create a product and they do investing this is really cool so this is what i'm getting at like there has to be an opportunity to create a like holding company of sorts where this is more of like an agency as far as i can tell where like they're representing these people and they will kind of bring them to bear and then there's ownership i thought it would be interesting if you got like 10 creators together and basically gave them joint ownership like you came together twitter tick tock youtube etc and you kind of take joint ownership of this holding company and the holding company then has an investment fund which i imagine you could go raise a billion dollars for because people would definitely give you capital given the collective influence the fund would have um and then you would have everyone's individual brands underneath it probably some sort of just like revenue share where like 10 of the profits they make go back into the holding company pool um and then you have any individual brands you're launching off of it and you launch them and then they you kind of hire a team and you can spin them out like it becomes this like creator iac of the future um that i think is like a really really cool content and you know you call it too right you call it um halftime ventures halftime ventures there you go there you go there's probably something really cool to do with it um you're normally the guy that brings up tokenomics and web3 but i'm just thinking about like over time because you would set an ownership base presumably at the beginning but over time as different people grow in different amounts and are contributing different value to it it would be pretty interesting if you had a way to kind of um have the creators that are growing the fastest and that are contributing the most value to the holding company actually kind of profit from that in some way and similarly the people that are following them that want to kind of participate within that value creation might have a mechanism by some form of token yeah i think the really cool thing about creators in general is and we talked about ecosystems before is you have the creator and then you have their communities and ecosystems around that so if you could create um you know a new a new version of iac or holding company where these creators are incubating products but you know they're seeing upside which is really cool um their communities are seeing upside which is really cool and you can use web3 to do really fun things like for example you know maybe you can't uh you know maybe you get if if you stake let's say your tokens you get certain benefits you get extra tokens like you know maybe there's ways to reward um you know communities and creators that are more uh i guess just are in it for the long haul so i i do like that yeah that piece of it it's a good point yeah i just feel like um one of the trends that i see happening right now is that creators are individually um going and building um kind of equity in things right and you kind of have like a bunch of creators that are raising small funds we've seen that obviously a bunch of our friends um i'm a part of that movement like there's a bunch of people doing this and i tend to think that like one plus one equals three if you bring these people together if you had the collective sway of a bunch of the biggest youtubers a bunch of the biggest twitter a bunch of the biggest tick tock um a bunch of the biggest instagram etc and you kind of brought it into a single fund that would guarantee be able to go and raise and collect more value from lps and the fee base of that and the potential future carry of it than just these individual small funds that people are able to raise um so i think it'd be pretty interesting to actually see something like this come together i've seen like another friend marshall sandman who runs uh animal capital which is like the sway house guys um josh richards and those guys is that his name josh josh richards right um and uh that's pretty interesting because they're bringing this collective kind of sway but can you go do that on a mass scale where you bring a bunch of people together and you have a holding company structure where you can spin things out i think it's pretty interesting and there's probably a bunch of adjacent infrastructure businesses that would need to be built in order to enable people to so how would you do it how would you do it so let's just say someone is listening to this and wants to go and create this um easier for sahel bloom to do it with you know half a million twitter followers by the time we hopefully uh by the time we put this out um you know what what sort of advice can you give to people who who might not have a an audience but who want to create something like this yeah i mean i guess the actual putting together of the structure um i think would need to be led by the individuals that were going to be a big part of it like they would need to all be on board for it but the individual pieces of like business and infrastructure around it i think could really be anybody um like when you think about pitch first off pitching them on it i think there's an interesting thing to just be pitched i i would be glad to be a part of that because i think it's a pretty interesting concept that i've played around with different people but i do tend to think that like the infrastructure uh layer of somebody going and launching a new brand like a feastables um is there a kind of um is there is there infrastructure and tools that exist that allow creators to very quickly spin up product drops or new consumer brands um things like that where you're kind of playing the adjacent trend i think are are probably the more reasonable way for anyone to get involved in that type of movement um but i don't know i need to think about it more we should muse on it more because i actually do think there's something interesting here and something that we're probably uniquely well suited to go and play like here's how if anyone's listening here's how i would think about it to me it's very similar to how you start a conference and you want to get guest speakers so the thing or you're starting a podcast and you want to get you know great guest speakers um you know you try to just like get bigger and bigger names and use those names to leverage other names [Music] and then once you have you know let's say mr beast as a part of this or mr beast coming to your event then it's really easy to get anyone else so i think the way to do this is you have to make a compelling like make a video or something like record a video make something really cool like grab an iphone but make it like unique and interesting and just like dm as many people as possible and then wait until you get that one person to say yes and then use that one person to say yes to like leverage and then be like i've got this person you should come on board yeah it's a hustle game it's a hustle game in the early days um i feel like that's a good transition too to bring in our guest for today who is a amazing creator in his own right but also has kind of taken the creator um the creator path and now effectively transitioned into building really scale businesses and equity around it um so i want to bring in i want to bring in our guest and we can uh we can dive into it with him and go a little bit deeper here cool let's do it um so i want to kick off by just wait we're recording now we're recording yeah but we can delete out whatever you don't like oh okay wait well first of all nice to meet you greg nice to meet you man nice to meet you i must i must admit i've i've seen i've seen your your videos so it's like it's weird for me because you and 10 million it's weird for me because it's like i don't know if this is a video or am i dreaming or what's going on but great to meet you [Laughter] greg tell me more about yourself who are you um yeah background in in building you know internet communities um was an advisor to tick tock uh advisor reddit started and sold three companies ran product strategy at wework now i run a holding company which is called late checkout which uh does investing incubating and uh agency work building web three and community based products for some of the biggest brands that's smart that's cool i love your website thank you okay great this is great wow amazing website um it's an insane website completely insane website um so okay maybe we can just start um i want to dive in and get your story and background because i think it's so interesting how you have progressed from where you start you know you grew up in israel um i want to kind of hear the background like yeah i've looked up and spent a bunch of time understanding you know your path and it's such an interesting one to where you are today and the business building um that you've kind of created around the creator economy as well but maybe we can just start at the beginning i'd love to just hear your kind of journey nus yeah yeah first of all guys uh greg sale thank you so much for having me here uh really appreciate it um yes my name is nasir like yes sire no sire yes sire no sire it's complicated uh i was born raised in israel uh i'm palestinian israeli so it's double whammy moved to the united states for college got into harvard not a double whammy uh graduated worked as a software engineer at venmo before it was cool now venmo is really cool back then it was cool too um and and then decided to become a creator and so i started making videos put them on the internet and then to my surprise like people started to watch i made a thousand videos in a thousand days never missed a day not even once i adopted facebook as my platform as opposed to youtube maybe that's why half your audience doesn't know me uh and uh and it blew up from there and now nas daily has you know 47 million followers in 13 different languages around the world and after i finished that journey of making content i started a tech company going back to my software engineering roots so we're building basically a master class for creators and we have been building it for two years we're venture funded series a and we will be serious b very soon i hope and that's me i'm talking to you from dubai so i need this i need to back you up a little bit on this whole thing because there's so many interesting um points in that story so you got into harvard you ended up at harvard i think i read that you were originally going to do an aerospace engineering degree ended up doing economics and computer science which i think is probably more practical practical maybe you'd be working for spacex or something now working in the space economy but you end up at venmo how did you decide to quit your job and go off on this journey because you were on like probably what was a very lucrative and great track and as uh as someone with um uh with immigrant parents uh and india you know an indian mother um jewish father i uh i was always someone who felt like the safe track was the one i was supposed to be taking and i imagine your parents had maybe similar perspectives yeah i know that's a great question i mean that decision happened six years ago i think the riskiest part of that decision is not the money it's actually the visa because when you quit your job as an international you lose your h-1b and you need somebody else to sponsor it and you need to win the lottery again and i was just like i don't know it was just a stupid decision in retrospect actually made me smart but i was like i don't i don't need america i don't i don't need the visa and i don't need the 120k per year because i had 60k savings already so 60k is is all it takes really to feel a sense of i'm never going to be homeless you know um yeah are there companies just to pause you on the visa point because you're sparking an idea are there companies that um help people with this like a company that um you can nominally work for and acquire a visa via that when you're doing a non-traditional path yeah that sounds like illegal yeah nominally work for equals illegal um do you think so i i don't know like like a company that will um kind of basically take people that are going to go on a non-traditional but potentially lucrative path and bear the risk of the payment on you know on whatever it costs to get them the visa but then gets a percent of the upside around it it's sort of like they're investing in your future which could be potentially much more valuable and they're the ones that are going to incur the costs around the visa process well you are very entrepreneurial man i i get i gotta admire that but i i think the us government asks you why you want the visa i'll uh i'll raise you you know i'll add to that idea so linkedin but it's for jobs that you know u.s companies will sponsor your visa j1 which is your internship visa which is really easy to give tn which is your canadian us you know it's just all br broken down and categorized around different categories as a canadian myself and moved who moved to the us like i dealt with so much pain around just like visas and stuff like that and so many friends have totally and it doesn't need to be this way i mean and and we're in a job shortage right like we need to hire people yeah and highly technical and skilled workers too i mean it's um it's an insane problem i mean i have um close close family who grew up in in bangladesh and are still bangladeshi citizens i believe and um it's impossible one of them worked for him oh one of them worked for amazon and then was wanted to go start a startup but literally couldn't leave amazon because of that challenge of like oh well then i'm gonna have to move back to bangladesh because i won't have a visa yeah wow crazy from amazon to bangladesh anyway back to you guys super interesting anyway i'm sorry i i gotta add so you know you said something uh when you're kind of explaining a bit about yourself which i i really dialed into which is you basically were like hey i started making a bunch of videos and then to my surprise people started watching and i made it a thousand videos every single day so number one like how surprised were you actually like um and how long did it take for you like how did you do it basically like what advice could you give to people listening who want to create something uh who want to you know create videos create tweets create whatever um what sort of frameworks could you give to people to help them get hundreds of millions of people watching yeah well greg the problem with this podcast is that people cannot see my face right when they see when they see my face they realize wow this is not a hollywood face you know there's a lot of this is why don't sell yourself short come on man you know what i thank you for being nice but that's because before starting nas daily i i went on tinder and i swiped right basically on every single girl for the next 500 girls and then i just got like two swipes back people don't want a hollywood face anymore they want a tick-tock face that's what they want okay well i i guess preference changed in the last six years well unfortunately i've been in a relationship for five years so i don't need to swipe anymore but when i swiped i got no responses so that's when i knew statistically speaking i don't have the face to go viral that's number one number two is i scream in my videos i don't know if you've seen the videos but i scream and a lot of people think that's annoying uh number three you know i'm from israel which is a very controversial country and all this stuff so yeah a lot of reasons that's why i was surprised people resonated to my storytelling my my recommendation for people watching is probably uh you know i what is my recommendation actually you know the truth of the matter is you know how there is like companies that find product markets fit i think there is such a thing called personality market fit there are just some personalities that literally cannot go viral that literally cannot be relatable and there are some personalities that are just make one video and you'll be immediately in love people in love with you like charlie demilia for example so my recommendation is first understand if you have personality market fit and for that you need to look at very early signals in your day-to-day life to see if you could rally the crowd around you so i'll give you one of the earliest signals i knew that i could have i could have i potentially could have a career here um despite my tinder failure which was i looked at my facebook my personal facebook and i uploaded a status update and it got 60 60 likes 6-0 and i looked at my roommate and he uploaded one status update and he got six likes now i was wondering why is my status update 10 times more engaging than my roommate who is actually 10 times more attractive than me and also the signals i started to understand like oh my god like my personal facebook is consistently popping you know if i if i throw a rooftop party people show up if i throw another summit six years later people consider showing up and i was like huh there's something there i wonder if i could find 60 million people as opposed to 60. and now we found 47 million and we have 13 million more people to go so that is fascinating to me the way that you laid that out because i i think it it clicks with me in a lot of ways in my own experience as a creator with the twitter stuff i've done because in prior lives i had done i had experienced something similar with facebook on a personal level or with linkedin um on micro scales and then with instagram i had a i had a brief uh appearance as like a travel instagram photographer deleted my instagram in 2017 because i didn't think it was healthy um but i had those same moments and just never really thought about it the way that you laid out that you have these kind of signals the other thing that you're not giving yourself credit for is you created 1 000 videos over a thousand days yes and one thing that we consistently come back to on this show whether it's with um the founder of reddit alexis ohanian or whether it's with scott belsky the head of product at adobe these amazing entrepreneurs founders creators that we've had on is the consistency the relentless consistency of effort is a common thread among all of them all of them actually say that they're not particularly special which i call on by the way like everyone says that i think it's this great thing of humility awesome i like i respect the hell out of it yeah i think it's i think all of you are very special but one thing that you all have in common for sure is this uncommon relentless consistency around the efforts once you've found something that works you know how to just go deep deep deep deep down that route yeah that is very true i think you would call it in a different world like obsession because it took me 270 videos to actually you know make it big with nice daily to get to uh you know to 4x um in one day so so my overnight success took 270 days every single day every single weekend working and making that one minute video um so i would say it's like you know like deep down inside like i knew this was this is supposed to work from day one but it took 270 days for it to actually work um how did you deal with the emotional side of creation and of the process like it's it's very similar to entrepreneurs great to this in his own entrepreneurial journey the highs and lows the swings are enormous and there's a high incidence of depression i think among entrepreneurs and among creators for this reason because you have this daily scorecard of your performance and when you're posting something on facebook every day and you thought it was amazing and two people like it or in your case you know 200 versus 2000 you're the only person that really thought about that by the way but it really does impact your mood so how did you deal with that emotional side of the of the process and journey yeah the truth of the matter is i i don't i don't deal with it it stresses the crap out of me and and you're so right is very similar to entrepreneurship like yesterday i thought my company is going to be 10 billion today i think it's going to be a failure you know like literally within 24 hours there's a 10 billion dollar difference every day when i was every day every day when i was making those videos if one video tanks i say okay i lost my facebook page it's gone it's dead forever and i had that feeling 500 days out of a thousand i'm not here to give any advice because i suffer from this every day i do think about getting a shrink i do think about getting into like a mental hospital or something um because it is you know it's when you take content and entrepreneurship at the same time you know the highlight the highs and lows are doubled so yeah here's another solution to it you got to suck it up here's an idea mental health hospitals for creators dude i completely agree i'm i'm all in on that i i think it's i think it's brilliant like even just like a tailor-made um daily video or something that you can click on um when you're facing those very common problems that creators all face like hedonic treadmill you know getting a thousand likes on a twitter thread in the past for me was like holy i just got a thousand likes on this now a thousand likes i feel like holy that's a dud why did i spend the time to write that i'm useless i'm a piece of yeah it's like dealing with those daily things that's something everyone deals with and you're again you're it's such a personal journey and you're the only one that thinks about it so i i agree greg i think you could build a very simple uh mental health curriculum with like little modules where you could just click on that video of like something to give you perspective on x y or z plus kind of peer-to-peer matching or like a community yeah where you could talk with other creators in real time about how you're dealing with that like our whatsapp group does is um is one of the most amazing things because it's a it's a whatsapp group that was put together by our friend um sriram over at a16z and it has just a bunch of amazing creators in it across youtube twitter tiktok you know instagram etc and people actually share things they're struggling with on a daily basis and then other people come in and give them perspective on it or you want to think about it i asked one time how to deal with negativity and everyone gave their perspectives and it really helped me so and that's how we connected that that's how we connect exactly that's how we connect it um and so thinking about how you productize that greg to your point i think okay i got the idea you know the company i sorry i gotta sorry i got the name i got the name we're gonna register the name after this as soon as so when this is live and if anyone wants to work on this because i think it would actually make the lives of creators a lot more healthy and happy and in turn hopefully make other people happier and healthier so the name is um creatorsgeneralhospital.com okay that's amazing i love that we could bring in like i bet we could bring in 10 or 15 creators as like part owners of this by the way and you'd have buy-in from people that could talk about it with their audiences because creators tend to have a lot of aspiring creators in their audiences so the distribution of it would actually be really easy because you could just talk about it you would know you had you know five percent ownership or something of this company we just need to find someone really good to build it and run it yeah but i think you you you cannot put hospital as a trademark in the in the in the company name i think uh it must it must be reserved somewhere but actually a similar company that's doing it is from israel it's called better help no well i like look i think that that is um i think the thing that's really interesting about this idea is that um it's like this general framework that i talk about often um of like the uh i think it's like generally christensen's model of disruptive innovation where you you have a space that is massive in mental health and you have companies that are trying to serve the entire spectrum of mental health that's very hard because what happens is you end up over-serving some customers under serving others you're not providing the perfect service to some people and so what you'd focus on with this for creators in particular is provide the exact set of mental health services that creators need and you'd go to creators and figure out exactly like what are the 10 or 15 you know swings in emotion that tend to happen whether it's too high or too low you know negativity on the platforms whatever it is and you'd create simple modules and simple products that would allow you to feel better in those moments and then you'd pair it with community because i think that that's a super interesting thing that you and i nods have seen is really powerful when you when you have a community you can talk to or rely on um and you'd figure out basically how to provide that very specific set of services and i don't think it would be that hard to set up actually as a company um and you could be the creator mental health platform very quickly and if you launched with creators and partnership as part owners of the company you could probably get to scale pretty quickly as well there you go there you go that's a 100 million dollar idea greg what do you think um i love it i think what i like about it too is it's it's relatively simple to to get going like it's just about scoping what are those nuanced services that you need how do you ensure that the mental health professionals are high quality and can do the job and it's just like a landing page really a brand a great brand and a landing page um yeah yeah and i think you go talk to a hundred creators like go talk to 25 tick talkers 25 youtubers 25 twitter or whatever and ask them what the you know swings of emotion are give us like three things that impact your daily mental health as a creator um and then you go you know partner with mental health providers and and mental health doctors who can um actually create the services that would improve their lives and those in those regards and then you you pair it with communities so that people can pop in and ask their questions or talk to someone that's unbiased or even anonymized um to help with those things on a daily basis because i do think there's going to be more and more people it's a great macro trend there's more and more people that are going to be creators that are thinking these things um and people are going to feel this more and more because we're in this world now that is going to be increasingly digital and so that connection um and the more time you spend there the more negativity you're going to face the more of this like kind of highs and lows swings you're going to face there's a pretty interesting business to be built around this yeah and i think uh there's a social good angle too right you could do like for every hour of mental health help that the creator buys maybe you give an hour to to to someone who needs it who can't afford it that's interesting too like a tom's shoes buy one get one thing buy one give one rather are you guys in the are you guys in the like uh uh like brainstorming phase in your lives where you're looking for the next company to build i think we're always in that phase i um i mean part of this show um is ideating in real time basically giving people we called it where it happens which is a play on the room where it happens and basically give people a lens into the kind of insight to idea to execution journey that entrepreneurs founders executors operators go through and so democratizing access to the rooms where these interesting conversations happen and where ideas are created and and formed um so part of it is literally this type of thing where we're on and we're talking and we're like oh holy that's an interesting idea let's go down the rabbit hole a bit on it and then we have a community set up in discord where we'll try to go deeper on those things and where people are actually trying to go start some of these ideas that have come out of the world that's smart how many companies have like fun out of this so far well we're only what is this episode 10 greg we're not very many episodes in we launched the show um a few months ago so there's actually i mean there's three separate channels now built around specific ideas that have come out of the show and you have like people going and doing research on different things that are coming out of there the ultimate vision is that we can create a fund around the show that actually invests behind these ideas um and you can kind of seed them out where it's almost like the show becomes a holding company of sorts that's great yeah it's pretty interesting um so tell us before we run out of time i want to hear more about nas academy as a company and so you did your creator journey you had scaled massively you know on facebook you then launched your youtube and i think 2019 you've scaled enormously on youtube as well i love your video going to north korea by the way it was awesome um fascinating i watched it with my wife is so so good um so i'm curious then how you kind of thought about jumping into building a business and um maybe kind of you know slowing down some of your creator output and focusing on building equity and building a real business that frankly enables a lot of other creators to go and create what they want to so look here's the way i think about it for any creators that are listening to this you have a shelf life you have a shelf life that either the market dictates or your mental health dictates which is basically like say five six years you know even the algorithm on facebook and youtube does not like you forever right at some point the algorithm's best interest is to recommend other creators on the platform to keep it fresh so you can never be the biggest creator on facebook forever so your shelf life is five six years um my when i was reaching my shelf life which was roughly year three for i was like quick i gotta build a company so that i need to build it for the next three years so by the time i'm out of my shelf life as a creator i have a billion dollar company you know so basically i'm using my creator lifespan as a leverage to become an entrepreneur the last thing you want is to be caught in a cycle two or too late then you'll just be a husband as a creator and you'll be a failed company as a company so um this is why i made the jump i've also always dreamed of having an organization that works when you're asleep the problem with creation is that you're when you're asleep there is no creation but when you have a thousand people working you can still be productive 24 7. um and last but not least i think every creator is a business you're an individual as a business you're a business of one that's what a creator is nothing else so going from a business of one to a business of 1 000 shouldn't be that impossible uh so that's why we're taking on that challenge as well so these are the reasons why i decided to start a company now the question is why did i decide to start this specific company master class for creators well there's a need nobody's teaching in the world greg i don't think you're teaching sahil i don't think you're teaching other than those tweets and you have knowledge what the hell is you know what's what's going on like your knowledge is really highly privileged it's only your friends in that whatsapp group that can access that knowledge so we really are on a mission to convince as many creators as possible to productize their knowledge and share it with their audience and that's kind of the idea behind nasa academy so both uh sahel and i have done a few of these cohort based courses and oh you did i assumed you're not dj and i just checked nazicon academy is it is it cohort based or is it like recorded and could you talk a little bit more about you know the best way for creators like us to educate people yeah so it's actually cohort based recorded so that's the beauty of it it's like hybrid so the problem with just cohort base is that you need to be teaching all the time every single cohort you need to do the work it doesn't scale with nasa academy it's like it's recorded but the recordings are only available at a certain time this unlock at a certain time finish at a certain time so every 100 students are put in one group and they learn together there's a coach assigned to them to make sure they all meet each other and communicate with each other and then they watch your video files when they unlock every day that's kind of the idea behind it so it's a scalable way for creators to teach in cohorts so how would you like i'm familiar with um like i think greg and i both did our courses with maven um yeah which is sort of the biggest platform now around like the live cohort based courses um how does it work you know one of the things maven i think has done really really well is they actually teach teachers how to be effective teachers like you know the future digital professors they do a course to teach them how much training are you doing around um like with the creators so that the quality of the content and the course that they're going and creating the videos et cetera is exceptional so i invested in maven and maven invested in us so we're sister companies basically um you know we love them i love the gun and west they're incredible people um and they've done something amazing i think maven is specializing in the live we are specializing in the uh pre-recorded uh but it's all cohort based uh we actually do a lot of hand holdings we have a curriculum team we have a video editing team so we go to your house sahil and basically we shoot you for two days we help you edit the classes for very very very very cheap and then we we put them out on the internet on the marketplace setting of nas academy so nas academy is not just software to help you teach but it's also giving you distribution think of it like amazon and maven is like shopify right we're trying to build the destination kind of like udemy and master class while maven is building let's say the infrastructure teachable and and in shopify so do you have does nas academy have like an all-access pass in the way master class does or is it self-serve kind of individual courses yeah so the problem with the self with a with a class pass is that eventually uh you lose control as a creator of your class you have no incentive to teach in nasa academy because if you're bringing in one extra user we we make all the money you know forever so that's why we're actually keeping it by purchase only we're enabling subscription for you so you can subscribe to sahil 20 a month to learn from him so it becomes like it's like a mix between patreon and masterclass basically this is interesting um super super interesting and then how does that tie in for you as a business to these summits that you're on so we are you know nas means people in arabic it just happens to be in my nickname but nas means people in arabic and uh we just want to build the people company so nasa academy people's academy now summit people's summit nas daily people stories of people every day um nas hotel you know nas fund everything we just want to build nas um everything ties to everything you know it's like a flywheel effect in the nas summit we're bringing creators casey neistat by the way is going to be the keynote that's going to be very exciting um you know we're trying to bring creators together in physical settings just to make the tide rise for all boats and we'll benefit a little bit but you'll benefit the most and this also is the same way we run us academy you make most of the revenue we take a small cut i love it i also i just love how it overlays community into all of this because i imagine you know when you bring this many great creators together they're all going to be building they're going to start collaborating on different things they'll do videos together they'll be working together you know there's just a lot of interesting things that will then trace chase their lineage back to the summit that was happening in dubai or whichever summit had had occurred digitally or physically exactly we we just want to make interesting people meet other interesting people that's it nice uh so yeah i was just gonna say um just because we're running out of time in a few minutes but you know do you have any five-year predictions around where uh where creators are gonna go like what does the future of creators look like in five years according to nas oh man that's a great question well i want to say something controversial what can i say like if i say it will increase well whoop they do sherlock holmes also cancer you know like so of course it'll increase i think i think the idea that you need to be a video creator to be a creator is going to be like not like it it will disappear i think video creator is going to be minority potentially like you could be an nfc creator uh a 3d artist creator uh so i think the definition of creator will increase from just vlogger to nfd artist or even an engineer could become a creator uh two i think they will make a crap ton of money uh i think you're gonna definitely see a creator well you see a creator a billionaire i think you will they're 100 yeah there will be a creator billionaire i don't think it's going to be mr beast by the way um i think what is that i think they'll come from india i think a lot of people in india are like killing it but the mainstream media in the united states does not listen does not watch like unacademy for example is a four billion dollar company started by a youtuber buy you by jews is the biggest educational company in the world worth 15 billion dollars who was started by a teacher who started on youtube so i i don't you know let's get out of the u.s bubble a little bit it's already happening so we're definitely going to see a youtuber who becomes a billionaire in the next five years the first youtuber creator billionaire will come from india you heard it here first oh you should tweet that bro that means i love that that's a great i have a lot a lot of my audience is in india because of my own heritage as well but um that's a great prediction i think it's an interesting one and i think your prediction on the kind of dynamic nature of what creators will look like is a fascinating prediction as well greg and i have talked about that in various forms on the show pseudonymous creators you know creators that never show their face in any way um in this digital world and as we increasingly move towards living in and caring more about our digital worlds and our physical realities um i think it's more and more going to become the case i completely agree with you yeah that's exciting but the problem is you're we're not we're not uh building for that world you're not building for that world we're we're still uh videographer actually are you a video creator would you say you're a video we post videos around this show like this video will be posted um and we do half the episodes live in person and so that we can post videos but i wouldn't consider myself a video creator yet just because of the scale of my reach there is so low relative to on twitter um eventually i hope to be um i don't know i don't know if i'm what's that how's your tinder game that dictates if you have uh you know my tinder game is zero i've been married for five years so you're gonna try to get me in trouble here i've got a baby on the way my tinder game is non-existent if my wife is listening non-existent that's great [Laughter] um no this was awesome man i i'm super appreciative of your time i know it's late on your end as well i hope i can make it over to one of these events um and if not we need to just do more together i feel like there's a ton of energy alignment around all of these things and um the future is very very bright for what you're building so i'm i'm excited to to watch your journey thank you guys i mean greg sale thank you for for having me on this on this podcast and if you're ever thinking about teaching you know where to go absolutely now so where can people find you just give us a quick plug where can people find you um yes seen

but the thing that big clout did that also handshake did right so handshake is a dns protocol so domain name service protocol um basically what they did is on big cloud they allowed anyone with a twitter existing twitter profile to claim the equivalent on big cloud right so you wouldn't have the zero start problem and then it enabled people to basically buy creator tokens for anyone on twitter right and twitter was the first platform they sort of linked through to so people can buy belts and demure's tokens i have not claimed my big clout account and i i don't plan to sorry i touched my microphone sorry you're good you're good you're good you're good you're good um but i think the challenge again is like all the actions on twitter so why would i invest hundreds of hours into building up my big cloud and the idea was if we incentivize people with free money then they'll come and they'll stay and now what happened is people came they claimed their free money they cashed out and they went right back to twitter and all of them were like so hyped for one week it was like everyone pouring money into big cloud like we're gonna get rich off big clouds and then i literally didn't do anything because i didn't understand it and a week later big cloud got like rug pulled everyone lost their money on it

one of the things i've been really interested in lately is belief right so money is a collective fiction right we and we can we don't need to get into this whole history of money like let's start with the number zero humans are narrative we're storytelling creatures actually right like mythos mythology stories that's how we've transmitted history through time that's how we remember who we are right and the stories are really just like fragments we've pieced together they've changed and evolved over time to fit whatever narrative we're trying to create and it's always the victors who tell the story right tell our history but there is this really interesting movement so historically right people organized around religion around belief like around their perception of what's happening why we exist what's going on um we have this really interesting shift that started to happen where our societies are no longer driven by organized religion right it's no longer really driven by your belonging to your nation state or like nationalism is is not as prevalent as it was probably 20 30 years ago and so what's really interesting is there's this huge religious movement that's taking place it's the spiritual but not religious movement
