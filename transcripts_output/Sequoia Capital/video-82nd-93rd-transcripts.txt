[Music] I was confronted with a situation where we would finish the project and die or not finish the project and die right away we were very concerned about are we going to lose this company or not we only got one shot and if you have one shot that chip has to be perfect but how do you build a perfect chip the first [Music] time welcome to Crucible moments a podcast about the critical Crossroads and inflection points that shaped some of the world's most remarkable comp companies I'm your host rof buam almost exactly one year ago in November of 2022 chat GPT took the World by storm within 5 days it had 1 million users within 8 weeks 100 million it was the fastest adoption of a new technology product the world had ever seen what fewer people know however is the decades long story of the company that developed the technology that chat GPT and much of AI as we know it today relies on today we're looking at Nvidia the technology company founded in 1993 by Jensen Hong Chris malikowski and Curtis Priam their initial idea was to create 3D graphics cards for gamers nvidia's eventual shift towards AI is one of the most remarkable business pivots in history it has spotlighted Nvidia on our cultural stage and cemented the company as a global leader in AI computing The Crucible moments in today's episode Center on nvidia's willingness to bet on unproven markets years ahead of time we'll look at how Nvidia took a risk at its outset entering a competitive field and targeting a user base few took seriously how days from bankruptcy they scrapped their product architecture entirely and embarked on a timeline so ambitious no one thought they could pull it off and how the company finally dominant and G gaming decided to stake its future on a radically new field that many doubted would ever become a viable Market I'm Jensen Wong I'm the president and CEO of Nvidia I met Chris and Curtis they were at some Microsystems I was at LS logic so we were all from the workstation industry and all we had to worked on were Sun workstations and and valid workstations and things like that this was in the ' 80s back when most computers were bulky expensive machines really only available to businesses that could afford them Sun Microsystems manufactured high-end computer workstations and LSI logic specialized in semiconductors concurrent with a computer Revolution was the race to create the most sophisticated computer chips very few companies had the ability to build their own chips with the exception of IBM really at the time and so son was venturing into building semic custom chips for their computers Chris and Curtis were building chips at some Microsystems and I was the assigned engineer to work with them from LSI logic so in essence Jensen was assigned to me and that started a friendship between the three of us my name is Chris malikowski I'm senior vice president fellow and co-founder of Nvidia Corporation we really hit it off Chris and Curtis are are um uh two of the best Engineers I've ever known incredible people Visionary and architecture and design and uh really really enjoyed working with them the CHP most companies were focused on developing were central processing units or CPUs the general purpose chips that execute commands entered into a computer but in the early '90s Chris Curtis and Jensen were tasked with building something more challenging a graphics card a chip that could be inserted into Sun's workstations alongside the CPU to render graphics on screen the three of us went about building this graphic subsystem that was challenging LSI logic who had announced the they knew how to build chips this size had never done it and we were able to get the job done each sort of staying in our lane and being good at what we did one year there were quite a few changes in the computer architecture and the graphics architecture at Sun and the architecture that Chris and Curtis worked on fell out of favor and they decided to leave the company Chris and Curtis reached out to me and asked me if I would like to leave MSI logic and join them to build a company and first of all none of us knew what company we would build and I told them that you know I wish them well they're going to do great I was gamefully employed and really happy doing what I was doing they kept asking me and finally I said well you know tell you what the one we just go out and we can think through what kind of company you guys can go build and so we would meet at Denny's which is right at the corner of capital and beresa this place in East San Jose I used to wash dishes at Denny's and I was a bus boy at Denny's and I was a waiter at Denny's so I I really like Den's I mean Denny's I consider my first company you know and and so we would go hang out there and was always a fun thing for me and a fun thing for them we just sit there and you know drink a bunch of coffee and you know the thing that's really great about Denny's is is all you can drink we'd show up we'd order one bottomless cup of coffee and then you know work for 4 hours so we just sat there until we ran out of ideas we ran out of things to talk about and go home and you know come back and do it again the PC Revolution was just beginning in Earnest and the trio recognized this as an important why now for their nent company this is now 1993 the PC Revolution really started 1995 we knew that the PC was able to reach price points and a level of of ease abuse that might actually have a chance to become you know quite pervasive and so we were excited about the PC Revolution and uh we thought okay well what application would we bring to the PC and what would we enable as this computer becomes a consumer computer and goes into the home you know what would would you do with it well the one thing you would do with it more than anything in the world is play games the capability the graphics capability the multimedia capability of of the PC was non-existent at the time there were no sound there was no microphones there were no speakers there no video there's no Graphics basically it was a text terminal and we thought you know maybe 3D Graphics would be the the the thing that'd be really cool and for the very first time you have a platform that could both be a computer and used for you know whatever you want to use it for uh you could also use it to play games and um we just need to go build a chip that makes it possible to play games none of us had even seen a PC before so we had to go buy a PC we bought a Gateway 2000 nobody even knows how to program Windows uh or Doss nobody even seen dos and so we had to tear it apart um start learning about the industry if you were to go to market research firms and you ask them what what's the market sized for 3D graphics for PCS in 1993 the answer would have been zero my name is Mark Stevens I joined seoa in 1989 and in 1993 I became the seoa representative on the board of directors of Nvidia marus since left Square by the way but remains on nvidia's board Chris Curtis and Jensen who still hadn't left his job at alysi logic wrestled with the idea of launching a company that made three Graphics chips for personal computers but they realized if they were to move forward they would have two major factors working against them the first was competition the market for 2D graphics for PCs was crowded at this point the differentiation here was Nvidia was going after 3D Graphics but there's a whole raft of Chip copies that came out in the 1980s you had companies like xyl linkx and Altera companies like serus logic and chips and Technologies one could argue you know why does why did the world need Nvidia why did the world need another Graphics chip company in addition to a crowded chip Market the second Factor working against Nvidia was its target audience and the chips intended use you know the people who did gaming on PC at that point were were teenagers gaming it just didn't have a lot of respect it just didn't feel like a first year business that everybody got and everybody appreciated and the overall gaming Market was much smaller at the time versus the market for movies and and other media forms the gaming Market is has become huge on a worldwide basis but back then gaming on a PC was a fairly small application games were just thought of of not serious applications Alfred Lynn I'm a partner at squir Capital throughout my life I've always been fascinated by Nvidia and and fascinated with games even though I decided not to do any of that professionally but I've been fascinated with game consoles and the graphics and how you could represent Graphics the most efficient way I would say a lot of things that don't seem serious a lot of things that seem like toys can very much start out that way but over time they have this ability to blossom into other applications The Crucible decision for Curtis Chris and Jensen was do you enter a hyperco competitive field of triip making where you have to fight to stand out and if you do do you position your renovation as a 3D chip for gamers an unproven Market at the time and bet on the potential of that market to grow there are several things that we say in the company and and that is do you believe it or not the first principles say you start from your assumptions whatever you believe and you break it all down and and it says therefore you should do this there go this so why don't you do it for what reason don't you do it and so if you believe this is going to change the Computing industry altogether for what reason don't you take this first move just start I think it was towards the end of 1992 beginning of 1993 I that I said okay Chris and Curtis I'll go do it with you guys and February 17th my birthday in 1993 was my first day of work the founders began looking for investors for their new company and Jensen went to meet with his old boss the head of alisi logic Wilfred cargan wil look if you're going to start a company go talk to Don Valentine and while I was sitting there he picked up the phone and he said hey Don I'm going to send a kid your way he's one of my best employees I'm not sure what he's going to do but give him money I went to SEO Don Valentine was there and and he just scares you and and I was 29 I just turned 30 I did a horrible job with the pitch but thankfully he was already instructed to uh to give me money Don at the end he just said one thing he said if you lose my money I'll kill you we were working in a small office at a strip mall I think we probably hired up to 20 people or something like that and here we are we're going to build a new chip for a new industry and so we just started from first principles and started building it up and and we specified this chip call mv1 the mv1 chip was the first device of the company delivered to the market I believe it took us 18 to 24 months to to deliver the chip after the company was founded and we thought it was going to be a great chip the reality is the chip was a failure it was a a great technology achievement it was a terrible product you know when you're done describing mv1 it sounds like an octopus because what kind of a chip does the PC industry Buy that has 3D Graphics video processing audio wave table processing IO Port game Port acceleration has this programming model called UDA no applications that run for it you know what do you call this thing that sounds like an octopus you know when you pull it out of the box it actually comes with these dongles and and these dongles makes it kind of feel like an octopus and and you need all these things because you got to you know connect the whole computer to it the way I've always thought about it is we built a Swiss army knife with lots of functions and the chip was overpriced for what the market wanted the market wanted a 3D Graphics chip and that's it and they wanted it as cheap as they could get it and as fast as they could get it and so uh it was a flop our customer partner uh Diamond multimedia uh we sold them 250,000 mb1s the retail sales wasn't very good and so Diamond panicked they returned basically most of those product to us 250,000 units went out 250,000 well 249,000 came back and practically put us out of business we learned a lot from that from that failure you know nowadays people refer to this as product Market fit and so we had a very good product but the fit was not there V ofv pricing and functionality I had to learn all of those things and you know how do you position against the competition because the customer is always thinking of Alternatives and so your PC companies are trying to figure out okay so this mv1 you can't compare to anything but it's not as good as this thing at this it's not as good as that thing at that but it's incredibly good together it's really hard to buy things like that nobody goes to the store device with army up and it's something you get for Christmas and so in every single way way from product strategy go to market how to think about the competition I think about positioning how do you even price it uh not to mention why would you go build such a thing in the beginning or there are other ways to go build it I mean the list of of mistakes that we made and that I made in the first three years of the company you could really write a book I think the lesson that we learned at seoa was that we might have been too early you know the investing in the 3D Graphics PC market uh and that's always a risk or a fear that we have as early stage investors the failure mechanism for most Venture back technology companies is that they're too early to Market not too late to Market we were out there sort of waiting you know on our surfboard in the Pacific Ocean waiting for that big wave Market wave to come in and you know if if the wave never comes in you never get to Shore and you freeze to death out in the middle of the ocean while the failure of the nv1 chip was apparent there was a bright spot on the horizon the company was simultaneously developing the nv2 in partnership with the video game company Sega sega's latest game at the time was you know virtual fighter and Daytona and virtal cop and you know really really fantastic 3D arcade games they were completely revolutionary Sega was also looking for a partner to build their next Generation console and it opened doors for us both in trying to build their next Generation console as well as encouraging them to take the Sega games over to PCS on the engineering side the nv1 and nv2 were developed to support an architecture that rendered images using quadrangles when Nvidia first launched it was the only company in the market making 3D Graphics chips for PCs but soon other 3D Graphics companies began to emerge and their chips supported a different type of architecture one that rendered images using triangles the architecture we chose was clever at the time but it turned out to have been wrong architecture completely this is 1995 Microsoft had come out with Windows 95 and the API called DirectX is the architecture that everybody else uses except us we had never even implemented a graphics architecture like DirectX before and the rest of the industry now some 50 companies are all over us and so the question is what do we do if we had finished that game console with Sega and fulfilled our contract we would have spent two years working on the wrong architecture while everybody else is racing ahead in this new world that quite frankly we kind of started on the other hand if we didn't finish the contract then we run out of money and so I was confronted with a situation where we would finish the project and die or not finish the project and die right away your first trip is a failure and your second triip is doomed Nvidia had arrived at a crucible moment do you finish the job you started and hope the revenue can sustain you or do you break your contract scrap your entire architecture and start from scratch this existential moment for our company was pretty difficult you know heated discussion uh among us to try to figure out what to do and I think the final decision was the right one one which is we have to figure out what is the the right path forward longterm and work our way back and the long-term answer of course is we have to support this new architecture this new graphics AR it's called inverse texture mapping and we have to abandon the forward texture mapping architecture that we had started and whatever we have to do to achieve that is the right thing to do so I went to Sega and to the credit of their CEO IR madrean I told them our circumstance is that if we finish this game console for you our company would be out of business and quite frankly I think that this architecture that we would build for you would be the wrong architecture because the world is moving towards this other approach called imerse rendering ERS tecture maing he asked me what I'm asking him to do and so I I told him that although there's no reason for him to do this I would like him to let us off of our contract relieve us of our responsibility of fulfilling the contract but pay us in full and they got absolutely nothing out of it there's no reason for him to do it and he thought about it for a couple days and you know came back to me and and said you know I'd like to help you you can't discount the kindness of people when you're starting your company when you you're you benefit than the kindness of all the people that support you but in this particular case it was some $5 million I think it was that they continued pay us it was all the money that we had and it gave us just enough money to hunker down after the failure of nv1 and then after nv2 sort of being abandoned we were very concerned as investors you know at this point we're probably three years into the company something like that and uh it wasn't clear if Nvidia was ever going to sort of have Escape velos one of the things that Jensen uh he said this for many many years was we're only 30 days away from going out of business well the fact of the matter is on a few occasions in the mid 90s that was true from you know because we were burning cash and developing through these uh Graphics devices you you needed some of the best Hardware in Silicon engineers in Silicon Valley and these folks do not come cheaply especially when we were competing with silicon Graphics which was sort of a Jugger at the time for engineering talent and Apple at the time so we were very concerned about are we going to lose this company or not with the L of their resources the company mounted one more attempt at a breakthrough chip we only got one shot and if you have one shot that chip has to be perfect but how do you build a perfect chip the first time nobody knew how to do that because in the old days you would build a chip bring it up write software for it find bugs iterate the chip tape it out again bring up more software until you get it done so tape out to production was often times at least a year year and a half I told the team that look we we get one tape out and they said why because if we need more than one tape out we don't need it we'll be out of business and so we get one shine in times of crisis when real quality CEOs are on display and this was a time where we as investors and board members discovered that Jensen was really unique in the way he managed a crisis I said let's work backwards if we get one shot what do we have to do to make sure that that one shot was perfect and so we have to do all the software in advance we had to do everything in advance and we did it in about six to seven eight months and uh on complete fumes and there was this other company that went out of business at the time and I'd heard about it it's called iOS and iOS had buil this thing called an emulator an end system emulator we called iOS they said thanks for calling but we're out of business and I said really that's insane we we really could use one of your instruments it's like a size of a refrigerator you plug it into the uh the PC that you want to emulate for and you pretend it's called emulation you pretend like you're the final chip and he says we have one in the warehouse that's an inventory if you want it we'll sell it to you and so we bought the scraps out of a company that was going out of business and we emulated uh Revo 128 mv3 the first PC chip the world's ever emulated and we taped out the chip and the chip worked the first time unsurprisingly to me anyhow that the genius of the the people that were at Nvidia would come up with the world's best inverse texture mapping engine in compl completely crushed everyone and revolutionized what we know today about modern computer Graphics we changed the way that chips were designed we changed the way that you tape out chips the way almost everything about our company today um yeah we Sav the company the Rea 128 was a feat of engineering and in its first four months sold 1 million units even more importantly the expedited process of building building and testing the Reaver allowed Nvidia to then launch its next chips at a Cadence more than twice as fast as competitors at the beginning Nvidia was behind but soon probably soon after 1999 they were just far ahead of their competition and you can just see it so when Quake 3 Arena came out in 1997 you just could see how much better the Nvidia chips performed against others nvidia's fifth chip was its first programmable chip it was called the GeForce 256 that was the world's first GPU and that was um adding programmability to acceleration so we created the world's first programmable accelerator a programmable accelerator is accelerated Computing and the benefit of accelerator is whatever you designed it to do it does it incredibly efficiently and so no matter how effective a CPU is with a programmable accelerator you could be a thousand times more effective this programmability would prove critical to the company's next chapter but it also paid immedia dividends with programmable shaders enabled by GeForce gpus video games exploded in creativity and popularity Nvidia went public in 1999 and in a twist of fate Microsoft whose direct X architecture nearly sidelined Nvidia in its early years chose GeForce to power its new project the Xbox it took five generations for them to get this Graphics acceleration right before they produced their first GPU and so the company was founded in 1993 and I don't think they released the G4S 256 until late 1999 so it was a long time of just iterating iterating iterating until they got it right to produce the first GPU unit if you you solve really hard problems that nobody else can solve which is what inidia has done and your patient you can build a tremendous company over time the success of the GeForce carried Nidia into the mid 2000s but as with all companies that break new ground eventually competitors catch up and while Nvidia had solidified its position as a major player in the 3D Graphics market for PC games over time it singular ity its shine began to fade the PC market at that point was starting to ASM toote and growth and we were worried about that and since we were selling into the PC we still had to contend with Intel as a competitor uh AMD to some extent and so we felt we were always going to be sort of boxed into the PC gaming market and always knocking heads with intel if we didn't develop a brand new market that nobody else was in Nvidia had invented the GPU and and it was a programmable device which means that it could be programmed and adapted for applications outside of gaming the 2006 release of Cuda at general purpose programming interface for nvidia's gpus opened the door for use cases far beyond gaming molecular Dynamics seismic processing CT reconstruction image processing a whole bunch of different things I remember starting to hear and musing about a lot of graduates students for their research found these you know Graphics chips at their local electronic store and they were writing simulators on them and doing research on them universities after another researchers realized that by buying this gaming card called GeForce you add it to your computer you essentially have a personal supercomputer one of the scientists that I saw was in Taiwan and he was a Quantum chemist and I was in Taiwan at the time and he reached out to me and said you you know come and see something and and I went to n National Taiwan University and he opened his his closet and there was his giant array of gForce cards sitting on all these shelves with these house fans rotating and he said I built my own personal supercomputer and and he said to me that because of our work because of your work he's able to do his work in his lifetime and I simultaneously Andrew Ang was working on deep learning at the time so around 2008 2009 my students and I started to work on and push the idea that gpus could be used for deep learning for neuron networks hi my name is Andrew I'm managing General partner of AI fund Avengers studio and I also lead deep learning.ai and Landing AI you know new networks have been around for a long time for many decades and still have gpus but I I think the conversions of these two ideas um came for a couple reasons one is we finally had enough data that we needed that compute to feed into new networks and then there was one other breakthrough technology I remember at Sanford when my students were telling me hey Andrew does this thing called K there not that easy to program but there letting people use gpus for something different could we build a server to use gpus and see if they could scale up deep learning and one of my students at the time Ian Goodfellow who was my undergrad helped me build a GPU server in his La room um and that server wound up being what we used for our first deep learning experiments to train neuron networks we started to see 10x or even 100x speedups training new networks on gpus because we could do a thousand or 10,000 Things in parallel rather than one step after another that's a total Game Changer of what you can do with new networks meanwhile in Toronto Canada hinton's lab was doing the same thing Yan LA's lab in New York University was doing the same thing they all kind of simultaneously reached out to us and we realized that maybe there's a new type of computing model that we could create this was just before Alex net the first breakthrough in computer image recognition in 2012 and years before Alo AI was still a niche Pursuit the biggest risk of trying to pursue the AI Market was very similar to the risks the company had encountered back at its founding the market for AI chips in 2012 20145 it was a zero billion dollar market and Jensen always likes to say that you know we're investing in Z billion dollar markets this would be spending R&D dollars on a market that may never materialize there was no guarantee that AI would ever really emerge because keep in mind AI I had had many stops and starts over the last 40 years I mean AI has been around as a computer science concept for decades but it had never really taken off as a huge Market opportunity this is the type of risk that unless uh you've survived building a startup you're probably allergic to doing and the reason for that is at this time we're public we're multibillion dollar company we're actually successful now and you know we've dodged several life-threatening ch es nobody wants to derail the company they want to defend the company and protect the Company Success can make you risk averse for two decades Nvidia had been synonymous with chips for gaming on PCS should the company stay in its lane or stake their future on a market that was unproven but which leadership and researchers around the world felt had enormous potential at some point somebody said you know this actually is a way to expand the market there's a lot of opportunity for computation that wasn't strictly put a color up on the screen so in order to capture that and maybe take advantage of this growing undercurrent of desire to get access to this you know Jensen and the team were willing to go for Z billion dollar business to on the hopes because you you got to believe what you got to believe then you put your money with your mouth this so if we thought this was likely to be an important segment of the market that we could tap into that we could grow our Tam to then then you do but you know I I credit a lot of people not me with with the courage to just go do it and uh and and let's see where it takes us Nvidia made a crucible decision that would change not only its own trajectory but that of the entire technology industry they would commit to AI Computing this was a giant pivot for our company we're adding cost we're adding people we have to learn new skills it took our attention away from our nor normal day-to-day competition in computer graphics and gaming the company's Focus was steered away from its Core Business and it wasn't just in one place is all over the company it was a wholesale pivot in this new direction to Jensen's credit I saw him leap early and place a very significant bet he started to allocate more resources to it pretty quickly I was impressed that the CEO of a large company that he saw it clearly enough to commit his compet to this direction early as a CEO or anybody who's trying to steer the the ship in a New Direction you have to have some intermittent some some near-term positive reinforcements and so you have to keep promoting the idea whenever something good happens uh that reinforces the direction you're going you have to you know put into perspective what is this why is this important how does this help us get to the next level when we pivoted to ship in that direction uh we sought out every single AI researcher on the planet and our platform being useful to them was the positive feedback that we were getting at the time which is the reason why I'm friends with you know all of the world's great um AI researchers they were all helpful in providing the early indications of future success along the way for me and you got to make a big deal out of those small wins I think we realized that Nvidia was the spearhead of the AI Revolution really within the last two to 3 years we saw our gpus being adopted by large scale data centers and cloud service providers we began to see the applications again in transportation health care that was really when we discovered hey this is going to be a very diverse and a multi-billion dollar opportunity that had you know 10 years or 15 years in front of of it for the last 30 years or so the computer industry has been advancing at about 10 times every 5 years Mo law mu's law is the famous prediction that CPU performance will double roughly every 2 years or 10 times every 5 years now with AI uh we're advancing at the chip level at the system level at the algorithm level and also at the AI level and so because you have so many different layers moving at the same time for the very first time we're seeing compounded exponentials and if you go back and just look at what how far we've gone since imag net Alex net we've Advanced Computing by about a million times not a thousand times a million times not a 100 times a million times and we're here now compounding at a million times every 10 years this new Pace at which Computing is advancing a million times every 10 years has been affectionately dubbed hang's law and so the question is what can you solve in the past that you were waiting for a million times to solve a problem that you thought you know I could solve this probably in about 30 years well if you can solve it in about 30 years you're probably going to solve it in five that's the big realization that's groundbreaking that's really the reason why I think it's an inflection point things that look far on the horizon you really really got to think about it not in decade time frame but in years time frame nvidia's acceleration of computing now includes a platform for transforming data centers and cloud computing and extends Beyond AI to anything that can be simulated as Jensen looks to the Future Nvidia is already building hardware and software for everything from digital twins to climate modeling to drug Discovery everybody suddenly wants to know where we came from I find it humorous that where the hell these guys come from you know we thought they were just gaming and and suddenly the the cudas stuff it allowed us to make a difference in markets that weren't gaming which I think then helped people value the fact that gaming was such a strong market and such an economically large Market we did what was necessary to continue to move the needle stay in business long enough to let the ideas come together I met somebody the other day and she said how do you feel about your success and I said well feels like this overnight success was 30 years in the making this a concept we talk about at squa called the time span of discretion what is the time scale across which you operate how do you stretch your imagination to make an enduring impact no founder has embodied this notion like Jensen it's been 30 years since Nvidia launched not many of us think in 30-year time frames and paradoxically by seeing its decades long Vision through the fruition today in VI technology is enabling us to accomplish far more in far less time every CEO's job is supposed to look around corners by definition we should be able to connect more dots the CEO also has to be the most bold about what opportunities what problems we can go solve that nobody imagines us solving you want to be the person who believes the company can achieve more than the company believes it can when you're a startup CEO you're zero and you're trying to become something more than that the idea that you would be a global anything is insanely ambitious by almost all measures we shouldn't be here there are only so many diving catches you can make in life and it's not just diving cat doesn't mean luck uh it does require a lot of effort you have to realize it's existential you have to be surrounded by amazing people and the people that that um uh did those diving catches many of them most of them are still here so it's pretty amazing this has been Crucible moments a podcast from sequa Capital we'll be back with season 2 next year if you have an idea for a company we should feature questions about company building or any feedback

I look at Crucible moments as opportunities to Pivot and explore A New Path like it it forces you to look at the world in a different way and I think when something like your sales go flat or you have a regulatory intervention or a competition comes in some way you have an opportunity to innovate that's the exciting moments when it's just up and to the right anyone can sail that kind of ship but it's a crucible moment when it's hard and you do need to Galvanize people to get that right kind of creativity they're just scary for people because when you walk in and you're like hey guess what we're going to do it in a different way it makes people uncomfortable but that's part of leadership how you have to lead and make people realize that the evolution is going to be better than where they are today

Title: 23andMe ft. Anne Wojcicki - How a DNA startup took on the FDA and redefined health tech
Published: 2023-11-16 10:00:08 UTC
Description:
Millions of customers have explored their genome with 23andMe. But when the company started in 2006, the idea of consumer DNA testing was heresy to the medical establishment. The FDA even ordered 23andMe to stop selling its health testing product. The company persevered to make allies out of adversaries, and became the only FDA-approved product on the market. Learn how 23andMe defined the DNA testing category, how it found product-market fit, and used its growing scale to enter the massive new field of drug discovery.

[Music] lizo dressed up like 23 me for Halloween and we had Eddie Murphy come to Saturday live and like talk about 23 me like we're in crossword puzzles and jokes everyone suddenly was exploding with stories about 23 me and then in 2019 kit sales started to Flatline it was really a question of like what happened welcome to Crucible moments a podcast about the critical Crossroad roads and inflection points that shaped some of the world's most remarkable companies I'm your host rof W when anisi launched 23 andme in 2006 the company revolutionized the healthcare industry by becoming the first to offer individuals direct affordable access to the information contained in their genome information to help people understand their ancestry but also their genetic predisposition to different Health outcomes but as with any company that sh takes up an industry especially the medical establishment there comes enormous risk and no guarantee of survival in today's episode we'll hear how 23 and me confronted a regulator with the power to shut down the company took a leap into the high-risk High reward territory of drug development and transformed its consumer business after booming sales suddenly flatlined my name is an wusi and I am the co-founder and CEO of 23 andme so many things played into me wanting to start 23 and me first and foremost I had spent about 10 years investing in healthcare companies and over time I started to realize that Healthcare was this massive system that was really wildly optimized to monetize you and I also realized how much much the patient doesn't have a voice in their own Healthcare and so 23 me really kind of came from this idea is like how do I bring people together where the whole purpose of that Community is about what we the community actually all see as our interest not necessarily what is that interest of the bottom line of you know a drug Discovery company or a healthc care company or an insurance company but like what's reflective truly of people's needs and interests and frankly that is about how do you stay healthy um as long as possible or then crowdsource Solutions if you actually have an illness and you want to have a better outcome just a few years before an found a 23 and me the field of genetics experienced a paradigm shift scientists successfully sequenced 92% of the human genome which amongst other insights gave Society a greater understanding of genetic contributions to numerous diseases I feel really lucky that was kind of in the right place right time of knowing the healthcare sector knowing the tech world and then also seeing the human genome and the cost decline that you were actually going to be able to get access to your own genetic data at a relatively affordable price so the mission of 23 me is to help people access understand and benefit from the human genome 23 and me was groundbreaking in a number of ways right when we launched first off like people had never had access to their genomes before you had one-off stories of people spending you know a million dollars prohibitive sums to get access and what 23 me is we really democratize that access so I think the second thing is that we were you know absolutely interested in providing lots of information back to individuals about you know things that the medical community would otherwise not return like Alzheimer's risk because there's not necessarily a treatment for that and a lot of that was actually driven by my ex-husband Sergey who at the time there was a a discovery about Parkinson's and he wanted to know whether or not he had that risk factor and nobody would test him and I think it's one thing that the medical world sometimes overlooks you know people do want to plan their lives and they can make other decisions outside necessarily just a clinical medical one that there's lifestyle choices and so that was one of the tests that 23 me put on on our chip you know testing actually for that Parkinson's mutation and we were able to show obviously that that Sergey did in fact um have that variant was a carrier for it and then I think the third thing that we did that was like really controversial and groundbreaking was the idea that we were actually creating this incredible database of consented individuals who were helping us make the product better meaning that as more and more people signed up we were able to create relative finder meaning that you were able to consent to say yes I want to see if I'm related to anybody or you wanted to look at your ancestry composition and you wanted to see what parts of the world your DNA came from so we were able to actually Pioneer a lot of really Innovative tools to help you not just you know get access to your DNA but then to also explore it and get meaning from it any company that Pioneers a truly Innovative product faces a harrowing question early on will there even be a market for it finding that product Market fit was 23 and me's first test we had an incredible launch we were the New York Times cover story we were the cover of wired we had this crazy launch party during Fashion Week we had all these slubs and it was again kind of unintentional but like it ended up getting so much press and again because it was sort of controversial like it was like the world of sci-fi was coming real like suddenly you could look at this code inside of you I was one of the earliest adopters and took my 23 in me test in 2007 I've always wondered what's wrong with me cuz I'd often sneeze once as soon as soon as I stepped outside the building into bright sunlight and I never understood why that was the case until I did 23 me and got the results back and it turns out there's a genetic trait called photic sneeze response where certain people have this genetic trait that they step into the sunlight and have one sneeze the novelty of this kind of Discovery along with more profound Health and Family insights helped drive an early surge in sales the first price point was $1,000 and we sold like a thousand kits our first day and then the volume trickled down to like 15 to 20 kits a day and for those of you who are math Majors that's not a lot of money and it became kind of that questions like what are we like how are we going to get people to think that they need their genome ultimately we decided one day that we were just going to cut the price to $99 and see what happens my engineering team called me at 7: in the morning and they're like and we've sold over a thousand kits like what should we do and I was like I don't know like Let It Rip I think that was my exact words like let it rip and you know to make a long story short we sold 17 18,000 kits by the end of the day and that was actually frankly all of our inventory I realized like there's demand suddenly being able to get almost 20,000 people in a day to to spit was like amazing because you know previous there hadn't really been like big studies over 10,000 people hadn't happened we raised our series C kind of off that data and it gave us that hope and that inspiration that we knew there is really this potential for it the company had finally found the kind of product Market fit where customers were lining up to spit in tubes but with 23 and me exploding in popularity it wasn't long before the medical establishment started to turn on the company you often see this in science that new ideas are often discounted initially you know people forget that Galileo was ridiculed for his notion that the Universe didn't revolve around the earth and that was certainly the case in the early days of 23 and me where many of the established medical profession heavily discounted the company's importance it was really discredited in the early days for years there were medical meetings that did not want us to attend um really solely based on the fact that we were a direct to Consumer company I had one dinner I was describing what we were going to do and this individual actually stood up and he left and he said you know 23 me is going to cause so much destruction in people's lives because women are going to be abandoned everywhere because of the non-paternity rates the thing that I realized is that there was a lot of General fear about genetics and information and a lot of fear about what consumers or patients in this point will do without Physicians supervision but that was unsubstantiated with data the fact that we were circumventing the medical world really just hit a nerve and when you circumvent the medical world Regulators start noticing 23 me had a history with regulatory agencies in our earliest days our first warning letter came from the Department of Health of California and that actually forced us to move from working with alumina for processing Labs over to lab core and we were able to resolve that one pretty quickly despite the medical community's concerns and the occasional regulatory warning Letter 23 and me forged ahead sending out testing kits but then in November 2013 it received something more ominous than a warning the FDA ordered 23 and me to shut down all of its Health testing services so when I got that letter in November it was a real shock and then I think the bigger shock was that it became public a matter of days later when I got the FDA warning letter I was actually at a offsite with the leadership team of 23 me and I got a text message from my assistant at the time who said you got a A package that was couriered to you from the FDA and they want me to sign it and I actually said to her don't sign it and then she said I already did it was brought over to me and I opened it and I read it to everybody and my take was like you know we've had a long history of issues like we can solve this too you know I did not read it as being that bad and on Monday the letter became public and that's actually when David Kessler called me the former FDA commissioner and said an I know you and I know that you don't think that letter is so serious and I'm telling you now it is and you have to stop and so suddenly I had the world to Grapple with all companies face obstacles but when a government regulatory agency like the FDA orders you to stop selling your product that's a true Crucible moment as a condition for selling their health product the FDA demanded that 23 and me go through the process of getting FDA approved an ordeal that could take years how should the company proceed all of the options looked daunting no one had ever done anything like 23 and me was trying to do there really was no genetic consumer product at the time so when they received the warning letter frankly I was a I was a little worried I was not sure how 23 and me was actually going to deal with this or frankly whether they could deal with it my name is Richard sheller and I was head of Therapeutics at 23 andme from 2015 to 2019 23 and me had no experience with interacting with a regulatory agency all of the Hoops that they would have to jump through in order to get a report approved and I wasn't sure that 23 in May was going to come come out of that and actually be a successful company okay so option one was a full after we got the letter there was no shortage of people who came to me and said you know an like most companies fold at this stage and in my mind I kind of made note of those people and I was like okay never work with these people again I was like of course we're not going to fold option two in my mind was like well we can fight this like we should fight there was no shortage of our customer who wrote in to say this is outrage how dare they try to impede my access to my own data and that kind of rallied me up and then the third option was just to totally comply and there was one very influential regulatory leader who I met with and she said to me an what do you want to do do you want to sell this company in the next couple years because if you want to sell this company you can just like package this up ship it out and be done but if you really want to do the things that you're setting out to do the way you're going to get there is you put your head down and you do the work and she's like it's going to be slow and painful and it's going to take you years and are you really up for it and honestly I think back now and I'm like I knew she said the word years but I didn't know exactly how many years so I chose option three I chose the last option because I said like 23 me is a Missi driven company that is set out to really have an impact on Healthcare making the choice to comply with fda's demands was one thing now 23 and me had to figure out how to actually follow through something and admits her staff simply was not yet equipped to do to be honest we did not have the right kind of team like I had a team that was very Mission driven and very capable but lacked regulatory experience about exactly how we should be pursuing a regulatory strategy and our warning letter did come out of surprise my main priority was finding somebody who was going to lead us through an FDA regulatory process so hiring Cathy Hibbs was a huge accomplishment for us in April 2014 Kathy Hibbs brought her more than two decades of legal expertise in clinical and medical settings to 23 and me joining as the company's Chief legal and regulat officer it really was a major transition to go from being an unregulated company to a regulated company and the engineering the software like everything about it was just an incredible amount of work we were in such a hole and in some ways the regulatory team that we brought in after the warning letter almost felt like you know we are being set up to fail oh it's a huge process dealing with a regulatory agency they asked 23 in me to show that the reports that they provide back to Consumers are accurate and I won't go into the details but suffice it to say that this was quite a technical Challenge and hurdle and then in addition to that the FDA wanted to be sure that a consumer could understand the report so the FDA asked 23 and me to provide the report to a group of people and then for the folks to take a test and to show that they could answer the questions in a way that demonstrated that they understand the report so that was a very big lift it took two years of meticulous testing proving methodologies and providing data but 23 and me relaunched an FDA approved version of their health testing kits to the market in 2015 the day we got our FDA authorization our head of legal and Regulatory she laughed she's like it's the only time I think anyone in the regulatory team has gotten a standing ovation like it was really it was really exciting the company was sort of under the hammer and an completely turned that into an enormous competitive Advantage for the company where they can now truly be the only company to offer these tests the work they put in incrementally earning the FDA stamp of approval over time didn't just change the way Regulatory Agencies saw their product it changed Minds with a medical establishment and Beyond I think that the biggest lesson from The Crucible moment was you know like the world does change and the way it changes is not like The Regulators see an aha moment and they change it's like small steps over time I remind people at 23 and me that when we started the company gay marriage was illegal the world does change and it changes because of the effort of people who are persistent and continue to Chip Away sort of the arguments with data and with activism with the company's Health product blessed by the FDA 23 and me was no longer the Pariah of the medical world but something else happened in 2014 and 2015 while they were buttoning things up on the regulatory Side sales of the ancestry product were accelerating opening the door to a bold New Direction for the company so the business really actually did quite well during that time frame like we we hit a level of scale and we had so much genetic data that we could actually start doing really interesting research but we started getting that scale of like well over a 100,000 people close to a million and we were you know sort of the largest consented gentic database in the world the database was finally big enough enough for an to follow through on one of her original Ambitions for the company I was always really excited about this potential of using human genetic data for drug Discovery drugs that had a genomic Foundation were two to three times more likely to be successful than ones that did not have a genetic Foundation from my days as a Wall Street analyst I realized in the biotech space you often have just animal data you don't have large data sets it's hard to recruit people um you do all this expensive work to set up a study and then take it down and realized that her library of data could be of extraordinary value to companies developing Therapeutics so we we started doing Partnerships with Pharma and frankly we kind of realized that there just wasn't a lot of expertise in house and a of Pharma companies about genomics about how to translate from drugs to therapies and it was an expertise that more and more 23 me was building in house so we realized that if we really wanted to harness the power of what 23 me had to offer we should do it ourselves and lead by example 23 and me had arrived at its next Crucible moment instead of partnering with outside firms should the company build out its own Therapeutics division from scratch starting a Therapeutics division is a big bold risky Endeavor making medicines is a very long and difficult process and in fact most attempts to make medicines fail it was not necessarily the case that this was a slam dunk it was many years ago that I met an we heard about 23 and me at gen Tech very early on right when the company was founded while a genetic Richard oversaw that company's investment in 23 and me's initial seed funding because I was an executive committee member of jentech when I retired it was required that the companies put out a press release when I saw that he retired I called him I think it might have even been a couple hours after the press release came out and phoned me and I didn't think that it was just a coincidence if you will that she was phoning to say hello and I said why don't you come over I went to go see him and we chatted briefly and Richard sheller is known to be very lovingly skeptical of of everything Richard was very forthright about the risk and you know the cash burn so one of the first things that I did was to put together a strategic plan which included a number of people that we might hire how much it would cost to build out a laboratory how long it would take to potentially come up with a medicine that would move into clinical testing how long the clinical testing would take how much that would cost and really educating not only an but the rest of the leadership team at 23 and me on what drug Discovery actually is how long it takes how expensive it is but what might come out at the end as a medicine that could really help people and I said to him I said yes I spent a decade investing in biotech I'm well aware of the failures but it's a irresistible opportunity to to be able to leverage novel human genetic data that's never otherwise been seen before in this kind of scale to say that potentially we could really transform drug Discovery the thing that impressed me about an most was her her vision and her enthusiasm and her just unrelenting belief that genomics will help with human health even though there was a glint in an's eye of building a Therapeutics business many years prior it really took somebody of Richard's experience in skill set to help Galvanize and get that off the ground it's my first day at 23 and me was quite amusing I came in and somebody said well you can use this desk and I looked and it was a desk and a sea of people and at J inch I had an office that was mine I had a conference room that was mine I had a library that was mine the closest they had to a laboratory was the kitchen where lunch was served so you know we needed to build a biochemical molecular biology drug Discovery lab from scratch we had nothing so we proceeded to hire a few more very talented people and then eventually moved into Laboratory space we bought a lot of used equipment actually we would participate in auctions where a company had perhaps shut down and they were selling all of their equipment so we would bid online to buy cuses and you know all the kinds of millions of dollars of laboratory equipment that you need in order to do experiments it was extremely daunting but I had in the back of my mind that look biotech companies were founded and they did start and they did succeed so that it wasn't impossible one just had to you know do it I think some of the biggest challenges we've had with Therapeutics this frankly is almost the perception of the company as a direct to Consumer ancestry company Pharma biotech cosos will sometimes ask me like you do drug Discovery I'm like yes we do drug Discovery and like with Labs I'm like with real lab labs and like real Labs like a pipet and I'm like with pipe pets like real like we have like real like we know how to make antibodies we know how to run you know assets like we have like a real working biotech and they're surprised because we're known for direct to Consumer genetic testing so we decided to work on a very specific therapeutic modality and that is to make antibody therapeutic which was somewhat more straightforward to build from scratch so it allowed us to more quickly move forward in making Therapeutics and there were a number of breakthroughs as we began to look at the data we saw that there were associations of particular genes with disease that suggested that those genes encoded molecules that could be important drug targets and that was the question that we had when we started would that be the case and we found a number of drug targets that we thought were worth pursuing it's kind of remarkable today because now I have a Therapeutics team that is incredibly dedicated and it's really hard painstaking work to develop a drug and they're sticking to it I have an extens of collaboration with GSK we have over 50 programs that have been identified and I think now we actually have this really amazing opportunity of working more and more with farm and biotech Partners as we have proven out just how productive this data base can be soon after I arrived the folks in the consumer group asked me how big does the database need to be for Therapeutics and the answer is well you know the bigger the better so you know I just said 10 million we're somewhere around 12 to 14 million people in the database now which makes the 23 and me genetic database by far the largest in the world also the growth of the database was more than I ever dreamed that we'd be able to accomplish to build a Therapeutics division from scratch takes fortitude but the main thing that it takes is an idea and a belief that you're going to do something different that's going to make a difference in patients lives and if you get out of bed thinking that every day anything is possible in 2018 we saw an incredible inflection point where kit sales really took off and our brand awareness hit an all-time high whether it was like lizo dressed up like 23 me at Halloween we had Eddie Murphy come to Saturday Night Live and like talk about 23 me like we're in crossword puzzles and jokes suddenly everyone was exploding with stories about 23 me and then in 2019 it started to Flatline it was really a question of like what happened and we did see that there was definitely more of a concern around privacy so Cambridge analytica was a big one um Golden State killer was a big one where suddenly we needed to address the fact that people were just want to know what was going to happen with their data amid changing tides of consumer sentiment 23 and me was also facing increasing competition so after the FDA warning letter we made the decision to continue selling the ancestry product but not selling the health product you know what was actually interesting for us is we sold pretty well so it was definitely an interesting time because we put most of our effort into Health but suddenly ancestry was taking off and I would actually argue one of the mistakes we made at the company is like we were not marketing heavily in that time frame and that's when our competitor ancestry.com really did take off as sales tapered off in 2019 23 and me faced another Crucible moment had they saturated their Market how could they reignite growth it became the question of like readjusting our spend readjusting our marketing budgets how are we going to keep growing but in in a way that's going to make sense from our product perspective it became really then about making sure that people understood well how is 23 me using the data talking very clearly and frequently about the principles that we operate on which is really choice and transparency part of readjusting meant laying off 100 people or roughly 14% of their Workforce it also meant completely reenvisioning what a director consumer Healthcare Company could offer users in the earliest days of 23 me we were so consumed with just like fighting basic survival of is it safe for you to get your genetic information are you going to be able to understand it and more and more we started to realize that we have that luxury of like 10 plus years of data and I realized like we have this opportunity to actually do an even better job of keeping people ongoing up toate with their genetic information that was a moment when we said like we need to Pivot and that became kind of that next phase for the company is really making sure that we are not just providing information but we're going to actually become part of the full stack of helping make sure that people now also know what to do with it by having a subscription product offering ongoing tele Health Services through a digital subscription would require medical professionals who could work Direct irly with 23 and me customers but at the time Consulting with medical professionals anywhere but in person in their offices was uncommon we had actually this offsite in 2019 where I thought about tele medicine and I was like I just I don't think we can do it but then like so many other aspects of Our Lives everything changed in March of 2020 suddenly with the pandemic tele medicine became like accepted in a matter of weeks so that opened up doors for us to say we actually have this opportunity to offer tele medicine to our customers to offer online pharmacy but building out a T Health platform and an online pharmacy from the ground up would require an enormous amount of time and resources so the company decided it might make more sense to take a different approach we had this opportunity to acquire lemonade and that gave us the ability to have clinicians who can work with patients in all 50 States as well as a pharmacy and having a pharmacy was really key for me because I look at the opportunities with pharmacogenomics meaning like how is that I can look at all of your medications and know which medication has a genetic component and can I get you the right medication based on your genome and suddenly we had that opportunity 23 in me's acquisition of lemonade Health closed in November 2021 I'd say today we're still kind of in that process of harmonizing everything and bringing everything together we have put more and more the right people in place to really lead the evolution of the company I look at Crucible moments as opportunities to Pivot and explore A New Path like it it forces you to look at the world in a different way and I think when something like your sales go flat or you have a regulatory intervention or competition comes in some way you have an opportunity to innovate that's the exciting moments when it's just up and to the right anyone can sail that kind of ship but it's a crucible moment when it's hard and you do need to Galvanize people to get that right kind of creativity they're just scary for people because when you walk in and you're like hey guess what we're going to do it in a different way it makes people uncomfortable but that's part of leadership how you have to lead and make people realize that the evolution is going to be better than where they are today looking at the path forward of 23 and me I feel like we have this opportunity now to be really sort of the world's only leader of genomic based medicine and how is it that people can get affordable access to advisers on the latest in genomic medicine and how to execute on it and what to do how do you have not just just like very generic hey like eat this exercise sleep but you know being able to help people understand well when should you get a colonoscopy when should you get a mamogram you know some people really it's toxic for them to eat fava beans so I feel like we have this opportunity to really give personalized prevention the biggest Gap in my mind in healthc care is this idea of like how do I keep you well and your doctor today is not terribly interested in that engagement of keeping you well and so we believe that there's this incredible opportunity based on your Genome of helping you you know stay healthy as long as possible or if you have conditions how do you better manage that in one of the strongest affirmations of Anne's vision for her company on June 1st 2023 23 and me sent out an email blast with news of 23 m610 a new firstof its kind investigational cancer drug an antibody that they believe has the potential to treat patients with Advanced cancers this is our first molecule to move into phase two of testing in phase one we demonstrate that the molecule is safe and tolerable and in phase two we test whether the molecule actually works and helps patients and we're just in the process of that now if it's shown to help people with cancer it will be a tremendous breakthrough but we still have a very long way to go in order to prove that but 23 in me is used to Long roads one of the benefits of spending so much time on a problem is that you're able to look back and recognize progress we do these surveys of clinicians like Physicians over 90% of Physicians say that they understand how genetics will make their clinical outcomes better and I do always still think back on like those earliest days in the company when I would go on stage and I would say a consumer should have the right to access their own genome and there was overwhelming like demand in the medical world was like oh my god well I don't know and I do think about the team at 23 and me that did just endure like in continuously proving out that this information is accurate it's safe and it's meaning and we slowly like won over the world so it's been like such a massive transformation of acceptance I don't know it's just like it's amazing to me Anne who's always seen her company as pushing boundaries continues to see that as a crucial part of 23 and me's DNA I don't worry too much about 23 me becoming too traditional because we're so far from it I remember at one point some big company leaders telling me like a lot of leaders who have a brand don't want to take a risk but why else have a brand if you don't want to take a risk and move the world forward and I feel lucky like I have millions of customers and I have a brand as you get bigger it gets harder to do things I think it's important to make sure that you're always pushing and frankly like that's my job to constantly Inspire and to make sure that I have other leaders who have that vision and that they are inspiring and one more medical term for good measure and I do think it becomes contagious this has been Crucible moments a podcast from SE Capital join us next time as Jensen hang shares how

Title: Jawbone: The Rise and Fall of the First Wearable Technology Company
Published: 2023-11-02 17:36:02 UTC
Description:
One of the most innovative companies of the mid-2000s, Jawbone pioneered wearable technology with UP, the first wrist-worn fitness tracker. And it revolutionized sound with the first smart bluetooth headset and then with Jambox, the first smart wireless speaker. But product malfunctions, weak gross margins, inflated valuations and financing troubles would reverse Jawbone’s meteoric rise. In one of the most dramatic turns in Silicon Valley history, the company went from a nearly $4 billion valuation to liquidation. This rich cautionary tale holds valuable lessons for founders today. In a new era of capital constraints, Jawbone’s story is more relevant now than ever. Co-founders Hosain Rahman and Alex Asseily, and Chief Creative Officer Yves Behar, share what they learned along the way.

Title: HubSpot ft. Brian Halligan & Dharmesh Shah - How an underdog helped invent modern marketing
Published: 2023-10-19 09:00:27 UTC
Description:
Founders Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah reveal how they took a blog and turned the ideas behind their hobby into a $20+ billion business. 

In 2006, HubSpot upended traditional approaches to marketing by taking advantage of the nascent internet in a new way: By capitalizing on search engines and social media, they offered a way to pull customers in rather than pushing ads and mailers out. They coined the new category “inbound marketing.” They continued to defy conventional wisdom, deciding to serve small businesses over big enterprises, and taking on a Goliath in a new category. As the founders explain, zigging where others zag is the key to their success.  
  
Brian Halligan 
Brian Halligan is the co-founder and executive chairperson of HubSpot. In 2022 he founded Propeller Ventures, a climate tech venture fund, and serves on the boards of Navier and Aquatic Labs.

Dharmesh Shah
Dharmesh Shah is co-founder and CTO of HubSpot. Prior to founding HubSpot he founded Pyramid Digital Solutions, which was acquired by SunGard Data Systems in 2005. 

Dannie Herzberg
Dannie Herzberg is a partner on the growth team at Sequoia. Prior to joining Sequoia she helped build and scale HubSpot and Slack. 

Pat Grady

everyone's reaction ATB was consistent don't do it no one liked the idea of doing a small business play recognize that this will likely be one of the hardest decisions you make and the fact that it feels difficult it's because it's difficult because it is so impactful welcome to Crucible moments a podcast about the crossroads and critical inflection points that shape some of the world's most remarkable companies I'm your host rof buam imagine sitting down to dinner after a long day of work it's the moment you can finally relax and then your phone rings you don't recognize the number but you pick up and of course it's a telemarketer you probably hang up before they can even finish their first sentence 20 years ago this was marketing interruptions to your day in the form of cold calls ads spam emails one annoyance after another and no luck for the person selling the product in 2006 two ambitious MIT graduate students Brian heligan and ares Shaw could see the traditional marketing tools were broken and that the internet was creating a new way of reaching customers they coined the term inbound marketing an Innovative way of thinking about marketing that would transform businesses around the world their company HubSpot is now not only synonymous with this idea but is the go to software for marketing and customer relations for HubSpot disrupting the world of marketing meant bucking traditional wisdom in the face of Crucible moments today we'll hear how against the advice of almost everyone they committed to serving a loyal following of small businesses instead of big Enterprises how they reimagined their pricing model to avoid death by churn and how they went up against a Goliath to break into a new product category HubSpot story is one of sticking to your convictions even through Crucible moments that challenge your instincts and test your resolve my name is Brian hallan I'm the co-founder and chairperson of HubSpot my name is dares sha I'm co-founder and CTO of HubSpot I was in business school it was the night before classes started and I was on my second Sam Adams the Marriott in Kendall Square and a woman walked up to me uh very nice woman and she started peppering me with questions all about me and my background and my interests in like an interview style and at the end of that she just quickly disappeared on me and what it turns out was going on there was when daresh goes to a cocktail party he finds the largest plant or bush he can find tucks in behind it then he sends his wife out to interview everyone and see if he can find some friends for him and then brings him over in the SC report on me wasn't good do you want to repeat The Scouting Report yeah it's like you know Brian likes baseball in the Red Sox he loves a Grateful Dead you've never been to a baseball game I don't think you know who the Grateful Dead are I don't think the two of you are going to hit it off so she's like move on like let's we'll find someone else uh for you to talk to and by the way my wife has been doing that she and I have been together for 30 years now forever that's the only time she's actually been wrong at a Scouting Report um only time I bring it up to her every time it's here in 2006 Brian was working at a venture capital firm as an entrepreneur in Residence meeting with Founders and learning about what drove a successful business and I asked them you know what's your go to market plan they all did the same thing they all bought a list and they sent emails they bought a list and they cold called they did a lot of advertising they heard the big expensive PR firm did the big conference and they all had the same results terrible it just didn't work and my thesis was that marketing was broken that people were sick and tired of being marketed too and getting awfully clever at blocking out with Spam protection ad blocker you name it really hard to interrupt humans that was my aha at the same time this is going on dares is in school and he had a very early blog called onst startups.com and he didn't have any stat for money associated with it and he would just write a couple blog articles a week based on interesting lectures and sure enough he had you know a thousand times more interest in his little tiny blog than any of my Venture back startups and so we just started describing the world back then as inbound marketing what dares was doing Brian coined the term inbound marketing we didn't deliberately say oh we're going to go out and create this category we said we need something to describe this kind of product that we have pulling people in through Google through search through social through blogging versus outbound marketing which was what my companies were doing interrupting people in their daily lives and that the world would be a better place if inbound was more prevalent than outbound we did not trademark it or copyright it or say oh that's our term no one else can use it we wanted everyone else to use inbound marketing as a term we wanted it to be a thing because we are going to be the company that's most known for that thing and what works when you're creating a category is when you have an enemy and it was inbound versus outbound and then people said oh I want to do this thing they call inbound marketing how do I do it Brian and dares officially founded HubSpot in June of 2006 in Cambridge Massachusetts as they were working to bring awareness to the new category of marketing they were also making a decision that would come to Define hubspot's identity should they focus on small and medium-sized businesses known as smbs or large Enterprise companies one of the things that brought Brian ey together was our shared kind of passion for going after smbs we actually chose that market before we even chose what we were going to do for that market we kind of recognized that the internet disproportionately helped small and medium-sized businesses more than larger ones because it kind of leveled the playing field you used to needed a ton of money to get found online but all of a sudden there was Google and social and if you create a great piece of content it would spread and pull people in like a magnet now all of a sudden any small business could create content and your success in marketing did and your success became much more about the width of your brain than the width of your wallet but trying to put all the pieces together to kind of Leverage the internet in the way that it needed to be leveraged and to do inbound marketing it just was a science project for a lot of these companies I did not have the time or the talent to actually do all those things if HubSpot focused on creating inbound marketing tools for small businesses it would give companies that never previously had marketing resources the ability to gain significant traction online when I joined HubSpot the company was a culture magnet like it was a bunch of cool Geeks Who were all situated in this tiny co-working space near MIT called the Cambridge Innovation Center and it was a really tight-knit group my name is Danny Herzberg I'm a partner at seoa Capital I joined HubSpot as a sales rep became a sales leader and ultimately joined the product team where I launched the company's platform we all drank the Kool-Aid of what HubSpot was pre in so every person there was genuinely passionate about the virtues of inbound marketing and helping small businesses Thrive but there was a problem everyone's reaction ATB was consistent don't do it no one liked the idea of doing a small business play in particular the people who liked it the least and we most adamant we change our mind Venture capitalists we had a heck of a time raising funding all of the competitors did the math and said you put a dollar into the go to market machine and an SMB gives you back $2 you put a dollar into the same go to market machine and a midsize company or an Enterprise gives you back $3 or $4 and so near term the payback is always to go up Market my name is Pat Grady I'm a partner at Sequoia if you just looked at the numbers the numbers will always tell you to go up Market customers are bigger they'll stick around longer up Market always looks like a better place to go and if you look at smbs they're much more prone to churn you can see why it's much more tempting to move up Market quickly I think the VCS didn't like SMB because there just weren't any examples of companies that had succeeded in SMB other than really into it and honestly that was the only one and every VC asks us that question we always said into it and then they would say who else and then we give A Blank Stare the kind of most common argument was it's really expensive to get to smbs you just you can't do that and you can't afford kind of the LTV to um customer acquisition ratio yes that was true uh for years and years that it was too expensive to go after smbs but have you heard this thing called inbound marketing which lets you much more efficiently pull customers in HubSpot had arrived at its first Crucible moment almost all investors are telling you not to pursue SMB do you listen to them or do you hold true to your belief in your product and to your understanding of the Market's needs dares and Brian stuck to their gut we were like trust us it's going to be a huge Market Brian and dares had this very astute Insight which was that everyone is flocking to the Enterprise the competitors at the time eloqua maretto and others that have ceased to exist all of them were moving up Market into this really crowded space with essentially the same solution and it was a total red ocean and SMB was a blue ocean no one was really vying for mind share across smbs the strategy was okay we'll let everybody else go up Market there are millions of smbs out there who could also use this product at some point if we just hunker down and work really hard to solve their problems at some point we'll become the default it's a lot easier to go from S&B to Enterprise like I can't think of any software companies that did really well in the Enterprise and then shrunk it down and really scaled it in S&B but I can think a lot of software companies that started an SMB and moved to the Enterprise and succeeded it's hard to make something complicated easy it's easy to make something easy complicated just overall one of the benefits of building an SMB product is it just kind of builds good product hygiene when you have to build a product for you know thousands tens of thousands hundred of thousands of people you have no choice but to make it simple working with smbs the sale was extremely personal to the extent that we'd actually ask the CEO of the company about their personal and professional goals and we jointly map out a plan to get there we'd figure out how many kids do you have when do you have to send them to college what are your savings what's the recurring Revenue in your business and what's going to get you from point A to point B do you actually have a plan and they're so proud to show you how it's impacted the business it's a very personal conversation it's closer to therapy than it is sales to a CIO there are some Crucible moments where after a path forward is determined the company heads down that road and doesn't look back in hubspot's case even after the company was able to convince investors of their SMB strategy they continued to be those who badgered them to revisit the decision obviously we didn't say something smart enough because we still kept getting the question quarter after quarter for 16 years you had to defend the SMB decision for a very long time there was one venture capitalist who had a board seat and a loud voice at the table who was really just convinced that we were wrong about it and we needed to go to the Enterprise and it was an eventuality and every board meeting would come up and I would just say it was a it was a source of contention in a lot of board meetings and it was almost like I could say a stopwatch from the beginning of the board meeting until this particular board member would bring up Enterprise and so just had to stick with it pretty much every quarter every board meeting every investor meeting the IPO Road show everyone and sometimes they would humor Us it's like oh it's great that you're successful then you figured out SMB but tell us the plan for the Enterprise and our response was always the same we don't have a plan to go to the Enterprise we've done the hard work of making this model work every time after a board meeting when Brian and dares got pressure from anyone around the table to move up Market they'd come back and say we get it we can close bigger deals up Market but we're not going to do that they kind of had the courage of their convictions to say I think if we just hunker down and stay here it's going to be more defensible because nobody else is going to be able to serve these customers the way that we will and nobody else wants to serve these customers the way that we do to me strategy is about what you say no to even more so than it is what you say yes to so the more cowardly or differential move would have been to say sure okay we'll keep our SMB division but we'll build an Enterprise division we'll build some features that are great for Enterprises but suddenly you say yes to everything and you're not really diving deep and becoming an expert in anything honestly I felt like I was doing high impact work work that I borderline would have done for free because of how it felt to to see small business owners emerge from buying the software and following along with the methodology that HubSpot was teaching them and really really changed their businesses their trajectories their lives as a result of it and so it was a counterintuitive controversial decision that required some near-term pain in exchange for long-term reward and they absolutely nailed it their persistence paid off HubSpot Grew From A quar of a million dollars in Revenue in 2007 to 15.6 million in 2010 the seed planted with tesa's blog had grown into a full-blown software and consulting company with its own book inbound marketing get found using Google social media and blogs in 2011 sequ began meeting with the HubSpot team we thought the company had massive potential I get introduced to Jim getts one of the partners at sequa he walked into the conference room at seoa and I remember like it was yesterday he shook my hand and as my hand was being shook he said what's it going to take for Sequoia to own a piece of HubSpot and I thought to myself not much actually we can sign a term sheet right now if you were that interested and we had a good chat and then he handed it to at the time a junior employee Pat Grady and it was a very different reception Pat was tasked with really going through all of our numbers to see if this thing was really scaling so when we make investments we try to make a very small number of very high conviction Investments we do lots of homework deeply understand a market try to deeply understand the team that's building in that market and then get into business with them for the long term and so when we were getting into business with HubSpot we did a fairly exhaustive study of the market we talked to a bunch of customers we really understood the numbers that were being produced by the business and a problem that was evident was churn when Pat started digging into the numbers I got very nervous I was pretty sure Pat was going to say no to the deal and go back to gym and say nice guys but math doesn't work and he would have had every right to do it he did not do that he dug into the numbers and he said this could be right if we fix the pricing model here's a story of how we came up with our initial price for HubSpot and realized that we had both just been to business school the first 10 employees had all been to business school all mbas all from Sloan um and this was the conversation it's like okay well we know we need to get a price on the product because we're both Believers in getting a product out there in charge early charge often awesome so we get into the meeting it's like okay so we need to pick a price yep we need to pick a price what do you think the price should be I don't know what do you think the price should be what do you think about $250 done and that was it that was the rigor and Analysis that we put into the kind of first price point that we picked for HubSpot 250 is exactly the wrong price point I think a $100 a month or less you can get away with selling something totally touchless at least back then or $1,000 or more you can afford to have an inside Salesforce to do it 250 was we were stuck kind of right in the middle those too so we did kind of pull that number out of the Hat I think we pulled the exact wrong number out of the Hat hubspot's one size fo S pricing was blunt and indiscriminate meaning they captured a fraction of the value they were delivering there were users who left HubSpot because they felt $250 a month was too expensive and there were others who felt $250 was a steal and would have paid far more for the product HubSpot faced its second Crucible moment how should the company change its price pricing model to avoid death by churn the pricing model is the most overlooked critical decision that a company makes the question is not what's at stake when you change your pricing model the question is what's at stake when you don't change your pricing model the fact that it was flawed not even just suboptimal like just broken is that I don't think HubSpot would have survived as a company had we not made that particular change the solution that was not so evident was to introduce a second access to the pricing model so that the price that they were getting from customers was better aligned to the value that they were providing those customers inact said I don't care if you use seats or users or visitors or leads but everybody else out there who's created a successful model in Silicon Valley has what he called a two AIS pricing model that's a term I never heard before a two access pricing model is a powerful tool to scale Revenue it allows you to adjust your pricing along two axes instead of one so a customer can pay based on exactly what they need whether that's access to a greater number of features or more licenses to use those features and as a customer needs change so does the amount charged along those two Dimensions look at Salesforce Salesforce has two axes for its pricing one on the dimension of what features you're buying into and the other that allows them to grow with a customer as they successful so in salesforce's case you know if a company is successful using Salesforce is it's CRM it's going to grow sales and then it can charge more per seat hubs SWAT didn't have the equivalent of that for month after month after month the topic was pricing and there were big debates over what that second axis should be should it be visitors could we do users or seats or should it be contacts or New Leads we ended up after many many months of debating at picking contacts a customer who had 10 contacts in the database might be paying the same as a customer who had a thousand contacts in the database well if you have a thousand contacts in the database chances are you're generating a lot more business than somebody who has 10 contacts in the database HubSpot decided to charge customers based on their number of contacts as HubSpot helped a business grow from 10 contacts to a th000 HubSpot would benefit from that growth too by charging the company more for its services essentially HubSpot would grow with a company as its contact database grw so many positive things happened once we kind of figured out the need for second access which is oh now we can kind of grow along two Dimensions as a result of getting that upgrade rate up that actually has theoretically No Limit right and that was life-changing once we kind of unlocked that opportunity to upsells and upgrades then it helped us kind of dig ourselves out of that churn hole I think one one big lesson from the HubSpot pricing model change is if you lead by providing a lot more value than you capture you're kind of creating this Bank of Goodwill that you can tap into later if need be for the sake of building your business I think if HubSpot was not beloved and then they showed up and tried to extract more value from customers it would have been a much tougher convers but I think because they were so beloved when they showed up with the new pricing model they got some breathing room there was a Triumph for the pricing model the day our Revenue retention hit 100% I never thought we would see that day but the day that hit 100% was a joyful day inside of HubSpot looking at it in hindsight that was like a truly like a literally critical decision uh in HubSpot history had we not done that I don't think the the company would have made it or at least not have become the mod of success that it has now while hubs initially focused on helping companies generate leads via inbound marketing around 2013 they became interested in taking the company in a New Direction when companies try to come up with their second product there's a couple of reasons they often do it one is oh we've saturated our current market right now uh we need to find New Horizons and and new new markets to kind of tackle another one is around like a defensive posturing ours was a mix of the two one was a defensive okay we're in the marketing software business the reality is uh the marketing software always works with a CRM and whoever owns the CRM over time is likely going to win CRM stands for customer relationship management so get them there close them keep them happy when people talk about CRM they're talking about three broad categories of software marketing which get gets people to your door sales which helps to turn those people into customers and then support or service which helps to keep those customers happy and so those are kind of the three legs to the stool for CRM the early um survey we had done where 20% were using particular CRM 20% were using some other one of the 60% was like okay well those 60% of companies that are not using a CRM need to be and the question we ask ourselves is look like what's keeping them from using a CRM to things one is it was overwhelming it was just too complicated the existing products that were out there or it was too expensive and they just didn't want to spend the money and we're like okay if we can remove both those barriers to entry we may have something here when we decided to go into CRM similar to our decision to do SMB we got a lot of push back should we move from a marketing app to a CRM platform huge pivot and it was a huge pivot we made 6 months before the IPO so explaining it to public public investors was very difficult and that was definitely a counterintuitive move for us and many of our board members a lot of enture capitalists thought stay out of that space stick to your marketing second products never work there was another reason investors were skeptical the market was dominated by one giant CRM player Salesforce there was a vendor doing quite well in the space in Salesforce uh they had Network effects they were they were cranking it was terrifying a HubSpot is very clearly David and there's very clearly a Goliath that is basically Anonymous with CRM and so who is this little company in Boston that's historically focused on marketing Automation and inbound marketing software who do they think they are to challenge the Goliath and launch a CRM here another Crucible moment should HubSpot stay in the marketing software lane or divert resources to a whole new platform and risk getting crushed by Goliath the whole management team sort of had their heads around how this thing would work and when we finally put it in there was a lot of consensus around it we created a startup inside of HubSpot to create the CRM before HubSpot launched CRM which is a broader piece of technology it offered little tools like track who opens your email and see when someone downloads an RFP that you sent the first thing they built was more a tool for sales reps to be more productive it was called signals and that was a premium little app that sales reps could use one of the reasons certain parts of the team were kind of gravitating towards tools is that tools are bought so you can put a website up there that says oh this thing cost $10 a month or whatever and people will come to the website and buy it platforms are sold right like causing someone to make a platform shift or invest in a platform takes carbon based life forms to convince them why that's important why yours is okay because they're making a career defining long-term decision for their company we're going to make it free so we're going to remove all possible reasons for people to say no to a CRM we generate all these leads for you and then you're using our sales tool to try to work with those leads why don't we just give you a free database so you can stick that stuff in and it turns out that the thing that sits at the heart of a CRM system is that database and so instead of saying aha now we have a CRM they just said well here's a free database you know you guys should use Salesforce if you need a CRM but if you don't need a CRM if you just need a database you can stick all your leads in you know here's our database that's a much more compelling pitch because you're not going after where the money is you're just going after where the need is in the underserved Market so here was another Crucible moment for HubSpot where the company made a really risky move which was to launch its first product CRM for an adjacent function the sales function and to give it away for free forever in order to gain distribution and ubiquity all the atlassian and dropboxes of the world and then we said oh should we build a series of apps for sales reps or should we just do the hard work of building a CRM system down below it and worry about the apps later and we flipped it about a year into it and and decided no we're not a sales tool player we're a CRM platform player so we have an annual conference at HubSpot that's called inbound at the time CRM was announced it was probably 10,000 or so attendees I remember when HubSpot announced CRM to the world and it was kind of terrifying and kind of exhilarating hubspot's stealthy entrance into the CR Market with a fremium database was a prime example of lowlevel disruption David had Reed his slingshot aimed squarely at kif there were six or seven quarters in a row where every single quarter the growth rate accelerated every single quarter the gross margins went up and so there was a six or seven quarter period where all of a sudden the numbers just got better and better and better and there were probably multiple reasons for that but one reason I believe is that they had finally gone from being one of many to just being the default and if you fast forward to today they're really the only viable threat to Salesforce and there's a huge chunk of the market where HubSpot is far more effective than Salesforce the only way to compete in a market as large as CRM with a competitor as tough as Salesforce you can't beat them with goto Market tactics or brud Force you can only beat them if you have a better product and fortunately HubSpot had that and yet again HubSpot got to embrace its Playbook of earning loyalty by offering value before capturing value and over time it built sophistication and Enterprise Readiness into the product such that they can move up market and really challenge the Goliath in a more formidable [Music] way I think the decision to move into CRM is a little bit like a decision on the pricing model had we not done it the existing CRM players would have added marketing and would have made our lives very difficult had we stayed Standalone and I think what would have happened is we probably would have had to sell the company for HubSpot growth meant survival today they're not only surviving but they're one of the most successful SAS companies of the last decade they have an amazing CRM product that they can keep going up Market with and that is a sure path to billions more of Revenue back to The Crucible moments they've had in the past should they delay some of that gratification and go even deeper into the workflows of the S&B customers and worry more about Enterprise further down the road so that's one interesting question for him today you've got one-way doors and two-way doors and two-way doors are decisions you can make and reverse it and that not a lot of damage happens we purposely made the move into CRM a one-way door we're not coming back in business school they say start an innovation group try lots and lots of things and see what sticks we took the exact opposite approach and we said we're going to do this if it kills us as Technologies like AI transform how business operate HubSpot is evolving while staying grounded in its convictions we've gone through some Crucible moments we made pivotal decisions what we want to make sure we instill is number one is always ask ourselves you know how do we solve for the customer stay kind of grounded in that and number two and it's going to sound a little bit cliched because it's a little cliched is to have the the humility and not to be know at all I got this from Brian is to be a learn it all right like we want an organization that's constantly curious It's like oh we haven't figured everything out I would say The Crucible moments are all around counterintuitive decisions or places where we zigged instead of zagged and then our engineers and designers build beautiful applications on top using that and that's our competitive advantage in the marketplace is how easy and elegant these things are and as we add more hubs we'll be able to continue to do that I'm a big skeptic when it comes to Conventional wisdom and I think that's in our bones and we'll continue join us next time as we hear from Hussein Raman and Alexa of jurn and learn how a revolutionary sound company became a cautionary tale this has been Crucible moments a podcast from sequa [Music] Capital Crucible moments is produced by the

Title: Eventbrite ft. Julia Hartz - A company that took 14 years to build nearly disappeared in 14 days
Published: 2023-10-05 09:00:02 UTC
Description:
Picture this: You’ve spent 14 years building a company that revolutionized how live events are organized, and are finally approaching profitability. Then a pandemic shuts down live events globally. What do you do? This was the reality Eventbrite CEO Julia Hartz faced as lockdows went into effect in March of 2020. “Even if you have spent 14 years building something, it could truly be gone in 14 days,” she remembers thinking. The company had faced crucible moments before—a change to its pricing model to become profitable without alienating users, and a bold acquisition to expand into live music. Julia relied on the same blend of grit and analytic insight she'd used to navigate these earlier inflection points, and put them to work to reinvent Eventbrite in a pandemic—and emerge ready to enable the future of events.

Julia Hartz
Julia co-founded Eventbrite in 2006 with her husband Kevin Hartz and CTO Renaud Visage. She became CEO in 2016 after initially serving as President. Outside of Eventbrite, Hartz is an investor in startups and serves on the board of Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts.

Kevin Hartz 
Kevin Hartz is the co-founder and Chairman of Eventbrite as well as an investor and advisor to startups. Prior to co-founding Eventbrite, Kevin served as the co-founder and CEO of Xoom, which went public and was acquired by PayPal.

who wanted to ticket any kind of event were very minimal they were mostly offline methods like collecting cash at the door you know using a PayPal button and tracking attendees on a spreadsheet and Eventbrite was the perfect solution our mission was really underpinned by the innate need to connect in real life as part of The Human Experience so we went out at the end of 2008 we had you know gone from zero to one we had found product Market fit and uh we were bushy-tailed and bright-eyed and heading down to Sand Hill Road and we pitched 27 VCS and we received 27 no's when we first met Eventbrite we felt there was a strong story but not yet a great product one of the challenges of building a startup is finding product Market fit and easy scalable distribution and when Eventbrite first pitched to Sequoia it wasn't clear to us that they had in fact found them Eventbrite was ticketing small events and many many of them but how quickly could we scale that and so that's the answer that we proved out in 2009 in the recession during an incredibly Bleak year and prior to us raising any Capital we saw one of the most explosive growth years of the company's history because as people were laid off they started to look at ways in which they could make money and the opportunity to use Eventbrite as a platform to teach classes to other people about what you know or to hold workshops or do you learn a new skill started to become a massive Trend and propelled the company forward and at the end of that year 2009 that's when we turned the no from Sequoia into a yes initially Kevin served this Eventbrite CEO and Julia was president in 2016 10 years after founding the company Kevin and I and the board started talking about you know what was next for the leadership of the company we wanted to give Julie an opportunity to rise to the challenge she was clearly a huge influence in the culture of the company and in holding things together and we thought it'd be a wonderful opportunity for her to step into that leadership role I became CEO April 21st 2016. by the end of day one I had realized that Kevin and I are incredibly different people but he had made it look so easy and I felt like I had been living in Candyland and woke up and Tron that's because she became Co at a moment when Eventbrite was facing challenges the company was post-product Market fit but not profitable they were creating value for customers but honestly not capturing enough of that as value for the business companies often encounter this tricky dilemma how much do you continue to invest in building more products expanding your footprint in the quest to build a bigger business long term or how much should you focus on the intern profitability up to this point the Eventbrite had focused primarily on growth Julia stepped into the role of Co and immediately was tested by a crucible moment how do you transition Eventbrite to a path of sustainable profitability [Music] 16 eventbrite's Revenue model was a per ticket transaction fee that was charged just for pay tickets free events or free tickets were free because we'd been so focused on democratization and enablement we were almost a victim of our own success which was we had the widest range of customer segments you could imagine and the issue was that our one size fits-all product and pricing was really sort of getting lost in the noise [Music] so the beauty of the self-serve model is you have a broad audience you can serve the downside of that is there are many different segments that end up using Eventbrite and they all have different needs and they all have different willingness to pay based on their alternatives [Music] Peril of become a commodity or some sort of utility it was time for us to become profitable the decision at the heart of this Crucible moment was how should Eventbrite change its pricing model to capture more value one of the risks that I think we had in changing the pricing model was tanking the business you know at the time there were enough bad examples of companies that had changed pricing and then had to roll it back whenever company faces this challenge of changing its pricing there's a tremendous fear of what the price elasticity is and what are the substitutes that your customers have it's a real challenge it truly is a crucible moment where you wonder whether what you have is good enough and will customers value it will they pay a little bit more and so it's generally a stressful moment for a company to go through these pricing changes and the company was very thoughtful as they went about this we ran a lot of experiments we did very careful analysis we tried to understand the different segments how we might price them differently what the true price sensitivity was and how people might react and almost by definition you're going to lose a little bit of business whenever you're increasing your pricing and then the question is is it worth it do you lose 10 of your business but increase pricing by 30 and you're better off as a company and so these are the sort of things that people really wrestle with as they try to finalize the pricing change we looked at a few different models we looked at just a price hike on the ticketing fee we looked at a collection of add-ons that you could sign up for if you wanted premium features we looked at subscription models I spent a lot of time in one conference room that we had painted mustard yellow and spent a ton of time staring at the screen with the three packages and so many different incarnations of those packages so when I visualize that moment it's really it's about that room so much happened in that room by the way but it was about that you know really looking at where are our customers going to find the easiest clearest path to engage with Eventbrite and find what they need and would this actually function the way that we wanted it to which would be a higher conversion of customers because it was very clear what you were getting and opening up this conversation around what Eventbrite actually was beyond just a ticketing tool so it was so much more than a pricing change it was really an unveiling of the Eventbrite platform and I learned that for pricing in particular something that is highly sensitive and has risk attached there needs to be one person in the room who's yelling go and that had to be me I truly think that pricing in particular given the risks that are associated must be led by the CEO and the CEO alone Because by the way when something goes bad it's the CEO who's apologizing and taking responsibility for it changing something that's fundamental like the way in which you interact with the cost of doing business is something that I think is is you know again only as CEO can really lead that change and so you just need someone to say let's do it let's go for it in October of 2017 Julia and the team landed on a three-tiered pricing model an essential package that offered access to the base features of Eventbrite a professional package that included more sophisticated promotional tools and a premium package that was reserved for customers who had signed a contract it took all hands on deck as a transactional platform there's not one part of Eventbrite that doesn't touch the pricing service [Music] so first we had to rebuild that service and really modernize it and then we needed to have every single development Squad work within the construct of this project it required a small tiger team internally whose sole job it was to make sure that this project didn't get cannibalized by the Thousand other things that we felt were urgent but we really understood that this would be the beginning of a new era for Eventbrite where we could differentiate to different customer segments the value of what we'd built we've been building features for 10 years this was something that was way overdue the growth that we saw in the company after shifting to the three-tier packaging model was very positive Revenue per customer went up and total Creator count increased in its momentum we saw the majority of our customers decide to you know adopt the professional package but we also saw some great growth in the essentials package which had actually lowered the core ticketing fee and was a great way for people to kick the tires and try Eventbrite for you know their first event and then unlock greater value over time the biggest lesson I learned from changing the pricing model is to be willing to make these types of tectonic shifts early and often we had waited too long to do this and in the end it was the right thing for the business it opened up all sorts of opportunities that we now have as a platform and I think being afraid to break the model in some way held us back and probably delayed us by a couple of years so there was just a lot of growing up that happened in that moment and I wish we would have done it a couple years earlier prior to 2018 Eventbrite was used by all varieties of creators to host a myriad of different types of events literary political religious professional Wellness you name it Eventbrite encountered another Crucible moment as it looked to expanded services to cater in a more meaningful way to a specific genre of event a genre that was gaining popularity on its platform we had noticed we were starting to be used by more Indie promoters artists music venues because Eventbrite is Switzerland we are the front door and the operating system for a live experience we are not trying to take a huge cut of your profit we're not producing the show we don't co-own the venue and that really gave the independent music industry something to be able to rely on in building their independence and so we realized that there was a purpose behind the growth of music that went beyond just a vertical and we leaned in one of the beauties of music as a category is has very high frequency use so when you think about Eventbrite as being a platform that serves both the creators and the attendees there's only so many conferences you might attend in a given year or workshops that you go to but especially for young people the willingness to go to mini music events gave us an unfair advantage of building a very large consumer audience and so all else being equal that actually made music a very interesting category we were seeing Bottoms Up adoption with smaller venues using Eventbrite and is inevitably the case disruptive software companies often Come From Below they initially offer a simpler product than incumbents and they serve smaller and mid-sized customers and so slowly our business was inching up into larger and larger events including larger music events and we wondered whether we could be a much bigger player in the music space and that led to this idea that maybe we should acquire ticket fly we had always been sort of friendly competitors uh you know Kevin and I and the founders of ticketfly Dan tree and Andrew dreskin had known each other for years and it was great uh friendly competition and Pandora which had acquired ticketfly about 18 months prior was starting to think about divesting in ticketing should have been brought a car ticketfly to compete in the live music space this was The Crucible decision and it was hotly debated there were a lot of concerns and considering acquiring a company like ticketfly first and foremost they are sales driven so that would be a huge change for us to bring on that kind of capability at such scale the many software businesses today they talk about product LED growth and Eventbrite was really a classic example of that the company had this organic growth if you look at the company's history it spent very little money on sales and marketing because the product sold itself there was this ability for users to promote Eventbrite to other users and that's how they kept on growing it was this fabulous Word of Mouth effect and take a fly was a sales LED organization sales driven organization with very different customers you know at a different scale from the ones we'd served historically and so you're mixing this Bottoms Up product-led growth motion business with a sales lead motion business and with those two mesh would you get Synergy from those or those oil and water and they're just gonna not mix at all it was a company that while subscale to Eventbrite and revenue was really successful and had a very loyal customer base and so we would have to capture The credibility and hearts and minds of those customers was there anyone who said don't acquire tick a fly I think I was probably the biggest objector to acquiring the company because of the risk that it would uh really impose and and introduce and at the time we were pre-pre-ipo so we knew that once we had generated a certain scale we would seek out an IPO and so that was on my mind and thinking about taking on a big acquisition seemed like it was uh a lot for one company to handle what changed my mind and made me decide to go for it was seeing the traction we were having in the market and knowing that we could Leap Forward about five squares in in the game of of market dominance uh and really see that we could bring a better technology platform to bear for these customers and help them grow faster and with music we had the sayings that the needs was so specific the ability to handle on-premise sales and you know somebody walks up to the venue and wants to buy a ticket on premise they want to be able to sell food and Bev they want to be able to sell merchandise at the concert these were all capabilities that we would need if we were going to serve the music industry and by making an acquisition we could LeapFrog and just get all that capability immediately and accelerate the business we also felt a company like ticketfly had very important relationships and existing contracts with sizable music venues and that we just enhance the scale of the business so again we had a certain fixed cost of operating the business and so if we can add Revenue it would make our path to profitability that much faster we all voted in favor of the acquisition I reluctantly said yes I had many questions along the way because it I was worried about the distraction and that it took us in a different strategic Direction than we'd been in with our Bottoms Up motion but at the end of the day I listened to the arguments and I was swayed by those arguments and so you know it was my decision as much as it was anybody else's decision I think it was a mistake in retrospect for us to have made that acquisition the challenges you integrate the two companies were that and you're looking at what it takes from a technical perspective there's the good better best scenario and I think that if I had to do it all over again I would have asked for the worst scenario we had decided that Eventbrite and tick apply would become one platform as quickly as possible and our Dev team had collectively together with ticketfly's Dev team created a roadmap that was I believe about nine months long to get the two databases integrated the two platforms integrated and then to be able to start moving customers over to Eventbrite it took much longer it was probably six to 12 months longer to integrate the platform than we had anticipated and when that happens you don't benefit from the synergies that you modeled as part of the transaction and so we didn't fully benefit from that we ended up with higher churn of ticketfly customers than we had anticipated when you know there's customer consternation and a highly competitive market naturally you open up an opportunity for competitors to come in and poach those customers when they're feeling uncertain about the future and so on top of the challenge of you know customer migration and really forging this this trust and credibility with customers we also had to be mindful and very Savvy about defending the business from competitors we had more management churn than we anticipated as well so we didn't retain as many of the key employees and therefore didn't retain the know-how and Industry knowledge and connections that we were assuming we would get as part of the transaction and then we ended up with this unfortunate breach in June of 2018 the ticketfly platform was held hostage by a hacker meaning when you went to ticketfly any customer on the venue or the the fan side saw a picture that looked like the anonymous picture the site had been taken over and and it was just a complete moment of disruption there was an exposed vulnerability on ticketfly that in the changeover was even more glaring and the business was hacked which sent the company into kind of a crisis mode for weeks as we fought to help customers and and get things back it was like you know everything that could go wrong went wrong I mean really understanding quickly the situation getting outside help from those who deal in the dark web and being able to ensure that customers data were not impacted or breached and then gaining back control of the site it was a no sleep moment for any of us as an executive when you walk into an acquisition scenario I think you should assume it's more likely to not work than to work and you need to increase the burden of proof on why an acquisition is worth doing especially as it starts to become a meaningful percentage of your own business a lot of lessons from the acquisition of ticketfly I could do it all over again I would probably have elongated that timeline and not forced it to have happened so quickly and the second thing is actually that two different cultures can find common ground and come together it's not easy and certainly there were a lot of moments of of stress but today some of the most incredible contributors at Eventbrite came from that acquisition and I think that there's something really lovely about that the history and the depth of experience the resilience it wasn't an easy time it was really really challenging and I'm I'm appreciative of those who've stuck with Eventbrite [Music] a year after acquiring ticket flying working through the challenges of integrating the businesses and fending of hackers Eventbrite went public on September 20th 2018. when we went public I was a mix of emotions it was like by the time we got to the day I was so excited to be there and be intact and then when I rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange I felt elated I felt sentimental we had our first 10 employees join us our some of our earliest customers joined us our family our friends and I'll never forget the president of the New York Stock Exchange Stacy at the time said we looked through the archives and we haven't seen this many women on the podium of an opening bell in any of the pictures that we can find and that was a Bittersweet moment for me because that was just our team and that's exciting but it's also sad and so it was wonderful to be with everybody and to to have that that moment you know and and really feel the love rule off was there of course and um it was great it was really wonderful and it was very gratifying [Music] the first year of being a public company was a challenge for Eventbrite the digestion of the ticketfly acquisition was difficult and then we disappointed Wall Street in our first quarter it's one thing if you've had 10 quarters of performance track record with public investors and then you have a slip up people might forgive you but if you make a footfall early on in your life as a public company public investors are going to take a long time before they let you out of purgatory for an early slip up so 2019 was a difficult year for the company but we started 2020 brimming with hope in the latter part of 2019 we did a number of things operationally to make it very clear where we were investing in the company and to start to gain Simplicity on where we were going to be investing in the company in 2020 we had completed a research project looking at the biggest customer value segments on the platform we'd been so focused on this certain music customer that we had really lost perspective as to who was driving the greatest value on the platform This research project revealed this horizontal segment of the frequent Creator a power user if you will and what we realized is that this user was using Eventbrite even though the Eventbrite platform was a pretty crummy experience for somebody who was hosting frequent events so we saw a high value segment with a great opportunity to improve the product experience and the platform to meet their needs we simplified our objectives for the year we reduced some of the cost in the business and we entered 2020 with a glint of optimism January was a banner month February another strong Revenue month and we were like oh my God we're gonna you know we're gonna beat our estimates on Wall Street this is so exciting we knew it'd be a long climb out of the panel two box but we were excited to be on the right track and then one morning in March I woke up to an early morning text from rcfo Lanny and the text said something like it's here I I opened my laptop and there was just this little line headed in the wrong direction from the previous day and that line went straight down over the next 14 days to negative territory this is the revenue line and from that day from that first text it was a complete and utter free fall so Square Capital published the memo in March called coronavirus is the Black Swan of 2020. we had a view of what was around the corner with covert and that it was likely much more dramatic much more impactful than people realized it turned out to be a crucible moment for many including Eventbrite within two weeks the company had lost 90 percent of its Revenue we honestly didn't know if the the company would survive this it was so surreal and of such massive Global impact to have a global pandemic just shutting down what his core to a business that you've worked for years and years and years you know in Blood Sweat and Tears together on building I'll be honest I thought that a decade's worth of work was going up in smoke this Black Swan had arrived and we didn't know what was going to happen next but we were going to fight to the death Sean Moriarty who's been a longtime board member close to 15 years and is our lead director today said to me you ready to be a wartime leader and I went home that day and I walked into our house and the home office had been converted by Kevin into a war room and he had gotten all these gaming monitors and set them up on arms to create almost a full 360. screen and in the middle of that were two chairs it was the most romantic and thoughtful thing imagine I tear up just thinking about it it was so symbolic to me of you know him saying nothing else matters we're co-founders we're gonna work together to get through this the first thing that I did was um I'm very operational and I I thrive in chaos but only if I'm organized if that makes sense so I I made five Lanes on the Whiteboard the first were breitlings we needed to figure out how we were going to help our breitlings adjust to what was to come the second were our creators how we were going to help and be a part of the hard message that their businesses were about to get decimated and what we were going to do to show up the third was consumers on the other side of the marketplace how were we going to help them get refunds quickly and what was our role in that as a platform the fourth was investors how were we going to message investors and really help ensure that not only were they in the know about what was happening with Eventbrite but we also needed to raise money quickly in order to stay you know in our minds solvent through what was going to be a devastating chapter for the company and the fifth was really around this this extra special thing that we had going on which was called Advanced payouts half of the revenue that we had generated in that period of time had already been Advanced to creators who were hosting events that weren't going to happen and so the Quantum of that was double our balance sheet so it was like an asteroid that was coming toward our planet and we weren't sure if we were going to be able to withstand the impact even if you have spent 14 years building something it could truly be gone in 14 days March 23rd when I gathered our executive team on zoom and I asked them one question which was given what we know about the business what would we do if we could do it all over again and I'm pretty sure everybody thought I had lost my marbles but there hadn't been a lot of sleep we'd been working 18 hour days seven days a week it was really intense I mean the work was intense a lot of hard conversations [Music] but what ended up happening from asking that question is the team started to think about well what are all the things that we've known about this business over the last 18 months that we would do we would focus on the frequent Creator we'd build a better product experience for them we'd stabilize a platform for somebody who was using Eventbrite for frequent events we would focus more on the core principle of self-service than human software we'd strengthen the Eventbrite product experience for those who wanted to use Eventbrite without having to call us you know and and so we started writing it down and what that did was it took a conversation that would have been about scarcity about where are we going to cut to survive and it flipped it to abundance what are the possibilities what do we see what would we do and at the end of the conversation I said to the team we're going to do it all over again [Music] so by late March of 2020 just a few weeks after the first day of covid you know coming to try to kill our company we had a plan we had a strategy we had figured out who we needed for that company we had committed to taking 100 million dollars out of the operating budget and we were ready to make the really tough change that we needed to make on April 8th of 2020 we announced our layoff as difficult as the layoff was it allowed us to realign our cost structure and stretch whatever cash we had as far as possible so the next thing we needed to do especially because of the risk of chargebacks and liability around payments was to ensure that our balance sheet was Stronger now the challenge at this point is our share price has dropped dramatically stock market was going through massive generations and public investors understandably had many questions about the future of our business it would have been incredibly expensive and dilutive for us to raise Equity capital in the midst of this crisis and so we look for alternatives to get debt financing there's a firm with whom we at Sequoia have had a long-term relationship called Francisco Partners it's about firm in San Francisco the Francisco team trusted us and they helped Bridge us at a time when we were an acute need Julie and I in in the rest of the team really read this a sigh of relief when that money had been secured for the financing but it was really then back to building the business refocusing on product yeah getting back down to things so one of the tools that we knew we needed to build quickly was actually the ability to reverse our entire Revenue generation machine and we needed to help creators be able to issue refunds quickly and at scale and so we built the mechanism to be able to bulk refund events and customers and in addition to that as we understood what was happening between the Creator and the consumer and the relationship that they had in service of the community that they had built together we realized that not all consumers wanted a refund consumers didn't really feel right about asking for money back from creators when their doors were closed and their local small business that they care about so we built the ability to offer a credit to future events in addition to refunds it was not in lieu of you had a choice as a consumer and that went a long way I think that really helped stabilize trust and credibility especially between the Creator and the consumer which was our number one goal in the very early days I would say by like May to June we started to see the Creator Community really wake up to the fact that humans need to connect we all know this innately because we're having The Human Experience together but I think the energy around connecting in any way possible was an opportunity for event creators who had previously only hosted people in real life and so what started to happen creators started to take the same content that they had used for a live in-person event and started playing around with what that would mean virtually and our product teams had thrown away the road map and were working primarily on how we can make creators lives easier through this moment in time and building tools for them to survive this crisis and so seeing them start to host events online like a daybreaker who hosts early morning dance parties in non-traditional places they started doing a Saturday version for everybody plus their kids which Grew From what typically would have been a thousand people in person to a hundred and ten thousand people globally in tens uh countries it was just it was incredible to see [Music] I remember in May and June one of the things that I was really focused on was making sure that event creators were considered in the small business act and I did multiple laps around my living room um kind of wearing a path talking to whoever I could talk to to Really Elevate the profile of the Creator as a small business we wanted to make sure that there was a handsome carve out for live event producers because they are the fabric of small business globally and in our country particularly so I was really focused on making sure that there was a consideration specifically for the Live Events industry because they were the first to close and would be the last to open and it was a very successful lobbying effort and we were very proud to have a very small part but a very persistent role in ensuring that there was a specific carve out for Live Events and that initial small business act and then in some of the follow-up moves that the government did to support small businesses one of the things that people underestimate is the resiliency and the human spirit humans are wonderfully adaptable and when you couple that with a moral compass like the one that Eventbrite has and an obsession with serving customers it's a great recipe for you to be able to overcome these types of challenges the company was always customer obsessed and so part of that means that they've built up an enormous amount of Goodwill with their customers as well and they truly had built a community it wasn't just a financial transaction between them and their customers and their customers in some sense depended on Eventbrite as well many of them their livelihood depends on Eventbrite and so that just creates a wonderful camaraderie and spirit of cooperation that enabled them to continue to serve their customers listen to their needs have the customers give us wonderful feedback to be able to adapt and both just had such a wonderful spirit of endurance and that helped us see through a true Crucible moment and crisis for the company [Music] one of those pretty unique moments where I'm not replaying it and thinking I would have done things differently because of where we are today I think that for me personally it meant a huge shift in my confidence I never thought of myself as a wartime leader a lot of my maternal and feminine Instinct kicked in and I wouldn't have thought that would have been the case as in Wartime I mean I had a lot of testosterone flowing too but it was really the Instinct that I would apply if anything were happening with my children and that really helped me and it made me gain more confidence in being a woman leader and and you know being a one of the few female founder public company CEOs [Music] it would have been very easy to give up and Julia and Kevin and their team refused to give up and they kept fighting and they kept thinking and they kept coming up with new ideas to navigate through this crisis to figure out how to get Eventbrite through it and also to help the customers survive through this experience so that's one of the key takeaways the other one for me is how a crucible Moment Like This can often help you in a phoenix moment experience a rebirth you accumulate Barnacles as a business you accumulate little decisions you decide to do this you add this product feature you you start serving this customer you open up this office you hire this team and you accumulate these things and there's not always a forcing function for you to revisit those assumptions you don't necessarily need to and then you face a crisis moment like this and it strips you down all the way and you bare and then you have to figure out how to rebuild and like the Phoenix Rises From the Ashes if Empire was able to really focus on its Essence on the core strategy and the core customer it wants to serve and so one of the things I've been wondering about is to what extent can one mimic that experience you don't have to actually experience such a Calamity for you to benefit from the clarity that it can bring in focusing on what's most important for your business trust your fear instinct stare at the face and know that you have to get through it you can't go around it you can't go over it you can't go under it like any really challenging time in life you know whether you're ending a relationship or a job or you know there's no easy way so the fear that you feel in your gut is actually a really helpful signal that you're gonna have to get pretty tough and go straight through it try to seek out the signal of what matters most we knew that we wanted to be around for event creators to be able to rebuild the entire Live Events economy and so that's what we focused on had I tried to sidestep some of the more painful moments of this journey we probably wouldn't be here today now what the future of events will be is really rooted in the innate human desire to connect I think we've lived something that is quite phenomenal that underpins the importance of our mission of bringing the world together through live experiences but also opens up the world of possibilities while people connecting in real life is I think Irreplaceable I think the option to find people virtually whether it be the metaverse or through online events is going to be an exceptional growth path particularly for people who are experienced creators and I think that understanding of the ephemeral nature of what we build it changes you in a way that you appreciate the value of a business you appreciate the value of a company so much more

Title: Block ft. Jack Dorsey - A controversial hack week project becomes the #1 financial services app
Published: 2023-09-21 15:51:10 UTC
Description:
CEO Jack Dorsey’s ultimate vision for Block was always about economic empowerment for all. Initially called Square, the company’s first product—the white dongle that let small businesses turn an iPhone into a credit card reader—was just a first step. So when a hack week project called Cash App that let anyone send money for free started gaining traction, Dorsey wanted to support it. It was easier said than done. It seemed like a strategic departure and it was costing lots of time and money. “Everyone wanted to kill it,” Dorsey says. Today, Cash App accounts for half the company’s revenue.  In this episode, Dorsey explains how the company navigated this strategic shift, and how companies can succeed by weaving successive products and experiences around a singular, core vision.

became clear and how the company turned a hack quick project called Cash app into one of the most popular Consumer Finance products in the world you'll learn how Block's culture of risk taking its willingness to accept mistakes and its refusal to let failure hold them back LED to some remarkable outcomes [Music] my name is Jack Dorsey and I am Black's head a blackhead my second boss ever this guy named Jim McKelvey when I was about 15 years old in 1993 Jim hired Jack to work as a summer intern at a software company Mira Jim coined him jack the genius and the two worked together for the next two summers I went to college moved away we kind of lost touch and after I left the CEO role of Twitter Jim reached out and he was interested in working together again I was too so I went back to St Louis during the holidays and we had a conversation and we decided that we wanted to build something we didn't know what that something was but generally we just wanted to work together because we enjoyed it I think it was in January of 2009. he said I know what we're working on and I said what he's like well I just lost a sale because I couldn't accept Dynamics Jim's side hustle was blowing gloss he ran a studio in St Louis selling sculptural gloss faucets which are beautiful by the way if you look them up but like millions of other small business owners Jim was unable to accept credit cards before square if you were a merchant who wanted to take credit cards you had to purchase expensive Hardware which locked you into a multi-year contract and came with exorbitant often hidden monthly fees on top of that as the merchant you were on the hook to pay a range of transaction fees to credit card Networks for a small business these costs were prohibitive this meant if someone wanted to pay with a credit card as was the case with Jim business owners had no choice but to turn down the sale there was an important why now the App Store had launched the previous year and smartphones were quickly becoming ubiquitous Jim thought what if someone could accept credit card payments using their phone and he said why don't we build that we wanted to build something that stood for small businesses giving them tools to level the playing field so we started with it being entirely software based and then we realized we needed hardware and we figured out how to build the hardware and intersect with the networks and just constant iteration to get to a point within a month of a working prototype that we could actually take someone's card and take money off the card in 2009 when I first met Jack and Jim the idea that there was this little reader that you would plug into the audio jack of your phone that would transform your phone into a credit card terminal was pretty remarkable remember Jack giving me one of the readers and I ran around like a child in a candy store showing it to all my partners at Sequoia and say please give me your credit card and and I would charge five dollars and I'd give them the money back obviously it wasn't I was trying to to scam all my partners in this case but it was just it was so inspiring when you think about the ability for a merchant to just run its business accepting payments it's just such a fundamental part of that block enabled these Merchants that were unserved to become part of the electronic payment system we have a core purpose which is economic impairment in 2011 Sequoia invested in square and I joined its board back in those early days I was worried about Square's ability to gain distribution at the time Intuit had a payments product and they had a bluetooth reader so competitors in the critical terminal space existed and square this brand new company would be up against them and there was a real question whether the Simplicity of design that square offered and the seamless nature of the whole product experience would really resonate in a way that made distribution and growth efficient so it was a little bit of competitive noise and then a question about is this a product that you needed to sell or is it a product that customers would find the risk was that if Square didn't figure out an efficient way to get sellers to embrace its product and then also develop a business model the company would die before it even got started so there was an inflection point within six or seven months of starting work on the project where on One path we could have built hardware and software and sold it much like some of our competitors were doing like a verifone and NCR and all these all these terminals you've seen on countertops the initial idea was we sell this reader and we sell the software or we could build a somewhat healthy margin business based off that but then we started watching how people were using Square early on so we had one Merchant under my apartment in San Francisco named Lily Bell and she sold flowers and we kept going to her every week asking her if she wanted to try what we were building try to accept credit cards because she was cash only and she consistently said no to us she said I don't want to deal with credit cards I want to keep it simple use cash eventually after about a month we asked her and she said no again and we were standing around someone came up to buy flowers handed over a credit card and she said we don't accept that but there's an ATM around the corner he kind of shrugged his shoulders and walks away the guy never comes back and she turned to us and said I'm gonna try this when we reflected upon it for Lily Bell she doesn't care about accepting credit cards at all what she cares about is making the sale so if that's the case and we want to help as many people make as many sales as possible we need to give this away for free we need to give the hardware away for free we need to give the software away for free we need to grow the network as quickly as possible and it was super scary it was super risky all the companies in the critical terminal space were making money by selling their hardware and software Square disrupted this business model by doing the opposite give the hardware away for free and charge a percentage fee on each transaction they envisioned they could succeed by growing a large network with lots of transactions but this direction would mean incurring enormous initial losses just as the company was getting its start when everything was at risk and so The Crucible decision became should Square stick with its initial plan to sell its hardware and software or should it take the less obvious riskier path and give it away for free after a lot of back and forth we decided to give it away for free and grow the network and that moment led to the whole company if we stuck with the hardware aspect which we're intending to do we would have been verified and I wouldn't be talking on this podcast Square introduced the credit card reader in 2010 and it immediately took off customers flocked to the service in addition to giving hardware and software away for free Square simplified the Byzantine fee structure of traditional credit card providers at the time these fees were anywhere from one to eight percent of a purchase depending on whether it was charged to a Visa Mastercard Amex Etc we want to make it simple for sellers to say yes and having a always-changing rate table was not simple at all so we decided we're gonna have one price it's gonna be 2.75 percent we're going to pay the difference we know we're going to lose money for a while but we did the math and we felt comfortable that we could do it that we are willing to take the risk and and see it through and It ultimately worked out while Square did lose money initially the company was able to grow its Network so much that eventually it became profitable and this opened the door for square to develop other Financial tools for merchants squares evolved a ton over the years I'm Melissa Henry and I'm the CEO of the square business at block when I started we were primarily payments it was a hardware dongle and most of our payments Revenue was really entered 10.50 hit charge and go and majority of the revenue wasn't associated with customers using software and our Commerce products to really run and optimize their business over time that's really kind of inverted because we latched onto this problem of no we're helping sellers make the sale there's other things that help them make the sale in addition to accepting credit cards the next thing that we found was we were giving the credit card reader to site glass coffee for instance they were using it but they had no way to track how many cappuccinos they sold that day or croissants or espressos or black coffee or whatnot we made a very simple register and the biggest thing we did was just made a button for cappuccino and it was programmable of course but what that meant is every time they hit that button for Cappuccino the price would automatically come up and in the background that was now tracked so now at the end of the day they could see how many cappuccinos they sold they could remember that on Tuesday it was rainy and how that impacted their sales for the day they could see the correlation between the Scotty sales and espresso when they moved the biscotti jar across the counter away from the register so suddenly they had all this data and the data helped inform how they built their business and what did that lead to led to them making more sales we did it again recognizing that we had a salon for instance and if they could buy a new chair which costs about two thousand dollars to install they would literally double their sales so we started looking at like what if we lend money and we talked to a bunch of merchants and it turns out if they go to a bank if they ask for a loan the floor is usually about twenty twenty five thousand dollars like Banks just don't work at those small amounts so we said okay why don't we set up a very simple system where we can lend money to these sellers send them an email says you know here's an offer for a 500 loan or a five thousand dollar loan all based on the data that we had from them using our register and the payment device you can accept it if you want here's a rate and you pay it back every time you swipe one of your customers cards and it was a hit because it was easy [Music] our model became very very simple which was if we help a seller make a sale and we help them make more sales it benefits our business positively and then we can support more sellers so we actually found this very virtuous Loop which had very little tax on our customers and our interests were entirely aligned all we had to do was help the seller make more sales and our businesses would grow your total a lot to listen to your customers and I think people take that somewhat literally like if a customer tells you to do this then you do that whereas we had a different approach which was we're going to observe what our customers are trying to do and then we're going to learn why they're trying to do that over a base of customers and then we're going to iterate based on that so this cycle of observe learn improve that really set the tone for the business for the next two years or so so in 2012 we had Starbucks reach out to us and it was Howard Howard Schultz then CEO of Starbucks Square got onto their radar and Howard reached out and they were interested in using Square at all their stores moving all their processing over to us which was pretty crazy given that we were only three years old and we built a really great scalable system but we never imagined like going to the level of a Starbucks which had 10 000 stores all around the US and even more internationally as I mentioned I was worried about Square's ability to gain enough distribution to get off the ground here was a chance to get a lot of distribution quickly but it also came with a lot of risk one of my earliest memories of the Starbucks deal was discussing it at a board meeting where the management team presented this as a as a potential Avenue for growth how do you gain wider distribution for your product and one of the paths is to do a big partnership deal and that is always brought with risk as as was the Starbucks Deal Four Square as it was known at the time and I was I'd say initially I was a little resistant to the idea the gap between where our product capabilities were and what Starbucks needed was very big and by investing the resources to meet Starbucks needs I worried that we would divert resources from other things that served the media potatoes of the business that we were in I realized that doing that would also stretch our capabilities and maybe that then would trickle down and benefit everybody else it's a difficult rate of decision I've seen companies where they were smothered by one big customer really overwhelming them and you almost become the r d extension or product development extension for some big company and I've seen instances where I've been catapult you so there's no single formula to say you should or should not pursue these sort of distribution deals [Music] and so this became a crucible moment should Square take the deal with Starbucks [Music] it's hard because Starbucks is a big name and of course you want to be associated with this giant name and of course you want those headlines and you know it would feel good but it was challenging emotionally because we were building this company that stood for small businesses giving them tools to level the playing field on competing with the larger businesses like a Starbucks we had so many coffee stores at this point and they were all competing against Starbucks my mom had a coffee store when I was young in St Louis Missouri and she was actually put out of business by Starbucks explaining it to our customer base I said you know there's an opportunity for us potentially to work with Starbucks your coffee store would you be opposed to that and I was assuming that they would not be comfortable with it but what they said consistently was no I you know I feel you should do that because if you can handle Starbucks you can handle me and by the way my coffee is better than Starbucks I'm not really competing with them I went to my mom I said you know Starbucks wants to work with us would you be upset she's like no like if we could have used square at the time we would use it and maybe I wouldn't have been out of business I don't know and then there's Square employees and that's where the mini Revolt kind of happened there's this mindset of we are for the underdog we're solely focused on helping them against the Giants and we had a big conversation I think we're about 200 people at the time those moments come with a lot of pain a lot of conversation a lot of stubbornness but eventually you arrive at the right solution if you're if you're asking the right questions one of the things that that came to me through the conversations is that if we cast ourselves as for the underdog for the smaller sellers leveling this playing field and were successful and they actually grow are we going to tell them to go elsewhere because philosophically we don't want to handle them at this arbitrary line of growth that they just passed no so what if instead we change our mindset a bit and grow with our sellers if we can grow with them for whatever ambition they have we're fulfilling the promise that we made to them when they came to us so that eventually resonated and we decided to sign the Starbucks Deal certainly it ended up being somewhat of a one-sided deal that did not benefit us and it is what it is in August 2012 Square became a Starbucks's exclusive processor of in-store payments for 7 000 U.S stores but in 2015 squares S1 filing revealed that this partnership had caused losses of 70 million dollars Square had been promised the percentage of the transaction fees but the terms of the deal were such that with each transaction Square was required to pay an even higher transaction rate to the credit card companies and so ultimately on every Starbucks swipe Square lost money there was this good BDM article that talks about the clock and the News cycle that companies go through where you know noon is your high Riding High everyone loves you six o'clock everything starts to turn sour and then you've got the two sides in between at this point we were in the second half we were probably seven or eight o'clock you know there had been some bad press somewhat dark hours and then you know the IPO was rough as well the Revelation about the Starbucks Deal and this very specific focus on the losses incurred in the payment processing part of it was something that cast a shadow over square and raised more questions about the company's ability to be profitable long term right when we're going public right when you're unable to respond to these criticisms because you're in the middle of a quiet period And So It was one of several headwinds we faced as we moved into the IPO Square had been valued at 6 billion dollars but on the day of the IPO we were priced at just nine dollars a share meaning evaluation of just 2.9 billion I felt sick to my stomach you know the key is obviously power company performs in the long run people often talk about the only share prices that matter are the share prices that the day you buy and the day you sell and everything else in between kind of is irrelevant as filing showed we essentially lost 70 million dollars on that deal you know but that's one way of framing it yeah did we lose 70 million dollars or did we pay 70 million dollars to get the exposure and to grow the network I don't know I mean certainly there were a lot more things that we wanted to do with Starbucks that they did not fulfill but I don't regret the move because it hyper accelerated number one our technology stack number two are awareness with both customers and potential candidates that want to work with us and number three it broke us out of a box which was we are building hardware and software for small sellers so it definitely changed the company for the better in company or business building there will always be dark hours no company no business is immune from these periods of time Square was going through those moments in 2014 and 2015 but I think we were planting the seeds then that have led to the success of block overall today it's helped us expand to support a larger range of Sellers and grow up Market as well and then of course transition from kind of Hardware only or Hardware focused in-person focused and payments focused to omnichannel software such that sellers can meet their buyers wherever their buyers may be whether it's in person online or over the phone or over social media one of the questions I always wrestled with when one reflects on decisions made is you don't have a parallel universe where you knew what all the other choices could have been so in assessing the Starbucks Deal on its own I think it was worth doing it the way we did it taking a step back did it enable the company to succeed long term did we learn from that experience did it provided enormous value to us it absolutely did the thing which I'm not sure about is was there some other decision that we could have made that might even have been better for the company in the long run and obviously yeah I don't know that but I would certainly encourage anybody listening as you evaluate your own decisions key Crucible decisions strategic options you're weighing is have as wide a set of choices as possible that you're evaluating and if you find yourself deciding between only two choices maybe you need to widen the aperture is there a third or a fourth option that you haven't even considered that you need to throw into the mix to really test whether that is the right path something that maybe is not obvious to people that have studied Square's history or looked at Square over the years was very very early on the company we were just culturally obsessed with trying to figure out how we could build a consumer product my name is Brian grazedonia I'm a CEO of cash app we launched the Square credit card reader in October of 2010 and by January of 2011 we thought that the product that we were building was really interesting but we didn't think that the business that we were building was very compelling unless we could Bridge both sides of the counter so figuring out a way for sellers to connect with their customers and helping them engage their customers helping them understand who their customers were so in 2011 we started hacking on this idea of a product called Square Wallet and it was a product that worked at Square Merchants and you could walk up to the counter at a square Merchant and you could pay and that product never really got off the ground we just could not find the right approach to grow it and we just did some stupid things early on like we assumed that a bunch of people who would be sellers would also have this Square wallet so that it was a one binary it was both the seller app and also the wallet unfortunately we ripped it out but it continued to be this thing of like we want to build daily utility for individuals as well not just sellers so it was another two years of many different attempts of us trying to figure out products on the consumer side that we could build that would Bridge both sides of the counter cash app was born out of kind of trying something entirely new it was maybe December of 2012. we wrote down 10 initiatives on the board and then we just put people's names next to these initiatives My name got put next to the build a low-cost payment Network on Adam [Music] after the Starbucks Deal happened we were looking at ways to minimize our cost on the networks one exploration was using the debit card rails effectively forcing a refund onto a debit card actually bypassed The Interchange fee completely and then right around that time this idea started to swirl around the company and it was this idea of emailing money what if you could send money as easy as sending an email and the idea was like you put any amount in the subject line it would look at an account that was linked to a debit card it could take from the debit card it could push the debit card extremely cheap to do both operations somehow these two ideas got combined together and that was the kind of setting that cash up was born out of so at the time that the cash up idea was floating around firstly I was a little bit worried that it wasn't obvious why would it hit a nerve given that person-to-person payments companies had predated cash apps launch and then there's this question about whether does a merchant facing company also have a consumer product payments company if the company were to pursue cash app in Earnest it would mean building out a new division within square a business unit focused on consumers developing a product for consumers would take time and resources and delay overall profitability with a divert Focus from Square's primary business its hardware and software for merchants companies typically pivot because they have no choice but in this case Square's initial product worked and it was thriving often people place a limit on their own potential by becoming risk-averse when they initially succeed they don't push further and so Square faced a crucible decision do you risk taking the company in this brand new Direction potentially putting your core business in danger and pursue cash app nobody wanted us to work on cash up because again we are for sellers we're helping them grow why are we doing this thing that is competing with PayPal or venmo like it's a solved problem we're not going to add anything new and we just didn't believe that like it felt really good it felt interesting it felt electric and it was in those moments in our company's history where you have to as a lead you kind of have to sacrifice some of your credibility and I was willing to take that credibility hit and willing to protect this thing because I I believed in it I believed in Brian and the team he was assembling and it was enough to give me confidence that we should continue to see this thing through despite the fact that everyone wanted to kill it cash app was given the green light Brian and his team got to work we started to just build I think we gave ourselves a week to build an experience where anybody within the organization could send a payment to somebody else I was empowered to kind of approach the work completely untethered from anything that we were doing at Square it was a startup within our startup but that's a tired term there's a lot of products or a lot of businesses that are being built within companies or you like to think about them like startups but this truly was it was truly firewalled cash app launched in October 2013. it began to see adoption and the square team observed something interesting about how the product was being used we found that it wasn't just about people sending money to one another people were literally looking at this app as their bank account it opened the door to us seeing a lot of folks who were challenged in just participating in the economy could not get a card could not get a savings account you know couldn't get a checking account they had a job at no way to direct deposit it into an account that they could actually use the money in the United States approximately 6 million people are unbanked like the Square Reader cash app became a tool for economic empowerment and this differentiated it from other peer-to-peer payments services at the time it wasn't on college campuses like venmo it's not in this Millennial crowd like venmo is it's with people who don't have any other option for a bank account and they're actually you know asking their family or their friends for money and then using that money to send to to other people so they completely bypass the bank account needed and just using cash app all the time despite cash app's popularity with users and its alignment with Square's purpose of economic empowerment its existence was constantly threatened the organization for many years was trying to reject the organ so in the early days of cash apps formation initially we just had to figure out if we could actually make customers happy could this service grow could it be adopted and can it show strong engagement and it did but the more it did the more it added to the company's losses and understandably the company's CFO and other executives are starting to worry you know we can't just continue to fund something indefinitely it's losing us all this money like why are we doing this it started to create a culture War within the organization something that we really had to manage there were millions of customers joining the network but we hadn't figured out a business model so this was you know maybe 2016. I think we gave it nine months and if we didn't figure out a business model for cash app within those nine months we were gonna either divest it or shut it down that was another almost like a crucible moment within a crucible moment for cash app you know I think that constraints can oftentimes really really Force Clarity and force creative problem solving and we were able to invent a business model around cash app foreign the team built out features such as instant deposit which gave users the option of paying small fees to expedite deposits into their bank accounts they launched the cash card a debit card that charges withdrawal and interchange fees they also introduced cash boost which allows companies to advertise on cash app and rewards customers when they spend money at those companies today these are just a few among many Revenue generating features we went from losing money on every single payment that was being sent to making money in every single payment that was being sent which created this amazing positive reinforcement for the business where we were able to finally reinvest money it was a breakthrough moment for us they invented new ways of earning revenue for a service such as this that I'd never seen before true true Innovation but it was the constraint of needing to focus on eventually generating revenue and becoming a profitable unit within the business that enabled that Innovation to take place if you go back to the creation of cash app maybe it was 50 50 that that idea would have succeeded but today half of blocks revenue is Cash Up and finding companies people are often scared to guard an Alum to recommend things that are maybe controversial there's this idea of the world being probabilistic in nature and if you always make only safe decisions you know very high probability payoff decisions you probably are not making the best long-term decisions because what about that decision that's maybe a 50 50 decision but the upside of that decision is enormous our culture was to do a lot of things and to have small teams of people focused on really big ideas and Starbucks was one of them and Square Wallet was one of them and cash app was one of them part of bets and risk taking is that you will have some that fail but if you don't take a swing if you don't make bets you can guarantee that you're never going to have that that massively pays off so when we started Square we were starting with one product and that product was this credit card reader that helped the seller make more sales and then we added the point of sale the cashier and then we added Square loans we kept adding tools for sellers we added CRM and analytics and issuing cards and all these all these things and what we realized we were building is not just a single product but an ecosystem of tools and then cash did the same thing we saw that same sort of build out of ecosystem for individuals as well so they were using us for peer-to-peer using us as their primary payment card using us now to buy Bitcoin and to deposit money all these things and then we asked the question well we have these two ecosystems they're both serving different audiences could we connect them because if we could connect them it's really powerful none of our competitors are really doing that and we did some smaller things and then we did one really big thing which was after pay after pay is a buy now pay later product what it does for sellers is it gives them a new tool to make more sales and what it does for individuals is it gives them discovery of merchants around them or on the Internet that they could pay in installments so they could get their merchandise much faster than they otherwise could we as buyers all know the landscape is changing and we're hearing from many sellers that they were interested in offering by now pay later to their customers we were looking at it on the Square side concurrently there's a small group within cash app that was also starting to explore and consider by now pay later from a consumer perspective or consumer lending perspective after pay based out of Australia was one of the fastest growing buy now pay later companies in August of 2021 block made another bold forward-looking decision and agreed to acquire after pay for 29 billion dollars this represents this connection between these two outscale massive ecosystems you're creating this bridge between what had been previously with square and cash it's a pretty like actually very siled different businesses with no connections or communication between the two we were just operating independently by putting after pay in the middle it starts to build this bridge in this two-way communication and in order to make it successful we have to bring these two businesses and our operating rhythms and portions of our culture closer together and so it's been phenomenal Brian I have never worked so much together it's it's great after pay team it's been a much more of an Enterprise sales motion where there are really really strong sales-led culture that has really really helped us as we think about bringing these two ecosystems together and finally kind of helping cash app and square build one network lots more to go do it's going to be a multi-year integration but excited about us seeing and ticking off the pieces of the deal thesis that we believed in looking back at all these moments I think the the most important part is we built a company that is willing to face entirely new challenges we're willing to ask really tough questions of ourselves and do so with humility of not knowing what's on the other side of them there's never one point or a set of points that you can point to and say that's why we're successful and we certainly talked about some of those things that look like that during this conversation but all of this is very small things adding up together very quickly and compounding into where we are today and that's all the successes and all the mistakes and all the learnings we made there's a ton of mistakes that we made that because we made them has given us more success and while these moments were important it's everything in between them that really made us who we are and gave us the success that we did and I don't think enough people talk about that but when you really consider and you go back and you reflect that's what matters the most it's just these little tiny things that that add up quite quickly and it's it's moving so fast you don't even notice them and then you bucket them into this this larger thing so it's easier to talk about I'm just proud that we built a company that continues to learn and is good at observing and and asking those questions and being uncomfortable

Title: PayPal ft Max Levchin - A Merger of Enemies That Reshaped Silicon Valley
Published: 2023-09-11 22:59:03 UTC
Description:
If you’ve ever networked through LinkedIn, driven in a Tesla, or even watched a YouTube video, you have PayPal to thank. The founders of all these companies got their start when the internet was just taking off, at a fledgling payments startup. PayPal would become a defining tech company, with many of its breakthroughs becoming standard practices for a generation of startups. But these lessons were hard-won in the company’s chaotic start. The PayPal of today only exists because of how its team navigated early crucible moments, including a merger between enemies, a battle against fraud that resulted in security innovations still in use today, and a decision to pursue one of the most significant tech IPOs following the dot-com crash. Explore the inflection points that shaped a cornerstone of Silicon Valley.


Max Levchin
Max Levchin co founded PayPal in 1997 at the age of 23. Like others in the "PayPal Mafia," Max has since founded and funded numerous companies around the world. He currently serves as the founder and CEO of Affirm, a next-generation credit card network.

Michael Moritz
Michael Moritz was the Sequoia partner who joined the board of PayPal in 1999. After 38 years with Sequoia Capital, Michael now serves as an advisor to Sequoia Heritage and as president of his family foundation, Crankstart.  

Dave Gausebeck
Dave Gausebeck joined PayPal when the entire company fit into a single conference room and, while there, co-developed the first commercial implementation of a CAPTCHA. He now leads technological research and operations at Matterport, a spatial computing platform he founded in 2011.

as you decide your path forward today's episode is very personal to me in the spring of 2000 on a student visa from South Africa and desperate to prove myself and earn a place in Silicon Valley I joined a fledgling startup called PayPal it turned out to be a life-changing Crucible moment but it wasn't an obvious choice at the time PayPal as it's known today a bmoth with a universal name and logo one of the highest valued digital payments companies in the world is nothing like the company I joined on my first day I walked into a rinky dink office next to the Pala Alto dump when I settled into my desk and switched on one of those thick 1990s style desktops the smell of garbage wafted through the air famous for the people who came out of it Max leftgen who you'll hear from today Elon Musk Reed Hoffman Peter Thiel Steve Chen Chad Hurley the list goes on and on they're often referred to as the PayPal Mafia because they went on to found some of the most significant companies of our time but back then we were just a group of unknown underdogs working day and night to keep our company alive I'll start with a roller coaster it was scary again and again we thought the company was going to die three defining Crucible moments in PayPal's early history played out nearly simultaneously just as we had wrestled one under control another challenge reared its head in this episode we'll look at how a 50 50 merger nearly tore PayPal apart how pressured to stabilize the business led to Innovative fraud fighting measures still in use today and how a series of acquisition offers tested our team's resilience and our resolved to fight and bet on ourselves you know the PayPal of today let's get into the early days that defined it my name is Jimmy Sony I'm the author of the founders the story of PayPal and the entrepreneurs who shaped Silicon Valley when PayPal was in its infancy it was two companies one company was called x.com and it was founded by a then late 20-something named Elon Musk the other component of what became what we know as PayPal was called confinity and it was co-founded by Peter Thiel and Max lebjin my name is Max Lufkin I co-founded PayPal and was this Chief technical officer the company was really started around kind of this broad idea of cryptography coming to devices with small screens of course it's mid 90s or late 90s and so things like iPhone don't exist yet but Palm Pilots do and so you have this maybe possible interesting area of opportunity where things like documents and payments will have to be secured my background was in cryptography and so I I thought the starting company in the space met this guy Peter Thiel we hit it off and uh co-founded a company that became known as confinity as we sort of meandered through the desert of bad business ideas we'd realize that nobody actually cared yet about encrypting documents on devices that could barely generate a random number and so we sort of chiseled away at it and eventually turned to this idea of payments initially on your mobile device but then over time there's sort of a chance migration to the web basically payments for everyone they create an email money framework or a process that we all know as PayPal today unfortunately for Max and Peter they weren't the only ones working on digitizing payments over the internet Elon musk's thesis was if in a digital age money really isn't real why does it cost me anything to move money around if I have an insurance policy and a mortgage and a bank and a brokerage why can't that all just live in one place and for him that one place was x.com we weren't aware of the presence of confinity when we made the first investment in x.com I'm Michael Moritz Michael was the square partner who joined the board of x.com when we met Elon we didn't have any background with him we had not been investors in the first company that had started uh zip2 so he was a fresh and new and it was obvious that he was one of these characters who was prepared to Tilt at windmills which is the sort of sensibility I think you needed when you were going to take on the banking establishment here's what leads to the Rivalry between these two companies both of them have an email money mechanism and both of them take off on this corner of the internet called eBay so eBay it's recently gone public it's an auction website you know there's all these buyers and sellers they could unite somebody that wants to sell a beanie baby with somebody that wants to buy a beanie baby and so you have this flea market but what the flea market hadn't figured out was how to do the payment part of the transaction and eBay didn't have a good integrated payment solution at that time and so despite the fact that x.com had this broader remit and vision of financial products it was really their person-to-person payments product that was exploding in use and similarly with PayPal it was the email product again used by eBay Merchants that was exploding in use and the two companies really had neck and neck market share on eBay at the time they both notice that like eBay buyers and sellers are less like totally Gaga they're obsessed because it's an instantaneous money transfer they don't have to do things like mail checks or send cash in an envelope or send a you know a money order through Western Union they can just actually like send email money they both take off and all of a sudden these two startups that are on the same street University Avenue in Palo Alto are competing against each other tooth and nail [Music] the actual sort of company to company relationship was basically that of a mortal enemy blood Feud sort of thing I always think of the times when confinity on one side of University Avenue and x.com on the other side were competing as if you've ever been to the little Tuscan Hill town of San gimignana which is um dotted in the center by very tall thin Towers where different families lived and these towers all have slits in the side for um a crossbow and bow and arrows to be shot these families waged holy war on each other and this competition drives both teams utterly completely crazy right you know the world knows that Elon is no slouch and he wants to win and he wants to be successful what what maybe fewer people understand but certainly people in Silicon Valley know is that Max Lefton has just as much endurance and intensity there's a member of the Infinity team that is celebrating a birthday and the birthday cake is brought out for the confinity team to enjoy and on the birthday cake in frosting is diex.com die on the other side of the fence on the x.com side of the fence Elon in a moment of you know heated competition sends an email that to this day 20 plus years later rings in the minds of his teammates the subject is a friendly note about our competitors and apparently the text was kill our competitors die die die right and so you have this sort of superheated competition Max leptin at one point warns his Engineers they were working at Infinity to be careful about what they say while walking around Palo Alto because there could be spies everywhere the paranoia took deep hole and um in part because we were absolutely certain that they must have heard us through the walls or maybe dumpster Dives for our ideas and Etc et cetera so it was definitely very very tense and of course you know all of us being nerdy Engineers so we'd never actually confronted each other in any sort of a physical domain we just sort of duked it out online both extra common and confinity had very high burn rates for those folks who are unfamiliar with the terminology in Silicon Valley the burn rate of a company refers to the rate at which it is depleting its cash balance there were people who thought that if the competition continued that it would be ruinous for both companies a key person in this process and in the negotiation that followed and in the kind of armistice that these companies had was Peter Thiel and he realizes that they are in this fevered competitive environment but that it is actually costing both companies a huge amount of money and a huge amount of unnecessary stress and grief that at some point he realizes that you know elon's x.com has far more Capital than confinity does that it could basically just win by dint of size it gradually became clear as the financing Market Titan that each of these companies as a separate entity was trading its own Road to Perdition and the sensible thing would be to combine forces the companies faced a crucible decision if your business's life is on the line do you merge with an enemy and if you do merge who's in charge [Music] but there are always two issues that pop up and emerge and one of which is how much of the cake will my company have and the second one is who's going to be in charge of the combined entity it was certainly very controversial because the original proposal from X was significantly in their favor all the metrics suggested that we were in some form or another equal to them and so my my pride was insulted by the original suggestion of let's do a 9010 merger in our favor there's nothing complicated about uh 9010 combination it means that one side has nine slices of the cake and the other side has one slice of the cake and from Max and Peter's point of view I'm sure that they felt that their progress at PayPal and the trajectory they they were on it should be worth a lot more than uh just one slice of the cake and I can well imagine that they were affronted by that but on the other hand you have to start somewhere Peter who's not a bad poker player himself I think counter it was something like absolutely not uh but I I left the uh I left the negotiation of the actual merger terms to them which ultimately led to a 50 50 merger which is really something I do not recommend to anyone in early 2000 x.com and confinity merged the combined company was renamed PayPal adopting the name of confinities payments product is the new overarching name of the company I joined PayPal on the heels of the Mojo which as Max said was a 50 50 merger or a merger of equals at the time this was meant to signify that neither team was better than the other but as Max hinted the outcome of this Crucible moment a 50 50 split came at a cost when these two companies x.com and confinity unite into one company it is profoundly awkward I described the merger of x.com and Divinity as a shotgun wedding and that's a pretty app description given that you know just days just weeks before this merger these two companies were like truly trying to destroy one another because it was a merger equals for example my position was well I am the CTO of the combined company I should be the one making technical decisions of course Elon had his own technical decisions in mind and there's well documented rivalry between us about what exactly we should have built and how so Elon for example thought that we should move the infrastructure the company over to Windows NT and most the engineering team that had come from the confinity side were Unix developers and Maxwell's had a very strong point of view that Unix is a much more secure platform for the company than in t which I think has proven accurate with the benefit of hindsight that sort of narrative played out in a bunch of other places where you would say well this is obviously the better way it was our way and the answer would be well sure but we merged 50 50. like it's not really clear to anyone here that this was your way or our way so it just creates a set of tensions [Music] here's a snapshot of the management roller coaster in those days Peter was supposed to be the Executive Vice President of the newly combined company he stepped down in may just six weeks after the Mojo but remained on the board a few weeks later there was a coup to remove then CEO Bill Harris shortly after that there was another coup to remove Elon Musk who'd replaced Harris a CEO and that was in August while Elon was away on his honeymoon the management team drove over to the square headquarters to plead our case to the board to remove Elon a CEO but manila envelopes assigned resignation letters from the management team to show the board that we were serious I was terrified about what was going to happen I had no idea how it would unfold [Music] Insurrection the Rebellion the coup whatever name you want to associate with it meant that Peter became the CEO of the business around Elon again understandably was immensely upset about this I remember him calling me from Australia obviously deeply upset we did hurt multiple time zones away labeling it all a heinous crime this turnover was all in the span of six months what was interesting was listening to employees one of them actually jokingly said to me sometimes you get to the office and you'd be like oh new CEO today all right no worries I gotta get back to my work right because the change was happening that quickly and that is actually one of the things that's remarkable about this story is just the amount I would say the sort of toughness of some of the people to get through these rapid changes to embrace the fact that immediately after this merger they have a different title they have a different role they don't know where they're going to be and I would say in a lot of cases the people who impress me most were people who just said you know I'm just gonna do what is needed in retrospect I think clear sense for owner versus not would have been would have made it easier for the teams to know who is the final source of authority and so having a clear sense for who sets the direction and who leads the company in every part of its operation in retrospect is a really really important thing for uh for old m a uh encounters for me having clarity about the roles off to the merger having a really good sense of the comparative strengths of individuals in the different companies and probably most importantly and this is always absent doesn't matter how hard you try coming up with a shared identity not separate identities and if there's any lesson to be taken away from this merger it's um to work very hard before you actually combine forces on the identity that together you intend to build that together you intend to own and that together you intend to share [Music] as the two teams struggle to get along the company's losses were out of control we had another big problem Brewing right after the merger the management team started to realize that our fledgling payments businesses now combine into one we're really getting abused by what the term became known as the fraudsters this summer of 2000 was a very scary time at PayPal we knew we had a massive floor problem it wasn't obvious that it was solvable the primary source of fraud that risked our survival at people were so-called unauthorized fraud what this meant was a user who didn't actually have authorization to use a given card would enter that card into PayPal system charge 200 or 300 funnel that money into another account and maybe consolidate it with a bunch of other accounts that they'd use with stolen credit card information withdraw that money and then they'd run off with it so this is just theft and so that was the primary source and the reason this is a very scary type of fraud is it's very scalable you can go to the dark web so to speak and you can purchase stolen credit cards for probably less than a dollar today you can get a million of them and there's a way for you to write a computer program to automatically sign up for accounts on PayPal add credit cards charge them funnel that money into a central account withdraw to a bank account and run off you could make off with millions of dollars and that's exactly what happened to us no one's ever encountered this kind of thing before which leaves the company PayPal in a very precarious position it is being defrauded to the tune of over 10 million dollars a month at one point and it's also not going to be able to raise more money because Venture Capital funding in Silicon Valley has all but dried up in the summer of 2000 the tone of the market changed dramatically cash became hard and then impossible to raise and there was money flying out the door uh because of the cost of fraud get very clear to all of us that if we were to project fraud losses we would be out of cash and out of business basically in a few months and so we sort of went from the problem was addressed it to this is a survival moment and if we don't figure out how to destroy what fraud is doing to us it will destroy us instead how do you find fraud and stem losses to stabilize the business this was PayPal's next Crucible moment and solving it required all hands on deck every engineer was redeployed to fend off the fraudsters there is a photo that an employee shared with me and when you look at the photo there's a kind of uh room it's got a glass window on one side and stacked next to this glass window are a whole bunch of cardboard boxes and then you see something you wouldn't expect which is you see a human being sleeping on top of the cardboard boxes it's Max levchen and he is there catching you know precious hours of sleep or minutes of sleep while he is mid all of these fights he's made the fraud fight he's amid the growth of the company and he is sleeping on top of cardboard boxes in the office look in a startup everybody is always burning the midnight hours and the work intensity of PayPal was immense for the people involved with PayPal that was what they lived and breathed 24 hours a day as PayPal Engineers became increasingly immersed in fighting fraud something strange happened the team at PayPal is actually communicating with its fraudsters one of the people who was creating these fragile accounts on PayPal somehow figure out my email address and it would email me summaries of his takedowns of my latest idea so before we got to uh the final version I would get half a dozen of emails per week from this person somewhere in Eastern Europe saying aha you try to rename form names in HTML and confuse me my scripts are not confused I create 20 000 accounts today so this is sort of menacing emails it would be like a bank executive talking to a bank robber as the robbery is happening uh or or someone breaks into your house and you have a delightful conversation before they steal something from you it's born in part of the background of a group of fraudsters who are based in Russia and the background of the company CTO Max levchen who was born in Ukraine and because Max is able to communicate in the fraudster's native tongue he is sleuthing he is visiting the forums where they spend time and share tips about tradecraft he's in these little chat rooms and kind of picking up Intel about PayPal and what people are saying about this company PayPal finally late one night we had a breakthrough my name is Dave gaussberg and I'm one of the creators of the gaussback love chin test when PayPal was being defrauded in droves one of the kinds of fraud they faced were from computers Bots that were basically creating fake accounts by the hundreds so that they could fleece the company for its bonus payments remember this very very vividly I walked out onto the uh I was in a cubicle right next to dozens of cubicles of our engineering team David gauzbek was sort of sitting down writing code was late on a Friday night and I said we have all these horrible human beings writing scripts to sign up for PayPal I want to make them do a puzzle every time they go for a sign up but I make it too difficult you will slow down the sign ups and it would be bad for user conversion or user signups if you make it too easy you will automate it or the bad guys will automate it and it wouldn't work thinking back to computer vision classes from college the idea that I had one night was well really let's just go for any task not related to our site that is easy for humans and hard for computers and reading text is one of the classic problems for that and I thought well why don't we just stick that into our site gaussberg looked up for his computer and said optical character recognition OCR that's a squiggly name is still very easy to read for human but computers struggle with OCR and those through a holy crap moment my next move actually was to sprint out to Fry's Electronics now sadly departed where I bought every boxed version of OCR software available in the markets to test my squiggly line introduction code to make sure that computers impact could not OCR we figured this will be a new arms race it's not an impossible problem to solve but it makes it a lot harder if you've ever had to look at a series of squiggly letters and retype them to prove that you're a human not a robot you can thank the PayPal team that's the gaspic lifting test now considered one of the earliest uses and first commercial application of capture I stayed up for three days writing code with no sleep trying to uh bring it to the side as quickly as possible there is a 48-hour coding crazy you know caffeine-filled marathon in which David and Max build this technology to defeat these fraudsters and it just sort of happens over a weekend and it is intense and at the very end of it when the technology is deployed a bedraggled Max leptin takes a big speaker and hooks it up to his computer and he turns on Ride of the Valkyries as a celebratory anthem for having developed this technology and defeated the Bots or at least some share of the Bots it had the exact desired effects of the year real-time account creation fell off by 50 which we knew half of the accounts were being created were actually fraudulent the easy automated high volume attacks just instantly shut off and Igor who had been taunting Max and sending these emails about how he would always win and he was smarter than our development team and all of this the moment of uh extreme Triumph for me at the time was when we I got an email from him basically saying Fu and I knew it worked because he couldn't have broken it by that the PayPal team went on to build pattern recognition tools to identify and stop laundering operations we developed a system to verify a user's bank account to make sure the person who is transferring money in or out was really the owner another breakthrough invention Sanjay bhargava who was recruited by Elon to work at x.com who was on a walk with a colleague Todd Pearson they were noodling on this problem of how do you verify and authenticate bank accounts and Sanjay said well what if we give people two deposits and then it's a code it's a four digit code so you would have two transfers into your bank account let's say for 12 and 35 cents and then you'd be asked to enter it back in at the PayPal site you would basically have to type in 1235 kind of similar to the four digit PIN codes people get all the time now with the with SMS verification the person standing next to him while they're on this walk for coffee Todd looks at Sanjay and says you are a genius and they get back to the office and they start building that technology right away the way that David Sachs who is the head of product describes the launch of random deposit he says it's an idea that's like velcro it's so good you wish you would have thought of it yourself it's one of or two of many that we have to come up with in a hurry and without mention go literally hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we had come up with implemented only to find out that they didn't work with the implementation of these tools gradually we saw our efforts to curb fraud payoff each month we lost less and less money to fraud towards the end of 2000 I thought you know we might just make it the bookends of the the miracle measure of fraud at PayPal was we were probably over one percent of old transaction processed were fraudulent which by any measure in any stretch of imagination is a horrific number at the time we went public I think we were the gross margin on each transaction was probably 65-75 basis points or 0.6 percent when I was leaving PayPal fraud numbers were down to about 19 basis points 0.19 and um at the time I thought that was the theoretical minimum we really could not do any better I think one of the more remarkable things about PayPal's fraud fighting techniques and tools is that a lot of those tools are still in wide use 20 years later and almost nobody recognizes where they originated and so you have things like random deposit you have things like capture tests that we use at this point unthinkingly we don't even consider it and those all came about in the effort of this one tiny Silicon Valley startup one of Peter's favorite Expressions is this is an experiment you can only run once but it's very hard to tell whether we could have or should have done anything particularly differently relative to what eventually ended up happening maybe if we had prevented fraud really successfully from Day Zero we wouldn't have been able to grow as quickly and as well as we did and so maybe we're in fact better off having a having gone through this sort of a moment of near death by a thousand paper cuts by by these bad frosters perhaps we could have done better by telling everyone you know what you need to fax us your driver's license and uh you know show up to our office and and log in in person to prove that you're who you say you are really hard to tell I think the general pattern of lean in get bruised but not killed by adversity figure out how to get out of it do it again is a pretty good formula for startups I think it becomes harder and harder to do when you have a lot to lose but we were at the time probably still very close to failure in just all kinds of other ways and the fact that we grew very quickly and we had lots and lots of very happy legitimate consumers pushed us on to invent a way to to remove fraud and bite it uh at the time we were celebrating first survival and then ultimately uh success throughout 2001 PayPal continued to gain momentum and we gained confidence in the quality of our business to give you a sense of our growth we went from roughly 8 million in Revenue in Q4 of 2000 to nearly 50 million one year later while shrinking our fraud loss rate but with this growth came friction with eBay our presence on the site became a bigger and bigger issue a tension at the PayPal EB intersection was that on the one hand PayPal was the most popular fastest growing most convenient way to pay for purchases on eBay on the other hand it was the only part of eBay experience that eBay didn't own they did own a competing product called buildpoint which they thought should have killed PayPal and made it or at least made it irrelevant a very long time ago and yet somehow they failed to do so and so as told from their side or their point of view PayPal was throwing a party in their backyard and charging attendance and not paying any rent for it and so we were told by their execs time and time again that hey this will not stand will eventually build something that competes with you and make you irrelevant over the course of three years eBay does everything in its power to gum up the works for PayPal and PayPal does everything in its power to stay alive on eBay because it's the place that's providing at that point you know sometimes upwards of 90 percent of its transaction volume eBay would go out of their way to do changes to code on eBay's website that would make elements of PayPal stop working and it would send the PayPal team into these kind of like peroxisms of like action and anger we knew that eBay had pulled together a war room and that they were trying to figure out how to beat PayPal they were desperately trying to figure out how to make their own payment system work I mean it's completely rational for them to do that and at some point they maybe would get it right and if they did get it right two-thirds of our business was at risk they would send legal notices they would send menacing emails they would do code insertions they would often just cut PayPal out of key product upgrades there was this kind of sense that there was this big looming existential threat which was the decision at any moment by eBay to shut PayPal down David sacks had this phrase which is you know we went to work every day feeling as though the sort of Damocles was hanging over our head and it was a very very stressful uh life for us throughout the time of these sort of uh eBay Wars their management team would approaches and say look ultimately you guys understand that we have to come together you are an essential piece of our puzzle you also just don't really exist without us we are your largest payment platform source to somewhere somehow we're going to merge we're going to be one company we had multiple conversations with eBay which were you know conducted with both a carrot and a stick and the carrot being some sort of acquisition offer the stick being all sorts of threats about how difficult they were going to make it for PayPal as a standalone company how Meg Whitman was going to ensure that the company PayPal was never ever going to be able to be a public company because she'd be sure that eBay was writ large in the risk section of the prospectus and she would ensure that we couldn't become a public company and you know this went on and I I like Mega and admire her but you know it's the typical big company posturing trying to bully and intimidate a small company they would come in and say look we think we should buy you here's a number and the number would inevitably be something that we thought we were worth a year ago and so it was always always perceived as a uh kind of insultingly low offer we passed on eBay's offers and meanwhile despite mixed threads began to look towards an IPO there were a few reasons for this going public would provide access to Capital it would legitimize the company and it would offer us a clear independent Market valuation in September 2001 we filed to go public that Christmas just weeks away from our IPO eBay once again complicated things so eBay came in and said hey here's one final offer we'll never do any better than this you guys should not go public you should sell to us eBay's offer was close to a billion dollars their previous offers hadn't been anywhere close to this nothing high enough for us to even consider but this one caught our attention its attractiveness put us at a Crossroads squarely in the middle of a crucible moment should we take the offer and end the battle with eBay or should we bet on the company's ability to stand solo and go public [Music] so every time eBay made an offer one of my kind of standard operating procedures was to sit down with a senior management team and basically say hey these guys are here there's a stack of money on the table are you prepared to continue fighting or would you like to sort of punch out and cash in the four years of Blood Sweat and Tears and every single time the team basically said now let's keep fighting like we we can we can keep doing this this is actually you know some sort of a painful fun that we're all going through here certainly wore the team down in a fairly meaningful way there was a pretty vigorous back and forth a debate among team leadership about what the right thing was to do to some extent we as a young team uh left the prospect of being able to take a company public you know how many times in your life do you get to be part of building a business from scratch and successfully seeing it through to an IPO and so there was something alluring about that but we also felt a sense of responsibility to our team because you don't go public for vanity reasons you want to do it because you're a steward of the business and you look after the financial interest of all your shareholders and all the employees Peter had this fantastic phrase which was uh just because somebody shooting at you and they don't succeed in hitting you doesn't mean that you're Bulletproof it may just mean that they're poor shot but if they can keep shooting at some point even a stray bullet can do serious damage Peter was very inclined to make the sale I did not want to do that and I think you know if Sequoia can claim a contribution to PayPal it's that we were able to put off and postpone the sail through as as long as possible PayPal bet on itself we turned on eBay's acquisition offer and went public in February of 2002. there were some who took eBay at its word that its acquisition offered just before we decided to IPO was its last and that our battle with them would drag on certainly PayPal going public didn't stop eBay from continuing to make our lives miserable but then in the summer of 2002 over the July 4th weekend eBay approached us yet again I remember one weekend afternoon where Peter and I were invited down to Meg's home in Atherton and we sat in her kitchen and she was negotiating with us this time the offer was 1.5 billion now it's easy for these numbers to seem small as we're surrounded by today's Tech valuations but take yourself back 20 years in 2002 we didn't have Broadband in America the majority of people on the internet were on dialab smartphones didn't exist the total number of people on the planet that had access to the internet was about 250 million not the 4 billion we have today this was a tremendous outcome because the company PayPal was public it was a lot easier for them to understand what the market perceived to be the value of the company and so as a result there was no longer this tense and 10 years conversation about price it was just a matter of all the public markets are valuing you at X here's what we want to do and you can decide whether it makes sense to you or not again we sat down to think things through part of this was taking stock of our team and our stamina and thinking long and hard about what we wanted our future to be and so right after we went public I had the same conversation with my team and they basically said look we're very tired but we'll keep fighting and then I once again sat down with the management team and said hey this is a moment to decide what enters into the conversation is they feel as though they are simply fighting for their survival and they are not creating new things anymore that it gets a little tiresome after a while to Simply have to try to stay alive to like work all night just so eBay doesn't shut you down the team is simply exhausted we've checked the checkbox of you know initial public offering we're now a real grown-up company we can keep doing this independently or we can accept the fact that we are ultimately an important tool within eBay and they are a huge percentage of our ecosystem I had disagreements all the way up to the eventual um sale of the business I thought it was I thought we had a huge opportunity ahead of us they were going to lose control of their Destiny they were going to be very frustrated you can live until you're 120 and you will never see a business opportunity like PayPal and I was right [Music] we formally announced the acquisition on Monday morning right after the weekend and the final acquisition offer was at a 1.5 billion acquisition price and the acquisition finally closed in October 2002. it was bittersweet it was a victory but it was also being bought by the enemy it was definitely a step away from being this cohesive team in a smaller office and it felt like leaving part of PayPal's history behind [Music] it was very hard to suddenly switch Legions to this new owner of the business Peter left Reed Hoffman left David Sachs left and so max and I were probably two the last senior management team members left at the company and and we sort of lost the cohesion that we had as a management team and we're starting to wonder about what we might do next and at that point Michael Moritz from Sequoia called and asked whether I'd consider a role at Sequoia I stayed on through the first earnings release for PayPal in early 2003 and at that point I joined Sequoia you know I think ultimately Acquisitions are one of three things they're either exits or maybe put more bluntly rescues and a lot of companies don't want to admit it to themselves but they are in need of a rescue I'm I'm internally familiar with the the hard choice of saying I thought this was going to the moon but it looks like it will probably uh tap out just here on Earth the other Morse or happier side of M A is kind of a one plus one equals five type situations where you really have something and someone else has another building block to what you're creating one enables the other and there's a whole sort of a very large component in between where you've lost your way and you don't know what happens next and it's not you don't need to uh you don't need to die but uh you you can't quite figure out how to live sort of a Thing If a company was a human and I think those are the hardest ones there's been a great deal written about what's known as the PayPal Mafia but maybe what's more appropriately referred to as the PayPal alumni group and a bridge list is almost hard to do but if you were looking at the creation of YouTube Yelp Tesla SpaceX palantir affirm the first money into Facebook some of the earliest money into every social network you know all of it traces back to this tiny startup that was created in late 1998 and is sold to eBay in 2002. there's always a question of nature versus nurture was it just that this company attracted really really remarkable people who would have went on to build YouTube anyway or did they take something from their experience at PayPal that helped them build build YouTube you know or Yelp or any of the Yammer or palantir Etc and I think the honest answer is a bit of both they also went through a series of experiences building a startup during one of the hardest times I think in Silicon Valley history to ever build a startup and you couldn't help but be imprinted by those lessons if you were working there at that time when they started their respective companies Yelp YouTube some of the others LinkedIn they understood they had already had experience in a setting where they had lived first hand with the challenges complexities opportunities risks and excitement of uh building a very high growth successful business and one of the lessons from my people experiences uh not underestimating what can happen in the long run one of the things we talk about at Sequoia is what is possible what is the imagination and honestly when I think about my biggest mistakes in my professional career it's been a failure of imagination and to see how PayPal flourished in the long run and how successful it's been as somebody who is Young and and didn't have that much experience I didn't fully appreciate the company's potential there's a famous adage known as Amara's law which states that we tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run living to look at new technologies whether it's the internet Cloud mobile AI through the lens of Amara's law is part of being a successful founder or investor in 2015 PayPal

Title: Airbnb ft Brian Chesky - Battling a Copycat Clone and Rebuilding User Trust to Revolutionize Travel
Published: 2023-09-07 21:18:12 UTC
Description:
As Airbnb took off in the early 2010s, Brian Chesky remembers worrying, “this is just one accident away from being a dead idea.” 

That accident finally came in 2011 when a host’s apartment was ransacked. It set off a period of soul searching that became a turning point—the company’s efforts to rebuild trust led it to becoming the global behemoth it is today. In this episode, Brian reveals how this crisis shaped his thinking, and how the lessons would apply to the company’s next defining moments, including a pandemic that shut down global travel.

[Music] it's 2011 I summoned the meeting together and I say This Is War in a war between missionaries and mercenaries the missionaries always win and we are going to win because we care more about this and then we're going to outlast them but make no mistake this is Do or Die it was literally like we're on a mission and we weren't gonna lose [Music] welcome to Crucible moments about the critical Crossroads and inflection points that shaped some of the world's most remarkable companies I'm your host and the managing partner of Sequoia capital of Twitter Airbnb was founded in 2008 by Nathan the transit Joe gabia and Brian chesky who you will hear from today their Vision was a different type of travel experience at the time it was unheard of strangers staying with strangers I distinctly remember meeting the founders at the Sequoia office in early 2009 when the company was still called air bed and breakfast it was a three-person seed Stage Company with a Bare Bones product and nascent adoption just five thousand dollars a week in Revenue but what they had was a bold dream the team articulated a completely novel approach to travel the idea was unorthodox but compelling and we were able to dream with the founders and could imagine how successful the company would be within weeks of our first meeting we had closed the seat financing to become their long-term business partner it's hard to imagine a world without Airbnb today but the company's Journey included perilous moments in today's episode we'll look at how Airbnb built and then rebuilt user trust launched the war against a copycat clone and led its Community through a global shutdown that brought travel the company's Foundation to a halt my name is Brian chesky I'm the founder and CEO of Airbnb the story of Airbnb kinda begins well before Airbnb it begins a little over 20 years ago I went to the Rhode Island School design not knowing what I wanted to do it never occurred to me to be an entrepreneur like the only entrepreneur I knew was like Bob from Bob's Pizza growing up so I didn't really think about that I want to be an artist so I graduate RISD I get a job in Los Angeles manufacturing like products for a small industrial design firm in one day I'm in LA and I I have this image like my life is like I'm in a car and the road in front of me looks exactly like the road behind me and I said this is not my life I love design but I'm not meant to be a designer I think I'm meant to be an entrepreneur and one day I get a package of the mail that changes my life it was a seat cushion that was designed by my friend at RISD Joe gebia and he was living in San Francisco and he made this product and it was successful I always thought it was successful because he made it he manufactured it and he sold it and to me wow you had an idea and that idea was real you made something that is success and I want to do that too and Joe said come to San Francisco so I go to work I quit my job with no savings with no plan except I'm gonna come to San Francisco and live at Joe when I learned how expensive it is to live in San Francisco the rent was one thousand one hundred fifty dollars and I don't have enough money to pay rent well it turns out that weekend an international design conference was coming to San Francisco and all the hotels that were recommended in the conference website were sold out and we had an idea we said well what if we just turned our house into a bed and breakfast for the conference we can meet some cool designers get paid they can have a local Guide to the city but there's a problem and the problem is like we didn't really have beds we just moved there and Joe had a bed I was literally sleeping on a foam mattress and Joe said well no worries I have a bunch of air beds in my closet so he pulled the airbeds out of the closet we inflated them we said there's not a bed and breakfast this is an air bed and breakfast it's going to be cheaper than a bed and breakfast and we built the website in like three days it was just Joe and I basic HTML and we launched it and I didn't know what kind of people would stay with us but three people ended up booking with us and something really cool happened we made enough money to pay our rent something even better than that happened though is three people lived with us for a week and here's the thing when three strangers come and they stay with you for a week it's like you take a multi-year relationship and you can press it to a matter of few days right you get to know somebody when they live with you and you spend all day with them like it would take like months and months and months to get to know them if you worked with them right and so we actually end up becoming friends and I kept in touch with them and so we were waving them goodbye and I remember Joe and I look at each other and we're like you know what we're ordinary guys I bet you there's other Ordinary People Like Us people that want to make some extra money meeting cool people I think that we felt all like if people could experience what we experienced that first weekend when the three guests stay with us that this would be an idea that would spread around the world I remember telling people this idea the first person this idea he said he looks at me says Brian I said yes he said I hope that's not the only idea you're working on and that was like the nicest thing that some people said to me you know in other words the idea seemed crazy you mean to say that strangers are going to stay with other strangers laughs remember this was back in 2008 before Uber doordash instacart before the sharing economy was a Mainstay of our lives today we don't think twice about getting into an Uber but back then the idea of sharing a space with a stranger sounded kind of weird getting people to seriously consider Airbnb to trust Brian and his co-founder's idea enough to use it was the company's first Crucible moment the company's existence hinged on it how do you unlock user trust I think we thought of it as a design problem how do you design something for people to kind of virtually get to know people well enough to be able to trust each other to give each other access and I think we just you know we just looked at like a number of things that were converging Facebook is rising at the time social networking that was an ERA where people had profiles so it could seemed kind of obvious that if you want every measured out profiles PayPal was rising and increasingly people could pay each other online and then Yelp was very popular and people were used to rating things five star and and they're also used to like telling a story with a review it wasn't just a five star but they would leave an actual review and write and messaging platforms were becoming more robust people were used to messaging each other online and then customer service I don't think we invented any one of those things but I think we just were able to combine them all together over the years they developed faster and better ways of creating Trust hi I'm Alfred Lin I'm a partner at Sequoia Capital previously I was the chief operating officer at Zappos where we were known for being customer obsessed and so when I joined the board at Airbnb I started helping the team think through how to deliver the best customer experience possible when you bought an iPhone Steve Jobs didn't come and sleep on your couch but I did I literally lived with our users we took photographs of their homes we did meetups we built the community one block at a time and by having first-hand instincts we were able to bring those back design a better product give it to Nate and really refine a perfect experience whether it's ratings on the guests and the host comments on how well a guest behaved how well hosts provided where to go because they knew the local places to go as opposed to the things that every single tourist goes to and so Airbnb has always developed trust in a much more organic and authentic Way by helping their guests live like a local I think in any com business and Marketplace business trust is Paramount it's very very hard to build and it's very very easy to lose it there are cruisable moments that arrive suddenly that demand and immediate solution and once that solution is executed the puzzle is solved other Crucible moments feel slow at first and then a simmering tension suddenly erupts the park is growing growing growing but in the background there's this limbering question like this is just one accident away from being a dead idea but everyone asked what happens when something horrible happens what happens with someone's home is totally ransacked and that happened in 2011. a host in San Francisco named EJ reported that somebody stayed in her home and ransacked it and it became viral suddenly there was this massive essentially online pile on in fact we got one of the first hashtag Gates you know like those like it was called ransackgate and ransack gate was trending on Twitter and then that trend on Twitter for a few days until it was replaced by another hashtag hashtag rip Airbnb and people were literally predicting our demise and I I don't blame them for having questions we didn't initially have a great answer to like what happens if somebody's home gets trashed there was a wake-up call of course something like this could happen at any given point in time it just had never happened and there was an element of shock how could this have happened well it's just going to happen it's a situation where you can't avoid something bad happening what you can decide to do is how you're going to respond we initially put our response it was a very inadequate response people felt like we like just weren't owning up to the fact that there was a fundamental weakness the model and so there was this huge pile on it was a crisis of confidence oh and by the way why did why was this like such a big viral moment well not weeks before we were announced to be a billion dollar company and so suddenly people expected us to be like a large multinational corporation but we were still basically operating out of a three-bedroom apartment or we had been not long before that so we basically worked around the clock and we knew this is a Do or Die moment Airbnb began with a crucible moment how do you unlock user trust now the company had arrived at another Crossroads when you lose user trust how do you rebuild it I did two things that has guided me ever since in every crisis in every Crucible moment the first is I decided to not make business decisions but to make a principal decision and things seemed honestly so desperate at the time that people are predicting we go out of business and I thought that was crazy but I didn't know and I thought how do I want to be remembered regardless of if I can predict the outcome because I can't possibly know how to get out of this so what's the right thing to do and I think the classic advice was like don't accept responsibility don't apologize you open yourself up to liability and I said screw that what I really want to say is I'm sorry I feel horrible what happened in This Woman's home and I'm wearing an open letter and I'm gonna apologize or we're going to take responsibility and we're going to try to make things right and the second thing I want to do is I want to use this opportunity to ship something that restores confidence and we had this idea we had this idea to create an Airbnb guarantee against theft or property damage and the original Airbnb guarantee was going to be a five thousand dollar guarantee for all damage for all homes globally and even crazier than that we decided to make it retroactive so anyone who's ever had any damage could come forward as long as he had any evidence whatsoever you can come forward and we would retroactively reimburse you for the damage and I partly did this to restore confidence because if everyone's home was constantly being damaged we'd be bankrupt and I was betting that there weren't that many incidents on Airbnb and I wanted to use this to prove it and we had this five thousand dollar guarantee and it was like July I think still 2011 and Mark Andreessen had just LED our investor around he came into the office and he read my letter and he actually recommended one edit and I said what's the edit and he added a zero at the end of five thousand and he changes to fifty thousand and I'm like oh my God this seems completely crazy but you're the one that wrote us a check so I hope you and other investors will give me money but we end up changing the 50 000 guarantee we also established a 24 7 trust and safety line and a few other upgrades and I wrote this open letter I published it and not only did it restore confidence but it actually became one of the biggest growth drivers we've ever had I don't know what is causality versus correlation but certainly we never looked back I think confidence was restored the product was better for it we try to do our best to make things right with EJ I always thought the crisis is a terrible opportunity to waste and ever since then whenever I had a crisis I've asked myself number one what's the principal decision what's the right thing to do number two in a crisis more people are paying attention ever so it's an opportunity for you to demonstrate what you stand for your values a crisis is a great forcing function to be bold to do things you wouldn't have otherwise done in normal times it was a defining moment because the company woke up and grew up in a very fast way to knowing that how they respond in a crisis in a crucible moment is what defines them and one of the things that Airbnb does really well is always to find a solution to these problems by being empathetic to the customer whether it's the guest or their host and to really think from their point of view how would we best protect the guests how do we best protect the host in situations that you don't anticipate [Music] as Airbnb Rose in popularity they came the question what's next how should Airbnb expand where do you go from here a lot of people like to Reason by analogy and it's very easy to look at Airbnb and the analogy would be an online travel booking site an OTA and then you should just accept whatever inventory that can make you money I think there was a temptation to say well the natural instinctist expand to hotels but I think that we had a really good Insight early on to focus on a differentiated product to like really hone in on a niche category but beyond our business rationale like listen I'm in my 20s and I'm like I'm not dedicating the rest of my life to building a hotel booking site like there's something magical about people staying with each other and that's we want to focus on and we don't want to divert our Focus I like to ask entrepreneurs like why do you deserve to exist and the best generic I answer I've ever heard is because if I don't do it no one else will and if your answer to questions if I don't do what someone else will then then that's a less compelling answer and so I felt like if we don't do this concept no one else will and for a while that was true and then one day someone else copied us here's how it happened I want to take you back to 2011. the fastest growing company ever up to that point supposedly was a company called Groupon overnight they went from zero to a billion hours in Revenue they were the hottest company in Tech and then this company called City deal clone them and created a European version of them and the Groupon ended up having to buy that company and City Deals was created by these brothers called the samware brothers I remember I was meeting with these investors and they basically told me the major thing you need to worry about is if these brothers discover you because they can rebuild your business overnight and so I thought oh my God as long as these two brothers don't call on us we're probably fine one day we like to notice we're getting all this scraping data and like a lot of weird messages are being sent to our hosts to list on this site called whim do and we're like what's Wim do and we learned that whimdoo is a clone of Airbnb based in Europe out of Berlin and it's created by the sandwich Brothers every time we change a pixel or change anything on our website when do would change there is to basically mirror our website they would be contacting our hosts placing bookings on Airbnb just to go there and recruit the host to list on one do it's quite a fascinating situation on a copycatel competitor that was trying to beat Airbnb but doing it in ways that were very competitive on day one all of a sudden I felt like we had a gun to our head and this company overnight raises apparent of supposedly a hundred million dollars and they hire like 400 people in 30 days they set up all these International offices and they said we're going to be the international Airbnb we're going to be the Airbnb of Europe and this was a huge problem for us if you're Airbnb and you're not in Europe and you're a travel company but you can't travel to Europe that's like not a very interesting product Airbnb not being International is like your phone not having email it's just not useful and then sure enough I get an overture from the samber brothers to meet Oliver Sam were inviting me and my co-founders and a partner from Sequoia to Berlin by the way this was Greg McAdoo a former Sequoia partner who initially sourced Airbnb and he traveled to Berlin with Brian Joe and Nate to meet wimdu in 2011. and so we fly to Berlin and the office is in like a former Factory the factories converted to a tech office but honestly it still looked like a factory it was literally like an assembly line maybe a sweatshop when I say Sweatshop like people were literally sweating in there like there was no air conditioning there's hundreds of people sitting elbow to elbow and many of the people have two monitors up on the left monitor is airbnb's website and the right monitor is whimdoo and literally there are designers and Engineers cloning the site like an assembly line cloning the product in front of us and all of our families like you are the Americans you are the innovators but we are the executors and he said we are going to copy you we're gonna clone you we're gonna out execute you he was very straightforward he's like this is exactly what we're doing the somewhere Brothers effectively gave Airbnb an ultimatum by us or else it was a crucible moment where Brian and his team had to decide in the face of a company shamelessly cloning your product do you buy them or do you fight back it was a struggle to sort of think about this company that is trying to copy Airbnb in a different region of the world should we just buy them because they have traction another geography and maybe we should allow them to continue to grow there and make them part of Airbnb or do we compete with them and conduct a ground war I thought there's no way we buy them and we win because even if we do win it's never going to be Airbnb again it's going to be a different culture it's not going to have the same spirit and we're going to bring in like a mercenary mentality to an otherwise mission-oriented company where people suddenly like it would just be a culture clash and it's not going to go well and I just didn't think they really cared at all about the experience they didn't care about design they didn't care about connection all the things we talk about and I said well that is not a culture fit and if one of my goal was to flip the company then this probably would have made sense but I'm 41 now and at the time I thought I'd be still doing this in my 40s and I said I need to make really really long-term decisions and I thought the best revenge against the Clone isn't to beat them it's just to make them run the company Long Term you had the baby you raised the baby I'm not adopting your baby you raise the baby and I thought there's no way they're going to raise this baby for 18 years that incompatibility in both Mission and culture was ultimately the reason why we just didn't think a merger would work it's 2011 I summoned the meeting together and I say This Is War in a war between missionaries and mercenaries the missionaries always win and we are going to win because we care more about this in them we're going to outlast them but make no mistake this is do or die and I felt like I went from like a CEO to like uh I don't know I don't want to say General but like there was a very it was a Do or Die situation from business perspective so I was like all right I'm gonna lead from the front and I decided to like basically be the head of international and I worked to build a team I assembled a few leaders and they very quickly mobilize and we hired like over a dozen country managers a country manager of like you know UK and Germany and France and Spain in Italy and I think we um had one in Brazil Korea and Japan so there were a few others so probably about a dozen country managers really mobilize we worked harder than we ever have before it was literally early like we're on a mission and we weren't gonna lose the efforts we made were Fast and Furious and Ryan was very very focused on how do we sign up a lot of Supply how do we get hosts to become unproductive as quickly as possible how do we make products and services to get them to be great hosts there was a lot of meetups he was traveling alone he was going all over Europe to host many of the meetups he also had to talk to a variety of government officials because some various government officials thought that Airbnb was a crazy idea but that wasn't new to him people thought Fairview was a crazy idea from the beginning you know I think we did a really good job localizing Airbnb that was really critical it's probably the biggest Roi thing we ever did and then we created a Playbook a country by country Playbook and I think we did it actually before Uber and others and then we became like the model that other companies then built off of but we get a country manager I would interview the manager I would then go to the team we'd create a whole like Airbnb and box kit they would build out a local operation we create all the different guidelines for them then we'd I'd go to the market we'd do a big launch we did like a bunch of press interviews we do a giant Community Meetup we'd work with a team get them like all rally to mobilize and we go and we never look back and it was essentially like an all-out War for like a couple years probably and predictably they were able to stick with us for a little bit but exactly what I thought was going to happen happen when do hung on for seven years but in the fall of 2018 they finally capitulated as Brian predicted the missionaries prevailed they never had an intention in hindsight to build a long-term company they built this company to sell it and ultimately became a marathon and didn't want to keep racing one sign of success to me from Airbnb through this critical moment with Windu is you know in some sense this was known to be the harder path and in retrospect they made it look easy I don't think it was actually easy at any given point in time when they were going through the motions of trying to sign up as many listings as possible in Europe but slowly but surely a company that was based in San Francisco most of its businesses in the United States ended up in a situation where a majority of the business was actually coming from Europe and bookings in Europe and I was a very proud moment when we sort of woke up one day and realized we had a really thriving business in Europe and the numbers proved out our convictions to the hard thing so I think the success from that and the learning from that is you don't necessarily take the easy route you want to take the hardware out because when you solve a hard problem you get rewarded foreign if you think about the story we have this crazy idea originally people think it's implausible strangers never say they're strangers it works it takes off we don't buy this company and now we're the psych global company and we were one of the hottest companies of 2010s you probably think of us and Uber and a few others um and so by 2019 we were preparing to go public and we were a 30 31 billion dollar company but I remember it was late 2019 and I had some other creeping feeling that was bothering me and I ended up going on a hike in Bolinas California in late 2019 with Joe and a and I told them about this and they said what do you mean I said well the company's successful but it's not exactly the company I intended for us to build and they said what do you mean I said well growth is slowing cost is rising it's like super hard to get work done there was a lot of bureaucracy we were doing a billion dollars of marketing like pretty soulless like Performance Marketing we were increasingly focusing more and more energy on like hotels and property managers and things that weren't Central to the original idea of Airbnb with the company's massive growth the team strayed from its focus on the original Mission of building connection between guests and local hosts I knew some big changes needed to happen but I didn't quite know how to change them because we're about to go public and I'm like oh my God what do we do so I come back New Year's day after New Year's 2020 and I meet with the executive team and I say I know we're about to go public but I think we need to make some changes but I don't quite know how and I know this seems like a really bad time and we didn't quite know exactly what to do and all of a sudden the pandemic hits and within eight weeks we lose 80 percent of our business I recall that first day staying at home looking at the daily metrics and seeing that you know we had a real problem on our hands my name is Ellie Wertz I'm a vice president of Finance at Airbnb it was not just that the business had slowed but it was that bookings had really evaporated overnight and our guests were canceling at at really unprecedented levels which meant there was a massive sucking out of the business in terms of overall cash flow when you are our size and you lose tens of billions of dollars of business in eight weeks it's like you're an 18-wheeler and you slam in the brakes nothing good happens I felt like I was the captain of a ship and it was just torpedoed and there was a hole in the ship we went from the hottest IPO of 2020 to within eight weeks people predicting the demise of Airbnb these are actual headlines is this the end of Airbnb will Airbnb exist can Brian chesky save Airbnb Crucible moment number three the covid-19 pandemic this Crucible moment is one of the best stories that I've been part of in my career because I had a front row seat to how you deal with a crisis and the reason I say that is because this is not just an ordinary crisis this is a once in a generation once in a century pandemic that is no doubt gonna affect a travel industry way more than almost any other business that you can think of people stop traveling so what do you do then I remember a quote by Andy Grove he said bad companies are destroyed by a crisis good companies survive a crisis but great companies are defined by a crisis and I said we will be defined by this crisis because we're going to become a great company this is a crisis that we will not waste we put the IPO on hold and we have to make a ton of difficult decisions it was a all hands on deck moment to figure out what is most important at this moment and what do we need to move on most quickly in a matter of weeks we had put together a set of various forecasting scenarios to understand not necessarily what was the best bet in terms of what would happen to the business but more so to understand the variables in the range of scenarios that could occur so that we could plan for the worse Brian is has described the period of as everyone being in a foxhole together and I think that's actually a great analogy the first thing we did is we pause all marketing 100 overnight next I basically started immediately cutting costs we reduced the pay of all the executives we punted a lot of key projects I studied Apple when Steve came back to Apple he reduced the product line he went back to a functional organization that's we did reduced the product line we went back to a functional organization you know we had to do a layoff we were one of the first big layoffs in Silicon Valley we cut 25 employees it was the hardest thing I ever did we had over a billion dollars worth of reservation requests that came in for guests that wanted to cancel their trips but they couldn't get a refund because of their cancellation policy and the hosts were really hoping to get paid in a two-sided marketplace with guests on one side and hosts on the other Airbnb faced existential Financial Risk the hosts are thinking I'm not going to get any more revenue for a period of time because all of travel is shut down and the guest is like well I don't know what's going to happen maybe I'm going to lose my job because of the pandemic and I have to take care of family members I need that money back there's about three or four billion dollars of customer deposits where both sides are claiming that they were owed that money and so a real tension of who do you favor guest versus host and based on on the principle that Brian was very clear with from the onset of the pandemic we really wanted to balance these different stakeholders to try to do the best we could by all of them we made a decision to override our host cancellation policies and refund a billion dollars of reservations but this really upset our host you know they were really hurting financially the biggest Crucible moment that in my opinion that we had to solve was that because in a Marketplace if you choose one side or the other even if you come out of it the other side is going to be annoyed at you for not taking their side the company didn't need more capital for its own internal operations they needed to raise Capital so they can guarantee both sides and that was the reason why Airbnb decided to raise money we move very quickly so over the course of I would say two weeks we explored a variety of different options in the form of you know straight Equity a convertible or debt we ended up raising two billion dollars of straight dad and the interest rate was really high because nobody really understanding how to price risk back then so the interest rate was like 10 percent again retrospect the cost of that Capital seems extremely high but if we walk back to that moment when we're facing insolvency and we don't know what the world it will look like going forward the cost of that Capital was effectually you know the cost of of solvency and so quite quite a good deal in in retrospect in terms of Shoring up the balance sheet and allowing us the freedom to navigate the rest of the pandemic [Music] the two billion dollars in straight dates allowed Airbnb to pay its hosts what they were owed and protect its Community as a whole we got to mid-may and there was a moment of respite and we started to look at the numbers and something crazy happens it's Memorial Day weekend we start seeing that people are actually booking airbnbs again and they're not going to cities they're not Crossing Borders but they're getting in cars and they're driving like a tank of gas away because they've been Sheltering a place to other homes where they're living and then suddenly this like domestic business of larger homes booms in these small towns vacation rental communities in rural areas and all of a sudden we have this rebound we pivot the entire company to provide housing in non-urban areas to provide longer stays pretty soon nearly a quarter of our nights booked were for stays of a month or longer we realized this business is much more adaptable and resilient than even we would have anticipated which led to the the secondary thought which was maybe maybe that IPO isn't permanently on pause so suddenly it's now the summer 2020 and something miraculous happens the bankers that told me that you don't need to think about the S1 anymore now they're like yeah maybe we should dust the S1 off there may be a window to go public and now here's the problem we basically were like tired and exhausted we had to rebuild the company and now we need to prepare for an IPO oh and by the way the S1 we wrote it's basically like we have to rewrite it almost from scratch because it described a business that basically didn't exist anymore and I wasn't honestly that involved in the original writing of the S1 but the new muscle was now I'm involved in every detail because that's the way I got out of the crisis and me and the team were involved in every detail I wrote 14 000 words of the S1 myself 14 000 words I remember asking for Morgan Stanley when's the last time somebody was this involved I think Michael Grimes said it was like decades ago I'm not sure that was a compliment or a warning to me but it was unusual and there hadn't been any Zoom IPOs so we didn't even know if that was a good idea so in the midst of a crisis a travel company in the middle of pandemic was going to go public on Zoom having had to rewrite the S1 and basically like eight to ten weeks from scratch and all the risk factors and half them had changed and the whole premise of the company had kind of changed a little bit and so we prepare to go public and in the beginning of the Road show the initial indications are fairly tepid because there's this narrative that Airbnb was going out of business and the narrative was outdated and we started showing some of the data the rebound the recovery and I basically told the story that Airbnb was born in an inflection point of the world you know the Great Recession mobile social we're all kind of converging and I said this is another inflection point the post-pandemic world Airbnb went public via zoom on December 10 2020. if you think about kind of our expectations for that day um they were pretty low we had priced the the IPO on the initial public filing at I believe 44 to 50 which was already almost double what we had priced warrants at at the time of um the financings back in March and so we thought we were doing quite well in terms of how this might perform and yet as we we sat on that kind of morning opening trade then we saw the first trade across the wire I think the entire call was was dumbfounded to see a stock that a mere eight months previously would have been liquid at say 20 a share across that first trade at over 140 dollars a company that people thought was going out of business is now a hundred billion dollars it was one of the most surreal moments of my life I got interviewed on Bloomberg I was informed live by Emily Chang and Bloomberg the company's value in moments had doubled from 50 to 100 billion they caught me on camera my eyebrows went to like the back of my head I couldn't believe it and it was like the whole crisis flashed before my eyes and I thought oh my God how do we get here this is like the most unbelievable journey and it felt like the ultimate Vindication that we had actually succeeded it was honestly about anyone's you know wildest expectations and quite quite surreal for all of us who had had dealt with you know the collapse and and the recovery it really was the kind of the moment of and looking at the top of the mountain in terms of all that had been accomplished in a in a very small amount of time and candidly a huge amount of gratitude towards our hosting guests who had you know come back on the journey with us and so over the last couple years we've done our very best to grow into that valuation and I think that hopefully the results now speak for itself when I think about the role of the pandemic crisis on airbnb's business we are a fundamentally different and better business today because of that crisis and you know the lessons there were you know act quickly be decisive consider your stakeholders and play the long game and you know where we are today we are leaner we are more focused and we haven't forgotten the pain that was the forcing function for all the changes that ultimately made us stronger since we went public we've made more than 340 upgrades Innovations to the product it went from a break-even business to generating we're a unicorn by cash flow three and a half times over and I'm pretty I'm pretty proud of that and we are just relentlessly obsessed with creating the most magical experiences bringing people together I I think that people need travel and connection with other people more than ever before because the office is now Zoom the mall is now Amazon the theater is now Netflix and I think travel is increasingly becoming the way that people see their friends they reunite with others they meet people and that's what I want to do I don't just want to be in the business of travel I want to be in the business of getting back to that idea of air maybe that original idea of bringing people together and reminding people that the other is not so other that people are 99 the same and we can make this world a little bit smaller and we can do it by designing not just products but ways for people around the world to connect with one another and that is going to keep me busy for decades to come [Music] this has been Crucible moments a podcast from Sequoia
