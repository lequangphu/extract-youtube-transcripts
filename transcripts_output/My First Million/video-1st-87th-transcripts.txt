Do you know what the most viewed YouTube channel is? The obvious answer would be Mr. Beast. Mr. Beast. Number 13. Why are we talking about number 13? I'm talking about number one. I don't. Coco Melon. Coco Melon. Yeah. What happens is there's this guy Renee. He said of the top 100 most viewed children's bands online. None of them were owned by big studios. They raised about $150 million. They go and they buy Coco Melon for $103 million, 70 million on Blippy, and then Little Baby Bum was the third big one that they bought. And they did that for 65 million. And so they raised about 400 million in total equity and debt to create the 3 billion exit. So like a 10x return roughly on the capital that they used to buy these channels. And the founders of this thing, Renee makes 300 million for this four years of work. His co-founder makes 300 million. The head of M&A made60 million. And the CFO made like 20 or $30 million.

You're not afraid to share ideas. Uh, no. I'm super afraid to share ideas. Um, but that's I mean one of my ideas that I'm actively exploring and here I am sharing it with everyone here. [Music] We should uh address the elephant in the room. Why are we on Why are we on a plane? So, we're just flexing on everybody now. This is my Tai Lopez. Hey guys, I'm just on my jet. Uh, so it's not that. Yeah. So, this plane, it's a citation CJ3+ and I fly planes for fun. So, it's been my passion and my hobby. I think since even elementary school, I was obsessed with airplanes. And um it was always my goal to be able to afford to fly one. And and then I learned I I interviewed a bunch of very wealthy people and I said, "How do you afford an airplane? Like, how successful do you have to be?" And the secret was you don't have to be that successful. You just have to have a big tax bill and good cash flow and so which takes success to get to that point but it takes some success but less than you think a lot less than you think actually um because it's like a house you could finance it get you know put 20% down and then you know the the rest is we'll walk through that in a second. So the the funny thing was we did an episode a normal episode where we're on Zoom and it was great. Uh you can go see it. It's called like Jessa like high school dropout you know blah blah. We we we YouTub you YouTubed it to to make the title good, but like you know I don't know 300 400,000 people have have listened to that interview across all the platforms and I wanted to do a second one and you were like hey I'm in town if you can kind of meet me here. I was like all right let's go I'll meet you there. And the second thing is you're actually great with tax hacks and you're better than my accountant who I pay I pay this guy to be like hey come up with ideas that I can lower my tax bill legally but how can I do it? What are the ideas? And he's idea poor. You're very idea rich. So, I thought, okay, it's kind of fitting because one of the things we'll talk about at the end is your uh you've talked to a lot of rich people and tried to to learn what are the options, what are the possibilities as far as taxes goes. And that's I want to learn that from you. Yeah. I mean, we'll talk about that as it relates to business ideas, but um as relates to tax ideas, it's actually a pretty similar process. Like, I'll just talk to as many people as possible. And I think the mistake people make with taxes is they have their one tax person and that person worked with their parents and they've been loyal, but actually this is a very bad place to have loyalty. It's really good to talk to like I've talked to dozens of tax promiscuous. You want to be very promiscuous here. I've talked to dozens of tax attorneys and tax accountants about their ideas and I just keep track of all their ideas and then I talk to all my friends, ask them for their tax ideas and consolidate it. That's so true. There's like this weird loyalty. It's like, yeah, he's been doing my taxes for 4 years. Like, yeah, but nothing has changed. And you want to get good ideas from everybody. So, let's let's do this plane real quick. So, a plane like this, what does it cost roughly? What do you have to put down? And what is the tax savings on something like this? Just a mini tax le for this plane. Yeah, mini tax le. And then we go into more detail on this on the last episode I did with you guys. But, uh, this is a $12 million plus airplane and, uh, you could put 20% down on the airplane. I got this pre-owned, so saved a few million bucks and it's just good as new. So, you put down roughly 2 million bucks. Uh, yeah, you put down about a few million bucks and then you just pay monthly financing on it. But then you get uh you get to write off up to the whole thing. Last year it was 60% upfront, but now with the new administration, it looks like accelerated depreciation is back. So, if you bought a $12 million airplane, financed it, you can write off the whole $12 million off your tax bill even though you only put in 3 million bucks. So you're going to pay the government or you could buy an airplane, right? So you it looks either way $3 million is going out of your bank account. Either way, the money is leaving your bank account. So like it looks lavish. It looks ridiculous. But this is why rich people do these things, right? And I just wanted to debunk that myth. I think a lot of people are scared to admit that. They don't want to share that cuz they want to flex more. They want to show off. But it's just a practical matter, right? And you use it to like literally be more efficient and go meet people where otherwise you might not have taken that day trip to go do it. Like you came up, you're like, I want to have lunch with you. And so you flew up, we had lunch and you flew out. And I was like, wow. First I felt honored, but secondly, man, there's probably a lot of people that I think I would have kind of amazing opportunities or build a relationship with, but I don't do it because the logistics are actually like in the way. Of course, this is not accessible to most people, but like if you're in that successful entrepreneur bucket, um it kind of makes sense logistically as well. It does. Yeah. And you know, we've got Starlink on board, so flying uh flying out here, I was able to make five phone calls and be on Zoom and, you know, do FaceTime video where I'm like, "Yo, what's up?" Right. And like it's it's a practical matter of saving money, but it looks really bad. If you're an operating CEO of a company, you're going to get shout on by your employees, your customers, your investors. And I realized that that would be a problem for me a few years ago. So that's why I stopped being an operating CEO. Actually, it it was really I had this conflict of like can I do everything I want to do? And I know it's the right thing to do. I know I will. I know I will. Well, I know I'll create more abundance. you know, I'll create more value for my companies, but at the same time, I know I'm going to get more flak. I'm going to have more people who want to rip on me, unfortunately. And I'm sure this video will not help with that at all. But like, I defend it. It's like a practical matter, right? I love that. Unapologetic. So, yeah. Uh, enough about the private jet. It's cool. It's going to make for a great great shot. First time for the podcast. What I want to talk to you about is what you're great at, which is ideas, um, and coming up with new ideas for businesses. So the track record here is you've been an operating CEO. You started this company called Intaneo when you were really young, right? How how old were you when you started that? I was 19 when I started. I knew absolutely nothing. Yeah. And then I built that company up and then started a bunch of other companies. Several of them are nine figure valuation businesses. I have no unicorns under my belt. So that's a big insecurity of mine right now. I'm going to be super honest about it. Like I don't have a single unicorn, but if you add them all up, I've got, you know, multiple unicorns. So that became my strategy. I decided I'm really not good at building unicorns, but I'm really good at coming up with smaller businesses. A barn full of horses. Yeah, a barn full of horses where I create I think we just coined something there, by the way. That was all you. Good work. Um, but yeah, if if uh I could just raise less VC money for these companies and just create more of them and not be directly operating them, then that could add up to being just as valuable, if not more valuable than if I created one unicorn. Not to mention all my friends who are CEOs are unicorns. Miserable. So miserable and so stressed out. And also they don't have the ability to live an amazing lifestyle because of all the stuff you talked about. They're scared of the optics. Um and they own a much smaller percentage of these businesses. Like a lot of my unicorn CEO friends, they own like 5% of a billion dollar company, which is remarkable amount of money. That's a lot, but you know. Yeah, totally. I'm in it for the lifestyle, not the uh You just have to decide what you're in it for and just be honest. And there's other people who are in it for the impact. That's dope. They they should do that. They should save the world. I'm on the world. I'm glad that they're saving it. Yeah. I personally don't want to do that with my time. I want to indulge my curiosities, have fun conversations, and just enjoy my life with my kids. Like that's kind what I like to do. That's my that's my gold standard. Yeah. So, your story is basically 19 years old. You start Inero. You run that company. You grow that company. And then you you've like you said you transitioned from starting and running companies yourself to now you have this like your own hold co where you're you're incubating or creating companies and you said that in the last four years you've started four companies each worth over $100 million. I've co-founded companies and when I say co-found sometimes I didn't do a whole lot. Maybe I helped with idea. I got the early team on board. I got some early funding and then on some of them I'm still really active and on some of them I'm not active and I'm just like a significant shareholder. Right. All right. Hey, real quick. If you're liking this episode with Jess, then we got something cool for you. So, when the episode ended, we asked her, we were like, "Hey, you were talking about how you have this this playbook, this recruiting guide, you have this like content guide, you have these things. Would you mind sharing one of those with us?" And she actually just sent us like all of them. So, uh she wanted the listeners to be able to have them for free. So, they're in the show notes below. It's her talent playbook. It's her recruiting guide. I think it's an operations guide for how she runs her companies. These are straight from her. They're available in the show notes below. Check them out. I mean, somebody's giving you free gold. All you got to do is take out your hands and just accept the gold. All right, back to this episode. I want to ask you about your idea process because that's amazing to be able to do that. I want to be able to do that. So, let's talk about that. Uh, let's talk about ideas. How do you get ideas to start these companies? And then what are some ideas right now that you're excited about? Yeah, I'll talk about process first. So um I love Y cominator ideas the request for startups and when I was coming up with my first ideas for businesses like Indierero that was inspired by that list and it's a list of a hundred business ideas where they say if you build this we are more likely to fund you right and I really wanted to get into Y cominator and um and then I put together this spreadsheet so I had this matrix of criteria and one of My top criteria was complicated enough that other people won't copy me too fast. Mhm. I think that's really important. If I'm a first-time founder, I need to have more leg room. And then another criteria was I can pseudo bootstrap this. Like I can raise some angel money, but I don't need to raise like a hund00 million. So like I'm not going to build Tesla or SpaceX. I want to build something that $2 million could get me very far. My other criteria was I wanted recurring revenue. I wanted something that was sticky, like a must-have. And so I literally went through every single one of those ideas on the Y Combinator list and I rankorded them based on these three criteria. And business, accounting, and tax management seem to be the better one for my criteria. And so my process is I, you know, go online and I scrape these ideas. I've even gone to Reddit to look for ideas. I have one-on-one lunches and dinners with people like you where I just say, "Hey, like what are ideas you're exploring?" And then we'll just have a brainstorm. But none of the ideas I've actually worked on came from me sitting in a room with a whiteboard and just like coming up with stuff yourself. Yeah. That's never worked out. I've tried it, by the way, with uh no success. Okay. So, you you had this thing on your phone. You had like this idea database. It was like 300 ideas. Uhhuh. And you promised, you said I'll show some of them today, even though these are things you might still go do. I think I might still do some of these. So, do you want to give us a couple of them? Absolutely. Um, it's called the idea hopper. So, actually, let me pull it up on my phone real quick. Okay, great. Should we start with the ones we talked about before with Yeah, she gave me a teaser of like two or three of them that I was like, don't tell me more. But yes, like, should we start with the Doge as a service? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I like I like this one. So, very trendy right now. Doge as a service for companies. Explain. Yeah. I mean, most companies have so much waste. You have people who barely show up or they're phoning it in. And I have friends who say, "Oh, yeah, like like I've, you know, my husband quiet quit his job. He's like working 2 hours a day and no one's tracking it, so he's available to hang out." Those are the people you want to get rid of. So, what if you could create a software platform that goes through and tracks who is actually on Slack, who is actually emailing, who is like using their computer, and if not, then they're fired. So, Doge is a service for companies. And so, it would be a team of consultants. It'd be a consultants plus AI. How would you do it? I think AI could do a lot of it. I also thought that if you're an enterprise then it's you could sell this to consulting firms like uh Mckenzie or VC or whoever and say hey you guys can offer this to the CFO. Oh they're already doing they're already in there. They're already in there and that makes you seem more valuable as a consultant because you could say hey we could demonstrate that we'll save you hundreds of millions of dollars. You'll pay us only $20 million and this AI did all the work. Yeah that's actually pretty interesting. I I don't think enough tech teams build tools for the consultants who have already done the sale. Cuz what Mackenzie is amazing at is they got this relationship with a Fortune 100 company. They're on retainer. They're getting paid millions of dollars a year. And if you can sell them a tool that either helps them land and expand that contract or just save overhead in actually like executing that contract, that's going to be pretty valuable. Like if I was like building AI right now, I would not be trying to make something that like I'm going to not only build the tool but also figure out all of the go to market. Maybe you could actually just sell this to consultants who already have the go to market done. Exactly. That that's I mean one of my ideas that I'm actively exploring and here I am sharing it with everyone here. So you're not afraid to share ideas or what's your philosophy around that? Uh no I'm super afraid to share ideas. Um but put you on the spot. You just got me really comfortable. So, here I am. Um, this is an idea I've been playing around with for a few months, and I really like it a lot. Okay, I like it. Um, I didn't want to be one of those people who said, "Okay, here are my shittiest ideas. Now you go do them." Like, I think that'd be just really lame. Totally. All right. What else you got? So, as a service, that's one I like. So, again, this is the trendy category. Okay. Okay. Um, another idea is, uh, you know, everyone says SAS is dead, agents are the new thing. Well, what if you could build vertical agent as a service for an industry? So, for example, build a library of agents for dental offices or for auto mechanics, right? Or for, you know, clothing uh designers or manufacturers or whatever or distributors. So, there are all these industries, but where they need their own very unique library of agents to automate their tasks and you can go really deep there. So this is more of a thematic business area which will be I think we're going to see thousands of businesses doing this, right? So okay, so somebody's building a tool and so you're saying you don't even have to build the agent. You're like there's going to be somebody who builds an agent that's about picking up a call uh and booking an appointment. Let's say appointment booking agent. So what you used to have to have pay a receptionist to do now AI is pretty damn good. It's going to be able to do that fully, right? So you have horizontal companies right now that sell the voice agent for any industry. The problem is you still have to do a lot of fine tuning and work for if you're dentist a dentist. So what if you you're a company and you look for all these off-the-shelf tools and make your own agents and plug them all in and tune it just for dentists, right? And so it's plug-and-play. I'm a dental office. I can use your company and it has like hundred different pieces of AI already baked into my workflow. Got the idea in a nutshell. Okay. I like that. And you should do this for an industry you know about. Like if you're passionate about you know dental offices then do it in dental offices. Um so that's uh shout out to anyone who's passionate about dental. You are this was your day. You got to I know you the more boring the better. That's the constellation software model right which so we invested in this company that's uh vertical SAS which was uh called Shop Genie. They just so we invested in it and I think within a year or two they sold for mid eight figures. And what they did was they went to auto repair shops and they were like, "Hey, guess what? Auto repair shops need CRM." So there was always CRM like HubSpot and others that they work for any type of business. And he's like, "Well, but auto repair shops have specific things that are, you know, uh, very specific for them." So they built a tool that was just for them. And they went and they got like 3,000 4,000 auto repair shops in like a year to use them. And by the way, very sexy business. Yeah. I was like, "Dude, how did you get so many shops to use you?" And he's like, "There's this guy who's like the auto repair influencer. He's like the Kardashian of auto repair shops and he vouched for us and then all these people uh you know followed on board. He's like that guy makes like 20 million a year as the like biggest influencer to other auto repair shop owners. It's like really insane. Oh wow. Great business idea. Yeah. So so what they did was they give him this tool and it was like for booking your appointment and the text message follow-ups or whatever. And what you're saying is like and vertical SAS has been a thing. Constellation software did it. What you're saying is instead of vertical SAS, it's going to be like vertical ass. As a sense of service, vertical ass. I love it. All right. So, but seriously, and then the more like random the better. Like if you could apply this to like, you know, marine shipping or to like resource mining, you know, then constellation will be acquiring and rolling up these vertical ass companies in the next few years. Like that's that's the future. What was the marine shipping cargo ship idea you were telling me about? Yeah, that was another idea I had on my idea. Hopper, the idea was in a nutshell. Could we uh Oh, yeah. It was uh coating for uh these cargo ships. Coding like the paint coating. Uh-huh. But to make it more efficient so that these ships could go even a few knots faster. Um and that saves you a ton of money on fuel. And then you don't need to like take these ships out of the water as often to recoat them. So this could be like millions if not tens of millions of dollars over a decade for your entire fleet of cargo ships. Totally random idea. I got this from having dinner with someone who was playing around with this idea or looking at funding something like this like many years ago and the other person just didn't have the money to proceed with it. And so my I like I learned about that just from having dinner with someone. Yeah. That's crazy. And so you when let's say you have an idea like that. Uhhuh. Uh so first it's like where who the heck even thinks about cargo ship codings? Not me. I mean, most of these ideas, the the common theme is I didn't come up with any of these ideas, right? So, you're a good spotter, would you say, or what what are you good at? I'm good at initiating conversations with people who are likely to have ideas or have access to ideas like you have good access to ideas. So, like, actually, I've sent you an idea before and now that I think about it, like uh my buddy James Creer has this great phrase. He goes, you want to turn yourself into an API. And what he means by that, he goes, you know, like a website has an API which basically says, "Here's what I can offer you. I I can give you location data. So you you ping me, I give you location data. That's what I'm good at. And by the way, here's here's what I want to get from your API, right? Here's the things I'm interested in. I'm interested in acquiring geospatial data." So you kind of have made your API. Like, hey, I'm always interested in hearing interesting, kind of weird, off-the-beaten path ideas. So when I hear one, I think, oh, Jess would like this, right? So you've put yourself in my mind and associated yourself with she likes to hear weird cool off the beaten path you know ideas that that you know she she's good at making them happen and then in return I you know you're like what are what are you good at? It's like what do you offer as your API is like I have a business and I'm trying to recruit a CEO and I know you've done that a bunch of times. I'm like oh if I go to Jess she's going to you know reduce my error rate and make me go faster at this because she's really going to be helpful in doing that. or if I have an idea, she's really good at fleshing it out over a lunch, like riffing on it and then being like super motivated to be like, "All right, what are we going to do to make this happen? Like, let's push the ball forward." So, I think you've kind of done that in the idea space, which is really well articulated. Yeah. Like I get people calling me all the time saying, "Hey, Jess, you have like five minutes to chat. I have this random idea I want to get your thoughts on, and would you build this with me or if I did it, would you fund it?" I get those calls all the time, multiple times a week. And it's like, all right, like, yeah, I'll find a time to call you back, but um it's like uh what Warren Buffett did. He just got the word out there. Hey, I'm buying businesses. Call me if you're ready to sell. And it's a fast, easy process. I'm doing the same thing with ideas. Yeah, that's great. My business partner, Ben, I was just thinking while you were talking like his API is so funny, is two things. One, Ben always knows a guy. So you're like, do you know anybody? He's like, I know a guy who knows a guy. That's always Ben's thing. Like he always knows a guy who knows a guy. And the second thing is a lot of people will go to Ben, they'll just text him when something good happens in their life. And I always I'm like, why did they did you ask? He's like, no, no, they just told me. And like, we just closed this big deal or we just did this thing and they haven't announced it. And he's not that close to them. But what I realize is I do the same thing with him because he's somebody that makes you feel good when you win. You don't feel like there's any envy or he's not going to try to take anything from you. He's like genuinely pumped for you. That's awesome. And because of that, he just gets this wealth of inbound of people who are winning, which is also great for us for investing because we're like, "Oh, wow. These guys are doing really well. Do they need more capital? Do they need something? Like maybe we could help them." And that's a superpower. So I think people there's like these underrated superpowers. Like the thing you're describing about I'm good at, you know, maybe talk having interesting conversations and getting good ideas and making people feel like they should come to me with interesting ideas. That's not even a skill you could learn in school or nobody would even tell you that that's a thing. Yeah. But you're going to build generational wealth off that. Yeah, that's well said. I think it's equally as important to know what we're bad at. You know, like for me, I realized that I'm not the best operating CEO. Like that's just not my forte. And after I realized that and came to peace with that, then I was able to say, okay, well, I'm going to come up with ideas and recruit great teams and then empower them. And that's what I'm going to figure out how to put on and be great at. Exactly. So, um, let's do more. I want more ideas. Okay, so you got me going. I have this other idea. The code name is Holy Health. And I came up with this idea because I heard of another business that was minting like tens of millions of dollars in Ebida within 36 months. And all they did was help one niche of uh like medical provider get access to insurance. And then I did some research. I plugged this in a GPT and I realized there's so many of these other types of people like chiropractors or physical therapists where they can get insurance reimbursement but they're so small they don't have the um the scale to negotiate with an insurance company on getting reimbursed. So they techally they could technically they could but is it that they don't have the time or the skill or like you need to ban them together? Both. So if you band them together then they can get some reimbursement and then you could create you know agents as a service to support them to create more lock in and then you could help them with their customer acquisition. So it's got to be the full stack and this other company did that for one of these different verticals. Um and I heard about that through a friend who heard about the company and I'm like oh man that's a great idea. Could I do something adjacent to that that's not copying them but similar in some ways? A similar blueprint but in a different space that needs it. Exactly. So you would go, what would you do for that? So you would uh let's just walk through this. So I want to hear So you have that idea. You actually start with a clue. I got a clue because I was having lunch with a friend and he's like these guys are making like 30 million in evida da. I'm like okay. And what question are you asking that friend cuz um we were just talking before and I was like how the hell do you get the I go what is your info diet that you are getting these ideas that I don't get to hear about? You're doing something different. You know you're not just consuming the same stuff I am because you're getting different ideas. So, can we talk about that real quick? But the the info diet. Yeah. I mean, none of these come from reading uh a blog post or watching a podcast. All these are from inerson conversations. I think a lot of people are lazy. They just want to come up with stuff by staring at their computer. Nothing good comes out of doing that. If I'm being candid, you have to get out of the building. Um you have to like just talk to people. And when you're talking to him, what do you what are you asking? Like, hey, what's interesting? What have you seen that's that's cool? say, "Yeah, what's the coolest uh what's the most interesting exotic business idea that's minting cash that you've seen recently?" And so, I'm not asking them for a business idea. I'm asking them for what's an existing thing you've seen. It's like why? What's the key to their success? And why does no one know about this, right? And like why hasn't anyone copied them yet? And you know, why is now the right time for them? Right? You're filtering as they're as they give you the exotic business that's minting cash. You're like, was there some spe secret sauce that's not replicable? They know maybe they're super influential in a community. Okay, that would take forever to build. Could this be done in another space? Is does this take $100 million of venture capital or could How much they start? And then they're like, oh yeah, like these guys just bootstrapped it, right? I'm like, oh my god. So now my math is really watering. I'm like, okay, and what are the other risks here? Like can AI just replace this in 36 months? That's like the new risk factor in my like criteria that you all have to ask. So you get the clue, you get the clue from the convers conversation key question and then you get the clue. Then you run it through your filter mentally just there. Let's say now you're excited about the idea cuz you're like um holy health and and you give it you give it a code name. Is there everything has to have a code name is why is that? It makes it real. It makes it feel more psychologically real and like okay then I have something to remind me of the rest of the substance of the idea. Cool. And so I'll just like throw the idea into chatbt before you even tell your co-workers. You're like, I think with AI first. Uh yeah, exactly. I tell everyone before you tell me anything, think with AI as well. Yeah. And so everyone does that and I say, give me like 20 ideas of potential names for this idea and then I just pick one. And this is the code name. And then we put it in the idea hopper. And then did you see the CEO of Microsoft went on a podcast? I think Boresh's podcast recently. He had this great line. And he goes, "My new workflow is think with AI and then work with my co-workers." So he goes, "I think people are thinking about like AI is going to replace your co-workers. Your your employees just going to the AI is going to do a task." He's like, "But right now the best use case is me thinking and sparring with AI to get clarity and then I go work with my co-workers after that." Sounds like you're kind of doing a similar thing. Yeah, we definitely do that. And what we're trying to do is um have all of our meetings be recorded. So, even if it's in person, we're just like turning on granola and having I have a big one of those conference speaker phone things and it's just recording everything and we're going to feed it in to create digital twins of all of us, then have like basically thousands of versions of ourselves just brainstorming and sparring with each other to refine ideas even further. It's like those little like chess arenas or whatever where they train the AI to just compete with each other until like until there's like a winner winning strategy. Yeah. And actually, how are you going to do the digital twin thing? We're actually doing we're actually training one based off of you as well. So I'm we're going to have it just watch every single video you've been part of so it knows how to think like you be like, "Hey, bring Sean into these conversations. Bring uh Satia, bring Suck, bring Elon, bring like whoever." And I want all of them to like help battle test this uh you know conversation. That's amazing. So that way I don't need to pay for you. You know, that's useful when if you just ask a question like, "Oh, what would Elon do in this situation?" Or, you know, take your most high agency um badass friend who's not afraid and seems to have like clarity in the moment of a fog of war. If you just have that friend and you've hung out with them enough and you literally just ask the question, it's like they're in the room. And I know if that works, then an AI that's actually trained on them is going to be insane. How do you know how you'll do that? How will you create like what are you going to use to make the me for you? There's so much public content for my team members. That's why I'm making sure that they record every single interaction in the company with each other. Um and is there a tool to do that or are you going to make your own tool or a lot to to get the transcripts cuz once you have the transcripts then you can just feed that into any of these. Um so any any LLM will be able to like it's going to do a pretty good job. Yeah, we should go into more advanced conversation on this but that's Dude, it's so annoying. People are using my voice in ads all the time now and I'm like this is this is wild. Uh like how do I sue you? I don't know who you are. Second thing is that um but I'm going to anybody who's doing I'm suing you. I'm actively working on that. I'm telling AI to figure out how to find you. Uh but then also also um what was the other one? Um oh writing style. So people will just put in chat be like write this in the style of whatever because I've written a lot of content publicly and it's it's not it's not me but it's like it's definitely kind of close to me. It's like oh that's 18 months away from being better than me. So that's definitely happening. I might as well embrace it. We're almost going to need like a safe word that's like is it human Sean that I'm talking to or is this AI Sean that I'm talking to? Like we need a code word. I know but that it's like really exciting and um and so yeah Satia is he's on point. He's on point here. Um so where was I? So you were telling me about uh Okay. So we're going through your process. So you get excited about the idea. Yeah. You have the clip. You have the code name and you then have a meeting with your team. What what are you doing in that meeting? What what are you trying to do to advance that idea forward? Yeah. Every week we have a R&D team meeting is what we just call it. And we talk about the ideas that we're playing with. And the problem here with holy health because this was a live idea and it still is a live idea. Everything I've shared today is still alive by the way. And um the problem is we just had too many of these ideas. I mean we have hundreds of these ideas and we try to work on too many at the same time. And the problem is then you don't really advance any idea forward enough between each week meeting and then we lose excitement. Right? So now the new rule is we're going we're only going to have two and we're going to take them all the way until they're busted before you replace and bring in another one. And so like what do you do? So you have the meeting, you pitch you pitch the idea. Do you have a way of kind of pitching it to your team or what how do you what's what's happening in that meeting? In that meeting, anyone can pitch. So it's not just me. Um, everyone usually has different ideas. And um, and so yeah, it's like, hey, here's a AI defensible idea XYZ. Here's why it's a Mi idea. So we kind of have a common understanding on what a Maui idea is. And which is roughly what? It's roughly an idea that can cash flow that doesn't require a lot of outside funding. We could fund it ourselves. Um, and where it's like boring and complicated enough where random people are not going to copy us that easily or reverse engineer it that easily. Um, that those are my way ideas and that's what I'd encourage anyone else to do as well. Okay. Like if you're an auto mechanic expert then that might be your theme of idea and we have that for like financial services in particular, right? And so you um what h what do you where do you leave that meeting? You say, "All right, what are we going to do next?" We say, "Okay, what are we going to get done to advance this between this week and next week?" Um and we just get very specific. And it's like, all right, like person A, you're doing these five things. Person B, you're doing these five things. And the next step might be like, okay, let's just go call like for Holy Health. Um the next step was let's just call some chiropractors and ask them um if they you know figure out who accepts insurance and who doesn't and why and then ask them why don't they plug into these existing companies that should be that doing something similar. So a lot of it's just like what are the questions we're curious about and psychologically are you trying to disqualify an idea or you trying to qualify an idea like what's the mindset is it I'm trying to figure out is this good or bad or is it like I'm listing the riskiest assumption I'm doing it. What what are you trying to do during that those next few weeks? It's uh it's it's not we're trying to figure it out or or disqualify it per se. I think either attitude might be too extreme. It's more like there might be a creative angle here that no one else has thought through. And so we're not married to this idea. We're holding it very loosely. You just have to figure out like, okay, we might hear an interesting insight from a chiropractor that says, hey, your idea is okay, but what would make it really good is if you also added in all these AI agents to automate away my receptionist and and then, you know, my customer acquisition is terrible because XYZ like those are the insights we're looking for to then manufacture an upgraded version of the idea. So, we assume the first idea is terrible and it's going to go through like 10 pivots, right? like, which is very useful because that's almost always the case. And if you don't have that attitude, you basically you hear something really juicy, but you're so locked in. It's like somebody was handing you gold, but you were out there just, you know, searching for for bronze, and it's like, are you sure? You sure you want that? I was going to ask you, you know, you you're talking a lot about ideas in Silicon Valley. There's this idea, there's this phrase, which is, you know, ideas are are are worthless. Execution is everything. Do you buy that? I think it's BS. I think it's I think it's some of the worst advice I've ever heard in Silicon Valley. So, what's your take? My take is that ideas are really freaking important and if you have the wrong idea, you could be a great team and you're screwed. And actually, I modified my thinking on this cuz I was a scout for Sequoia Capital for many years. And they would show us a bunch of these like great ideas with amazing traction, especially in consumer internet. And then they would ask us, would you invest on this memo, yes or no? And so we would vote and then they'd say, well, here's what happened to that company. It ended up being, you know, a zero. Even though it had the best team, the idea was still garbage. So it ended up being a zero. And that was like a common theme I noticed. So they would train almost train you on historical memos basically. Yeah. Oh wow. That's incredible. But you but if the traction was great is it usually the traction good or just the team and the the thesis was great. I mean the the early traction might have been good and the team looks good but then if you really think through the long term like is this idea sticky after a year or two? Will there be copycats? Like is it like is there anything that really holds the consumer in? you know, that's where these ideas would then lose steam, right, and die. And so that kind of helped me think about this a bit differently. And so you're saying uh ideas super important. Ideas are really important and the team is really important. They're both really important, but to say, "Oh yeah, like ideas are a dime a dozen." Like really, it's not just the idea. It's like the whole thinking of the business. like doing the calls to like understand or meeting with the chiropractors in person or the auto mechanic and really figuring out these juicy tidbits that you're not going to find out um by sending out a stupid survey or by using chat GPT to tell them, hey, what are the problems that chiropractors have? Like that helps you build an interview script for what you're going to then uh talk to them about. But then, you know, you have to show up. So, like when I was building an Inero, I would go to Yelp and I would call these CPAs and I would say, "Hey, I'm like a 19-year-old college kid. I know nothing about business. I want to do something to help accountants. Could I come to you, buy you lunch, and just like ask you some questions just for 15 minutes?" And then you show up, they're not going to kick you out after 15 minutes. 15 minutes is going to turn into two hours. And you have your notepad, your scribbling. Like, they love that. They want to be helpful, right? And um I did a lot of that personally like I just showed up and asked them my questions and then got all these insights and we we still do that. I'm still on these calls, okay? Like even if it's not in person, if you could at least do like hour-long plus, you know, uh expert calls like we use GLG for this. There's also um like alpha sites and they charge you a lot. You know, you might be paying 800 bucks or thousand dollars to talk to an expert in a very difficult to find area versus like accountants and chiropractors. Like you could just call someone on the internet. But if you want to find like an expert in titanium mining, how are you going to find that person? You go to GLG and you pay them a thousand bucks. They'll find the person for you, set up the phone call for you, right? And we do that all the time. the way you're talking about ideas and markets, it reminds me of there's this story of this marketer and the marketer goes to I think a a seminar or something like that. There other marketers there and he goes, "Okay, um we are going to let's pretend we're opening up a hot dog stand and um he's like so I can get he's like I'm a genie. I will give you anything you want to make your hot dog stand the most successful you can make it." So he goes, "What do you want?" And so first person, "What do you want?" The guy's like, "Uh, I want the best ingredients, best buns." He's like, "Got it. Best buns. You, what do you want? He's like, "No, no, no. Buns. That's foolish. In the food business, location is everything. So, location." All right, I got you this corner spot in a hightraic area. Cool. Uh, location. You got it. What do you want? And each person had like best branding, best whatever. And he goes, "Um, I have one thing that I think will beat all of you if we all if we all did the same thing and we all got our wish granted." He goes, "All I want is a starving crowd." And um if you're a marketer like you're going to spend a lot of time and energy trying to sell something, the absolute best decision you can make up front is finding a starving ravenous crowd. And it sounds like you know when you say ideas really the idea, you know, what's underneath an idea is a customer or set of customers who have like a real pain and like a desire to solve that pain, you know, like they are they are hungry and they're hungry for something. And if you just show up with even decent buns and hot dogs, like they'll buy it, you know, instantaneously. It's okay if it's a little cold. It doesn't matter. Yeah, that's a great story. It's uh it's about like how acute is this problem? And ideally, um one hallmark of a MA idea is the customer doesn't have to pay anything. So, in Holy Health, you don't pay to be on our platform. By being part of our platform, you make more money, you get more customers, and we'll take a cut of that in exchange for helping you grow your business. So, you like that model because there's no friction. I love that model. It's like, why would you say no to that? It's like you're just saying no to more business. Yeah. That's like those companies that um they'll negotiate with all vendors on your behalf and like whatever we save, we'll take 20%. If you're saving nothing today, if I save you any money, I'll take 20%. And it's like, okay, go have at it. You you were talking about you had a couple other ideas. You had like a divorce one. What was that? Yeah, that was like um I had so many friends getting divorced and still do. And people say they need an advance on their alimony or like there's going to be uh or their money gets tied up and locked up cuz they're in divorce proceedings and they're really rich, they're really successful, but they can't tap any of their own capital while it's all tied up. So, what if we could just give them some of their money back and and so that was just like a funny creative financing around either the window of a divorce or the alimony. We called it divorcef fun. Didn't go forward with that one. No. I mean, people talk about it and stuff. We still joke about it, but there are other ideas that we got more excited about. So, so let's talk about failures cuz one of the things you said to me before so many failures. You were like, I like your podcast, but you know, sometimes you listen to people and it just sounds like it's I had this idea, it worked, I'm so great. You know, like that's it's a podcast problem. and you were like, I want to be super honest about things we were trying that are not working or failures that I've had. Where do you want to start? Yeah. I mean, I would start by saying when I use YouTube and I have all these entrepreneur business podcasts, I spend a lot of time flipping through and I think, man, like I'm not doing enough. Like I'm not good enough. Even when like I watch your podcast, I think that and I think that a lot of people, you know, probably share that view and and and the people you interview, I know a lot of these people. These are my friends. I know what they're secretly struggling with. Yeah. And they're not necessarily sharing all of that. And I think that's just important to know. So in my case, looks like I am good at coming up with these things and having success, but most of the time they're total duds. And one example is we had this idea, we called it cred boost. terrible idea in hindsight. I'm so embarrassed to share this, but I'm going to share it anyway. And the idea was um we're going to help you like improve your credit and repair it. And you know, we had the customer acquisition funnel going and it was high churn, low price point, very high regulation by the FTC. You know, it it it got compared to credit repair businesses too much. And you know, my idea was we're going to boost your credit, not repair, just repair your credit. and it could have made some money, but we just got bored with that. And so I burned a few hundred thousand bucks experimenting with that. And then I put in the wrong team. So I made so many mistakes on that. That was an early incubation that went nowhere. And this other idea was we're we're going to help veterans of the US military um find new jobs and we're going to get paid by Vette and the GI Bill to do that. And we can do this all online. So, it's virtual, it's scalable, and we're helping veterans. So, it felt like a really good idea. And the veteran, all they have to do is say yes. So, we launched all these ads. All these veterans signed up. They're like, "Hell yeah, I could double my salary, make more money, and do this all online from the comfort of my home." And um and our payment mechanism was this thing called Vette, VE TEC. and it had um bipartisan, you know, acceptance. Everyone loved it, but it got stuck. It got approved by the House and never went up to the the Senate. And the money dried up and we were like, "All right, well, it get renewed imminently." And 18 months after that, still not renewed today. Still not renewed. And we're like, "Okay, well, that business died just because of that." And then I tried to pivot it. I'm like, "Oh, can I get the GI bill to pay for it?" But then the GI bill requires in person. And then after that, we lost interest. Like I was the only one excited about this stuff. I'm like, "Guys, we got to help the veterans." My team's like, "We have other ideas that will make more money, Justin. We want to make money." Like, "All right, I'll come back to this when the time's right." So, swings and misses for sure. I want to show you this. Uh I want I want you to read this. This is from a talk you gave. So, this is not 2011. This is when it hurts, but not just because an idea is wrong. Sometimes it's even when the idea is right and you're running a company. Can you can you read this? I want you to read that. Yeah. I wrote this to my mom and my dad on Saturday, June 4th, 2011 at 5:56 a.m. So, I was up all night. I couldn't go to sleep. I was so upset. Subject line kind of sad. Um, I feel like uh I'm burning made off rich on the outside but completely broken on the inside. There's just a lot of pressure right now because the company is running dry on money in the next nine month nine or so months and we really need to produce this summer or else we're royally screwed. Um, this was about a year after Y Cominator for me. Anyway, I'm going to start seeing a therapist or something because this is just no way to live. I have no idea how you handle this entrepreneur job, Jess. Wow. And my mom, she's an entrepreneur. She came here. Do you remember that? I do. I absolutely remember that. I remember the night. I remember how I was just like very upset cuz I had all these hoops and expectations on myself. And you know, Paul Graham even he was my mentor and he's like, "You're going to be one of the greatest entrepreneurs of all time. You, Patrick Hollison, and Sam Alman, and I'm still the least successful today." And I still think about that often. And um so that that weight was on your shoulders. That weight was totally on my shoulders. It still is on my shoulders. And um and my mom called me and she said, "Hey, like I love you no matter what. Even if you're a total business failure, I'll still love you." And then I just cut all my expenses, cut my burn, moved into a tiny apartment with my business partner and and then just slowly crawled out out of the hole and then yeah, we grew into narrow to you know it's few hundred employees profitable good business not a unicorn but it gave me all the training and um spiritual training to pursue entrepreneurship and be comfortable with mistakes and failure. M were you uh at that time I guess like what was the conversation with yourself to like cuz you're like I did these things. I lowered my burn. I did this. I did this. So those are the actions. But before the action comes some there's some inner monologue. There's some conversation you got to have with yourself. And I I love the inner monologue because your whole life gets dictated by this tiny little voice in your head that nobody hears. It's the one telling you how to feel, what to do, where to stand, what to say. And I think training that and learning how to like kind of uh improve that inner monologue is so important. And you it gets better in moments like this, right? That's when it gets that's the muscle building for that that inner monologue. Do you do you remember kind of what you were telling yourself at that phase? You you wrote this, your mom tells you something. What did you tell yourself? I distinctly remember what the monologue was that whole evening, which is I am destined for greatness and I am not producing my best work right now. I am not showing up at my best. I'm not playing to win and I'm I'm falling behind and I need to diagnose what went wrong and I need to keep on trying and I will not accept or tolerate failure. That was what was going through my head. Were you listening to to a song at that time? Where did that come from? That was fire. No. How'd you get yourself into that state from kind of sad to like kind of kick ass? No, that was sad though. That was not It was not an empowered attitude. I was I was thinking that and but because I knew that that was my situation then it went from like all right like I need to do all this or I'm screwed and then like all right I'm really sad and I got to process my emotions right just get it out of me and you know be honest with myself that I'm struggling I need to ask for help and I didn't have a great community cuz back at that time you you know as an entrepreneur you want to show off you want a posture you want to seem like you're better than everyone else and then after that I realized realized I could just be honest and I'll still have friends and I told all my girlfriends and ends up more people were struggling than I realized. More of my Y cominator batchmates were also running out of money. And if you we look back today, most of the companies from that batch did not make it. Most of them went BK and then people took normal jobs or started new companies and then eventually found success. And so yeah, I still think about that. I still have thoughts like that today. It's not it's a work in progress, right? You know, uh I've I've done whatever over 600 of these episodes and at certain point, you know, you'd have to be sort of stupid to not realize like there's a mindset amongst the a common mindset that I think great entrepreneurs have and I I've distilled it down into this. I think a great entrepreneur's mindset is they're ignorant of the past because it's already done. If they live there, they'll die there. If you just stay stuck on, well, I've been failing for 5 years, you know, then you you will feel like a failure and you won't be able to to win. So, you're ignorant of the past, realistic about the present, which is kind of what you said, like I'm not showing up at my best, I'm not putting in all the effort, I'm not doing the obvious things that I should be doing right now. Um, but I'm also not, it's not over. And so, they don't make it worse than it is. They don't make it better than it is. They see it as it actually is. So, ignorant of the past, realistic about the present, and delusional about the future. You have to have that delusion because if you're just realistic and practical about the future, you don't do anything great. Yeah, that's really well articulated. I think also going through moments like that, I remember then talking to my business partner and we did a full postmortem. We listed out every single strategic and tactical mistake and thing we did wrong and what we would do different if we went back in time. And I wish I wrote this somewhere because it was a long list. I mean it's like I would do everything different if I could go back in time was the attitude and even today I was talking to or or yesterday I was talking to one of my colleagues and the number of bad ideas we um funded and experimented with um and our process flaws you know we we would also do everything different going three years back if we could but we're talking about this constantly and that goes back to what we talked about at first kodawari So every week, what if we bake this into our workflow? No matter how good things are, let's still reflect on all the mistakes we made so that we can improve and not repeat that again. It doesn't have to be when times were tough and when you're about to run out of money that you're reflecting on like everything. Yeah. Yeah. No old mistakes. It's kind of like the It's the no new friends. It's the no old mistakes is what you want. You don't you don't want to keep making the same mistakes again. You said something when you were talking about like I'm not You said I'm not showing up the way I need to. You said I'm not playing to win. Yeah. Yeah, I was talking to your boyfriend before this and he goes I asked him I said what's a what's a Jess ism meaning like if you talk to people enough you sort of see their the things they repeat the things that are like their philosophy that they're like actually operating on and he go he said something like um play to win don't play not to lose explain that I think that came from this story that I just shared where I one of my problems was I was playing not to lose so I was in a scarcity mindset And when I'm running out of money and I'm in scarcity mindset, um I mean there's research that talks about how your IQ drops by a lot during those periods. And so I'm not going to think outside of the box. And um playing to win means I'm optimistic. I'm delusional about the future of it. Right? So I I see a lot of my friends who are just like playing it too safe. They're not they're not trying new things. Um, and so you can't do the same thing you've been doing and expect a completely different outcome. Right. What's an example maybe non-b businessiness related where in your life you're playing to you had the moment you're like uh I need to play to win here instead of playing not to lose in a personal life like uh for example with the airplane you know this is a physical manifestation of that attitude and why it's really fun to share that with everyone today. Um it's easy to say I'm going to be frugal. I'm going to save the money. I'm going to let it compound. I'm going to invest it in my other businesses or, you know, screw it. I'm playing a win here. This is going to manifest way more abundance for me than if I don't. Or you had told me something when we were at lunch that inspired me. You met somebody, I think, who threw a great event and you hired this person. You were like, "Hey, here's a budget and I will pay you whatever you're making at your job. I'll pay you that or more or whatever." You're like, I want to have four events a year in these four cities with the most like inspiring fun people in my like that I want to create. I'm going to engineer some serendipity, some luck, some fun, some cross-pollination of people and ideas four times a year in these in these places. And I remember I've told five people this because you need some resources to do it. Yes, of course. Of course. Like don't if you're in the YouTube comments, don't be that guy who's like, "Oh, it must be nice to have money." Great. There's a version of this in your life, too. You can take people out to dinner, right? It doesn't have to be a a grand event, but I was like, that is an investment that I don't even have a line item for. Yeah. Right. I kind of know if I did it probably really I would a have a lot of fun and b like, yeah, I do think good things would happen. But you took a almost like intentional business capital allocation approach to the like luck and fun part of your life, which I think most people leave untouched. Luck and fun is just something that either happens or doesn't happen. I don't use my business for that. I use this other part of my brain. It seemed like you almost stone because I want to have fun. I want to do more business, meet cool people. But I also had this friend who hated her private equity job and really wanted an excuse to leave. And so I was able to present that to her. The vision was four events a year with, you know, the most successful entrepreneurs and investors I know. And we're launching the first one literally today. That's exactly what I'm flying off to after we're done. And then the vision is we'll do a summer thing, a fall thing, etc. But it was really expensive. And so what she and I decided to do was we would help her find other work, other events. So I'd set her up with my other friends throwing events. She would charge per event and she would get paid based on the revenue coming in to the events. So, it's all variable versus her being on my payroll, right? And so, for this event, what I did is I called a bunch of my friends. I said, "Hey, you got to pay something because I have hard costs here." And they paid in and then she only paid herself after there was a profit. So, you could get creative about this. For the ideas we were talking about earlier and my whole team, bunch of these people are on contract. I found them on Upwork. Yeah. Okay. Like, you could do this. What type of person like what skill set do they have that you found on You said like Fiverr or Upwork? Yeah. like one's a product management UIUX thinker, one is a financial services guy, one was a intern of mine. He was at UCLA and he asked me to speak to his entrepreneur club and then he said, "Hey, could I like take you to lunch? I want to get some advice from you. What should I do after college?" I'm like, "Just intern for me and I'll teach you the ropes." And then he was so good that now he's full-time with us. but he's probably one of my best idea sparring partners. And then here, this uh event planning person, I met her from the Burning Man community. These people are everywhere around you. They don't necessarily have a fancy specific resume and they're fun. I love them. We work well together. That's more important than the resume, right? I met a friend recently who told me this uh he said something in passing. He goes, "I was at this event and then there was this guy who was he was dressed differently, blah blah." and me and my friend, we collect eccentric people. So, we went over to him and had a chat. I kind of paused him. I was like, that's kind of a cool thing you just said, like I collect eccentric people. I don't do that. And I was like, but what what do I collect? Like, if I just put myself in if I said what am I a collector of? So, like for me, I'm a collector of what I call golden nuggets. It's like I can have this conversation with you and I'm just looking for two, three, four things. Like I I don't need two hours or 90 minutes of a conversation to be perfect. I need three ideas that spark something, three golden nuggets that will change my way of thinking or acting. Um, so I'm a great collector of those. I'm also a collector of like young talent. Like I see somebody who's young, who's hustling or is talented in some way, I will like kind of really help them out because I want to a stay young myself and be helpful, but b I kind of want to be able to connect dots between young people and good opportunities or young people in funding or whatever it is. Uh, and so I think there's this interesting idea of like figuring out what is it that you collect? Like some dudes collect stamps, some dudes collect bugs. What is it that you collect? So like for you, what do you what would you say you collect? I would say I collect interesting people with outside of the box ideas who also like to have fun. That is the key intersection I'm looking for. That's your ven diagram. Exactly. Cuz I think you could find interesting people where they're not fun. It's very transactional. They're just in it to make money themselves. But then the problem with that is then I can't do any business with them. So that's so then my idea was okay how do I bring more of these people together so that we can have more serendipity. Oh I'll just create my own event and then bring them there and then have a bunch of my people also you know talking to them getting their ideas and seeing where we could partner on stuff. Right. Right. Engineering the serendipity. Our buddy Nick Gray does a like no cost lowcost version of this. So he used to do a renegade museum tour. So he like he loved museums. So his ven diagram was like fun people who are interested in like you know going to a museum on a Friday night and he would host his he wasn't a part of the museum. He would just take people on a tour because he knew the museum better than the tour guides and he would take them on a fun version of the tour. They'd like have a drink outside after uh beforehand. They would go in and they would like do little fun things at the different stations. So I think that was one thing he did. Another way he engineers serendipity is he would throw these like singles events where he himself was looking to date somebody, but he's like, "Well, I could just kind of do that. I can swipe left or right or like, is there something I could do more creative that will not only help me find someone amazing, but maybe even like a bunch of our friends find somebody amazing?" He started hosting these singles events. And again, the it's a pizza budget. It's not like it's super fancy. Doesn't have to be fancy, right? Like uh and I feel like I need to say that cuz we're sitting on this like jet, but like Yeah. I mean, most of the stuff we do is like very cheap, cost prospective NP and Ps for itself and sometimes makes a profit, you know. So, like just but just taking that intensity to engineering some serendipity. I kind of love that. Uh, before we leave, what do you just leave me with what are you currently nerding out about? Um, I've been spending a lot of time thinking about like cancer and oncology. I've been thinking a lot about um longevity and you know, we're still funding a lot of the research with Mike Leven who's my favorite scientist of all time. He's the bio electricity ninja. And um I've been nerding on out on this a bit more because um I was mentioning to you before we got here, I've been in a bit of a sad mood this week. I had a friend die of cancer a few days ago. Um never smoked a cigarette in her life and had stage four lung cancer. And um and it's just more examples of this in my life. Every year or two, I lose a friend like that. and and so it's not necessarily going to make money. It's not going to improve my lifestyle, but I'm just like I got to nerd out on it, right? Is there exciting progress in the cancer oncology stuff right now? Like is there something is there a new paradigm or a new pathway that's interesting? Yeah, like with Mike, we he talks about how he's been able to use bio electricity to normalize cancer cells. So everyone right now in the field is talking about how do you kill a cancer, right? You think about chemo, radiation, it's really painful on the patient, but if you could just normalize cancer and um not have to kill it, that's going to be a lot more comfortable. Kind of makes it like a normal non-cancerous cell basically. It's still going to be cancer, but it's more benign essentially. So that's really cool research. He's got a lot of great stuff on longevity, making lab uh animals live longer. Um, I don't think he wants me to talk about it publicly yet, but how insane is the AI uh AI for medicine and biology? How is that how is insane is that going to be? I think it's going to be amazing. I think it's also going to be a lot harder than people think cuz you have AI that's coming up with all these ideas, but the bottleneck is still regulatory, still FDA, it's still getting a clinical trial put together. That's one area where we're going to see slower progress than everyone is bragging about. Whereas, you know, with everything else we discussed with digital twins, if we could have the two of us brainstorm ideas, there's no bottleneck there, right? Like the only bottleneck is like spinning up the computer and then us pulling the trigger to fund ads or fund whatever. But in health and bio, it's people's lives are at stake. It's going to go slow still, I think, unfortunately. Okay. Well, where should people find you and what should they send you? Yeah. Um, if you have any exotic outside of the box business ideas you want to run by me and um, I'd love to discuss that with you, uh, shoot me a note. And I am on LinkedIn. LinkedIn um, just search chess ma. And um, I post on my blog there almost every week. Uh, partially using Chashbt to come up with my blog post, but I still review it. I'm like, "Hey, write me a blog post that's 2950 characters long cuz the LinkedIn limit's 3,000 in my voice about XYZ CX XYZ and insert these anecdotal stories and uh and then like within 2 minutes I have a blog post." That's amazing. Yeah. But so I post there and these are real life stories in my life and uh just send me a message on LinkedIn. Would love to hear from people. And also the last pod we did, I made a bunch of friends. Like people just cold emailed me and I'm like, "Yeah, I'll grab lunch with you. I'll grab dinner with you." And two people I met from the pot are coming to my retreat. That's a that's amazing to hear. That's a a point of pride for us is like we wanted today if somebody comes on the podcast, they you should get more kind of inbound messages from this than any other podcast you go on. And the second would be that the people who message you are people you would actually want to talk to. That would be the goal, right? That if we're doing that, we've kind of built the right tribe here. So, a great job with that real community. So, thanks for having me here. Awesome. Well, cheers. Cheers. All right. Here we go.

The British East India Company prepared for this. China had like a monopoly on tea production. The British decide to do something about this. Hire this guy named Robert Fortune. Scottish botonist. You are going to infiltrate China and you were going to steal the tea industry secrets. He looks like a Scottish man. He disguised himself as a Chinese merchant. He traveled deep into China's tea region. This guy was supposed to be Chinese. I don't know how he did it. They don't think he's you with sideburns. Then he started recruiting Chinese tea growers, hiring them and persuading them to leave China secretly and relocate to India. He pulled it off, steals the trade secrets, he hires the tea growers, he smuggles them out of the country and they start growing tea. And soon after that, India surpassed China in terms of its tea production. That's insane that this guy pulled this

Where were you when you were thinking about this? I have this room in my house where I have the best ideas. It's a cool room because if you need a shower, you're already there. It's just the bathroom. Okay. So, I'm in the [Music] bathroom. All right. Um, I got a business I can tell you a little bit about that. It kind of blew my mind. So, I was on TBPN by a good buddy John Kugan. I was I went on there and they asked me a question. and they go, "So, you're a creator and um you know, you've got this kind of like cool business, you know, business underneath your yourself as a creator. Are you bullish on investing in creators right now?" And I go, "No, but I'm bullish on creators investing in businesses." And they were like, "What do you mean?" I said, "Well, actually, like what I'm doing is it's not that somebody invested in me. I'm investing I'm buying pieces of of businesses that I think, you know, should exist or that I can accelerate in some way." and that's going really really well for me. So I think that's going to be a model that people do. And so I started thinking about this and I saw an example today that kind of blew my mind. So do you know who Nick Sabin is? I I smell what you're stepping in. Great. Great. Yes. I I love where you're going with this. Yes, I do know who he is. You tooting my horn. Yeah. Beep beep, my friend. I like Nick Sabin. All right. So Nick Saven, who is the uh he was the coach football coach at Alabama and LSU, and he's like probably the most successful modern-day college football coach. The guy made probably $150 million as a coach. Amazing money. Is that real? 150 as a college football coach. Yeah. He's he's like in his 50s, so he's been doing it for a long time. But like his last contract was basically a 10year hund00 million contract. He was making he was making 10 to 12 million a year. His last contract. Wow. But Nick Sabin is actually going to be a billionaire and he's going to be a billionaire because of car dealerships and I found this pretty fascinating. I I couldn't believe what I was reading. So the story is pretty cool. Here's how here's how it goes. So Nick Sabin has partnered up with this guy, I think his name is John Aggressi, and the the headline of the article was the man who will make Nick Sabin a billionaire. And it talks about how Sabin after his co well while he was coaching was deciding like you know what I think I might go into car dealerships and car dealerships have had like an interesting history with athletes. I remember growing up in Colorado John Elway all the car dealerships had John Elway's name on him and he was our he was our active quarterback at the Broncos and I didn't really know this because I was just a kid at the time but I went back and looked. I was like what happened with John Elway's car dealerships? And it turns out Elway basically had this insane story where he he while he was a player, he started these this car dealership brand selling Toyotas and like uh Chevys or something like that. And before he retires, he sells his car dealership group to Autoation for $87 million, mostly stock. And so he gets he gets paid out $90 million, which was more than he was making as a quarterback for uh you know, professional quarterback in the NFL. and um and he then also licensed them his face and his name so that they could continue using his brand all the way for like another 10 years and but he had a non-compete during that time and two crazy things happened. One um because of that because of that deal structure John Elway both made he made a bag and he lost a huge bag at the same time. So he made $87 million but then when he retires it turns out that the owner of the Broncos offered John Elway an incredible deal. He basically told him, "You can buy 10% of the team for $15 million today, and actually I owe you this like deferred salary because you're going to retire uh early or something like he owed him $21 million of deferred salary." He said, "You know what? I'll let you buy another 10% for that 21 million." And he's John Elway's like, "I don't know. That's a lot of money." And the guy goes, "I'll make it even more of a no-brainer for you. If you want to, if you change your mind, you don't like it, you want to sell the team within the next 5 years, I will pay you back everything you made, everything you put in plus $5 million and 8% annual interest." So you you literally can't lose money in this deal. Like you can only make money. Who owned the Broncos at the time? Bernie Maidoff. Because this sounds like a deal too could be true. Pat Bolan. And so Pat wanted John Elway to be part of the team. So he wanted him also to work as an exec with the team. Got it. And I guess he was like, "I'm going to pay you this money either way. How about instead I trade you stock for the team." Okay. So Elway actually turns the deal down. He turns it down for two reasons. One, he's illquid because he sold for 87 million, but it's autotrader stock. He and so he didn't have liquidity at the time. Maybe he couldn't sell right away. He didn't have the 15 million cash on hand because he had also just made an investment for $15 million into some guy named Shawn Mueller who was actually just running a Ponzi scheme that ended up failing and he lost, you know, half of his money in that. He got half of it back. Lost half of it. So, he didn't have the cash. So, he's like, "Ah, I can't do it." And then he's like, you know, also, dude, he listened to the wrong the wrong Ponzi scheme guy. I thought it was the Bronco guy. Turns out it was this other guy. Exactly. And by the way, that stake, that 20% stake, that's about a billion dollar stake today in the team. the team just sold for $5 billion. So, Elway missed out on that. And after the non-compete ended, he then went back into the car dealership business and he uh he's built it back up and now that car dealership business does like, you know, again, over a billion dollars in sales and he's worth a few hundred million from his second rodeo on the car dealership side. So, I I don't really I don't know. I didn't put enough respect on the car dealership name. Let me tell you about the the Nick Sabin one. Now, what caught my eye is that a story came out saying that they bought two dealers, two dealerships in Miami. Two two car dealerships in Miami. Guess the price. $20 million. I don't know. 10. You're only off by $680 million. Wait, why? They bought two dealerships for a reported $700 million in Miami. Oh my god. Oh, and they're Mercedes. I'm looking at the article now. Mercedes Mercedes dealerships. I think they have like an exclusive. I think they're in like the the prime ultra rich area of of Miami. But dude, I had no I I actually spent 30 minutes this morning to figure out is this a typo? Because I was like there's no way that individual dealerships could be worth $350 million. In fact, I'm still like 25% convinced that might be a typo and it might be 70 million. But I couldn't find after 30 minutes of digging, I couldn't find it. But it's pretty insane. their dealership group. They now own like I don't know 10 to 15 dealerships across like Alabama where he was the coach to now Miami. And he says that the guy said that they sell 22,000 cars a year. 22,000 Mercedes a year which is and he says they do about 2 billion in revenue on that. The partner is now worth a billion dollars on paper and Sabin will probably be worth a billion dollars after these deals. Isn't that wild? It's crazy. I did I not bring this up a while ago? I thought because I I think I read some I didn't know that he was a billionaire, but I read some stat about car dealerships. It's crazy. And you told me you wanted to cover car dealers. Interestingly, recently Forbes, they did an article with another beautiful title. It was called the car dealership billionaire no one knows. And it's about this guy named Terry Taylor who owns I think 120 car dealerships and he's also lives in Florida. But they they came across him because they're like, "Well, this guy doesn't do any interviews. He we've never seen a photo of him. We don't know anything about him." But what we do know is that someone recently bought Tommy Hilfinger. They bought his $30 million mansion in New York City. And turns out the same LLC owns $250 million worth of real estate. Who's behind this? And they find out that it's this auto dealership uh owner who owns practically the whole thing. and he owns a bunch of them and he's just making a lot of money and they eventually get a hold of him and he goes, "I heard you've talked to all my associates. Fine, I will answer just a few questions for you." And he go and the whole story is how he purposely is trying to be low-key and under the radar, but they uncover that he owns, you know, a $80 million jet. He owns all this amazing stuff. And so, turns out car dealerships shockingly amazing companies. If you shockingly amazing. Yeah. I think they get little local monopolies because I think you get like a territory. You might become the only dealer for that brand in that area and then dep and then people tend to buy from, you know, a local radius if they're not buying online. And I think the way that they work is like the car manufacturers basically do like floor financing or something like that. They basically like lend you they basically finance you to own the inventory. So you I think you're not out of pocket as much as it would sound like. It's very bank friendly. So, uh, in this article, the guy the they were talking about how once you've proven to Mercedes or whoever that you're, uh, a decent operator, they, you know, they'll they they're like, "Yeah, we would love to expand. You're trustworthy. Let's go." And then the banks will be like, "Yeah, like this is a very like uh predictable business. Like, we've seen this for 100 years. We will loan you money once you've proven to be successful." So, it's a very loanable business. Hey, let's take a quick break to talk about our sponsor today. HubSpot has put together a list of 200 AI business ideas. These are business ideas that you could create using AI and it's a list of 200. They did a huge brainstorm. So, you could check it out if you just click the link below. You can get access to these 200 AI ideas. Uh I'll give you an example of a couple of them. One of them is you could build an AI dressing room. So, let's say you go to an e-commerce site and you want to see what something would look like on you. You can use AI to actually take a picture of you and show you what the clothes would look like on you or what the makeup would look like on your face. It's pretty cool, right? Um or AI tools for real estate brokers, maybe something that takes their listings and makes them more more fancy, more more more beautiful and attract more buyers. So, check it out. It's a brainstorm of 200 possible AI ideas brought to you by HubSpot. You can get it free in the link below. The way that this happened was Sabin was sponsored by Mercedes. So he had just done some event and so he goes to these Mercedes events and he's like, "Huh, okay. Like I think like Mercedes is great." So he talks to them. He's like, "Yeah, I'm interested actually like I might maybe should like doing a dealership." And they go, "Listen, you're not going to want to operate these things. You keep being Nick Sabin god tier football coach. You go obsess over that. Let's intro. We'll introduce you to four or five of our favorite franchises that we think do kick ass. We have all the data. We know who kicks ass. and um you you you might be able to partner with one of them. So he does a 4-hour meeting with the first guy they introduce him to, this guy John. And he takes no more meetings. He agrees after the 4 hours, I'm going to partner with this guy. And he goes, it's like interviewing an offensive coordinator. When you know, you know, which was so romantic. Thought he would use like a love analogy, but he's like offensive coordinator. And this guy John is a hustler. So in addition to the car dealerships, they had a a new bourbon company that they started, Kentucky bourbon company. him saban again. And then during co they created a medical supplies business called Dream Medical Group. So they have Dream Auto Group and they created Dream Medical Group and sold over $100 million of PPE during CO 19. This guy's doing [ __ ] that by the way whenever I hear that story of someone doing PPE during co Well, it can go one of two ways. Uh you're always a hustler. You're in that circle, but it's like you're either full of it or good hustle or bad hustle. Yeah. Like there's something about it. Um, how how fascinating. I did not realize it was that big. It seems like the key to this is two things. Partnering with the right dealer before like you know I own a Mercedes and it seems like Mercedes has been booming for the last 10 years. Like they're cool now. Uh they were always they were always cool but now they're like they have it's like they have some accessible models that many people can buy. So they I imagine they're selling a lot. But also he picked the right cities. So he picked Nashville in like 2016 or something like that. You know what I mean? picking like the right geos that are growing with richer people to be able to support a dealership and where your name if you're an athlete or a coach carries weight like it's kind of silly but like just the the what is what is Elway's one called I think it's called um John Elway Chevrolet it's the number one Chevy dealer in the country because guess what we like we like our hometown kid we like the local hero you know the local quarterback who brought us to the Super Bowl right like that that's a heroic guy and John Elway Chevrolet. It does 50 to$100 million a year in revenue just that one one one dealership. Uh and you know that that's pretty crazy. And so I think these guys have done a good job. By the way, here's a quote from this this dude. Tell me what you think of this. So it says um they're talking about this guy John. They go he's even more obsessed with the financial details. Uh he's a former accountant and he compiles his own monthly statement for every single store. Quote if you say to me how's March going? I can look and say Cutler Bay sold 13 cars last night. Eight new, five pre-owned. I can tell you who the sales people were. I can tell you that Evelyn bought one. I know every name, every car we sold, how much money we made, and I tracked them on parabolic curves to make sure we're not overcharging or undercharging anybody. What a beast, man. The only thing is what is he talking about parabolic curves for? What could that even mean? I tracked them on parabolic curves. Is Isn't a parabolic curve like at the beginning of when exponential growth happens? Yeah, but what does that mean? I I track them on parabolic curves. What does that even mean? Patrick Collison tweeted this thing the other day and he used the phrase local maxima. Did you see that? Love that. Love love breaking through a local maxima. I I had to like go and figure out what all this meant. Uh he said I think worry about local maxima comes from imaging the 3D world where it is in fact easier to get trapped. I I didn't know what that meant. I had to go figure out each word had to be individually looked up. I did not know what that sentence what that sentence meant at all. And then he goes, uh, but company space has many more dimensions. So most critical points are, as you say, just saddles. There's almost always a positive gradient. You can trundle along. I did not know what any of that any of those sentences or do not. I did not. And so I had to I I shared I said, "Could somebody explain to me?" And they he and he explained what it said. And it's actually brilliant. And it I totally got into this. Here's what it means. It means um people often worry that they're g that they're going to grow their company a bit and hit a ceiling and get stuck like reaching a small success and thinking that's as far as it can go. But the original quote says that business isn't like climbing a simple hill where you can easily get trapped on a small peak. Business has many moving parts, product team, market, pricing, strategy, etc. And that creates lots of directions to explore. So even if growth stalls or slows, it's rarely the true limit. There's almost always another path forward, something you could tweak, improve, change to unlock more growth. Most stuck points in business are just temporary plateaus, not dead ends. And the saddle thing kind of blew my mind. It's a mathematical It's like a It's like a mathematical thing. Oh, I see the picture of a s shape. Yeah. It's kind of It's kind of mind-blowing actually. When I like saw this photo, it's hard to explain to the listener. We'll put we'll put the uh the photo up, but it's basically looking at a normal like X and Y axis, but now there's a third and it's 3D. And it shows that you can go forward or back, up or down. And it actually kind of was mind-blowing. I I felt like Tom Haverford uh in the show Parks and Wreck where he like sees like a piece of art and he's like, "This makes me feel something. That's so strange." And someone actually explained to him that's like, "Yeah, that's what art does." Like it makes you feel something. And I remember seeing this uh this weekend and I just sat there and I'm like, "I feel I feel I feel special after reading this." Like I've just learned and and and it was kind of cool. I think you got you got reality distortion fielded, my friend. I I think he just RDed my ass hard. Telling somebody they're at a local maxima is always one of the like pat you on the head. It's like, wait, are you patting me or are you like telling me I'm a little boy, right? If you ever use that on somebody, it's a great backhanded disc. Just says like you're doing great, but you don't realize you're still at the kids table right now and there's this other game that's the global maxima. You got to throw in a bud there like local maxima, bud. Local maxima. In fact, this article with the car dealership guy says an article on Forbes and at the end of it they go and Joe um Joe loves deal making so much he, you know, in the middle of our interview has to apologize. Sorry, pal. Don't mean to be rude. I just really got to close this deal. And I was like, "Oh, damn. He just powled you and you put that in, you put that in the article." Joe, Joe sounds cool, but also like a douche. He's got into the whiskey business, too. Check, check, check. Did you call him Joe? His name's John. Oh, I was just local maxima, bud. I don't remember for I don't remember. I don't remember names. That's hilarious. That was the uh that was the virtual version of slapping someone on the ass and say, "Go get them." Calling them by the wrong name. All right, what else we got? Uh I have some other stuff. All right. So in AI there's been these like waves where four or five of the same company will get started and they'll all get like an incredible amount of traction. So few years ago this was uh when chat maybe GPT3 or 3.5 was out it was like uh copywriting services. So Jasper, um, Copy AI, there was a whole bunch of companies that just exploded past 10 million in revenue very quickly with a with the same idea, which was like, hey, we'll help you write blog posts and marketing copy, right? Marketing copy written for you. That was like one idea. And that and then they got kind of wrecked by uh just chat GPT just became good enough where you could do all those things. You didn't need a separate tool. Um, so that they they ran into troubles. I shouldn't say they got wrecked, but they ran into to some headwinds where the grow the explosive growth didn't last forever. And then the current batch of AI companies that's doing this is um these website builders. So, Lovable is one of them. Uh Replet is another. Um Bolt is another. And so there's these website builders which is very simple like just the way you had Squarespace and Wix and all these squares uh all these um uh go you go drag and drop and make a website without code. Now you don't even have to drag and drop. You just say what you want. You're like hey I want a website for a law firm and it just gives you a beautiful website for a law firm. You're like uh make the hero thing a carousel and it makes it a carousel. Like you don't have to you don't have to code and you make these sites. And so these businesses have now exploded. They're some of the fastest growing uh companies. is I don't know the latest revenue numbers. Is cursor one of them? No, cursor is a little different. Cursor is a tool for existing developers, but like you know lovable hit 4 million was doing basically a million dollars of of ARR every week for the first four weeks and it's now at 20 million plus. That's insane. Bolt is at 20 million. Lovable is at 20 million. Uh it's crazy, right? So like they're they're growing really really fast and so those are there now. But I also kind of predict that that's going to be a very shaky space to build on. I don't know. It's going to be like a Groupon, you know, like could be could it might be that they're the next Squarespace. Squarespace, you know, eventually become a public company, but I don't I don't personally think so. I think that that's going to be just like a feature inside of ChatgBT. It's like make me a website and I think they're going to be able to do that. Something like Replet's a little different cuz it's got a whole back end or whatever. Anyways, that's all nuance. What I'm saying, what I'm trying to get to is it got me thinking, what would be a more defensible AI business? So, what's a simple business that's about AI, but is not going to get just wrecked by the next Chad GPT update. And so, I started thinking, I was like, okay, well, some of the most defensible businesses are marketplaces. And nobody's really built a good AI marketplace yet. Like, what would that even be? You know, why why not? We all know that marketplaces are super super valuable when they get built, right? eBay, Amazon, Airbnb, etc. You Uber, you these are all marketplaces. Supply, demand. Where were you when you were thinking about this? Tell me, walk me through like when you're having these these very strange conversations with your where I have this I have this room in my house where I have the best ideas and um it's like we have tile on the floor. It's a cool room because if you need to poop or pee, you're already there. If you need to shower, you're already there. It's just the bathroom. Okay. So, uh, you're just sitting in the bathroom thinking about defensible defensible, uh, AI companies. Okay. As as one does. As one does. And so I, um, and so I'm thinking, I'm like, why isn't there like a high-end like, you know, one of the hardest things about AI right now is just keeping up with the tools and being able to do something. And I was thinking, somebody should make a Upwork or Fiverr that is just for highly skilled AI doers. So, a place where I can go and I can just put up a task that I know probably somebody with AI can either do it, build it for me, or show me how to do this on a recurring basis and um make a very skilled marketplace where people can go earn a ton of money for their own AI enthusiasm. Cuz I know a bunch of people that are like really enthusiastic about this stuff and they build their own pet projects. They try every new tool that comes out, but they don't really have like businesses where they need to use them cuz they're just like AI enthusiasts. They're just like kind of bored on Twitter all day. And I think that you could if you even just had like 150 people on the supply side for this. I think every a lot of businesses know that they could probably benefit from AI. And I think if you went there and you were able to just like state your problem and then have people sort of like tell you what they could do with AI to solve your problem and you just pay them to do that, I think you could build a marketplace around skilled AI practitioners right now. I think that I think that could be built. It's like the upscale version. you know, you go you go to like the the top kind of like 1% level of quality of job on Upwork or Fiverr or 99 Designs. Dude, I always thought that like somewhere your company somewhere or something like this should uh just make it where I can hire an expert and they could come and I they could spend three or four weeks looking at my company and saying I can make this better, this better, and this better because that's what I want because I see online that everyone's like, you know, I think Shopify made this announcement. They go, "Instead of hiring, you first must say, can I hire AI?" And if you can't, then you can hire a human being. And I see these things like this and I'm like, "Oh man, I feel left out. I don't know how to do any of this." Like, like I want I want to automate all this. Like when you say AI, to me, I'm still on level one. It's just me talking to chat GBT, but then I hear about all these other things and vectors and all this stuff and I'm like, I know it's important, but I don't know how to do any of it. Do you know what I mean? It's like saying like, See See See See See See See See See See, do you want the V6 or the V8 car? And you're like, I don't know what any of that means, but I know that the V8 is better. Uh, I like that's how I am with AI and I wish I could pay someone to just come and do this. So, I think this is an excellent idea, by the way. So, you you can there's there are consultants that will do this. They'll shadow your work. They'll they'll come into your company, they'll do a discovery phase, and I mean all the way up to Accenture, I think, is going to do a billion dollars this year in AI consulting. Like big companies are hiring Mackenzie and Accenture to do it. And then small companies can hire these like indie shops to basically say, "All right, I'll pay 5 to 10 grand to come do a like six week program where you kind of figure out where you can optimize and then and then optimize." But a lot of that's so speculative and like what if what if you don't find anything? That sounds like work on my end. Here's kind of how I want it to work. So, what would you call this? What would I call it? I'd call it name. Cute name up slice. Top slice. I call it top slice. Do you remember we That's not bad. Do you remember? That's actually kind of cool. Do you remember when we talked about a team? I thought that name was so good. A team is fantastic. It was a fantastic name. A team. I like that name for everything. Let me just give out some marketing some absolute marketing gold here. Have you ever heard this phrase? I I'm almost scared to say this cuz I love like the marketing genius of this phrase is so good. Nobody ever talks about it and I really want to use the same principle on something, but I'll give it away here. Have you ever heard of marry me chicken? No, I don't know what that is that a nursery rhyme. No, it's a chicken recipe and it's like you ever It's like, oh, if you want to learn how to make my mar like this is this chicken dish is called marry me chicken because if you make it for a man, he will be like marry me right away. And it's this thing that women say it's like a it's a it's a it's a way to say the recipe and it's like if you just think about that, there's a thousand ways they could have described like this creamy chicken recipe, right? Creamy chicken. It could have been like the name of the ingredient. It could have been the the cooking process. No, marry me chicken. Love that phrase. Love the idea of marry me chicken. I think for any business you should come up with like a marry me chicken level uh description of like what the person really would want. Like how good must it be that they say marry me at the end of it, right? Um so I love that. So so I I would love to come up with something like that for this. But yeah, I think that there's an opportunity to create create something like this. Here's how I would want it to work. So I have a buddy who invests in this e-commerce company. I was like why'd you invest in that? and he goes he's doing really interesting stuff with AI and honestly I wanted to invest just so that I could like see what he's trying he's trying to build the the company the whole company AI first so he's trying not to hire anybody he's trying to do AI for pretty much every job it's ecom in the sense of they make a product and they sell it or it's like Amazon like it's like a it's like a platform they make a it's like a brand like you buy this supplement and then you and then they they sell it on Shopify and I was like oh fascinating so like what's he doing I really want to know I got an ecom brand and I think actually that's a that's kind of a good hook which is instead of saying let me study your business or um or you come in and you describe the problem that you know AI can solve because that already presupposes you know quite a bit about what AI could could or couldn't do for you. But if I just subscribed I was like hey I want you to tell me once a week what somebody paid somebody to build for their ecom brand here and show me kind of like how it works. I then as an e-com store owner would be like, "Oh, you can just I don't have to do product photography anymore. I could just use this thing to do all my photography. It actually works." Like, "Wow, that's great. I didn't even realize that." And then, oh, the next thing. Oh, they set up this agent that uh manages the supply chain. So, it takes every uh freight forward invoice and it puts it into the sheet and then it checks that sheet to make sure that there's no overages and then it and then it posts it in Slack. That's great. I have a person doing that today. That's awesome. you know, I I'd like to take that task and sell it to AI instead. And so, I think the problem with most businesses adopting AI is a problem of imagination, not capability. Like, you could sit down and figure it out or you could hire somebody to do any of these things. It's an imagination problem. For most people, they don't even really realize where they could be doing things. So, for you with Hampton for example, you might maybe it could be as granular as like memberships or paid communities or something like that. Or it might just be like somebody who's doing sales. It's like you subscribe to the sales feed. It's like cool. Anytime somebody comes in and pays for an AI uh AI job that improves their sales process, I want to know what they did. Um like I'll give you an example. In one of my companies, I have this company is growing really fast and so fast that we literally can't get enough proposals out the door. Like customers want to pay, but the sales guys have too many proposals to create. And so what he did was he created this uh our CTO created this little agent um that will listen to the sales call and it knows what our capabilities are and it just it's it's listen to the sales call and it knows our capabilities. So it autogenerates a a draft invoice of what services we should package to this customer and there probably wasn't like a good plugin and he just customized it for you. Yeah, that didn't exist. In fact, I think there's a whole startup idea somebody should build. But like he built that internally and now our sales guys as soon as they get off the call the draft proposal is ready. They just need to tweak three things. And I was like wow this is genius. Um and again like I think that should just be a startup idea altogether. It's like a you know a a tool for sales people that like by the time they get off the call the AI agent has already figured out the follow-up email the draft the proposal the CRM thing that it needs to input etc. This is kind of a 10 out of 10 idea. Yeah I think so. I think this might be a 10 out of 10. I don't know the AI marketplace or the sales thing I just said cuz they're both kind of dope. Well, the I don't know anything about the second one, but yeah, that's cool. But the first one cuz I'm like thinking like I I guess like I would easily give money to someone right now if they if like cuz a lot of times AI it feels like I don't know what I don't know, but I know it's important. Uh and it's like if just give me all the examples of how this is helpful for me and just do it. You know what I mean? Like now the the the hard part about a business like this is of course marketplaces are incredibly difficult to spin up, right? It's a chicken and egg problem. How do you get supply when there's no demand? How do you get demand when there's no supply? How do you how do you increase are you how do you figure out are you supply constraint or demand constraint? That initial cranking of the crank is really hard. So this is not something that like I would say a B B minus entrepreneur can do, you know, like I think I think you basically have to be an A+ entrepreneur to do marketplaces. uh as just like maybe a personal belief because I think the initial cranking is so difficult and takes so much kind of skill and hustle to do, but I think it's a a great opportunity because when you build them, they're very valuable when you when you do build them. And so if anybody wants to work on this, feel free to email me sea shampoo.com or DM me. I want I want to hear if anybody tries this or is interested in trying it. Well, how is Fiverr taking advantage of uh the AI stuff? Have you seen anything? Dude, I used to use Fiverr so much. I don't use it at all anymore. We'll know from the homepage. It's still the same old junk. And I feel like I bet if I had to imagine a lot of their business was graphic design and now it's basically just taking advantage of people who don't know that chat GBT exist and they're like yeah and they're like hey can you like oh I could just pay this guy to make an image. He gets back to me so fast. It takes a lot of iteration though. But but you know what? One thing I heard people do, I think there's a there's people who are rolling up the top Fiverr accounts cuz they're like, "Cool, you have top uh real estate under graphic design on Fiverr. So, you're just automatically getting, you know, hundreds of jobs a week inputed to you." So, they're buying them and then they're just replacing the creator with AI and like an AI managed service underneath it. And um I thought that was pretty fascinating. It's like buying, you know, beachfront property on the world. Sounds like a horrible idea. shittiest island. But this is Yeah, this sounds like a horrible idea because that's like uh you know what happened to the thr property like right where the hurricanes keep hitting in Louisiana. Yeah. I mean this sounds horrible. So you know the the key with any rollup is like yes either you're going to get extreme durability in which case you pay a higher multiple or you get unknown durability. But if you're buying at like 1x for example or you're buying at like one and a halfx or 2x or something like that, you can make it work, right? Like you can you can end up looking like a genius if you if you buy at a low enough multiple. So in something like this, I bet these people have never been offered anything before. It's like, oh, you'll pay me like a year of earnings or two years of earnings for for if I just walk away right now and then I know that I can kind of increase the the earnings or the cost potential, you know, the co the cost savings by, you know, 30%. And as long as it holds for, you know, two years, as long as Fiverr doesn't just go under the next two years, every year after that, it's profit, right? So, you know, you could make it work. It's not like it's not that's not a horrible idea is what I'm saying. My mother-in-law has this pillow business and it does many many hundreds close to seven figures a year in revenue and it's quite profitable. Like, she's paying herself a good salary. And um you know, now that she's got some a bunch of grandkids, she's like, "I guess I'm just going to shut this down." And I was like, "You know, Smithy, I I don't know anything about e-commerce, but I'm pretty you know, you could sell a business." And she was like, "What do you mean?" I was like, "Well, someone will pay you something like it could be one times, it could be eight times, I'm not sure, your your salary, like they'll pay you that or your owner's earnings to buy your business." And it blew her mind. And she was like, "Someone will buy this." And it it it was like amazing to hear this woman who's like killing it just on Etsy realize that someone will pay her money. Uh like to own this thing. And I don't I have no idea what it's worth. I don't know if it's one times uh if it's five times what it's worth. But it was pretty cool to see her go through this exercise. Are you doing are you actually using AI in a meaningful way in anything uh in your company? Or I'll ask differently. Are your employees using I'm sure you use it as a thought partner. Are you using it like are your staff using it on a daily basis where your company has gotten significantly more productive? Well, the example I just gave you on the sales side, that's probably the most the most impressive example, I would say. Other than that, it's like more chat GPT plus, you know what I mean? It's kind of like, oh, review this email. It's like, hey, we need to write this thing. We need to like research this thing. we need to uh draft something stuff like that is like the daily stuff. I don't we haven't like replaced job functions yet with AI. That's that's what I'm waiting for is like basically like oh we don't need to hire this person because AI an AI agent or this person with AI is better than this person with another person. But that's where something like this service is this actually plays like an interesting part here because you know it's important but you for a variety of reasons haven't implemented it. Then there's people anymore. So you know I'm not the CEO of any of these businesses. So you know they the people who run these businesses are they're their heads in the business. They're not as AI curious as I am. And yeah, but they have the same mindset which is either I'm either too busy right now or I don't exactly know how to do this or this sounds like a project that I I'm I'm a little bit ignorant on, but I know that this is interesting. And then you have all these guys who have like in the past 3 years been like raised on this stuff and they're like, "Are you a fool? Why aren't you doing it this way, this way, this way?" You know what I mean? And there that connection would be very valuable. I remember. So you we both did the newsletter business and the workflow for the hustle was probably similar than the of the workflow for dude. It was so janky. So like it what's the output? The output is we got to write an email. We got to write an email that's going to go to you know hundreds of thousands or millions of people tomorrow morning and it's got to basically say here's the most important stories that you should care about. Here's uh what happened. here's our kind of quick commentary of what it means and um let's make you laugh, right? And let's entertain you along the way and let's put in the sponsorships and all that. And there needs to be the right ads. The right ads need to be in the email. I had a full-time person whose job was to do that. And when you say the right ads, what do you mean by the right ads? Just explain the complexity for somebody who's like, "Why do you need a full-time person to make what do you mean the right ad? Just put the ad in." Because if you're sending an email to let's say three million people and you make $100,000 every time you hit send, uh sometimes like let's say Target will say, "I want to spend $1 million with you over the course of the next 3 months." And then um uh Warby Parker will say, "Well, I want to spend $20,000 with you over the next 3 weeks." You have to figure out how to mix and match. So today's email to 3 million people, uh 500,000 is going to see the Warby Parker ad. one uh 2.5 million is going to see the target ad and then next week it's going to be swapped and you have to make sure not the same people are seeing the same ad and no technology at least when I started did any of that so I had to one person manually do all of this and it's not crazy complicated but when the stakes are high and it's like my whole business it and you have ad ops was kind of the name of the job right like you're not the sales person but you're the ad ops person in between so okay great so so I met a guy who was doing a new and there's multiple ads ads per email. But even if you take the ads out for a second, if you just take the content itself, okay, so what do you need to do? That means every day somebody's figuring out what are all the top stories today. So there's like a search and then there's a curation and then you have to like so you you find all the top stories. You make a judgment call on which ones are worth talking about. Then you have to research those topics and then you have to write about you have to summarize them and then you have to maybe add some commentary, some value ad. Okay? So we had to do that every day and you know we did it with one or two writers. I think you did it initially with a few writers. And so let's say the the cost of production there was like, you know, let's just call it on the lowest end $250,000 a year. If both of us weren't so scrappy, like another person running that business, in fact, when we sold the business, it became like closer to a million dollars a year of cost to like do the editorial. Yeah, we were we were definitely spending seven figures. And so I met a guy who was doing this entire workflow with AI. So he just did that thing and he was just like, "Cool, I'm going to do this with AI." So he's like uh he He was using AI to scan specific sources to figure out what stories are hot. Then he would use AI to summarize those articles. Then he would use AI to check which influencers were reposting those articles on Twitter as a signal for like social signal of what what's important, what's what's what's generating buzz. And then he would take that final thing and then he would send it to a human dude who was living in Japan who would just like proofread it overnight and then be like, "Yep, this all is like legitimate. Fact check. Just kind of like make sure the AI didn't hallucinate." He's paying that guy like whatever $50 an hour to spend two hours on it, like a 50 or 100 bucks a day on this uh on the editing. And then he never wrote he never wrote it and he never had a writer. And it Oh, and then it auto formatted it for him. So, it created an HTML email for him. Um, and it inserted the ad and then it sent it out and then it tracked the results and it sent him a report. To take it even a step further, this sounds like I'm going to one up oneup you. I know a guy who is doing the same thing, but it's for local newsletters. And the thing about local newsletters is it's a fantastic business minus the fact that the profits are totally destroyed because you have to have local ad sales and local writers for everyone. But if you could just have like lots of newsletters uh for Raleigh, for Nashville, Louisville, but not have the writers, it would be a very great business, right? And he's doing what you're describing, but for local news. And it very quickly spins up a place, a newsletter that says like, "Hey," and it makes an ad, and it says, "Hey, Danville in California, do you want news just for Danville?" And it goes to a danville.com or whatever. And he's built this whole local newsletter empire, all automated. How's it doing? It does six figures right now a month in revenue. And it's just him doing it. And so it's him and it's um buying ads on Facebook, targeting local people to get subscribers. That's awesome. That's great. Um, very cool, dude. Our business is like, "Oh my god, thank God." Right. Thank god we got out. But, but why are you saying that? You're saying, "Thank God because it's it's just way different. It's just way more competitive now." Or, what what do you what is the underneath what is the underneath that feeling? I have the same feeling, but I think maybe for a different reason, I think. Uh, okay. So, when I started in 2016, people like laughed at us. And I know you hear that story a lot, but like people were literally like you you were that person. You said why are you doing this stupid drink? Yeah. You said people left. You you were like why are you doing this silly thing? And I was like no it's like if you run the math it could be big now like I like I I know these like hip like hipsters have newsletters. like it's like it's everyone has a newsletter and it's way more complicated inside of someone's inbox to stand out. And so it was I think I succeeded because it was a silly business that I took seriously and there weren't that many serious operators in there. And you could say I wasn't even that serious of an operator, but I still succeeded. Now there's actually really smart people trying to win the game and makes it much harder for just like, you know, it's just harder. Let's say you were motivated to start the hustle this year. What do you think would be the outcome four years from now? So the caveat is you're committed to doing it. You're going to work hard on it. Does it have to be the same genre of content? Could be different. I think I could build a significantly larger business. I think it would look a lot closer to industry dive. So where it would be lots of different newsletters built for job titles that are kind of forgotten and ignored and then to monetize it would be newsletter uh it would be advertisements but then also it would be community peer groups sort of like Hampton would be on the back end and I think I think um I think it I think it wouldn't grow as fast and I could own it forever. I think it would be very very hard to grow as fast as I grew it the hustle. And what if you did the hustle idea again? I don't think it would succeed. I think that it would I would not succeed, dude. I got to I got to like 300,000 subscribers organically in like 2 years. Like it was so easy looking back on it. That would never happen again. It it's there's too much noise. I think that to buy subscribers on Facebook, it's actually shockingly the same price. Uh I don't know if you know anything about the market. I don't. But I hear it's still like a $150. But we grew organically because we got popular on Reddit, on uh Hacker News, places like that. And it was considered outlandish and silly and remarkable what we were doing. It was noteworthy rather. It's not noteworthy anymore. So it's too hard to have something spread virally now. Do you agree? Um yeah, I think I think all the things you said are true. I but I do think you could do it again and you I think you could do I think you could do it again and win because uh you're good at that type of content and that type of business. So I think you would I think you would figure it out again and I think you'd have other advantages which is that like you know newsletter advertising is a lot more sophisticated and like available than it was back then. So but it's also cheaper now though. So we used to charge I forget what we charge but I think it was $25 to $40 per 1,000 cents. I'm hearing now it's much cheaper because there's so many options. Interesting. Huh. I I didn't know that. Um when we were doing Milk Road, um I think we were charging that or more. Um and that was only 2 three years ago. So maybe it's changed or maybe it was crypto. So it was like financial financial newsletters. I think definitely command a premium. Um so I'm not sure, but I would never do it again. It's hard. It's a way harder business than people realize. It's [ __ ] hard. Can we wrap up with me telling you something funny? Okay, let's do it. Go to this. Go to um sperm racing.com. Have you seen sperm racing? What do you mean go to it? If it's my homepage. Yeah, I mean you seem like a sperm sperm racing. Yeah, they probably they were they were trying to figure out who to set the sponsorship guy. They're like Sean seems like a sperm guy. I guess guys, two words, blank check. All right, so the world's I go there. The world's first sperm race and one of the most epic little videos behind it. Okay, so what what is this? So click manifesto and just read the first couple lines. All right, so sperm racing, when people hear it, they ask me the same thing every time. Wait, is this really happening? And the answer is always, hell yeah, it is. But here's the thing. Sperm racing is not just a joke. It's not just some viral idea for the internet to laugh at. It's something much bigger. All right, that's Let's see. Let's see if they could pay off that promise. Male fertility is declining like a lot. It's happening quietly, steadily, and nobody's talking about it. And then there's a diagram of the average sperm count in a man from the 1970s to today. And it's basically cut in half. So we have half as half as much sperm per milliliter of semen. Wow, a metric I didn't even know I didn't even know you could measure that. Didn't even know that existed. All right, til. Uh, all right. And sperm mobility, which is how fast it moves, which is a massive factor in fertility and getting pregnant, u measurable, trackable thing, just like running a race or lifting weight. It's something you can actually improve. And nobody's cared about it until now. So, we're turning health into a sport. And they built a racetrack for sperm. Two competitors, two samples, one microscopic finish line. And then they have a MS Paint diagram of the uh track. Is this a real thing or is a joke? It's 100% real. Um, can I watch this live? Can I pay-per-view for this? So, listen to what they're doing. So, here's this is from an article uh the times.com. So, once the samples are taken, which I assume that means they have to go backstage cuz like it's got to be like ready to roll right away. Uh, it's going to be placed into the middle of the stadium and a live video feed that's magnified 40 times to display the sperm will track the sample's progress. And the sperm are going to swim through a uh they typically spend swim 5 mm per minute, meaning this race is going to take 40 minutes because they're going to have them swim through this course. The event will run over three races in front of a crowd of 4,000 spectators and feature playby-play commentary, instant replays, and leaderboards. And this company, according to this article, is run by uh like uh three 17-year-olds, and they've raised $1.5 million. This is incredible. Everyone else out there who is working on a product that isn't working, take notes. All right. The hype video was amazing. I genuinely think we should be sponsoring this and or we should be the uh the presenting sponsor presenting podcast of the or bias baby. Um so, okay. So, but what are they really trying to do? Okay. So, they they're going to sell out this venue, 5,000 attendees to watch this, which is hilarious. They're um trying to raise awareness, but is this just an awareness? Is this an offshoot of a bigger brand or they want to make this a sport? I I I don't know. It's hard to They haven't They've done the right thing so far, which is they haven't uh relieved the tension from the joke. Uh like, you know, they that's I think the way to go about it. But look at the photo that I posted on here where this guy really the photo of him Eric and he says the future of technology. How beautiful is this? And so I assume that this is all about like content marketing for some type of male fertility startup. But they've done the best thing ever which is they've not acknowledged that it's a joke. And you might and apparently the founder is Eric Zoo Z Hu. But that's like a pretty common name. So you probably know No, I know this guy. I did a phone call with this kid. He was doing a uh a different startup before this that I didn't think was that like was the one. Did you advise him? Did you advise him? You're like, I I got an idea. Hear me out. I said just I said just dream about the future you want to build. And this is what he came up with. What's a secret, Eric, that you know that no one else knows? We wanted flying cars and we instead got sperm racing. Yeah. Wow. This is this is crazy. Uh fun project though, you know, like when I was um I've talked about this before actually, but I think that silly projects like this, and not to be insulting because obviously this is actually greatness, but things that to others might seem silly are um amazing starter businesses. And I think that one mistake a lot of people make when you're early on as a founder is you try to do a what you think will work. So you end up doing some like I don't know some a boring business that you're not really you don't really understand very well but it sounds good on paper or you try to you know shoot for the moon where you're not you know you shoot for the moon but you don't have a rocket right you don't have the skills the capability the network the the whatever and of of course those could work and there's no I'm not saying don't do those but I think another path that I did which was like my first business was a sushi restaurant chain like most outlandish idea yours you were doing like I don't know what your first first was but like you did a hot dog stand, you worked for the American Pickers Guy, right? You did like a bunch of random things that the business itself isn't great. You know, opportunities of sort of three out of 10, four out of 10, but at the time you don't know any better. Um, but the important thing is that you're going to build a bunch of like random skills. And so like for example with our sushi restaurant, I learned because we were trying to make stuff, I learned how to pitch investors. I learned how to do I learned Photoshop. I learned how to use After Effects a little bit. I learned how to use iMovie. We created a YouTube channel. We'd learned how to do uh you know door-to-d dooror sales. We learned a bunch of random random experiences that I wouldn't have got had I just a had a traditional job or b if I had done a startup that was just like um I don't know like more serious in nature. I guess because the startup was like a little bit fun. I was willing to do things that uh it felt normal on once the first idea is a little bit fun. you you know then your marketing idea can be a little fun and out there and then your hiring practice can be a little fun and out there. You could just sort of stack on from there. Um when you kind of have like what feels more like a sandbox where you could be creative versus um when you feel like you have a you're on tight tight rails of what you're supposed to do. I don't know if that makes a lot of sense, but that makes a lot of sense and I agree with it. And I also think reminds me of me. Um, we didn't do something as anywhere near as interesting or cool as this, but like we've talked about Henry and Dylan, those those guys who were doing uh clip, they were making content. They have this like Yeah. little like animation um uh uh what's it called? Like a service business like they do funny newsletter. They'll do like they came to our house and they built our podcast studios. They're just doing a bunch of random [ __ ] that was like building little skills for them. they weren't experts in any of those things, but they became expert level doing them. And uh they're sort of pivoting from one idea to the next. And to others, it might look like they're sort of lost, but I've seen it work out very well for myself and my friends who I was doing it with. And so I don't know if you could advise people to do that, but if you're already doing that, I would say don't sweat it. That can it can actually pay off. And Eric Zoo is listening to this podcast right now and he's saying, "I need to clip this and send this to my Chinese immigrant parents who are like like they still, you know, they're not on board with sperm racing." Uh, and imagine being 17 years old and selling out a 4,000 person uh uh stadium. I mean, that's pretty it's pretty baller. Yeah. Although they're just saying it's sold out. Is it actually sold out? Uh when you go to the ticket master when you when when you go to ticket master to buy a ticket there's a lot of blue you know there's a lot of open seats so I I don't know uh you know I'm not exactly sure but I could see this being a pretty fun thing for a bunch of college kids like are you going to go watch the sperm event the sperm race? Even the logo is so good. Everything about the branding is is extremely well done. Oh no event cancelled. What? Oh no. All right. update from the sperm guy. He's I go, "Is the event cancelled? I don't see it on Ticket Master." He goes, "No, we got effed over by the by the Palladium, I guess, the the venue." They weren't happy with the TMZ interview and some other stuff. And then he goes, "It's still the same day, but we moved it to LA Center Studios. Tickets will redrop Tuesday." Oh my god. What is What is Ask him what the other stuff is. Sounds like a sticky situation. I don't think I want to know. Yeah. All right, that's it. That's the pod. [Music]

We all run into these stats throughout our lives and most of us are just like, "Oh, that's cool." But I think there are some where it's like maybe you should actually examine this a little more closely. And so I compiled 100 plus of these and we can talk about some of them today. [Music] Steph Smith, this is your 10th time on MFM. Is that right? Not quite the tenor. And Steph Smith, the background, if you're just now listening for the first time, she used to work with me at the hustle where she ran this thing called trends, trends.co. And then she went and joined A16Z, one of the most prominent uh venture capital firms. And your whole thing right now is finding upand cominging trends, but you do it by looking at the data. Is that right? I try to. I try to, but yeah, I I guess now after trends, I run this thing called Internet Pipes. And that was kind of like trends in the way that you want to surface things that other people don't know about, but it's also about how do you show people how to catch their own fish, if that makes sense. And you come on every once in a while and you just basically have all of this data that you rattle off a story behind the number, a story behind the data, and you explain why it's an interesting trend. And sometimes you'll say like how different people are pouncing on this trend. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, lately I or recently I compiled this digits database. I call it digits. You guys call them like one chart businesses. But basically these generation defining stats like we've all talked or heard about when Bezos saw the internet was growing at some crazy rate. And he was like what does that mean? Well, it means that people will be buying stuff online in the future. Let me go create this crazy thing called Amazon. And so we all run into these stats throughout our lives and most of us are just like, "Oh, that's cool." But I think there are some where it's like, okay, maybe you should actually examine this a little more closely. And so I compiled a 100 plus of these and we can talk about some of them today. And the guy who one of the two guys who started your firm, uh, Mark Andre, he um, he has this famous quote or this famous story where, you know, people are like, you know, Mark, what's most important? Is it having a good team? Is it having a good product? Or is it picking the right market? And he goes, uh, it's picking the right market. That's easily the most important thing because if you pick the pick the right market, you could have a bad team and a bad product and it you you still like the market pulls the the the success out of you. So, for example, you could have the world's greatest team who are brilliant, who are smart, uh, and they come up with this amazing product, but if it's in a tiny market that people just don't want, then you're going to lose. But if you are Coinbase in 2014 and crypto is all the rage, which is what happened, Coinbase.com crashed all the time. It wasn't that good of a website, but people were begging for it and so they put up with it and they used it and they pulled the company into fruition and made it a success. And so you were going to show us potentially some of these markets. Yeah, maybe. Maybe. But I mean, I think that's the perfect setup because if you think about it, a bunch of other people saw that exact same data point and he was like, "Oh, well, I should go create this company called Coinbase." And a bunch of other people were like, "I'm just going to go for a run. I'm going to like, you know, go to my 9 to5 and ignore that same thing." So let's start with one that you I think know pretty well, hearing loss. So the stat or the digit is that nearly 2.5 billion people by 2050 are expected to experience hearing loss with over 700 million requiring rehabilitation. And then I saw this interesting quote that kind of was just like an a frame to take away um which is that some project that hearing aids are about to become as common as reading glasses. So you think about just like how normalized reading glasses are. People wear them all the time. You have all these optometrists. Like it's a very normal thing. Even if you think about the benefits that companies offer, right? Vision is often part of that. And then if you think about where hearing is in that equation is nowhere near that on the same trajectory yet. But if it's true that billions of people are going to require hearing loss. And you even think about some of the other signals like the fact that today we have AirPods in our ears or many people at least in our circle how many hours a day? Like eight. Exactly. That was not true 10 years ago. Right. Wait. So why first of all I wear hearing aid. I wear I've had probably 10 or 12 surgeries on my ears. I was born with bad ears and I fought putting a hearing aid in because I didn't want to look old. And a lot of times on this podcast people see me where I'll do this uh and I do it instinctively because I'm always leaning in with my good ear. Um and so I wear a hearing aid and it was uh it's they all suck. But why are more people needing a hearing aid? Is it because something's going on or is this a normal number and there just more people? No, I mean I think the technologies that we use are influencing a greater number of people who experience hearing loss. Like if you think about even as you said there's a cultural element to it too. Like I go to Soul Cycle the first year I went no one's putting in the earplugs. Like it's so uncool to put in the earplugs. And then as you know, I've been doing it for a few years now, it's like maybe 10 20% of the class is putting in the ear plugs. People put earplugs in because the class is too loud. The class is way too loud. And by the way, even think about the technologies that we have that now signal to us some of this stuff. Like your Apple Watch will tell you when you're in a SoulCycle class, this is damaging your ears. Like if you do this for more than 10 minutes, you will impair your ears in a permanent way. And so the point around the cultural side is interesting because I don't know if you experienced the same thing, but I grew up in the '9s like glasses were not cool. And then now you see like some people when you're like, man, you look so much cooler cuz the glasses you wear. Like I wish I almost wish I needed glasses. That's how I used to feel like when I was in third grade about braces. If you had braces, you were cool. It's like I need braces. I don't know if I ever felt that way about braces. Well, that's probably why I didn't have a girlfriend until I was 21 years old. Um, are there any interesting um, companies in the hearing aid space that you've seen? Because when I was trying to get a hearing aid, there was all types of like promises of like this will listen to the words that people are saying and it's going to repeat it in your hearing aid. And it was stupid. And and honestly, I I think I paid two grand for a hearing aid. They're really expensive. And the app is horrible. Like, it's these are not good products. One time in fact my hearing aid broke and got stuck in my ear and I had to go to the hospital just to get part of it out. So I've had all types of Yes. It was horrible. Oh my god. You should you should found a company in this space cuz you know of all the problems but I don't know the hearing aid space as well. Um I have been seeing a lot of people who have been getting Have you heard of Loop the earplug company? It's just these kind of like nifty looking earplugs which again you go to something like a workout class and they give you these disposable like bright yellow earplugs that you can't even get into your ear. And so I do think there's going to be like again on the cultural side, how do you create products that not only to your point are solving the problem like they have utility, but they also shift in this direction of, oh, I look cool, I feel cool, I want to wear this thing. Dude, this company Loop is going to kill it. They sell $50 earplugs. Oh my god, this is Yeah. And it's super smart marketing. Like if you go if you just search Loop earplugs like they've got a page and they're like earplugs for events because again they're not they're not marketing to like oh the everyday user necessarily for this stuff. Um it's like oh you're going to a concert, you're going to the Super Bowl. It's going to be really loud and these look really cool. People don't even realize they're earplugs. All right, my friends. So, a lot of you guys who listen to the show, you listen because you want to start a company, but you're not sure what idea to choose, or you may not even have an idea, and you like our podcast, My First Million, because we've done a lot of the work for you on researching all these business ideas. Well, my friends, we've made life a lot easier for you because HubSpot, they just put together an entire list of all the resources that you can use to find a market opportunity to validate for your next business idea. So, if you're looking for a market size calculator or tools to identify market trends or a huge list of ideas to get started. So, if you're interested, there's a link below. Click it and you can have access to the whole thing. It's completely free. Now, back to the show. All right, let's move on from hearing stuff. But one last fact, did you know this is one of the reasons why I succumbed and got the hearing aid is if you have a hearing loss and you don't address it, the increase of getting dementia jumps significantly like four or five times. And I believe there are two reasons. One, that part of your brain that hears stuff because it's not working, it begins to atrophy, and that's correlated with dementia. But also the second reason, and I find myself doing this all the time, is when I'm at a restaurant or something, I cannot hear the difference between someone talking to me in the background noise. And so I usually just zone out. And if you zone out all the time, like you're you're going to be like mentally like or uh permanently kind of zoned out. Uh I believe those are the two theories as to why that happens. But uh so yeah, getting your hearing fix is is a big deal. What's another one you want to do? Okay, so rounding out the hearing loss thing, by the way, um something we didn't quite touch on there is the fact that they went over the counter in 2022, which means like you don't need to get a prescription. And that also I think is, you know, opening the aperture. And you guys often talk about these like policy or legislation related shifts or unlock. Yeah, we call them um I call them regulation inflections. So something changes drastically. So, for example, uh one negative inflection is like New York bans Airbnb. So, there's like an inflection where like short-term rentals are just going to go to zero versus if they were to there would be an inflection where they now say it's allowed. There's a a massive change. Yeah, exactly. So, one of them is the FAA um has made a few changes recently and I want to call out two and one of them is around drones. So, consumer drones have existed for quite a while. I have a DJI drone. People use them for anything from like just filming your neighborhood. Real estate agents use them to like capture better um imagery of their assets. But recently the FAA changed regulation for some companies where they can fly drones beyond line of sight. And that doesn't sound like a big change, but if you can fly a drone beyond your like visual aperture to actually see what it's doing, well, it enables things like drone delivery. There are companies like Zipline. I'm sure you've heard of Amazon playing around in this space. That changes the game. Another change that the FAA made recently is they started approving these electric vertical takeoff and landing companies, the EV tool companies. And again, that was in the news, but what wasn't covered as much was the fact that this was the first new category of aircraft in nearly 80 years. And the one just before this was um called light sport aircraft. You know what light sport aircraft is? No, it's helicopters. It's small business jets. These are things that like each individual is a massive industry. And if you think about like how um you know if you take like super wealthy people who take helicopters who take these business jets like that's meaningfully changed their life and each one of those is a vertical. Um EV tool again this is the first new category of aircraft in 80 years. You can only imagine like we're in the early stages that word EVOL. So again it's like electric vertical takeoff and landing. So there's some companies who are playing in this space obviously like I think Joby Aviation is one. Archer is another one. Um we had we had Brett Atcock on the pod and he started a thing called Archer which is publicly traded and they've uh I think they have some huge deals with United um things like that. Yeah. So I mean if you think about this is like thinking more long term but these are designed specifically to be you know operating within cities taking people from like one end of New York to the other airport trips and if you think about like what that kind of is a parallel to is not the like mega you know Boeing air jets it's actually more like cars right and if you think about how cities have been oriented around cars what businesses have been drawn up from there. I think again these are two legislative changes that are uh in the long term going to meaningfully reshape the way that we all engage. one of our friends um I or Nikita who a lot of people know uh who he is. He was telling us I have to get it right but I believe he told me that he invested in a company where if you are in LA and you call 911 the police will take however long to get there. Let's say 20 minutes or something because LA is really big 30 minutes uh or even just 10 minutes but they send out a drone right away to go and see what's going on. Have you seen that? Yeah, we at A16Z is invested in a few of these companies. So, they get there more quickly, but they also have a safety angle from the perspective of, you know, if someone calls 911, they're telling you something. Um, sometimes they're just reporting like, hey, I think there's a scary person like on the highway doing X or I think there's a someone in this alley and they have a gun. And the ability for these drones to not only get there more quickly, but to validate the statement and say, "Oh, actually, like that's not a gun. That's a poster in a, you know, in a tube or something like that's it. That changes their ability to actually react to the situation more." Yeah. You just got a guy like want to show off like his Lamborghini poster from like the Scholastic Bookf Fair instead of like a gun. Yeah, that makes sense. Happens all the time. Yeah. No. Yeah. Been there. Been there. What are some other ways people could pounce on this? Well, I I think the thing that I'm trying to drive home here is like these are obviously going to take years if not decades to influence us in major ways. But is for people to ask questions like for example if there is drone delivery at scale. Think about even the ways that we package goods and the fact that you package a good to sit in a truck to travel across the country and it needs to have certain levels of padding of, you know, to make it unbreakable. All of those things potentially change if we're able to, you know, pick something up and drop it off a mile away, right? So, I think it's just encouraging people to ask about, you know, if this is true, what are those second third order effects? If it's true that there's going to be a lot more autonomy, like how quickly does that ramp up? You take like Whimo, which is a lot of people think of is in like Phoenix or San Francisco. I just read an article the other day saying that Whimos are already taking up 20% of Uber rides in Austin. And so this stuff can like move pretty quickly. I had a I don't I don't smoke weed anymore or do anything like that, but I had like this thought the other day cuz I had to send someone a letter in California. Isn't it insane that for what's a stamp cost? 40 cents, 50 cents that I can send a letter 3,500 miles and it will reliably get to pretty much any house I want to in a matter of like four or 5 days. I think that is insane. That is that is so crazy. And to think that like so there's that type of delivery that I think of all the time and I'm like the post office, USPS, uh UPS, FedEx, these companies are wild. That's got the biggest mode ever to build that that is so freaking hard. But then there is the last mile component and that's this whole other thing. And to think that drones that that's what's going to be happening is that drones are going to be flying everywhere. It's pretty wild to like imagine like the moat that a company in the space has. It it is it's it's it's it's hard to like comprehend because if you think 50 years ago to try to explain to someone, no, you're not going to go to Walmart anymore. You're not going to go anywhere. Everything's going to come to your door. It to think how is that going to change in the next 20 or 50 years? It's hard to comprehend. Totally. And I think to your point, it's like are people on this podcast going to go create like the next Whimo or the next Zipline? These companies that have been working on these problems for years and years and years? Maybe not. But okay, if all the or if a significant number of cars on the road are autonomous, who's cleaning those cars, right? Who is creating the LAR that goes into the cars to so that they can actually drive safely? Who is, you know, actually coordinating the cleaning and the use of these cars, the degradation of them, who's the person that gets called if there's an issue in a Whimo. All of these are new businesses. The same way that like when Airbnb was big, the answer wasn't go create another Airbnb. It was like go create the cleaning companies and the and the operations companies to run an Airbnb, right? Like there's there's still, I think, a lot of opportunity on, you know, on the edges of these major trends. All right, let's do another one. Let's go to the psychedelics thing. So this one is just is pretty simple like psilocybin has been illegal for a long time in the United States and elsewhere and it was decriminalized in the first state which was Oregon in 2020 and has subsequently become decriminalized in a host of other states and cities with you know lots of legislation pending and this is another one where we're talking like what's going to happen not in the next year but several years if not decades but people are already jumping on this some people are doing psychedelic retreats you know again a policy change that we're seeing. I think we have a few Hampton members that have these psychedelic retreats and I've seen some of these. Did I ever tell you that I tried to go to one? I think it was in 2018 or something like that. Like right when the stuff was getting popular, I knew this person. It was a friend of a friend. Jack introduced me to this person, my friend Jack, who was like hosting. He said it was a shaman. And I was thinking it's going to be some brown dude and like a like a like a sheet. like he's going to say like namaste as I walk into their house and take off my shoes and they ask us to go to this meeting in advance to see if it was a good fit. So I go to the meeting and it's just this like normal looking white lady uh in San Francisco in uh in a condo, a fancy condo building and we sit down for um for dinner and uh so she can get to know us to see if it's a good fit if we actually want to go through with this like psychedelic experience with her. And she like does a few things, but she's like, "So, where are you from?" And she was like I I was like, "Oh, Missouri." And she's like, "Oh, fly over country." And I was like, "Bitch, what the [ __ ] Are you insulting me right now?" And she said like three more things making fun of like where I was from and like mocking me. And she was like, "What do you do uh for a living?" And she I was like, "Oh, I I like kind of work in like technology and the internet." And she's like, "Uh, capitalism really bothers me." And I looked at her LinkedIn in advance. She worked at Lehman Brothers. That's where she worked at. She worked at Leman Brothers before she became a she's now doing psychedelics. I go, "Lady, you worked at Lehman Brothers. You were literally a venture capitalist. What are you talking about?" And then uh at the end she was like, "Uh, by the way, it's got to be $2,000." I'm like, "Lady, you just said you hated capitalism. All right, what the hell is going on?" Uh, and so I got asked that night not to come back and I was disinvited from my psychedelic experience, which probably shows that I need this more than anything. But, you know, well, I was going to say you definitely like those are some pretty bad vibes and you definitely do not want to be on psychedelics, you know, with that with that introduction. I got I got kicked out of my psychedelic group. So, that was my only experience. I wanted to I forget what it was like ketamine or MDMA. I don't know, but everyone said it was dope and I was like, let's see what this is about. I got kicked out of the group. But um I have seen a bunch of these like retreats. I do think it's cool. I have friends that are like I've got a couple vet buddies who have done it and it's like changed their life and we had Scott Galloway on here and he says that it's been really helpful. So I'm on board with them. I'm just not on board with it for me. You know, it's kind of like I say cornrows, you know, it's cool for other people but not for me. Cornrows and face tattoos and psychedelic retreats. Yeah. Uh, any any other interesting opportunities with the psychedelics? I mean, I think maybe the marketer in me, not that I'm trying to like push psychedelics, but I think a lot of people think of them as either you do it if you're like just a druggie and you just, you know, you do these all the time, or you do it if you're in a an impaired mental state and you need to like get past something. Like, let's say you were a vet and you had some terrible experiences. is like there's a lot of ketamine assist assisted therapy that's popping up psilocybin as well. But again, it's it's often to solve some kind of negative experience in your life and get past that. If this does become more normalized, I think some of this at like a much lower dose um you could imagine being very helpful in smaller life decisions or for example, you're starting a new job. You're trying to decide if you want to join one company versus another. You're trying to decide if you want to quit. You're trying to decide if you want to have a child. Those are not things um that like have any direct relationship to psychedelics, but are things that people have a really hard time understanding their perspective, understanding how they relate to, you know, let's say their partner or their family. And I think that could be a future scenario. Like imagine if you had someone guiding you through a psychedelic experience specifically related to your career, specifically related to again like the difficult and very meaningful decision of having kids. I think there's something interesting there. I completely agree. That's actually a really cool idea where like for example, if you like are in a certain social class, like you don't have the same problems as someone who um who's not in that class. So like when I quit drinking, I went to basically like a mental clinic in South like in in Soma and it was like me and like everyone else was homeless and I was like what am I doing here? But the reason I went was because I didn't have any income cuz I had just started my company and I was like saw it on Yelp and I went to this place and I stuck to the same doctor for like 10 years. She was amazing. And then there was at one point where I remember telling her like certain problems that I had and this woman had never worked with anyone else that had similar types of problems because she wasn't used to a client like mine. And I was desperately seeking like a therapist who had like people who were at like maybe a higher higher tier on Maslo's hierarchy of needs. And it was so hard to find like a person who could serve that need. You know what I'm saying? And so that is very interesting to have like a different genre of psychedelic guides or whatever the hell they call them. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, because to your point, even within therapy, for a long time, people thought therapy was only for when you're kind of about to divorce, right? They're like, we only provide therapy for when there is a clear issue. And then now therapy has expanded a lot, right? Like people do it preventatively, people do it because they just like their therapist and just need someone to talk to. Like there are many different reasons now that people do therapy. And I think obviously in the, you know, People on their own do psychedelics for many different reasons. But you could imagine that if this is going to be something that is no longer illegal. People are building businesses around that they can build those businesses for kind of these these other needs. It does there doesn't need to be a problem. Is this going to become like a whole therapy session for me? I'm telling you about these doctors that I used to go like when I was homeless or like uh about my psychedelic getting kicked out and how I'm deaf. Oh my gosh. Every time you come on here, man. Uh can you talk about this job stuff? I find this the most interesting. Okay. So a few things. I think the most, you know, relevant thing to the listeners would be that AI is here. Bunch of people are freaking out about jobs. They're wondering, you know, do I still have a job? Are my skills still relevant? And so I think it's just interesting to discuss number one like what are the new jobs that are on the horizon? What are the existing jobs that are going to become more important? Um, and then I have some other, you know, some other ideas that we can talk about. But like first, did you know that the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports all the time every year or I think more frequently what the um fastest growing jobs are? And do you know what they are? Fastest growing jobs. Yeah. Uh, white collar stuff. So like in uh computer engineers, graphic designers, anything involving computers. Yeah. So there's like of the top five there's data scientists, there's security analysts, but there's also wind turbine service technicians, there's solar panel installers, nurses are also on there. Further down the list, I think some of the interesting ones are certainly in the like again climate installation um operations space. Like one interesting thing that I didn't realize cuz I've never owned a house with solar panels is that you don't only need to install them, but in order for them to be efficiently used, they need to be cleaned. And some, you know, if you want to get the max efficiency out of them, they need to be cleaned like every 6 to 12 months. So it's like, who's cleaning those solar panels? Like that's an opportunity on its own. Other things on the list, I'm just scrolling down it. physician assistants, actuaries. But over the last two decades, some of the fastest growing jobs were manicurists, HR managers, event planners, massage therapists, and compliance officers, which is also interesting. I have a uh I have a this small website called Sam's List where uh you can it's like Yelp for accountants and you know we it's a tiny website but I think we have three or 400 accountants on the website and the woman who runs it Kimmy has talked to like all 400 of them and the common complaint that they all have and it's like horrible for my business because Sam's list like the way it makes money is a user who needs an accountant for their business or for their personal life. They go on and they can submit their information and then also we allow other accountants to pay us money to go and like basically like bid on that client's like you know you this person is looking for this. Can we also pay money for them for us to be shown or introduced to them? And it's a horrible business for me because what we've noticed talking to 400 accountants is that they don't need more business. They they go we have enough business. What we need is more accountants. They're like, "I can't hire fast enough." Like, it's no one wants to be an accountant and we just simply do not have people who want to work here. Yeah. And by the way, those are exactly the industries that people should be looking at for building AI products, right? If you think about even just the selling motion that you need to do for any new product, if you're going to a company and they have ample demand and there's like a very very liquid market for talent, well, that means that they can probably get talent for cheaper, they have to worry about like, oh, am I going to bring in this AI tool and then fire or lay off a bunch of my existing staff? Like, those are all considerations. But in the world of accounting where let's say like you said there's a firm and that firm is is like I can't hire fast enough. I literally don't have people I have clients who want to pay me and I don't have you know the the staff to actually facilitate that that project. Well then it's an easy um cell right to be like I can support you in this way. Um, so I think that's just like AI is obviously being applied to a lot of the obvious areas, but a lot of these industries where there is not enough talent, there is and you know that is in my opinion where where folks should be looking. There was two different members in Hampton who had companies uh so in nursing there's a huge shortage of nurses in America. Um, and it's a great job. It pays really well and you get good benefits oftent times. I mean there's the downside is like you're obviously working with sick people and it's probably it's a tragic uh can be tragic sometimes but there's a huge need and you have relatively secure you know you will always be able to work they have these things um called travel nurses so a lot of hospitals are lacking nurses and so they'll pay you know extra money to have someone come and stay there for 3 months or to stay there Monday to Friday or wherever like you know the 5day block or a three-month block and there's There's there's a bunch I think Trusted Health is one of them where they build these massive businesses all around facilitating getting a travel nurse to the hospital in need. And I believe uh Trusted Health I I have no connection with these guys. I just saw them online. I believe that they are a a unicorn. I think they they've raised funding in the billion dollar plus range. I mean, I've heard that that's a huge industry and and the fact that like again, we talked about it last time, silver tsunami, a lot of a lot more nurses are needed and the concentration of that talent is not always where it needs to be and so it makes sense. All right, let's do one or two more. What else? What? Tell me some other interesting ones. Well, one note about the just the world of of jobs. Um I want to get your take on this is we've talked before about pay transparency and there are I think over a dozen states that have also you know put pay transparency law in action and that's why it's like California is one of them. You go to a website you see a new job posting and you see um how much that job makes. one super simple um opportunity for folks that I haven't seen but I I'm sure someone's building this is basically just the glass door for open salaries like there's levels.fyi FYI, kind of a more aggregate level. But if you take what glass door did, glass door basically became the they had a bunch of other features, but like why did people go to glass door? One, they wanted to see if a company had like good or bad reviews, TBD on if that was actually useful. But then they also mostly wanted to see how much am I going to make at this company? Like if I'm negotiating, what should I ask for? And that relied on people who worked at that company to submit their salary, right, to glass door. And then they built up this database and that was their moat. Today all of that is online right all every time a company is posting a job posting they are saying how much they pay and I have not seen anyone aggregate this information in a meaningful way where if I'm again if I'm trying to join a new company or if I'm trying to negotiate I'm still going to glass door which is crazy to me because even glass door has really limited data in my opinion and so someone should just go and again like you would need to build this up over a little bit of time but someone should be scraping these salaries off of different website or different companies and building up this database completely usurping again the like requirement of people uh needing to submit their salary themselves. Is that like is the range huge like so for example A16Z I assume they're California based uh so like would they list the sal let's see do they list their salaries there? They do and lots of other companies do too. And people only notice this when they are in the job process and so they have a snippet of time and often jobs that are not the same as the one that they're applying to. Right. Oh, sorry. So, I just went to Andre Horowitz. I clicked a fund assistant controller. I assume that that is uh related to accounting. They're going to work closely with assistant controllers and fund. So, it's a finance accounting job. It says the expected pay for this position is between $216 and $252,000, but the actual starting pay may vary based on a range of factors which include experience. They have to say that. They always say that. Yeah. Interesting. So, wow, that is very intriguing. I did not think. Would it say like in order to be like a legit partner at A16C or something like will they even list like the jobs that uh are paid potentially millions of dollars? They have to. But the thing that is worth calling out is that they are only required as in through law to my understanding is to put base pay. So obviously a lot of these jobs not just at A16Z have other mechanisms for rewarding people and so that this is only one part of the story but also if you've ever gone to glass door glass door has been terrible at capturing that other segment in any case and so at the very least again a lot of this information is out there and I think you take this like age-old company well actually I don't know when was glass door even founded let's see it's not that old it's not age 2007 is I would say I would say It's internet. What does age old mean? It's as old as age. It's it's in my opinion, you know, it was great for the first version of the internet and now again like there are there's a change in legislation here uh fitting with our theme, but also it's like the technology exists in a way for us for someone to be able to scrape this really easily and aggregate this information across you know not a few companies but many many companies. What else do you want to cover here? I uh I read a book that you suggested because of this whole animal thing. It was called like the five senses or what's the the the animal? It's called an immense world. An immense world. You have heard me give this spiel so many times but I Okay, so there's this book an immense world. It's by this guy called Ed Yang. And whenever I explain it, it sounds really obvious, but you know, obviously does not do the book justice. But it's about the fact that we as humans are familiar with five senses. is like this is how we interpret the world. Even within those five senses though, they are not equal. We talked about hearing for example, but sight for sure is the the sense that not only humans tend to use the most to interpret the world, but also if you benchmark that versus other species other than birds, we have the most precise vision um of you know again the the animal kingdom. We have really strong vision and again that drives the way that we see the world. I say that because this book is about recognizing that yes this is how humans see the world but every animal again this is not surprising is uniquely tuned to their environment their prey you know how they survive. Um, and for many it's, you know, sight is not the most important way that they interpret the world, but there are senses that we don't have that they use again to engage. And then again within the five that we're familiar with, it's just it's worth acknowledging that for example, the way that you know the spectrum of light that we see or the spectrum of temperatures that we're comfortable in are just simply not the way that you know other animals exist. If you take an arctic squirrel or if you take a camel and you put them on hot plates, uh they will not move at temperatures that we think are crazy and uncomfortable because they are comfortable. for example, or if you take um UV light, which we can't really interpret, other animals or creatures will react to that. So, that's my spiel about like what the book is about and it obviously does a better job of making that interesting. But this is my first million and the reason that I'm bringing this up is because there is this this I think converging world of nature and technology which has always existed to an extent but at the same time I think for a long time people thought that technology was kind of adversarial to nature cuz it's like humans were like moving forward and we're progressing and we're leaving nature behind and sometimes even destroying you know that natural world. But I think there are tons of examples whether it's whether it's Velcro being, you know, modeled off of bock burrs, whether it's bullet trains being inspired by the king fisher's beak, whether it's NASA learning how to design airplane wings uh to be more like birds. We not only learn a lot from nature in the way that we build technology and I think that's an interesting thread we can pull but also there's a really interesting space of how technology is actually getting us closer to understanding the animal kingdom and communicating with it. So we can pull any of those threads but that that's my nature technology rant. Keep going. Uh I'm fascinated. Keep just keep talking. What were you now you on on this document you were talking about a trip you took, but does that weave into this? Yeah. So, I just came back from the Glavos Islands. Have you ever been there? No. I And I'm super ignorant. Um I if I'm being honest, I don't even know where it is. Uh but I know it's related to Darwin. That I mean I'm I'm incredibly ignorant of Gopagos. Yeah. So, okay. The Gopagos are um I think it's 600 miles west of Ecuador. Um so they're in the in the Pacific. There's a set of islands that Central America, right? I mean I South America, but yeah. So I'm not I'm not the biggest uh South America, Central America expert. I don't even know I don't know too much about it. Ecuador is on, you know, the north end of South America. Okay. Um, so basically they're part of Ecuador, but a lot of people know them again because of like you said Darwin. They are this, at least from my perspective, and I've been to 50 or so countries, the most kind of uh nature scape trip I've ever done where you actually feel like you're entering their world versus the opposite, right? Um, and so the reason uh it fits into Darwin's story is when you have a bunch of islands, uh, the way that these different species evolve across the different islands, especially land um, bearing or land uh, creatures who can't make their way AC, you know, from one island to another. They end up evolving differently due to the unique fauna, due to the unique environment, set of predators, etc. on that particular island. And so he was like, "Wait a minute, why are there, for example, bluefooted boobies, which are a type of birds, and red-footed boobies on two different islands." Um, and that was him witnessing some of these. He did a lot with finches and I think some of the giant tortoises. Like he he noticed these things and then that was his kind of like aha to understanding evolution. I never heard all this story. Like I I I knew nothing about Darwin. This is actually the first time that I've ever like heard like the I'm sure there's a lot more to the uh you know the aha moment story, but I have never heard that before. Yeah. And he he did a lot of his research there and I think in particular with the finches, I think there's like 17 kinds of finches. And the interesting part is like when does an animal become a separate species, right? So you take these two finches, they exist on different islands and then like they're evolving. At what point do they become a new species? It's when they no longer mate with each other, right? So one interesting thing, fun fact is just they had these, you know, one example is lava lizards. And these lava lizards would do um these mating dances, but in the case uh for them they're doing these push-ups. At least that's how humans like describe this mating dance. But because they're different species that have evolved on their unique islands, it's like one lizard might do like three push-ups, another one might do five, another one might do it like a little bigger uh or funkier than the others. Um, but what's crazy is that like they will not mate with each other. Like if you take one lava lizard from one island and the other one's doing, you know, the males doing the push-ups for the females, just slight differences in how it's being done. It's like, nope, sorry. Like, we no longer mate. And one interesting takeaway for me, and this is just me again, like this is nothing to do with business, is just that's never happened to humans. Now, there are some like bad historical examples of like segregation and stuff, but for the most part, like we've existed on different continents evolved, right? and over long long long periods of time like you still like someone from Australia will still mate from some with someone from North America which who will still mate with someone from Europe etc. Right. Like I just thought that was that was an interesting like I wonder why that is. I've heard of a bunch of friends of mine doing push-ups to impress some lot lizards, but never lava lizards. Steph, do you know what a lot lizard is? I don't. Is that embarrassing? No, it's it means you're It means you're much more sophisticated than me. A lot lizard is a prostitute that serves truck drivers. Oh, that makes sense. I feel like if you know what a lot lizard is, that sort of says what part of the tracks you're from. You know what I'm saying? I hear you. So, you're talking about Galapagos Islands and Darwin and you know the eight senses that animals have. But if I know a few people that know a few things about lot lizards if you want to talk about that. Uh just saying uh what's this um ask nature thing? So if people want to go down the rabbit hole of exploring kind of not just like let me go look at pictures of animals but understanding like how do animals produce color? What are the examples of technology being inspired by natural design? For example, like a search algorithm that was inspired by ants. This is so fascinating. So, Ask Nature has this um they have this like there's all stuff you can click on. So, there's one about the African darter. Apparently, that's a type of bird and it has a very special feather that is incredibly waterresistant. And then it tells you like different applications that this potential feather or like inspiration of this feather could have. And it talks about like the strategy of how it works and like the potential for copying this feather. This is amazing. How did you find this website? This is really cool. So someone shared it within internet pipes. We have this survey whenever people join which just asks like what's your favorite tool? A lot of it ends up being what you expect chatbt hs etc. But there are a bunch of gems that come through like this. And so by the way is internet pipes. It's literally just tons of different resources for finding these things. So what the product started as it was I hate the term course but it was a course that existed to say it's called a book. It was a book. It was a book. It exists in notion and there's videos and there's text and now there's a community and now there's things databases like the digits database. But the origin was okay the most common question I get asked is you find all this cool stuff online how do you find it? Um, and so internet pipes was showing people how to find this information through a series of tools. And that's why it's called pipes, right? It's like use this tool to make sense of all of all of the purchase that purchases that are happening on Amazon, all of the pages that exist on Wikipedia, all of the searches that are happening on Google. And you know, you go down the line, this data exists. And by the way, we're at a unique period where like it didn't quite exist 15 years ago. in 15 years from now probably everyone will know it exists. And so it's like this internet pipes is a course, a book, whatever you want to call it, to learn how to do that. And you've made a lot of money off of it so far, haven't you? Yes. That's pretty dope. When you answer just yes, that means I'm not going to ask how much. Six figures. There's a pretty wide range of, you know, does the six figure include the 0? So it could really be like 1,00.00. It's eight figures now. Got it. Um, this is a really really cool website. I could spend hours just looking at this. Like there's an article about like camels fur and how uh it keeps people cool or it keeps camels cool in the desert but also warm at night and why that particular type of fur is special for this. Like it's so and the reason it's kind of interesting is like the the two that I've named are clothing related, but like if you had a clothing related brand like some type of like it's stealing the story for you like it's like or not stealing it's giving you the hook. Do you know what I mean? Exactly. Exactly. And by the way like people in our world in business tech are always talking about the like lindyness of something. How long has something existed for? And it's like you are learning from millions of years of evolution, right? um of these these animals that have become purely optimized for this purpose. And to your point, I think like the marketer and both of us is like what could you know what products could you make off of this? Like there's one like the otter where it's like it keeps it keeps heat in and cold water out. So otter and I'm sure every single wet suit company has like stolen this marketing for their branding or whatever, but like so it's like really fascinating. Sorry. Go ahead. Well, did you ever see you know Mischief, right? Mischief. Mischief is uh the company like weird projects like they did like a a blood shoe for with Lil NasX or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. So, they've they've done a ton of shoe collabs. They did one I think it was I don't remember if it was with Jimmy Kimmel or they just announced it, but it was called the Gob Stomper. Did you ever see this? No. I thought they were kind of cool. They basically the bottom of the sneaker comes gray at first and then as you wear it more basically like as your shoe wears away it looks like a gobstopper and it was just like which is the candy that you suck on and each shell layer of shell it turns colors. Okay, cool. Yeah, exactly. And so my like you might think this is the silliest idea ever, but when I went to the Gopagos and I saw these red-footed and these blue-footed boobies, and by the way, fun fact for the listeners, the reason that these birds have different colored feet is because of what they eat, which I just thought was like so strange and interesting. Basically, like the two different birds on different islands eat different things and that ends up um impacting the pigment in their feet. But imagine a sneaker brand that was, again, stick with me here. This might be a really awful idea that's related to health in some way. So like, let's say you're wearing a CGM and on your shoes, your shoes change color in some way based on how like if you're in range or some other metric that you care about. But basically, you're able to signal something in a way that changes through your feet. Like that awful idea. Well, it could be like if you know, we could we could we could show your fertile or something. It would help with the whole lot lizard thing. Have like those parties, right, where you wear like what are they called? The stoplight parties where you wear red, yellow, red, or green. That's pretty. So, we could stop light shoes. Maybe that's a better version of the idea. We just put all of our um uh blood work on our, you know, like I don't have a thyroid issue. I'm good. Yeah. Your like your function health results show up in your in like a pendant around your neck or let's let's let's end here. I think we got a ton of stuff. Steph Smith, um thank you very much. Internet pipes steppmith.io. Is that your website? Technically, yes. I I haven't updated it in a while, but yeah, if people are interested in internet pipes, I think we dropped a code last time, MFM, if people want to use, and they can get that that digits database of 100 stats. We talk about ship building, disaster insurance, you know, tech literacy, nomad visas, all that good stuff. All right, God bless America. We're done. That's it. That's the pod. Thanks, M. [Music]

Sam, do you know Seronic are building these unmanned surface vehicles for the ocean? God, this looks sick. Sam, just take a guess. How many ships are in the US Navy fleet? 500. Only 300. That's just like a very small number to me. And we have 67 submarines. That's it. Average cost of these is something like $250 million. In Silicon Valley, the smartest tech people, nobody was working on defense. Defense was taboo. And comes out and what they did was they said, "We're going to do this. We're going to use the Silicon Valley method and talent to do this. We're going to change the cost structures." And they've built now a 20 to30 billion dollar company doing this. And now it looks like Seronic is basically doing that in the um ocean defense space. This combination of elite talent, robotics and AI and autonomy. and you pair it with this old industry and I think you have a pretty unique window to build a very big company doing

Three years ago, my mother-in-law, she goes, "I think I want to start a business online. Can I drive to the airport? Uh, you can like tell me how like the internet works." Free ride to the airport. Sweet. Yeah. Yeah. And I give her like the most highlevel like advice ever. 3 weeks after that, she sends me this website. I'm like, "This website looks beautiful. That's my website." And I'm like, "What?" She's like, "Yeah, in fact, I already got my first sale." Well, fast forward 3 years ago, she's done over a million dollars in revenue. If you go to her Etsy page, that's where I think a lot of her sales come from. 8,000 or 10,000 sales. So, basically what she sells is like really high-end throw pillows, which is as a young man I was like, "Throw pillows? Who the hell buys that?" Well, women love throw pillows. So, she's handmaking these. Yeah. Well, she now she has a little warehouse in New Jersey. I tweeted out that story 2 days ago. That guy Marcus from The Profit, what's his last name? Uh, something.

We launched this thing saying, "All right, let's let's aim for $10,000." We hit our $10,000 goal in 7 minutes. And in the first 48 hours, we had $2 million. After that is when the story gets really [Music] interesting. Okay. Well, good. Uh Sam, do you want me to kick it off? Yeah. Wait. Well, yeah, I do. First of all, Sean, how did you guys even come to the same world? Craig. So, we invited Craig to the event because Craig's one of my favorite people, even though he doesn't play basketball. We were like, "Craig, you got to be there. You're the the the exemption. You know, you're not the basketball guy, but we just want you there for sure." And we told him what it was. He got excited and he goes, "I have somebody who I think should come." And we were like, "Okay, great. Who's the plus one?" And he he was I guess how long have you guys been friends? It's got to be a decade now. It's so funny cuz he called me up and he's like, "Okay, I have the weirdest invitation ever. It's a basketball event, but I'm not going to be playing basketball. And I was like, "Okay, uh, that's as weird as it gets." And then we started talking and I'm so glad I went. It was amazing. Yeah, that's actually a big leap of faith for you cuz you know, we know Craig, so obviously, you know, there's a personal connection there. What What did he say that made you get off the couch for that? I mean, it's random. He didn't he honestly didn't give me many details. But um in general, Craig is one of those people on this list I have where if he says to try something, I just try it and don't ask questions. There's only like four people on that list, but he's on there. So, I'm so glad I did it. Exactly. And ever since we met you at that event, I was like, "Okay, we have to have you on because you blew us away." Just to give people context. All right, so there's a room full of people. Imagine 25. We tried to invite the 25 most interesting, ambitious people that we could find who also love to play basketball in this case. And um the room is like I mean it's basically like 30% billionaire and and so there's a lot of successful people in that room and I would say you blew us away the most. You gave this talk that really kind of inspired us and I would say you blew us away for three reasons. Number one, your business is a like a giant dragon, but it's looks like a playful cute dragon. And so, you know, people don't look at it and think, "Wow, this is a juggernaut." You have a board games company. If anybody's ever seen the the games like Exploding Kittens, that's your game. And not only is that your game, you were telling us, we were like, "So, like, of the top games, like, you know, is yours number one?" and you I don't know if I want to paraphrase you exactly but you go we have number one two four and five of the top five sold games in the world and I just thought that was incredible. So you have this huge business but you have this artist spirit where you're the nicest guy and you're creatively driven. It didn't seem like you got into this for the money. You got into this to have fun and you gave this talk at night, this little presentation, a little 10-minute presentation that blew us all away. So that's why I wanted you to be here. You can respond to that and then Sam I want to hear your impressions too before we jump in. Uh well first of all even before like I would just love to say that is so flattering like I showed up to that event like about as fish out of water as it gets and imposttor syndrome like you know dripping out my ears. It was just this this room is filled with incredible people and um Sean I think it was you. I think I think the very first few minutes um I remember uh I I I I asked I asked you like why are we here? Like what is this thing? And you you had the best answer ever. You said everyone in this room is smarter than I am. I'm going to spend the next 3 days learning as much as I can. I hope you're here for the same reasons. And I was just like, "Holy crap, I have found my tribe. Here's where I want to be. This is so great." There was one moment when I was with you in the sauna and you asked me and maybe Austin Reef or someone uh like that. Uh you're like, "Can I get your guys' opinion on something?" And you like expressed like, you know, opinions on an investor conversation, something. You're like, "Can you just give me your take on this?" And we gave you our opinions. And you asked the question in a way where I thought I was helping you. And then I was like, "How big is your business?" And then you said the numbers. And my reply was why are you asking me this question like you are you you it's so funny you win the award for most humble person because you're acting like you are in this room of big shots when like of all the people there you were the big shot. Are you able to give any numbers, whatever you're comfortable with to give the audience a sense of how big Exploding Kittens is, like if it's valuation, games sold, revenue, anything you want. I I have to be a little careful cuz we have investors who who like to keep it under wraps. But I'll I'll tell you this. We sell We did this math. This was so ridiculous. We sell a game every 6.4 seconds round the clock. And our first like we started our company on Kickstarter um in 30 days. We were trying to raise $10,000. We raised almost 9 million instead. Our first um our first print run was 700,000 units. And that was mind-blowing. Like how the hell do you print 700,000 games? And for scale, I'll tell you that is today like so such a tiny print order for us. Like I wouldn't even consider printing that many cuz they'd sell out so fast it wouldn't even be worth our while. One of the coolest things was when you took us we went to Target and Walmart and we were walking around the store and you took us to the games aisle of a Target and you were just kind of breaking it down like this shelf a shelf that I've walked by hundreds of times. Don't really pay much. You know, I don't even think about it. I just I either buy something or I don't I don't think about the business of the shelf. and you talked about this sort of like you know this sort of six foot six foot uh space and it was like this shelf is like I mean I won't use your numbers but I'll just give it a generic idea of like this shelf is like hundreds of millions of dollars and every inch of this shelf for Target the way they think is like sales per square inch or something like that and you were describing how that works and then you were like yeah you know I'm trying to figure out our Walmart sales so I'm going to go work as a Walmart associate for the next few weeks just to get kind of an on the ground look and not like a marketing stunt. You were like, "No, I genuinely want to know." So, and you said you were going to do that right after our event. Did you end up doing it? Yeah, they postponed it. This honestly this this tariff thing right now has turned everything into quite turmoil. But, uh, it looks like it's going to now be scheduled for September. So, uh, I'll be going to Arkansas to work at Walmart for a bit. Um, but the whole reason it's, you're right, it's not a stunt. Like my goal isn't like, hey, I want to tell the world about this and and and get publicity. Like in order to sell products at any retail location, you have to understand the customer and you have to understand when they're walking into a space, what are they looking for and what turns them off and what turns them on and if they pick up a game and then put it back, why did they put it back? And it's not so much of it is contextual. It's not necessarily the game, right? It's not necessarily I looked at this game and it wasn't for me. It's I looked at this game and then something else caught my eye. So, I put this down and I picked it up and and those are the stories I need to hear in order to be as successful as possible. And I just figured finally like the only way I'm going to get this is by living there and spending as long as it takes to talk to people and figure out like why'd you put that game down? Why'd you pick that one up? Why did you walk in here to begin with? And uh yeah, I just think I have so much to learn. I'm really excited to do it. How big is the company uh in terms of employees and how old is it? company is we just had our 10 year anniversary, so we just turned 10. We got about 100 employees, a little less. Um, and um, yeah, we're we're based out of Los Angeles, although we've got offices uh, in Canada and in Europe and kind of all over the place. Everywhere we have a distribution center, we also have an office. All right, let's take a quick break because we got something for you. You know, we pinned a survey to one of our videos and we asked, "What's the biggest challenge you have right now in your business?" And the number one thing that you guys said was getting your first 100 customers. That was the most popular response. And it's, of course, that's the challenge cuz if you can't get to 100 customers, you're definitely not going to get to a thousand. So, what the team at HubSpot did was they went through all the old episodes and they heard the stories where I talked about how I got customers for my first business, how Sam did it for his first business, and some of the guests that came on and talked about what they did, how they scrapped and clawed and got those initial 100 customers to get the ball rolling, and then they put those together in a report. It's a PDF. It's totally free, and you can get it, and it'll give you some inspiration, some ideas around how you might be able to go get your first 100 customers. Check it out. It's in the description below. So, give us the origin story. So, how do you how did you do this? Why did you why did you decide to create a board game? And then how did you do this Kickstarter that blew everybody's socks off? You you set out to raise 10K and said you raised 9 million or something like that. And then now it's this company that's making, you know, I don't know exactly how much you're making, but you don't have to confirm or deny, but I'll just put it out there. I think you've built a billion-dollar games company and in a space that I think most people the cool part is most people think you either are going to choose something for the money. I got to go do this sweaty B2B, you know, business, HR, tech, whatever, or I'm going to have fun. I'm going to build something cool that's fun that will give people delight and joy. And you got both. You did both. You did the fun thing and you ended up with the money prize, too. That's what I love about your story. And so, how the heck did this happen? Can you just tell us the kind of origins? Sure. Yeah, it's a bizarre story. So, um I used to work I I've been designing games my whole life, but the the most notable place I worked was at the Xbox. I was the uh chief design officer there building games for the Xbox for ever. Um and I remember one day, so one day I uh my my brother, he's got two kids, and I love them. My niece and nephew, they're the best. And uh Zeke and Kiki. And I I walked over to their house. I was so excited to see them and um they were playing Xbox when I walked in and I was like, "Hey, how's everybody doing?" And they like didn't even look up, like didn't even acknowledge my existence. And to add insult to injury, they were playing a game that I designed. And I was like, "Oh, I've broken something so fundamental here. Like, this just feels wrong." And within two weeks, I resigned from Xbox and thought, "Whatever I do next, it has to capture what I remember in my childhood, right?" Like, when I think about playing games, you know, other than the NES, there really weren't any consoles at all. So, we were playing around a table and we were cheating and kicking each other under the table and throwing food and and making all those like alliances and and betraying each other and all this fun stuff. I don't even remember what the games were. I remember the relationships and it's because we like looked each other in the eye and we and we like could lie right to each other's faces or you know secretly conspire to make you know my younger brother lose that was a favorite activity but I remember all these really fun things that were I think very formative for me and so when I resigned I thought I want to return to that and certainly the first step is really simple I'm just going to design this very simple card game and see like Kickstarter exists. I'll put this thing up on Kickstarter. I'll try to raise just a little tiny bit of money. What's a little bit like $10,000? You thought $10,000. And $10,000 wasn't an arbitrary number. I like I called up a printer and I said, "Look, I want to do this thing. What's the minimum print run?" And he said, "You got to print out, you know, I think it was like 400 units." And I was like, "Okay, well, how much does that cost?" And it came out to just about $10,000. And I was like, "Cool, there we go." And this was really all because of you felt some type of guilt about your uh your family being using screens. Yeah, I felt like I was on the wrong path. I felt like I was part of the problem instead of part of the solution. Was that a big thing? Like were you getting wealthy from that? I mean, chief design officer sounds like you're you're that's a big deal. If you had asked me then, the answer would have been yes. Uh now my scale is a little bit different. And and and so when you when you do this, you've never made a card game before, right? You've never this not something you grew up doing. You use zero. You're a beginner at this stage. Totally. Literally my first try. But the stakes are so low, right? Like if I'm just going to be making a few hundred units, even if the thing is totally broken, that's okay. People, you know, they're going to pay 20 bucks for this thing. They know this is my first time ever trying this. Like, this will be easy, right? And um I showed the game uh to a bunch of friends. And one of those friends was Matthew and he is the creator of the oatmeal uh the online comic. It's like the funniest guy I know and he's like he's the audience whisperer. Like he knows how to command a crowd and he knows how to get their attention and he knows how to keep them engaged and just this incredible brilliant mind. And I showed him this game and he said uh what's it called? called and I said, "It's called Bomb Squad because we got a deck of cards and there's a few bombs in the deck and those are the bad ones. We try to avoid the bombs and all you're trying to do is get through the deck and not draw a bomb." And he said a few things. He said, "One, um, this is the best game I've ever played. I would really, really like to work on this with you. Will you please let me work on this with you?" And I was like, "Yes." Like a hell yes. If if the O'Neal ever asks you if he can work on a game with you, your answer is yes. Like, holy crap, what an opportunity. and he said, "Cool." Um, the second thing is we can't call it bomb squad because it's too obvious. Like, bombs are bad. Of course, you're scared of the bomb. There's bombs in the deck. You're scared of the bombs. It's called Bomb Squad. Who cares? You're going to forget that in 5 seconds. What if instead the thing that you were most scared of were cute, adorable, fuzzy little kittens, and we'll call the game Exploding Kittens instead? And that's really the origin story. like that one simple conversation happened to meet the right person at the right time and we decided to collaborate on this thing and then we had the discussion with the distributor and he's like Matt said we're going to make we're going to do more than 400 units and I was like I don't know I don't know this is uh this is totally risky neither of us have ever made a game before and so a friend of mine a guy named Dan Shapiro he runs Glow Forge he gave me this incredible advice when I was talking to him about what number to set our Kickstarter campaign he said when this campaign runs, you have no control. Like there's going to be sto hopefully stories written about your campaign, but you don't control any of them. They get to set the narrative and you just sort of hold on. But what you can control are the stories that are like tried to raise X instead raised Y, hit their goal in X minutes, right? All of these statist datadriven stories. you control those by setting that one number that you have control over, setting that at the appropriate place. And he was totally right. And so we set it at 10,000 knowing this is probably a little low, but it is the truthful minimum that we need for our order minimum. And now we can control those stories. Were any of you guys like famous back then? I know the I know what the oatmeal is, but is that like big enough where you're like uh where he's like, "Dude, I'll blow this up. Just like tell me when." It it turns out the answer is yes. But none of us really knew it at the time. So like we launched this thing saying, "All right, let's let's aim for $10,000 because of Matt. Matt made a single post saying, "Hey Oatmeal fans, for the first time ever, I made a game. I'm really proud of it. I hope you like it. Here it is." And we hit our $10,000 goal in 7 minutes. And it's because of Matt. 100% of Matt. He made one post, hit hit $10,000, and then within the first 12 hours, maybe maybe it was closer to 24 10 years ago, uh we we raised a million, 100% because of that. And in the first 48 hours, we had $2 million. 100% because of that. After that is when the story gets really interesting because 48 hours in, all the oatmeal fans that are going to back this thing have backed it, right? They've seen his post. They know what uh they know they're interested in this thing or they decide they're not interested in this thing and they've either purchased it or not and that's it. The sales price on that is $2 million. Amazing. Like we are off to the races. We can do anything now. We've raised $2 million. And Matt and I sat down and we're like, "Okay, we now have a choice. Either we can say we have raised $2 million. That is one of the most successful Kickstarter campaigns in history in the games category. and we can just kind of ride this thing out knowing that we're not going to raise much more than that. Maybe we'll get to 2.5 and we'll declare that a huge victory. Or we can bet it all. Like what if we just went absolutely crazy and deployed every marketing strategy either of us have ever heard of. And we shook hands and said, "Let's do it." Like let's let's try as as big and as bold as this thing can possibly be. And on Kickstarter, they've got these things called stretch goals, right? We've met our game, but if we get, I don't know, we've raised $10,000. If instead we raise $20,000, everybody gets a free carrying case. $50,000, we're going to add 10 more uh cards into the game. Stretch goals, right? They're trying to motivate people to back the project. I sat down and I thought, this whole thing is crowdfunding. And all of those stretch goals, every strategy I've read, every YouTube video I've watched, everything is based on funding. like they ignore the crowd part and they're just like laser focus on funding, funding, funding, funding. And I was like, I think that's backwards. I think instead we're going to ignore the funding because we've already got 2 million bucks and let's just focus on the crowd part. And instead of doing traditional stretch goals, all of our stretch goals were based on the crowd. So, we're like, look, we don't care about money anymore. Don't give us any more money. We don't want any more money. Nothing we talk about from now on is going to be about money cuz the funding doesn't matter. let's have a party and everyone is invited. So, we're like, look, we're going to do those same things. We're also going to give you a carrying case and 10 extra cards and all that fun stuff, but it's not based on how much money you give us. It's based on how much fun you have. So, show us a picture of 10 Batman's in a hot tub, whatever the hell that means. Show us a picture of that. Or show us a picture of 100 people dressed up as cats. Or show us the craziest, most interesting things you can come up with. and every time you do that, we're going to make the game better and you're not going to pay us more. We're just going to make the game better cuz this is fun and we've already raised enough money. Let's have a party. And we did that for the next 28 days and we watched our numbers just skyrocket. I'm going to focus on the crowd part here, right? Like we had I don't know, let's say we had a,000 backers at that point. By the end of this thing, we had 219,000 backers for this campaign. That is so far in first place of any Kickstarter campaign in history to date. It's been 10 years and no one's even come close to that record. And it's because we said the funding is completely irrelevant. All that matters is the crowd. The funding was a really nice side effect though. But it was 8.5 million that you got. Well, yeah, there was that, too. So, wait, give us example. So, you said 10 Batman in a bathtub. What What were the other things that you did to get the crowd to do that? Yeah, we said, so one of the characters in our game is called Taco Cat. Um, which is my favorite character, right? Taco Cat is a palendrome. Spell Taco Cat backwards and you've still got Taco Cat. So, we had this adorable character and we said, "Look, we don't actually know what Taco Cat is, but show us 25 pictures of real Taco Cats and we'll make the game better." When you say show us, do you mean like post in the comment section? Yeah, post. So, it was basically just like uh an online message board that you were using. We used whatever social media platform you wanted. We just said, you know, cop tag us on it and that's all we care about. And so that was the virality. They were posting a a image that didn't make any sense in the feed and they tag you guys. That got people curious that to go check you out. Is that why have you stuffed your cat into a burrito? What is happening here? And on and on those pictures went. One, we had this um veterinarian who worked in an animal shelter and she showed us all she did was she had a picture of her holding this adorable cat and a piece of paper and the piece of paper showed that she had legally changed the cat's name to Taco Cat for real. And we're like, "All right, that's about as real a Taco Cat as it gets." So, we gave credit for that one as well. And it just it went on and on and on like that for 30 days. Every time we thought, "Here's a challenge way too hard." uh they absolutely smash them and then we would just our challenge was every day how do we come up with five new challenges that's going to keep everyone entertained. You have these little oneliners that are like what if instead of the funding we focused on the crowd. It's like this like simple idea that then you and then you run with them. So it's like that if I was going to describe you I'd say he takes silly ideas very seriously. Old Charlie take take a simple idea and take it seriously. I think yours is take a silly idea and take it seriously. You do that with your games. You do that with your with your marketing campaigns. And you did this when we were at the event. We do this thing where we put everybody on the hot seat. And let's say somebody's like a real estate mogul. We'll just instead of saying, "Hey, tell us about your business." We'll just say, "All right, so how do you make a billion dollars in real estate? What's the secret?" And like in your case, it's like, "What's the secret? How do you make hit game after hit game after hit game in a hits business that normally sounds like something that's just a game of chance, but you're doing it again and again and again. You must know something. And you said a great line. Uh can you can you describe your philosophy around games cuz you said it in a oneliner that just stuck with me. Yeah. Oh, I love that you focused on this one. Um so the line is uh games should not be entertaining. Games should make the people you're playing with entertaining. And that simple line, which is a very silly line, like I I remember the first time we pitched it to our investors, we're like, "We're not going to make entertaining games." And they're like, "Never say that again." Like, "Never put that in any piece of writing ever." And instead, we put it as the first p as the first line on our web page because games should not be entertaining. If you're making an entertaining game, you're trying way too hard and it's you versus the audience, which means when you're done entertaining them, they're going to go away and never come back. If instead your goal is I'm just making a tool set. My tool set is going to make the people that you are playing with the entertainment. Suddenly you've got an engine. Suddenly every time they play it's different. Suddenly they constantly want to come back. They want to play it over and over again. They want to take it to new friends house. You make a piece of cardboard, right? A deck of cards. You turn that into a viral engine. And that's the secret to success in the board game industry. But that sort of is like going to the Met and seeing a Picasso and being like, "Dude, it's just like scribbly lines like this is unimpressive." You dismissing it as just a It doesn't explain why your company is potentially worth billions of dollars and makes potentially hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue. What is actually happening? Because we've had all these rich and successful billionaires on the pod and I'll meet them and I'm like, "Oh, you're really nice." And then I start thinking like, well, no, this guy's a shark. Like, you must be a shark to be this successful. So, like, what else are you not tell what are you not telling us that that has allowed this company to become a potentially allegedly multi-billion dollar company? Yeah. Well, one is you have to do it consistently, which is hard, right? But how do you tell if your game is a tool set to make people entertaining? And like unless you have the the litmus test, right? Unless you can quantify the data that you're putting in those boxes, like then it's just a theory. And I remember we started taking submissions from external inventors and um I just eventually started rubber stamping them with here's why we're rejecting you because this you're trying too hard to be entertaining. And it was incredible like hundreds of these submissions and every every game designer was making the same mistake where they're like I am building an entertaining thing and I kept having to remind them we're not buying entertaining things and eventually we found like one or two inventors we could work with. Um and then I had to design all the others which is totally cool because I know what I'm looking for but how do you test it? Like how do I know that I'm hitting that mark way before the thing hits the market because by then we could have already screwed it up. So, I figured out one bit of quantifiable data that lets me back up that claim. When I say a game is not entertaining, it makes the players entertaining. I can back that up. And the way I can back it up is in our testing procedure, we we have um we have this this group of 400 families called the Kitty Test Pilots. And all we do is we send them games all day long and we ask for feedback. And it used to be we would send them this crazy Google form. We're like, "How long did you play? How many players? How old are they? What was your favorite part? What was the part you hated? What part needs work? You know, on and on and on. Like 30, 40 questions. And I realized like nobody's reading these. Like I'm I'm I don't even care about what this is. And by the time I finish reading their answers to this questionnaire, I haven't actually learned anything about whether or not this game has made the players entertaining. And so, uh, we now send out a questionnaire. And it has one question on it. Just one. Start to finish. One question. And that question is, do you want to play again? And I have found that that question is the most direct heat-seeking missile to answer the question, have you made the players entertaining? Because if a game is entertaining, you have extracted almost all the entertainment from it on your first time through. But if the players are entertaining, you want to play again. And we only now ship games where 100% of that question's answer is yes. We get even a single no. We dive into that person and we watch the videos and we figure out what happened there because they should want to play again. And if they don't, we've got something to fix. I think the most successful people, Sean, have you ever studied like personality tests and like and read about disagree uh agreeableness and how the people who are most successful rank very low on agreeableness, right? Disagreeable is a positive trait for founders. Yeah. Because like the very simple example is you just are un you don't accept how things are done. You disagree with that. Therefore, you want to go make your own. Uh often times people who rank high on disagreeableness are jerks. You uh Alain do not you are not a jerk. You are a objectively a sweet person but you seem like you are hiding this um this uh disagreeableness because uh like for example you have incredibly high standards or you just made a survey where uh us if a lot of staff might be like well we have to ask 10 questions. We can't just ask one question, but you're like, "No, no, no. You see, this makes sense for this reason." Do people enjoy working with you? Um, because like I guess I'm fascinated on how your ability to be disagreeable but also polite and it seems very effective. Um, it depends on who you ask. So, I think I think my team likes working with me. At the very least, very few people ever quit. Um, but if you were to ask our printers, if you ask our distribution partners, I think they hate working with me. Like despise it. And and the reason is because I am absolutely a perfectionist. Like what I do for a living is make little boxes of joy. And if you open a box and there's something obvious wrong with it or the card quality is not where it should be or like the in exploding kittens, you don't know which card is an exploding kitten. It has to be a surprise, right? And and that means the backs of every card have to be identical. And if I can detect one degree off in the pan in the panone registry of this card versus this one, I'm sending the entire I don't care how many millions are in that shipment. I'm sending every single one of them back and I'm not paying a penny and you are going to reprint them for me. So they hate me and I get it. But also I don't think the company would be where it is today if I said, "Yeah, we we'll just ship it that way and the next run will be better." I love that you also have a approach to marketing that I think is very different than most founders. It was really inspiring to me when I started to hear these stories. Can you talk about some of the unconventional hustle things? Cuz if I'm listening to this right now, I'm like, "Okay, cool." So, he was like had a cool like a sick job at Xbox. He quit first game, first hit Wonder, hit Exploding Kittens, which is like the number one game in the world for I don't know how many years now. Oh, his buddy happened to be the oatmeal guy. So, he had instant distribution. Must be nice, right? I'll just be YouTube comment guy for a second. Yo, must be nice to be uh, you know, to have have connected, powerful friends. Ah, that's why I'm not successful, right? That's I think where most people land with stuff like that. What they don't know is that first there's all this that person is not just your friend. There's actually like luck that you create along the way to create uh those types of opportunities. Um, so either you could talk about that or you could talk about some of the hustle tactics you guys did like the vending machine, like the other stuff you guys have done that where you were not just like handed the keys to the to the castle, but you actually like scraped your way there. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look, the company you've just described is a company that would disappear in 8 months, right? Like there's no longevity to that at all. So once you have a hit game, which requires a lot of luck, but also a lot of skill, once you've gotten that, now the skill really has to kick in because now you have to make sure that thing doesn't disappear. Now you have to make sure your next 10 games are also successful. You need to make sure your profit margin on each game is where it should be. You need to make sure you build a community. On and on and on. So I'll give you I'll give you a few examples. Um, and they're all they're all kind of marketing. like once you have a company, once you have any degree of success, you have to be able to double down on that and get your audience to care passionately. So, um, we used to go to this convention in Seattle called PAX, Penny Arcade Expo, and, um, we're a tiny company. We got no money for marketing, right? We've had this one successful Kickstarter campaign. We spent literally every penny actually producing the product and building the company. And now our bank account is empty. and we show up to this thing and we've got like no ability to get people's attention and advertising is expensive and they literally rent out like every square inch of the walls in there and so anything you want to do costs money which we don't have. So I had this idea and this convention is to impress other game makers or vendors to carry your game. Exactly that. All all of the above, right? So, you're getting you're building a fan base. You're building other uh uh relationships. You're trying to get distribution. You're trying to get into retail stores. The only thing we had ever sold is a single product on Kickstarter and now we got nothing left. By the way, people know these exhibits. If you go to one of these, you become an exhibitor. Your booth, like the big games, they're spending hundreds of thousands of dollars just on the booth. and you're like, you also sign up to be a booth, but you're just a fold out picnic table in in section F over, you know, past the bathrooms and you're you're just sitting there hoping somebody walks by your shitty table and you're like, how am I supposed to compete with that? It's like Michael Scott in the job fair episode where he's like, you literally just have a table and you're trying to convince people to do to come to you. I got the crappy sign that I printed on my little on my little inkjet printer and that's and the folding table and and that's it. And so the very first year, I was very proud of this. Um I knew we had to have marketing space and I couldn't find any that we could afford. And so I made um I made these little kittens. I cut them out. Little adorable cute little kittens with our logo on it. And the kitten was holding a bomb and it said exploding kittens. And there was a fuse. And I secretly put one of those inside every urinal in the convention center. So you had to pee on them to extinguish the bomb. And it like mobbed our booth. Like everyone wanted to see who made these things. So much so that um the organizers came to us and they said, "Uh, you can't do this." And I was like, "Well, show me show me the part of my contract where it says I can't do this. I understand you don't want me to do this, but show me where I can't." And they said, um, they said, "All right, well, we're not going to prohibit you from doing this cuz you're right. You found a space that is just nowhere in our guidelines. Um, but we'll tell you this, next year we're going to start charging for that space. So, I think I haven't checked because we haven't been back to PAX, but I think they now charge for urinal advertising space thanks to this little stunt we have. Do you want to go get them out of there or are you expecting me to? I did not extract a single one of those. It's actually genius. The second year is when you did the vending machine thing cuz insane. Yeah. Okay. So, the vending machine was um trying to solve the problem on a more permanent basis cuz like I do this urinal thing and they shut it down and it honestly it just wasn't big enough. Like that got us a few hundred people every day, but how do I get thousand? How do I get tens of thousands of people every day? So, I looked at our little folding table and thought, you know, people come up to this thing and they give us money, they give us 20 bucks, they get a box and they walk away and they have no memory of that transaction because all that really is is a vending machine, right? You go, you put money in the vending machine, you push a button, you get your your your soft drink, and you walk away. And you have no lasting memory of the interaction you just had, cuz there's nothing remarkable about it. So, I thought, all right, if we're going to be a vending machine, what if we were the world's coolest vending machine, like the most spectacular vending machine the world has ever seen? And so, I took um an old refrigerator box I had in my garage. So, this big 8-ft tall cardboard box and we cut some holes in it and we built uh we sorry we covered it with fur and these giant googly eyes so it looked like a cat. We built a 8-ft tall fur covered cat and um it had a we cut out a hole for a screen where we could like put a display and it had little buttons and it had a little uh credit card reader. It had everything a vending machine should have. And the experience was you walk up to this thing, you put in your money, you push a button, and a game comes out. Very, very simple. We're not talking anything crazy expensive or really anything that remarkable yet other than, okay, it's fur covered. It looks like a cat. That's kind of adorable. Nobody's ever seen a vending machine like this before. And that attracted a crowd. But then we had to push it over the top. So I put in an extra button. And the extra button said random item $1. Way cheaper than a game. What the hell does that mean? And so enough people were willing to try this experiment. What happens if I put a dollar in this and push random item? And so they'd put a dollar in and push random and out comes a pineapple from the vending machine or a hot burrito or a bag of rocks or a a a plumbers's and it's just you behind it just sticking your hand out with a pineapple or whatever. So this was the thing. This is what we didn't tell anybody. Everyone assumed this is the world's most sophisticated vending machine cuz it can deliver 2,000 different objects. And people literally brought up chairs and they built little bleachers around this thing just to watch it for hour after hour after hour to see what the hell is going to come out of this thing. And basically for for the listener, it looks like just a box, but the box backed up to like a curtain. And behind the curtain, I would imagine you had a whole team of people like So, so there's the punchline. Instead of it being a vending machine, it was just a vending machine costume. There was no robotics in there. There's no there's no computers. There's nothing. There's eight of us sweating our asses off for 10 hours a day backstage and every time someone pushes that random item button, we are literally pulling a random item and throwing it out the front of the machine. And we had our line got so long that it blocked our aisle. It blocked all the other super expensive, you know, million-doll booths. Uh, nobody could walk up to those anymore cuz our line was so long. It went out the door. It went out of the convention center. It went down the street and the line for our silly little fur covered vending machine was longer than the line to get into the convention itself. And all of that's just because like we had no money and we had to think creatively about like what does it mean to build a community around a transaction and that's what we came up with. So Sean, have you ever read about Dr. Fman? Richard Feman. Richard Feman. Yeah. Sorry. Uh have you read about him? So yeah, a little bit. Why? What comes to mind here? He would like get super hands-on with a problem and not and question everything and he would start at the very foundation of that of that question and basically not accept any truth before him. He would have to like question each one in order to solve a problem. And uh one big example of this is he helped uh create the atomic bomb and so like they like questioned all these like previously thought rules that he broke. And uh Alain kind of has that same thing. And I I admire this because I I work really hard to have this, but I don't I still don't have it entirely. It's not this doesn't come naturally to me and I don't excel at it. But I think that for everyone listening, this skill set is really important, which is how do you how do you be really creative and the framework being you question everything at the very beginning and don't assume anything that you've ever been told is true. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah, I think that's accurate. And and also never take no for an answer. Like it's it makes no sense to ever have someone shut you down for any reason. So the vending machine is a great example. It's one of my favorites of we so we we install this thing in a convention center and we're handing out pineapples and watermelons and and and ridiculous objects and and we're putting googly eyes on them and giving them mohawks and all all kinds of fun stuff. And we got to a convention in Indianapolis and they said, "Uh, you can't do this because we cannot let you ship the produce backstage to your to uh your your space on the convention floor." And I said, "Why?" And they said, "Because you've exceeded um what they called like a casual purchase, and now you have to the only way that we can accept that much produce is to a registered grosser. And you're not a registered grosser. you can't do this anymore. And I I remember thinking like my whole team was like, "Okay, well, here's a dead end. We need to think through like what objects can we do instead." And I got so frustrated. I was like, "You're you're just accepting a dead end here." And I don't think we need to. And it turns out um it's easy trivial to become a registered grosser. I went to a website and you fill out a form and you pay like a hundred bucks. And today, Exploding Kids is a registered grosser in Indiana. You know where else we're a registered groceryer? 14 other states. Cuz it's that easy as well. And so every convention we go to, we can now accept the shipments backstage because Exploding Kittens is also a grocery store. I love that. We, you know, when we were doing our event, um, Mr. beast is there Jimmy Donaldson and he his production document so like his training document for his team like an older one but had leaked online and it's really fascinating to read this because here you have a guy who wrote this probably when he was 22 23 24 years old right so it's kind of like he's an expert at 24 um but he's he is an expert in YouTube he'd actually been doing it for over a decade he's the most successful YouTuber on the planet and he's like I know how to make videos that people watch and one of the things that he talks about in there he goes push push past the no. Just because you receive an initial no from somebody absolutely does not mean that it's a no forever that it's a no under any circumstance that there's a no without you know some caveats and if you come back and you just say I asked you know they said no u that's not an acceptable answer in our in our or right so he's like you know I wanted the pyramids for a video the the Egyptian pyramids and they were like his team told him no and he goes what do you mean like who told you no Egypt told you no who'd you call what did they say why' they say No. Uh, did you call the other guy? Who's the other guy? Give me the number. Let's call him. Do they have kids? Let's FaceTime their kids. Let's see if that works. Like, what are the different ways that we could do this to just to accept an initial no um is basically out of is culturally unacceptable at the company? Yeah. I I think I think that trait more than anything is what I've seen in successful business owners. And I don't know if it can be taught. It's more just that like when you hear the word no, there are two possible reactions. One is damn it. And the other is I didn't hear that properly. Let me dig deeper. And it has to be instinctual. Like every time you hear the word no, you have to think, okay, I didn't hear that properly. Let me dig deeper. Over and over and over again. I love that. It's not just being a jerk and saying, you know, just pushing just pushing on them, but being curious or being like clever or being playful and trying to figure out like if I had a trillion dollars, maybe you'd say yes. Okay, so like let's just agree it's not physically impossible to do this. Okay, once it's not physically impossible, that means now there is a way. Let's just see what that way might look like. It's so good. Maybe the better way to phrase it is when someone tells you no, instead of assuming that that's the answer, assume you ask the wrong question. Hey Sean, we did this thing. Um, I was talking to David, the guy who hosted the podcast Founders the other day, and we did a show called the Anti-Business Billionaires, and there's like a handful of people out there uh, who are these billionaires who they shockingly don't care about revenue and profit, and they're like very passionate about whatever it is they're making. The guy who started Patagonia is one of them where like he just doesn't seem like he cares about money. here. The guy who started Dyson, James Dyson, uh he's another guy where oddly he's obsessed with making vacuums. Do you care at all about revenue and profit or do you just see it as a like do do you care about business? I I didn't originally. Now once I figured out how to look at business as another game that can be won, I suddenly started caring passionately about business. Like I used to think, all right, I don't actually want to be CEO of this company. what I want to be is lead designer. I'm going to hire a CEO. And we tried that for a while. And what I realized is like everyone we hired into that spot was playing the game the wrong way. And I want to play instead. And so now I actually love strategy meetings. I love business meetings. I love when we go in and talk about the next 10 years and or how we're going to solve this very particular problem about this convention or this ne next game launch or this next partnership because that is such a fun game. And I was like in high school um I loved physics. Physics was my favorite topic until I realized um I need to switch to computer science. And the reason I needed to switch was because for physics everything they were teaching us the answer was in the back of the book. If you had a problem you could just you could just flip to the back of the book. And um I realized that computer science was very different because computer science was like the cutting edge. Like there were no answers in the back of the book at all. You had to figure everything out as you go. And that was really exciting for me. That was like a life-changing moment when I was 16. That's what business is to me. There are no answers at the back of the book. And if you want to win this game, you got to figure out what the rules are. Invent your own where you need to and get to that finish line before anybody else. Look at Sean's hands. And look at I just realized that whenever we do this, uh, you got us. Yeah. Like, you know, when you're talking to a girl and she puts her hair behind her ear, there's like some indicator of of like uh of attraction. When you're talking about this, I'm like, "Ah, this is beautiful." I mean, just the way you're describing this, like there's no answers in the back of the book. Like, dude, that's inspiring. I I I love that show. I love that stuff. You I also think there's other things we can learn from you. So, you know, I've learned from you on on the marketing side, and maybe we'll just close the loop on the marketing idea, which is it's one thing to hear the idea of the vending machine and be like, "Oh, wow. That's a great idea. I'm interested in what is the mindset that creates that idea? What are the questions that you ask? How do you brainstorm? What are you doing differently that's leading you to crazy answers like that that actually work? So, like I don't know if you can describe it or if this is like asking, you know, Steph Curry how to shoot a jump shot. He's like, I don't know. I just got to flick my wrist. It just goes in. Um, when actually a thousand little things are happening that he's not even attuned to. But like you know for example you said something like what if and like I know what what if questions are just like a great like a great tool in the tool belt for a creative thinker. Um it's very different than we should. Um it just like the language changes everything. What are some other things you do when you brainstorm? I love parameters. I hate blue sky brainstorming. Like the idea that like hey let's sit down and create a game is the most terrifying experience in the world for me. or let's let's sit down and brainstorm anything and we don't know what it is. So, what are the parameters for the last handful of meetings that you've had? Yeah. So, okay, let me let me back up and say like you asked about um marketing for a convention, right? I told you the story about the vending machine, but I also told you the parameters are baked into there. Like we didn't start by saying what's the coolest experience we can have at a convention, right? We started by saying this is a vending machine transaction. There's our parameters. What is the coolest vending machine experience we can craft? But you also said, how do we get tens of thousands of people to come without spending money instead of 300, right? A sort of an unreasonable target. Unreasonable is totally reasonable. Like it's fine to set your goals that high as long as you you understand the parameters of the problem. If I were to sit down and say, "How do we get 10,000 people to come to our booth?" I'm getting I'm not going to get anywhere. Like I I just have no chance of success there. But if I sit down and say, I'm going to build a vending machine that must attract 10,000 people. Now I'm running. Now I I'm busy for the next 10 months building that thing cuz I know what that is. That's shockingly a useful tip because I do the other thing where I just say, "How do I get how do I get to 10,000? How do I get 10,000 people to come?" Yeah. Yeah. No, I I there are people who are great at it. Like you know, you mentioned Mr. Beast, Jimmy, he is exceptional at that. Like if you were to tell him just like I I listened to your interview with him, right? And you're you're spitting out random nouns and he's coming up with incredible ideas. He is exceptionally talented at that thing. I suck at it. I need to know exactly the shape of the box. And I will build you the coolest contents for that box in history. But unless I understand what that box is capable of holding, I I just I have no chance of success. So it sounds like one way to put it is creativity loves constraints. and you use the constraint. You start with the constraint rather than starting with the just the desired outcome. Right? The desired outcome is there. It's part of the it's part of the the the the goal. It's the parameters, but you you actually start with a constraint in order to to get yourself to think a little bit differently. Do you have any other examples of kind of like this constraint style of thinking? We're asked to build a board game uh for a few different NFL teams. And what does that mean? How do you get an NFL audience to play with a board game? And um if you were to just leave it there, you kind of don't have a chance. You're basically saying, "Build a good game. Go." And me personally, I'm going to suck at that task. But what we started to do was And you're like the best in the world at doing this. Just Yeah. So if you're going to suck at it, we're all going to have no chance of success. I promise you zero chance of success. So instead, we sat down and we said, "Okay, what is football?" Like what are the best moments and um I started writing this list and my list was um the the magical moment where a player catches the ball against all odds. Everyone's covering them. It's impossible. It's impossible. Somehow it was a perfect throw, a perfect catch, and off they went to score. And we I personally really focused on that. Do you do do you even care about football? Uh, football matters very little to me, but only because um it is very hard for me to watch people having fun without wanting to do that same thing myself. That's pretty funny. But the reason I'm asking is because this is your perspective as a total outsider where you just you just created the rules and Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's watching other people, right? Like my family is obsessed with it. So, I watch them watch football and I'm like, "Oh, that moment there. Okay, that moment there." And and so we eventually built this game. It's called Catchables. And all it is, we made these cute little foam figures. Um and we had an increasing series of challenges defined by the other players cuz the other players have to provide the entertainment where you have to throw an object, this little character in the air and just catch it. So simple. Throw it, catch it. Really easy. But now players are going to start throwing cards at you. You have to do it blindfolded. You have to spin around before you catch it. You can only use one hand. You can only use two fingers. You have and and like what if I give you 10 of those cards at the same time? And now that very simple throw and catch has become really really entertaining for everyone to watch. You defy the odds and at the last moment pull it off despite everyone's expectation and the crowd goes wild. This sounds so trivial. This is actually pretty groundbreaking. So let's give a very a specific example that's not related to you. Uh so Shawn has uh Shawn works in the e-commerce industry. Let's just say that Shawn sells uh shoes. Shawn owns a shoe company. and let's say growth has stagnated uh and they and he comes to a meeting and he goes I we need to we need to our company needs to improve we we have to be better what would like be interesting constraints uh in order to um make Sean's company better and make the meeting productive yeah what you'd want to do with a shoe company I've never worked in shoes before so bear with me but I will anything you throw at me I'm going to try to tie it back to a community I'm going to try to tie it back to how do I by wearing these things form form more lasting, reasonable, exciting connections with other people. So, um, what if you started printing out beautiful, incredible shoes that you'd be proud to wear? You love every single shoe that you make, but everyone has um half a secret message on it and somebody else has the other half of that. Get your shoe next to them to read it, right? Like suddenly you have a reason to go not only tell your friends to buy some or buy more yourself, but suddenly uh you have a reason to go seek them out in the world. You're walking through a crowded airport and you see someone with those shoes, walk right over to them, put your foot next to theirs. Yeah. Exactly. Right. So now there's a very low percentage hit there and so you'd have to probably redesign it to have a much higher percentage hit and that's very achievable. But again, the first thing I'm going to do is define a constraint and say a successful shoe equals a reason to look for more of those shoes out in the world because then more of those shoes are going to sell. That's pretty great. Wow. Just yesterday, I was with my wife and we're walking out somewhere and this woman had a little Trader Joe's bag and she goes, "Hey, sorry to bother you, but is that that bag that everyone's going crazy about online?" I was and in my mind I'm like, "People are going crazy about Trader Joe's bags now. Like, what what's going on?" And um I guess there's a little I guess there's a certain design of a Trader Joe's bag and it's not even like limited edition or luxury. I don't know what the full story is, but you're it kind of highlighted to me it's like man you could take any moment. It's like the moments in between the moments. And if you if you do something interesting there, you give people a reason to feel special, a reason to connect, a reason to collect, a reason to to to to do one of those things. It's like, damn, how much wasted surface area is there in my businesses where we're not just just by applying creativity, we create magic. We create it's alchemy, right? We create value for people if we just were a little more intentional versus just going on autopilot. And I think 99% of the time I'm just on autopilot in my businesses. I totally get it and and I've been I've been there as well. Can can I tell you a story about I'm I'm so proud of of particular solve for that problem. Okay, go. Um, so my daughter, uh, Exploding Kittens is not the number one selling game in the world. It's number two bestselling game in the world. Number one is a game called Hurry Up Chicken Butt. Hurry Up Chicken Butt. Um, I I designed with my daughter and she when she turned four, I was so excited cuz you know most of the games are like ages four and up. And when she turned four, we went out and we bought all the games, right? We got Candyland and we got Zingo and like all the games and took them home and we started playing and I immediately noticed a problem which was I am having a miserable time. She's happy. She's playing with her dad. She's getting to see bright flashy colors. Like all the stuff is designed for kids, but I am bored out of my mind. And what that results in is when we're done playing the game, uh, one, I've let her win because I got to let her win because if I try at all, I'm going to crush this poor four-year-old. And two is when we're done, she says, "Hey, daddy, can we play again?" And all I'm thinking is, "Oh god, no." Like, "I am so miserable. The last I I did it. I did my time. We played the game. I'm going to go do some go do something fun now." And I I remember having that reaction and it must have shown on my face. And my daughter said, "What's wrong?" And I said, "I I think this game is broken." And she said something brilliant. She said, "Let's fix it." And like fireworks started going off in my head because I was like, "Yeah, let's fix it." Like, "Why are we not fixing this?" And um I spent the next month. We split the work. My daughter just started drawing pictures, like all the fun games, everything fun that she wanted in a game. And I started writing this list of what success looks like. And for me, it was my daughter has to beat me without me letting her win. and I have to look forward to playing again. There the game cannot be luck based. I have to watch my daughter get better at this game every time we play. I have to feel like she's learning something and there cannot be any losers. She can win but there but nobody can lose. So those are your constraints. Those are my five. And by the way, did you start with just things you hated? Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Yeah. I'm I'm saying this like oh overnight I came up with these five things, but the list was like 25 things long and I narrowed it down to those five which were the most important. I'm writing this book on creativity right now and Jerry Seinfeld has this great quote. He says irritation is is what causes innovation and he's bas he created comedians in cars getting coffee because he just hated going he was so sick of going on late night talk shows and doing the same thing every time. He's like all right a talk show that has none of those things. In fact, my irritation is going to be my source of innovation. Sounds like for you all of those things you talked about were sources of personal irritation for you. Every one of them for sure. Everyone there were the things that everybody was doing wrong and was the industry standard. Nobody had raised their hand and said, "This is broken." Like, "This is not fun for half the players who play this game." That half being the adults. Well, did you present those five things to your daughter or did you were you didn't care about those things? So, you were the one you were the one who Well, what what I'm trying to get at is can you present those five things to people at your company and they be just as creative and effect? Like, could they make hit games? Like is this a is this a transfer transferable skill? A teachable skill? Absolutely. Yes. As long again it's not you're not teaching problem solving, you're teaching problem identification and then creative people will be able to solve those problems. But if you try to solve if you try to teach how to be creative, you never get anywhere. All you're really teaching is how to identify a problem, how to know what success looks like, and then you just hire creative people to work within those constraints. But then do you as the leader define if you have a hit? Yes. Well, well, hurry up chicken butt is an easy way is an easy definition because again as soon as it went out to testing party, this was one of those games where when we sent it out to testing, not only was it 100% yes, I want to play again. Nobody sent the games back. This is a huge problem for us. Like we send them out, we want you to send them back so we can tweak them and then send them back out again. Nobody would send that game back to us. It was ridiculous. We lost so many copies of that game. So bridge the gap there. So cuz I I play this game. I play it literally with my daughter who's five. I bought it after we met and hurry up chicken butt and we play it at home with my my son and my daughter. It's a great time. But I've seen the end output and now you've described your initial conditions. Is there anything else interesting and how you kind of figured out how you bridge that gap? So we go through tons and tons and tons of versions and I sit with my daughter. I'm like, "Look, I I want I know we want a game." And she's like, "I want to run around." Cool. That's going to be part of the game, running around. I want to act silly. Cool. That's going to be part of the game, acting silly. And then in the back of my mind, I'm like, "I need tension, right?" Like a game without any form of tension is a broken game because you need something to push you forward. In most games, it's competition with the other players. But here, that's not going to be present. So, I need something else to insert the tension, the the pulse of the game. Uh, and we did that with an electric timer, right? It's essentially hot. The way the game works is it's hot potato. Uh, you've got this adorable cute little chicken that clucks and eventually screams and you pass the chicken around. And if you're holding the chicken when it screams, uh, you have lost a point and everybody else proceeds. Um, but the tricky part, it actually works where the person before you wins the whole game. Again, no users, only winners. Are you like Pixar where you have like your five or eight trustworthy people in a room and you're just banging this out? Absolutely. Yes. And how long are the meetings and how many meetings were there between uh idea to iteration one to final iteration? Okay. So we sit down, we'll meet for like 2 hours and we'll just discuss parameters what success looks like. Let's brainstorm in that space and we'll usually come up with like I don't know let's say five or six interesting things to explore. Then everybody goes off and does their own thing. Everyone's got an assignment. Play with this one. And we're going to come back and we're going to try all these games. And um in this case, we actually had like I don't know 15 or 16 different ideas that we were playing around with. And they all sucked. Like they all everything fell apart in one regard or another except for this one. That's not true. Except for four games. Four games made it out the door. Um two were almost immediate failures. Um, and two of them, uh, one was Hurry Up Chicken Butt, and the other is called The Best Worst Ice Cream, which is like I think it's ranked number eight in the world right now. So, it's up there. Uh, I only look at the top five cuz that's the scoreboard I like to keep. But, it's doing great. And, uh, could this could this apply? Let's say I owned a B2B SAS software. Could could I use this process in my company? I'm tempted to say yes. I look I I don't know definitively the answer but I believe that the best ideas come out of constraint and defining success and I can't imagine there'd be many creative-based endeavors that would not benefit from that approach. You just did a game with Tim Ferrris and I think he uh was a part of creating it. I'm just curious like what was that like and what were the main things you taught Tim and then did Tim teach you anything or did you sort of uh modify any of your process because Tim is such an interesting guy that maybe he he could bring a little bit of a different different approach to what you were doing. Yeah. So I went on Tim's podcast uh like two years ago. He just wanted to know what's the game industry like? Like what are you what is it that you would do for a living? And so we talked for a while and at the end of it after we finished recording he said, "I've always wanted to make a game. Can we talk about making a game?" And I was like, "Absolutely." That's like when Matt asks you if he can be your partner. The answer is yes. Yes, yes, yes. Let's do it. And so we started talking and he is obsessed with uh one of my games called um Poetry for Neanderthalss. And it's a really simple, really fun game. It's in the top five. Um and uh he just loves loves loves that game. He plays it with all his friends. He plays it all the time. He's constantly sending me pictures of him playing that game with his group of friends. And he keeps saying like, "I need a game at least this good." And so the first few meetings were me just going over to his place with suitcases full of games. Like all my favorites, but they all tried to scratch that same itch. Like I know what's great about poetry for Neanderthalss. There's a creativity component. It's heavily players entertaining other players. And it's fast, funny. uh you can learn it in one minute and you play it in 10 minutes, right? Like I I knew I knew that was his version of what success looks like. And so uh we started playing a bunch of games like that and we started honing in on what the process what things he liked the most, what games he liked the most, which ones he didn't. And it fast became clear, okay, none of these are right. Like not a single I must have shown him a hundred different games. And the answer was, yeah, none of these. At one point, we were on this walk. We had been walking for like 6 hours and at one point I was like, "Okay, let's start as basic as it gets. What if we started with rock paper scissors?" Tim happens to like rock paper scissors and I was like, "Okay, rock paper scissors is actually no fun at all until you play it a bunch of times." Playing rock paper scissors once is stupid, but playing it again now we're playing a game because now I'm thinking, "What did he do last time? What am I going to do this time?" But he knows that I know that he knows that I know, right? like all that stuff starts to kick in at game two and it's not present at all in game number one. So I was like, what if we start there really, really basic, and instead of three activities, rock, paper, scissors, what if we had 25? And what if there was a hierarchy between all of those things? And what if we're all playing at the exact same time? And we just started with crazy statements like that. Like, I don't know what that game is. I don't know how those things make sense. But his eyes lit up and my eyes lit up and it was like something. Okay, what if also we made it rhythm based? and we ran to the house and we just started scribbling on cards as fast as we could. My buddy uh Ken Grul was there too, who's an incredibly talented designer and between the three of us, we just started crafting cards as fast as we could. And the first version of the game, of course, sucked, but it was at least something. It was at least like, hey, we are playing a game where every single person playing this game has a task. You have to do this symbol. You have to do a peace sign. You have to pretend you're a a ballerina and you have 1 second to do the right thing. And we started playing around with, all right, that's a little too easy. What if we made that harder? What if we had to switch roles? What if every roll had a color and now we have to skip all the red ones? What if we had to go twice as fast? What if we had to whisper? What if we had to shout? What if? What if? What if? What if? And we started writing all these cards fast and furious until we eventually got to this thing where we had been playing for like 4 hours. And I looked around the room and I was like, "Okay, anybody want to play again?" And both of them were like, "Hell yes." And so we kept doing that and uh then we started to invite other friends over and they started playing and we said, "Do you want to play again?" And they said, "Yes." And so we we just kept doing this thing, rinse and repeat. Remove a card, write a new card. I use these blank cards where I can create them super fast. I buy these like by the truckload on Amazon. You did that when we were uh at Sean's event. You basically you were literally on your hands and knees like dealing out cards and then you were like, you know, I don't like this one. And you pulled out like a blank card and you had a pen and you like wrote new rules. I live and breathe those cards because you know what's beautiful about those cards? They're not just cards. Like obviously you can use them to make any game you want, but like let's say you need um a six-sided die, right? And you don't have a six-sided die. You've got six cards, right? 1 2 3 4 5 six on the cards and shuffle them up and draw one. Now you got a six-sided die, right? If you need a board, you can make it out of a grid of cards. If you need a spinner, you can make that out of cards. Like I I walk around my backpack is so much heavier than it should be because it's loaded with blank cards cuz I never know when the next idea is coming. You have this great great quote you said. I took a weeklong skydiving course and at the end of it I asked the instructor, "Do you ever get bored of this?" And the guy said, "Do you ever get bored of having sex?" And I thought, "That's exactly it. This is how I feel about games. That's how I feel about this job. It's not the thing uh with an expiration. It's a little dopamine factory for me and the people who get to have these experiences. I don't know how you can get bored of that and it's just eternal. You So that was a quote that you had and I read that it's like I want to feel that way about just anything in my life. I know, right? I know. Like you know like you see kids playing with bubbles and you're like I wish I felt anyway about this kid how this feels about bubbles. And I see this and I'm like Elon's got bubbles. He's got the answer. This guy has This is the answer to life. Go ahead. I was at I was at an airport and um our flight had just been cancelled. It was so terrible because everyone was miserable. Last flight out, they're starting to hand out hotels, but they're but they're like, "Hey, the flight might come back, so everyone's got to stay in the terminal for hours and hours and hours and every hour they delayed us again." And it was awful. And everyone is miserable. Everyone is miserable. And they're frowning and they're grumpy and they're screaming at the poor gate agent. And it's awful except for this group of six kids sitting in the corner giggling and laughing. And I could not help myself. I had to walk up and see what they were doing. And of course they're playing Exploding Kittens. And I remember thinking like this is it. Like this the all the chemicals going through my body right now. Like this is why I have this job. This is the greatest feeling in the world. And I just want to keep delivering this every opportunity I have. That's so good. I was going to say, you know, my um I have these kind of people I admire for different reasons. So, it's like, you know, you can admire uh a great athlete for how they how disciplined they are, how they train their body, how they just they just never give up, right? Or you can admire Elon for, you know, thinking big and sort of defying the odds and and and really going all in on his bets and being like, you know what, I I need to have that all-in mode. And you're to me on this like on that very short list of people because you build things for the joy and from a like from a place of joy. You're like a more pure artist I think as your career. Um I see you as you know you're not like a CEO who's got a ballpoint pen. You're an artist with a brush. And then and then the second part of it is like the limitless thinking in terms of there's kind of nothing out of bounds. It's like, yeah, okay, I can register myself as a grosser or we can we could create this vendetting machine that what if it distributed any item, right? Like I would be scared to go there because how and what if what if things go wrong and I think you just think about things a little bit differently. That inspires me. Um and then the last bit is like the simplicity like figuring out when you look at something like oh the game is fun not because the game itself is fun because it makes the players fun. It's like, oh, that explains charades and Pictionary and all the games I grew up playing thousands of times and not just once or twice. It's because of that core insight or, you know, instead of doing focus groups and surveys, you're like one question, you want to play the game again. That that simplicity. So, like to me, those are the three big things that you do that I'm like, I would if I can get, you know, 10% of what you're doing there, I level up if I do that. I love to hear that. And but I'll also say it doesn't just have to apply to games. Like we um I remember during co all of our plants shut down and once once we once stuff comes in uh from China, we have to it goes into these giant warehouses and it has to be unboxed and then repackaged with all the correct labeling and then off it goes to all the retailers. And during COVID, no one could go into those facilities. like they just wouldn't allow anybody in and that was going to tank our business. we were there was no way for us to survive zero sales for you know six or 12 or two years right like no way to do it and so uh most games companies shut down for at least a little while there and I remember thinking like they're this is a no like this absolutely people are telling me no so you know to use the earlier quote like so I must be asking the wrong question and instead of calling these warehouse owners over and over again saying when do you opening your doors? When are you opening your doors? I finally asked a different question. It was, "What are you doing with your parking lots?" And the answer was, "Nothing because nobody's at work, so our parking lots are empty." And I was like, "Cool. Can I park three 18-wheeler trucks in your parking lot?" And they said, "Sure, why not?" And so I brought the games over in these 18-wheeler trucks, and I had one person per truck go inside and repackage our games because all I needed was the space. it occurred to me I didn't need the warehouse, I just need the square footage. And they've got that in their parking lot and there's no restrictions there. There's only restrictions inside the facility. And the reason I bring that up is because that's just a game, right? Like that's just somebody saying, "Here's a roadblock." Everybody else is saying, "Ah, a roadblock. I can't get through this roadblock. It's time to shut down my business." When the reality is, just ask a different question. There's a different way through this roadblock if you're willing to play the game. I used to have this high school cross country coach that was like, I'm going to teach you all about running and everything, but I'm really trying to teach you about this other pastime that we have called life. Uh, and that's sort of how I feel about you and this podcast is you came to talk a little bit about business, a little bit about creativity, but we're really learning like a good way to live. Uh, you know, that makes me so happy. Yes. to be passionate to um be passionate about what we about certain things we're doing to find uh the positive to to look positively in things that could potentially be negative and to solve problems in creative ways. Uh you're awesome. We appreciate you. Thank you so much. Hey, where should people follow you? Cuz I'm following you on Tik Tok where you're doing like it's amazing. I don't understand. Have you seen his Tik Toks? No, I'm not 12 so I don't use Tik Tok. This is a Well, you should because I need to live more like him. It'd be positive thinking like here's what's happening. Basically, the world's best game designer is on Tik Tok teaching people how to design games, little simple tricks and tips in like 30 second nuggets. And it'll get like two views cuz Tik Tok's algorithm doesn't know yet who they're who they're messing with. And I can't believe it's like you could you couldn't pay I could not pay you for this type of information, dude. you only have 177 followers. I know it makes I I just started doing this. Here's what I realized. Like I teach these classes at my company uh once a week and we we'll we'll tackle whatever topic. Here's how we write instructions. Here's what we put on the front of the box. Here's what we put on the back of the box. Here's game design. Like all over and over and over again. And we don't record any of them. And I kind of realized like I this is all going to just disappear. Like nobody's recording it. I have no motivation to record it. So, I hired a social media team and all they are they it's like it's like hiring a trainer at a gym. They come over once a week and they force me to have a camera on me and give the same class that I gave at the company just for free online. And so we've been recording them and posting them and the it's uh yeah, like you said, nobody knows they're there yet, but if you've ever wanted to learn how to make a game or more importantly how to apply those lessons to anything in the whole wide world because it's all applicable. Uh, I'm going to just keep posting these things cuz are you going to give your team some constraint like um you know without any money and only teaching creativity lessons? Figure out without making me dance on TikTok like get this to 500,000 views per video. Yeah, I should absolutely do that. I Is that what the constraints would be? Uh that basically that's what the constraints would be. It would be Yeah, it would be how to stay like true to what I want to deliver right without dancing. Um, but yeah, how to how to increase the viewership on this. And to be fair, nobody has been tasked with that yet. My my goal for the last like I don't know, it's been probably like two months has just been let me just create the content, put it in a place, and then once it's there, then it's probably worth promoting because now there's enough there to make it worthwhile. You're you're you're badass. You're awesome. You got the you got the googly eyes from us. Uh uh. All right. Shout out where where should people follow you? Just shout out your handles. Uh yeah, if you just search for the the the kind of hub of everything is just Elon Lee on YouTube. That's where I'm putting the long form stuff and then from there it links out to all of the the Tik Toks and Instagrams and everything else that where it's you can find it in shorter form. Awesome. Thanks for coming on, dude. It's such a pleasure. Thanks for having me and um yeah, just a huge fan. I'm so so grateful uh that you that you wanted to chat with me. What a what a thrill. Of course. By the way, look at how many games are behind them just within just within sight right there. Isn't that ridiculous? Yeah, that's that's one of two shelves. There's another one over there that's equally packed. Um, we've got 90 games now. 60. Sorry. We have 60 games, but 90 total because there's like weird expansions and variations and stuff. Um, yeah, it's stupid. It's just I I it doesn't make any sense to me anymore. Love it. All right. Thank you, man. That's it. That's the pod. [Music]

This guy Josh on Twitter, he tweeted out about this company called Shotsy app for tracking your ompic injections. Oh, that is funny. And it just crossed a million in ARR. And all it does is it basically is a it's a shot tracker. The woman who made this, I think her name's AA, she was an engineer at the Athletic on the side. She just built this like for her own painoint and just off of Reddit and then some Tik Toks about it. It's gotten downloaded like 100,000 times. Got this paid subscription, crossed a million in ARR. just such a simple just problem solution app that somebody realized, okay, if Ozmpic is the next big thing, I think it's like 40 million people or some like really big number of people who now all are on some schedule and realizing that you could build an app just for that population is a uh a smart idea. Have you seen like the Oscars and the Grammys? Everyone looks great. Everyone looks great. Just losing weight quickly. Are they illegal in sports? I don't think so.

They're like, "Would you be interested in selling your company?" The response was, "Fuck you. This is a family heirloom." [Music] Okay. So, what we're talking about today is Yeah. basically I don't listen to any business podcast other than Founders. It's the only business podcast I listen to. I listen to Founders and I listen to MMA and true crime. That's pretty much it. Uh, and so like I I I view you as my friend, but I also am a fan of yours. And you tweeted out this amazing thing. It was about the anti-b businessiness person, the anti-b businessinessman billionaire. So the first tenant of these uh anti-b businessiness billionaires is they have high levels of disagreeableness. This is very important because everybody around you I just use a reference of Michael Dell. Michael Dell could be on this list too. I'm reading his autobiography like and I got to the point where they're like he's he's taking the company private and they're just it's so difficult what he's trying to do and everybody's just like why don't you just give up Michael you're already rich you could start another company he's like I don't want to start another company I want this this is my first and last company in his case like that's very rare to have your first company your last company this is my last company but then he has a line he goes I'm going to care about this company after I'm dead I was like oh that's a different level so the disagreeableness like if we use the three people in the clip which is like Steve Jobs James Dyson and Ivon Shinard. It's just like they are hellbent on making the they don't bend to the world, right? They make the world bend to them and they refuse to compromise on the product quality even when it seems absurd. And like James Dyson, I got to tell you a crazy story about James Dyson cuz you know everybody's like, "Oh yeah, Dyson, the guy that like I wash my hands and like dries my it's a hand dryer in the bathroom everywhere and it's that cyclonic vacuum cleaner." It's like no, the guy has built one of the most successful companies of all time. I think it's one of the largest privately owned companies in the world. You want to hear some crazy. So there's always rumors, right? And again, privately held, so you don't have to tell. And everybody's like, "Oh yeah, you know, he's probably worth like 10 or 20 billion." I was like, "You you're off by like a lot." So a friend of mine happens to know somebody that works for and usually you can find you can find uh hints, you know, if you look at their family office, right? And a friend of mine knows somebody at the family office where they're just like, "Man, we have a big problem. like they have to deploy like4 to 5 billion dollars every year, right? Okay. And so they're like they you look and he's like James Dyson now is like the largest producer of green peas in Europe. He owns the most sheep in the entire world. Like you see all these crazy so like why where's the four or five billion coming from? He's like the rumor is that he's been taking out you know four five six 7 billion a year in dividends retaining the enterprise value obviously because he never sell any company sold 100% of it. So, I was just this like super fancy um private investor only conference, right? There's only a handful of people there. One guy controls a ton of capital and he listens to the podcast. So, we were talking and he has a problem where like the more assets under their management have the bigger you have to Buffy talks about this over and over again like to move the needle the opportunity has to be just so large and so they were buying like smaller family companies maybe in like the billion to two billion range. And so now he's like I have too much too many assets or management I have to like I have to swing bigger. So they go to approach Dyson. Okay, I'm going to paraphrase. The response back from Dyson is gonna answer your question about high levels of disagreeableness, right? They're like, "Would you be interested in selling your company?" The response was, "Fuck you. This is a family heirloom." So it's like again, he's not doing it for money. He's run out of the money he will ever spend. He's doing it because he loves it. He wants You just talked about maybe if your kids want to work in the business, you see that a lot. They they're doing it because they want to pass on to the next generation. They want to die still owning this thing. There is not you can't go to him and be like, I'll give you two trillion. It doesn't matter. It's just there's no amount of money they could give James Dyson to stop working on Dyson just like there would have been no amount of money you could have gave Steve Jobs to stop. If you go to Steve Jobs, imagine going to Steve Jobs and like, "Hey, this iPhone you created, you created the the most successful consumer product of all time. How much could would I have to pay you to not do this? There's just no could you There's no number that you could have spit out that you'd be like, "Okay, yeah, I'll retire." He's like, "I just this is what I like to do." Who's the most disagreeable person you've ever studied? Oo, that's a good question. Um, I mean, James Dyson's got to be up there because, uh, if you see the bookshelf that's in back of me, it's in order by episode number starting in the upper leftand corner. So, it goes all the way down. And so, I'm I'm going to hit like 400 uh, biographies read of history entrepreneurs this year. And my number one recommendation is still his first autobiography. He wrote an autobiography when he was 45 and he wrote another autobiography when he was 75. They're both great, but the first one's really great. Be the reason I recommend that one is because it's all struggle. The 90% of the book is just him failing over and over and over again and him refusing to give up and and what's he obsessed with? Like because obsessing over vacuums is strange. So he would describe himself as an inventor and an engineer. Definitely as an inventor. And so I what I would say is what he's obsessed with is is making the world bend to what he wants to happen. And so in many cases, if you look at the his early career, he was inventing a bunch of other successful inventions and they were like taken from him because he didn't uh keep control of the company. There's like all these little things that are happening to him that caused him a lot of emotional pain that then he fixes in the the new company. And so for him it's just like he spent 14 years be before he had the ideas like he's kind of and similar to Steve Jobs and Ivon Jinard. They're offended at the mediocrity of most of everything around us. They always talk about like why does every product we use suck? They talk about over and over and again. And so his idea is like I bought a vacuum cleaner from Hoover. It it gets clogged after the first time I use it because it has a bag. This is stupid. Why do all vacuum cleaners have bags? And those then from that thought it's 14 years 5,127 prototypes till he has a the world's first cyclonic vacuum up to his incredibly difficult standards that he owns 100% of. When does having that trait of high disagreeableness go too far? Oh, that's a good question. I don't know. Does his family love him? Uh like do they like is does he have a good relationship with his children? Cuz like Steve Jobs did did not. Um and so can you be highly disagreeable and still loved by your children? Can you be highly disagreeable and still be proud of how you treat one another? So there there is a devastating um line in Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isacson because Walter was collaborating with him as Steve was dying and he told Walter one of the reasons he wanted to do this biography is because he wanted his kid he sacrificed so much of his time at Apple that he wanted his kids to know the kind of person he was and what was important to him. That's devastating line. Dyson, from what I understand, uh, has great relationships with, he's still married to same wife, has great relationships with his kids. Some of them work inside the company, some don't. Um, but yeah, again, I spent a lot of the, as you know, because you listen to the podcast, I spent a lot of time talking about their childhood, their relationship with their father. Dyson's dad passed away when Dyson was like nine and he said, you know, he's writing a biography when he's 75 and he still cries and gets and sad that his dad, he didn't get to know his dad as an adult. his dad didn't get to see him grow up, see his success, meet his grandchildren. And so I think having that experience was just like, man, I want to make sure my kids don't have that massive hole that I had in my life. Not any fault of his own. His dad died of cancer from at a young age. Um, no, so I don't think they're mutually exclusive, but yeah, you you you definitely see a lot of these highly describable people. Like James Cameron is probably the best podcast I've ever done in in terms of like what I like craft, and I'm really proud of that episode. I did like two or three years ago. And I start the episode kind of, you know, giving you a hint of the highly disagreeable personality where I'm like reading from this GQ article and it's like James Cameron has moved to New Zealand with his fifth wife. And it's like nobody could have a fifth wife without that's that that should tell you if you're reading lines that's a difficult person to deal with. All right. A few episodes ago I talked about something and I got thousands of messages asking me to go deeper and to explain and that's what I'm about to do. So, I told you guys how I use ChatGBT as a life coach or a thought partner. And what I did was I uploaded all types of amazing information. So, I uploaded my personal finances, my net worth, my goals, different books that I like, issues going on in my personal life and businesses. I uploaded so much information. And so, the output is that I have this GPT that I can ask questions that I'm having issues with in my life, like how should I respond to this email? What's the right decision? knowing that you know my goals for the future, things like that. And so I worked with HubSpot to put together a step-by-step process showing the audience, showing you the software that I use to make this, the information that I had chat GBT ask me, all this stuff. So, it's super easy for you to use. And like I said, I use this like 10 or 20 times a day. It's literally changed my life. And so, if you want that, it's free. There's a link below. Just click it, enter your email, and we will send you everything you need to know to set this up in just about 20 minutes. and I'll show you how I use it again 10 to 20 times a day. Um, all right. So, check it out. The link is below in the description. Back to the episode. All right. Number uh two, they have extreme self-confidence and they do what works for them. So, what's an example of that? So, that line that they do what works for them, there's this guy named Tim Grover who was the trainer of both Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant and he wrote a book all about comparing and contrasting them. It was really fascinating. And he says what they had in common was that they do what works for them regardless of what other people do. Like they were indifferent. There's another great line in that book that I think is a lot of people that you and I are going to talk about have in common where it's like everyone wanted to be like Mike. Mike didn't want to be like anybody else. And so in situations like that which like they are I would say there's this line in in Dyson's book where he calls his method of invention, his method of company building, he calls it the Edisonian principle of design. He is not a big, hey, I have a master plan. He's like, I'm going to just do an experiment, get immediate feedback, and do a constant set of iterations. There's this great book that I I'd re I've read three times. I think every single entrepreneur in the planet should read it. It's called Creative Selection. It is written by Ken Kosienda. He was a programmer who demoed jobs. And in that book is the most detail. He helped he was the one that in uh that programmed the initial uh Safari browser and then he created the Safari browser and then the keyboard for the first iPhone. What he shows in there is like it was just all the great products that came out of Apple were just a series of iterative demos to Steve and Steve applying his personal taste. This is why I think when you talk to a lot of investors and to me when I talk to them I'm like man you you think about business way too academically, you know, like if as if you could sit at a whiteboard and like plan and master plan everything out. It's like I don't see that in the books I read. It's like these little a series of just small decisions every day, getting a bunch of feedback and then essentially just changing course slightly every single day and then doing that over a long period of time and constantly improving you get to amazing products and amazing businesses. Are the people who have extreme self-confidence were they self-confident at a young age or did something happen like I guess born versus uh becoming that all three of those. So if we're if Ivon Shinard, Steve Jobs, and James Dyson excessively self-confident at a young age. And I think part of this has to do and I'm speaking from my own uh personal experience. It's like you grow up with uh almost like you're seeking revenge for the circumstances in which you've been born in. You know, Steve Jobs was adopted. Ivon Chernard had no his family didn't have any money. James Dyson doesn't have a dad. And you just like everybody's around you is like, "Oh, you're not good enough." And you're like, "No, I'm pretty sure I'm better than you are. and I will show you and I'm willing to work and make sure to prove what I believe. I always say belief comes before ability. And you know, I I see this over and over again. People are like, "You shouldn't be confident. You should uh generate evidence first." Like, no, you have that completely backwards. They believe that they can do great things way before the like there's any proof in the physical world. Let me give an example. Uh in the Michael Dell book, he hits the Fortune 500 when he's like 26 years old. And ba basically for the listener Michael Dell I believe at the age of 16 17 18 in college in a college dorm he was selling computer parts to help people assemble computers right he was he started Dell in as a really the prehistory of Dell really happened when he's like 16 17 he officially started as a freshman in his freshman dorm at University of Texas but the the Fortune 500 thing is important because it's like yeah he goes could the kid that grew up reading Fortune magazine possibly predict that I'd start a company that broke into the Fortune 500. He goes, "Yeah, I always thought big." He doesn't try to hide. He's like, "Yeah, I had a lot of confidence. Like, I knew I could do this. I believed I could do this." Now, he did he think he'd hit it at 26? Probably not. But he he got there even faster. That's the point. He had the belief first and then he demonstrated the ability. You also say that the So, the third principle is they're obsessed with product quality. And I hear people say this a lot, but I've because I've never had a job, I've never been able to like uh uh intern or apprentice at one of these folks who are obsessed with product. I've never been able to see firsthand what they're like on a day-to-day basis. Can you give me an example of what they do each day in order to actually be products? You know, I I love that you frame that question like that. What do they do each day? I was thinking about this this morning. Um I was thinking about the conversation we're going to have today and I think what all the the the entrepreneurs I admire have in common is how they want to spend their time is working on their company. So like I get invited to a lot of things I say no to most of them because like everything that's not working on the podcast is a giant distraction. And so if you go and actually look Tim Cook said this after Steve Jobs died. He's like if you took an inventory of how Steve spent his time he was at Apple and then when he wasn't Apple he was at home with his family. He wasn't going to conferences. He wasn't trying to be on the scene. Ivon Chinard, what is he doing? He's working on product and he's testing the product. James Dyson 75. The guy's probably worth hundred billion dollars if we're being honest. And where's he at? He's on the front. He's on literally the factory floor and then he's with the design team. The important thing, and you see this, this is the problem with modern day entrepreneurship industry is they like like everything except actual what their company actually does. So, if you can find love, right, in the activity itself, you're able to do it for a long time. I got to have, this is the main thing. I had lunch with Sam, who we could talk about, too. That 2-hour lunch changed my life, right? And his main advice to me was never relinquish the freedom on what you work on. He goes, "The the more successful you you become, people are going to try to constantly dangle opportunities that are distractions in front of you. And they're going to do that for two reasons. They're going to try to offer you more money and more status." He's like, "Retain your freedom." And he said something that's brilliant. He goes, "Uh, go for freedom. If you have freedom, you can control with what what you work on. If you control what you work on, you can choose to work on what you love. If you love it, you'll do it all the time. If you do it all the time, you'll get good at it. And money will come as a result of that." And so all of the people that I admire, it's like they don't want to go, you know, they're not trying to go out fundraising. They're not trying to like go party all the time. They're literally like just obsessed with what they're doing. And so everything that like if you take an inventory of their time, it's like the time is just spent on the company because I like that. Let me give you my example for me, right? You know this because you have a podcast. We can log into our podcast host right now and change you can charge you could change the name of my first million, right, to to Sam's Club, right? You can change whatever you want. I can change founders whatever I want. The thing you cannot change is the RSS the URL slug that for the for the first time you set up your RSS feed, right? And that URL slug will have the first name of your podcast. My podcast went through multiple names. The first one was autotellic. The definition of autotellic is an activity done for the sake of itself. I was telling you right from the rip, I don't care if no one listens. I'm going to do this. I it is in inside of me and I have to get it out. I'm going to do this. I would be reading these books and talking about history and entrepreneurship and founders and crazy psychotic people because that's what I love to do. I'd be doing it if no one listened. I love hearing you talk about this. Do you think that you've gotten more crazy and more obsessed reading about these people? For sure. For sure. So, first of all, you know this because we've talked about podcasting a bunch and and a lot of people like try to like part-time it. I think literally like podcasting is a miracle. The idea that anything you want to learn, right? Me and you grew up similarly. We didn't have access to a lot of money. We didn't I don't think you went to an Ivy League school. Like I couldn't go to an Ivy League school any at all. Right. My wife went to Ivy League school and when I met her and she told me first I she said she went to Penn and I was like is that where that football rapist coach guy goes and she's like no it's like a she's like it's like it's like a it's like a big school. It's like a big shot like we're like we're part of the Ivy League. I was like what the is Ivy League? Is that Hogwarts? I don't know what that means. Dude, I I I have a rather embarrassing story. Like first of all, not only did my parents never grade graduate college, they never graduated high school. So the entire time I was growing up, they never mentioned the word college to me one time. And so I remember being in high school and they're like, "What colleges are you applying to?" I'm like, "What? The one I can drive to because I got to go to school night cuz I got to work full-time during the day." Like, "What are you talking about?" I I moved in. I went to student housing and I uh my roommate was from like Colorado somewhere. That was the first time I ever knew, this is really embarrassing, that people didn't work and go to school. Like he just went to classes. That's all he did. Like he had nothing else. I I couldn't even fathom that. So the reason I'm so obsessed with podcasting and everything else is like you have all any subject you want to learn about. You have somebody that is usually spent 5 10 you know 10 plus years studying that and you can learn from them for free on demand anytime you want to. How could you not be absolutely obsessed with that? So to answer your question the reason I started reading this and I didn't even understand this. A friend of mine is the one that told me this. He he visited me in Miami and he's like it's pretty this is like two years ago and he's like it's pretty obvious what you're doing. I go what? He goes, "You didn't have any mentors or any good good examples. So if you're like how you are," which is kind of like psychopathically obsessed. He's like, "So you just started reading and trying to find like good examples for yourself." Um, and so there's a line, there's this guy name who built this like multi-billion dollar art business that he controls 100% of. And on the the profile that I read to make the episode, there's a line about him. He says he got so good at selling art to the masters of the universe that he became one. He starts out literally selling art in a parking lot and he got so successful he's now a peer. So the reason I'm doing this is like I'm trying to build the best product for the best people in the world. And so yeah, like it is, you know, I I take a lot of the ideas from the podcast and just apply it to my own business, which just happens to be the podcast where I derive the insights from to begin with. The next one is retention of total control. What are the trade-offs of owning everything and being maniacal about the details versus delegation? Because often times, for example, my favorite author, business author is Felix Dennis. He wrote the book How to Get Rich. He's not nearly as serious as these other guys. He's like kind of like a MC Jagger and Richard Branson combined. He's like a rock and roll partyier, but he became a billionaire. He says that de delegation is the reason why he's anything is he's like I'm a master delegator which I imagine a Richard Branson type of person would say a similar type of thing whereas you have Elon Musk or maybe uh Koko Chanel or a couple other folks where they are good examples of being in total control and maniacal about the details. I think uh um Estee Lauder I believe she was uh pretty nutty. What are the pros and cons and trade-offs and which do you prefer? I love that you you asked this question because this is the the great thing about entrepreneurship is like you get to decide what's best for you. Like there is not one way. There's not one right way. I could give you examples of people I covered that delegated everything and people that delegated nothing. I just did Todd Graves. Have you ever gained you used to live in Austin? You're you're a fellow fat boy. Well, I was a former fellow fat boy. Former Yeah. Yeah. But I saw him talk I think on Theo Von or something like that and I was like wow you're amazing. And so I went to Raising Canes and started eating it just because he was maniacal like you don't think of a fast food restaurant as being focused on the product but there is a a need for it for sure. But he was like we only do these types of fries. We only do chicken. We only and like it's the simplest thing where I'm like how hard could this possibly be that you need 30 years to master this? Let's go figure it out. I so I just did an episode on him which I think is going to be one of the most popular episodes ever just because I when people would ask me like who's you study dead entrepreneurs like what about the living ones that you like and I would bring up Todd Graves I'm like the chicken finger guy like no well he's got a and he's got a he's got a really uh relatable demeanor. Yeah. you want to hang out with him. But also, I'm even if I was even if he was was a jerk, the way he built his business, you know, he owns over 90% of a business that's worth at least $10 billion is growing 30% year-over-year. And he's been doing the same thing, you know, for 30 years. And I just love everything. I'm obsessed with Simplicity. I just love everything about him. But the funny thing is in one of the interviews I found with him, he literally says, you know, people told him when he was younger, you're you're you're a micromanager. You have to delegate. You can't possibly do the stuff you're doing now. And he has a great line. He goes, delegate? what kind of word is that? Like he's just like that that doesn't even make sense to me. And he goes and all the people, the experts that gave me that advice, I'm bigger than they are now. And so he's literally giving this interview and they interrupt the interview because they had some event and his social media team was showing them the reel of the video reel that was about to come out. This guy's, you know, running a business. He has uh 50,000 employees, 800 stores, you know, unbelievable amount of responsibility. And he's like, it doesn't go out until I approve it. He's approving every single Steve Jobs did the exact same thing. He wouldn't let Apple go ads go out uh without approving it. He there's a there's another thing um every single location. I approve every single new location. Uh you mentioned Elon Musk early days of SpaceX. He personally Elon personally interviewed the first 3,000 employees of SpaceX. Sam Walton, go back even further. He approved he picked out I think the first few thousand Walmarts. So a lot of them are I would consider micromanagers. There are some that, you know, delegate w delegate widely. What's more important than that though is like it depends on your personality type. Like for me, I am a complete micromanager. I'm one of the only podcasters still like still making podcast that actually edits his own podcast. Everybody every other podcaster tells me, "You're idiot. Why are you doing that?" And it's just like I'm completely obsessed with it. And I hate it, but I love it at the same time. I it's the the part about podcasting I like the least, but it's so important for me to completely control the final product. Um, so again, I I don't think there's one right way here. It's just like really you have to think about like how do you want to run your business? Another thing that you said uh was that they uh refused to make me too products. Is there a story that you have where standing out by having a different product was key to them winning or also nearly ruined them? Let's I don't know about anybody ruined them. Um let's use the the the the pre prehistory of Patagonia, right, which is worth a couple billion dollars, privately held company, you know, and as you know cuz it's in the book in the episode. It's like he didn't he was kind of like a communist. He didn't even want to start a business. He was a he calls himself a dirt bag. He was like, "I was a dirt bag climber. I lived in a van. I traveled around just trying to climb mountains." And you know, which by the way, that is there's a dichotomy there. If you weren't if you're a communist, why do you fully own your company versus giving out equity? Cuz he's obsessed with Exactly. There's a It's almost like a paradox, right? Uh the uh Yeah, cuz he's obsessed with control. So that that go all ties back to control. Now sometimes you can maintain control. Public company Zuck Mark Zuckerberg has complete control of Facebook, public company. Steve Jobs had complete control of Apple, public company. Dyson obviously private, Bloomberg private, you know, uh, Patagonia private. But if you start there, it's like his his whole thing was just like, hey, I'm my life is literally hangs in the balance of these clips that people use for mountain climbing. And he's like, these clips are plastic. They suck. They break. This is not good. And they they they would optimize for for cost because most dirt bag climbers have no money. And so it would be like 75 cents each. And what did he do? You you ask him what his profession is. is he said, "I'm a blacksmith." Cuz that was his his trade, his craft. He's like, "Hey, I could do a better job than this." He starts using higherend steel. And now he sells what used to cost 75 cents cuz it was differentiated for $4, more than 4x what what the market is used to paying. And he wind up sealing up like 80 to 90% market share because his was so much better. So they if they feel that the they're not starting companies just to start companies, they're starting companies to make products. And so therefore, they're not going to make a product if somebody else is already doing that. No one made the products that Steve Jobs made. No one made the products that James Dyson made. No one made the products Ivon Shannard made. And I talk to founders all the time and even podcasters and I'm like, man, you why are especially in in in our trade. It's like, why aren't podcasters thinking more about differentiation? When I started my podcast in 2016, one, I thought it was too late, right? I was like, oh my god, I missed the boat. But I looked around. I was like, what is everybody doing? Everybody's doing the same thing. It's like two people, one person interviewing another. This is why my first million first came on my radar when I came on your podcast two years ago. I mentioned I listened over 100 hours of it cuz it was truly differentiated. It's like two guys have great chemistry. They're funny. They're both entrepreneurs and sometimes they're going to just shoot the and talk about ideas and brainstorm. Sometimes they'll bring people in. Like it was a very unique format. You've seen since then obviously because of the success of the show like what happens like you have a bunch of people trying to do it and then none of them achieve the same success because they're not first of all they're they're not they're the copers. They're not the ones that actually came up with the format and came up with the idea. So, uh, one thing I would just say is like I if the product already exists, I would only make it if you see that there's a giant hole and a way to like make it better. In the case of James Dyson, there's everybody had a vacuum cleaner. They were all crappy compared to his. I paid Listen, I you can go on Amazon right now and buy vacuum cleaner for 40 bucks. I have a Dyson. It was $600. It's literally the best. It's the best. Do you think that there's a common theme amongst so everyone most most of the people who you've named and of maybe most of the people you cover on founders they're creating higherend products where the margins are probably a bit higher. So, I have a $600 Dyson. Um, I have, um, you know, Patagonia now is more mid-tier maybe. Um, but you've covered a lot of, you know, luxury brands and I think that a lot of like LVMH, like luxury brands tend to be the biggest and best businesses, it appears. Yeah. Is there a commonality of you being different and thus being able to charge more and profit more? I don't like the one person if if you ask like my own personal Mount Rushmore of like history's greatest entrepreneurs is they actually had like uh some of them obviously have big margins like Apple right but then like think of Sam Walton like Sam Walton had the tiniest margins why because like his idea was like hey I'm going to be totally committed to this one simple idea which is like everyday low price and so the margins are small raising Kane's one of my f favorite entrepreneurs his margins like less than 10%. So yeah, I don't I I think these ideas can work for it really just depends on the industry and the business, but like you see them appear over and over again, whether it's a high margin business, a low margin business, if it's physical goods, if it's luxury goods, if it's software, it's just like the kind of the same personality type over and over again. I'm going to combine the last two, which is this the the first of the two was they wouldn't sell at any price. And this is the second one, their exit strategy is death, which I love. I absolutely love is this particularly with AI. I don't know if you've seen I know you're not like with it when it come because you're so focused like you I think you've said you don't pay attention to the news. You don't pay attention to social media too much. There's this thing called vibe coding. Have you seen vibe coding? It's basically Yes. So it's like we've had a few of them who can go from zero to a million a month in revenue because it's so fast and easy to make apps. Yeah. Do you think that people today are thinking shorter term than before or has there always been a gap of a very few amount of people are willing to think long term versus the short term? I think both. I think yeah, undoubtedly more a larger percentage of humanity is thinking short term and that we've always as a species been wired to be short-term. Jeff Bezos has a great idea of this is why why he would be constantly willing to have a longer term view. His point was that like if you're planning on a year if you're investing in a product that may not, you know, reap any benefits over a year, you have a lot of competition. 5 years, less competition. 10 years, no competition. Like just nobody is thinking that long term. So if we have a long, I think he calls it long-term orientation. If we have a long-term orientation, then I want to do that because we just have by default, by sheer numbers, I have less amount of competitors. Now, I need to back up. I am only interested in people that do things for a long term and I'm interested in your last business. I am not interested in your, you know, your startup, your first business. In many cases, what I'm interested is like what is the thing that is going like the reason um I become so close with the founders of RAMP. It's bec and we have this deep partnership. It's like one of the things I love is I talked to Kareem. I'm actually seeing him tonight who's the the co-founder and CTO of RAMP, one of the most brilliant technical minds that I know. And one of the things way before we became friends, way before we became partners, he's just like ramp's the last my last business like like this is I have all you know 90 99% of my net worth into it. I spent all my days. I'm not thinking about anything else. Like that's what I'm very interested in. And many cases to get to that last business you usually have to serve. Cream had already started start and sold a company. Usually you have to go through a ton. It's very rare for like the Mark Zuckerbergs, the Michael Dells, you know, even Steve Jobs like to to be your for your first company to be your last company, which is what I had. I think and I did it because I saw a theme that a lot of the people who had who I had admired had a hit in their 20s or 30s that allowed them to think longer term. That that is key, right? One, I think it's a mistake if you ever sell your best idea, whether you have money or not. So, never sell your best idea. But in in the case you're describing it's like if you can relieve you know financial pressure mean you grew up with financial pressure it feels and it's real like it it's it it destroys you. You can't sleep. There are people who can overcome and just go all in at a young age. In general it seems it's easier when you have a wealthy parent or when you have some type of you don't need to worry about rent for three or four years. That that is it is easier that way. So, so to get that like, hey, I'm not going to have to worry about feeding, taking care of my wife, my kids, feeding myself and give yourself room to breathe and then you're able to step back and like, here's the thing. A lot of this is just self exploration. Like, dude, I know myself so much better now than I did. Think about when you're like, you're supposed to be picking your career when you're in high school cuz then you got to figure out what you're going to major in. It's like the stupidest thing ever. Like, nobody if you're the same person you were at 18, that's very bizarre. And so like I I just think part of picking a successful company and a successful career you can do for a long period of time is like you have to go through this exploration of who you are as a person and what your true interests are. The problem is with humans like we think oh like vibe coding is really cool. I like these kids are making money but eventually through all these experiments they might discover what they actually you know truly want to dedicate their lives to. Um so I think it's like an overall good thing. Um, but yeah, I I think the advantage that if you as an entrepreneur, as a podcaster, as a writer, as an athlete, whatever the case is, like if you can think long, you just have a massive advantage if you could just have a longer term perspective than other people. And this is the important thing is like when I'm able to choose what I work on, I'm not worried about what like my downloads today or like my audience size today. It's just like as long as I do this forever, right, and I keep focusing on adding value to other people's lives because money comes down to service, then I'll get as long as I wake up every day, read a biography of history's greatest entrepreneurs, and sit down once a week and talk about what I learned and do that forever. I'll let the the score take of itself, the chips will fall where it is. Like, I will get everything I actually deserve. I don't want the listener to think long-term means it's it's okay if I don't kick ass today. And a lot of people will justify this and say, "Well, it's a marathon, not a sprint." And to them, I say, "Yeah, but have you ever ran a uh like a 100 meters at the world record marathon pace? It's going to feel like a sprint to you." Like, you have to be able to run fast for a long period of time. And what I and what and what I mean by that is that doesn't excuse day-to-day um lack of urgency. you still need to be uh impatient on a daily level but patient on an annual level. Additionally, can you tell me the people who thought long-term they were still maybe you can give me examples but that doesn't mean that they were broke five or 10 years into starting their company or that they didn't have traction or did they am I wrong? So the the to like close the loop on what you just said, I agree completely. If you think of like there's not very many entrepreneurs that had a longerterm perspective than Jeff Bezos and his line about this was like, "Yeah, we have long term, but like we're going to take step by step ferociously was his motto. Step by step, ferociously." Not like, "Oh, we're going to lolly gag." It's like, "No, no, no. I'm fine being, you know, you know, we're going to be the company we want 10, 15 years from now." But every day for the next 10 to 15 years, like we're pushing the pace and we're doing as much as we can. Um, people that were broke five or 10 years in. Je uh James Dyson for sure. He was literally going to sleep covered in dirt because he's trying to build a vacuum cleaner for the entire time going going inside crying himself to sleep as his kids are small and then his kids are completely grown up. He was in massive amounts of debt. He couldn't find no one. The reason he owns 100% of his company is because no one would would uh would actually want the equity which is hilarious considering how valuable it is now. But also he was like he had second loans out on his on his he had a second mortgage on his home. He was crying himself to sleep. So he was he was nearly bankrupt at some point. He was Oh yeah. Yeah. For for and if it's not the full 14 years it was a good chunk because he started licensing it. He he had some small wins where he could actually pay his bills but he was not like a a wealthy man. Steve Jobs rich from the get-go. You know app he builds the first Apple in his garage. Four years later he's worth $100 million and the company's public. Like it was pretty crazy. Von Chinard broke for an excessively long period of time. Like there isn't like a you know just it's a case by case basis. Jeff Bezos already wealthy. He worked for this hedge fund in New York called De Shaw and he quit that and gave up a huge bonus to move uh to Seattle but he was already you know able to live in Manhattan. He was working for a billionaire Sam Walton. Now here's another and by the way I think Amazon had like a hundred million in sales like four years in or something. Super fast. Super fast. He was like by the time he was 30. So he starts the company at 30. I think by 35 he's a billionaire. I tracked him on this when I like had my uh I had this sheet where I tracked probably 300 people and I had timelines for each of them of when they were born when they started the thing that allowed them to be a little bit financially free when that period ended and then when they started the thing that made them huge. And he uh started Amazon at 32 and between the ages of like 24 or whenever you graduate college to 32. Presumably he was making some amount of money like the equivalent of $250 to $500,000 a year today. For sure. For sure. Sam Walton had his first, this is an interesting thing cuz there is an idea uh a principle I've noticed is like go slow now so you can go faster later. And what I mean by that is like Sam Walton, greatest retailer of all time, undoubtedly he had one store for 5 years. And so he was obsessively learning everything he possibly could about retail, doing all these experiments. And so then you fast forward, you know, one store for 5 years. Then you fast forward, let's say 25 years into his career, he has the idea. He's already has Walmart, but he's like, "Hey, he meets this guy named Soul Price, who I've done episodes." How many years? Did you say 25? Well, let's say 25 years into his career, right? So, so, so the first five years of his career, it's one store. 25 years in, let's say around there, he he's got Walmart, but then he he has this idea for Sam's Club, which he got he took from other people. He took from this guy named Soul Price, who's uh he came up with the warehouse club idea. Uh the founder of Costco was Soul Price's mentee when he was like Jim Synagol was like 18 working for Soul Price. That's where he got the idea for Costco. Sam Walton sees that. He's like, "Oh, this is a great idea. I'm going to do it immediately." So 25 years into his career, he didn't have to stick with one store for 5 years. So when he launched Sam's Club, within the first 5 years, he gets to like 105 stores and like 7 billion in revenue. Same period. When he started out, he can only master one tiny little store in Arkansas. But the ski your skill set and your resources and everything compounds. That's the point. Todd Graves talks about, you know, I think he by the time he gets like he's 10 the the Raising Canes guy, he I think he's 10 to 12 years into his career, he's got 28 stores. Sounds like a lot, right? He opens like 150 stores a year right now or 100 between 100 and 150 stores a year. Go slow at the beginning to go faster later. He's learning and he's going to apply that is this is the important thing about not jumping from business to business to business because if you jump from business to business to business, all you're doing is interrupting and compounding. Was it clear a lot of these, you know, the world's greatest entrepreneurs, was it clear that their TAM was big enough to achieve their ambitions? No. Absolutely not. No. Like for example, you'd be like, look, this chicken figure thing, that's maybe silly, but I guess McDonald's is huge. I guess you could be kind of like McDonald's. I think he's if he did think of anything, he thought of In-N-Out. Uh, In-N-Out was found in 1948. If you look at In-N-Out's menu, looks looks like Todd Graves. OB there's other people before him was like to me Todd Graves is just Harry Snider reincarnated who was the founder of In-N-Out but instead of doing burgers he does he does chicken fingers but no like uh I I just went over this because I'm going through the Michael Dell episode right now like there's just like no way like he knew computers were like most people hadn't even seen a computer and like he was just completely obsessed with it. So there's no way he could have predicted the financial success he was going to have and that that and how big the market could actually get. You know, he started with Dell with $1,000, no venture capital, $1,000. And his main competitor was Compact, who started with like 25 million of venture capital. And Michael Dell is super competitive, but nice. The the book is called Play Nice and Win. Play play nice butt win. But he's like, he's constantly contrasting. He's like, I started with a,000. They started with 25 million. I'm kicking their ass. It's really funny. And Dell would tell you that having the constraints of limited capital was really good at the beginning because it c it forced him to innovate and to uh in a way that you wouldn't if you had money. And I was like, "Oh, wow. That's interesting." So, I go and pull my highlights from Sam Walton. Sam Walton said the same thing. Kmart existed before Walmart. Kmart was dominating the big cities. Cuz if you're going to start retail, where you going to go? You're going to go to Chicago? You're going to go to New York and go all the other places. So, he's like, "Well, I can't go there. I don't have any money." So, he starts going in these little towns in rural Arkansas. And what he learned, he goes, "Oh, constraints are your friend." Because if we were uh we if we were better capitalized, I would have never went out into these tiny little communities. And what I discovered is in these tiny little communities, there's far far more business than could we could have ever predicted. Perfect example to your to your question. You're the man, David. I appreciate you doing this. I could just like I think the listener will notice this is probably the podcast that I've spoken the least amount of of all 700. I uh I've I've listened to uh hundreds uh of your episodes. I think you're at like what 400? I think I've listened to half of them now. I appreciate that. I appreciate you. That's it. That's the pod.

So, you went from selling worms to How much money does NFX have under management now? Uh, close to 1.6 billion. Yeah. Does that blow your mind? Like, blows my mind. Blows my mind. What are the traits of a savage founder? Speed. School taught you what time looks like and now you think this is how the world moves. You're you're wrong. Your speed bar is wrong. So, if I'm a founder, what are the most common emotional blockers slowing me down? The big one is just fear. We have these mindsets bred into us by the normies. Why is it that sort of 85 90% of all returns in tech have come from the Bay Area? It's because the mindsets here are slightly different. So, can you make me smarter as a founder? Cuz it seems like this is important. Don't think of yourself as choosing a job or choosing an industry. Think of yourself as choosing a network. What do you think of people who are investing in OpenAI or the the sort of the models is that where the value is going to occur? Yeah, I don't get it. I don't get it. I think they're making a big mistake. What do you think is the juiciest kind of opportunity? Whether you're an entrepreneur or an investor, there is going to be opportunity. And can you tell your high school story? Cuz when I was doing my research, it looks like James, Harvard, Princeton, exit, you know, like you went to the top high school, the top college, the top business school. So I just thought you must either come for money or just prestige alumni something. But I guess you were telling me before we started that's not the case. Yeah. So I love the phrase you said. They got me out of the mud. I I love you said that. Yeah. They plucked me from from the mud. I I uh grew up on a dirt road in New Hampshire about a mile from the nearest paved road. My mom was a music teacher. My dad she made about seven bucks an hour. And my dad was a uh a carpenter. Sometimes she was a hostess at a at a nearby restaurant. And um we had 12 cats and two dogs. We just we lived in the middle of nowhere. And I would sell worms to fishermen who would be fishing nearby. That was my first job when I was sick. Now, my first job, my first startup was when I was six, and they would come by and they'd need worms to go fishing. And so, I would dig them out from under the apple trees that were nearby and and put them in the uh empty cat food cans that we had in the house and uh sell them for 50 cents. And uh I would make, you know, six bucks a week during the summer because they would come up the driveway and I would just sell them worms. And then I went on to do all sorts of other businesses. But what happened was in sixth grade I got beat up by a guy named James Cody. I hope he's doing well, but he was kind of brutal. I'm sure he did not have an easy life, right? Uh because he was making my life hard, too. And uh and as my friend Lance Casey picked me up off the ground, uh he said, "Don't worry, James. We're going to go to prep school." And I said, "What's prep school?" And he said, "It's where the smart kids go." And I said, "Do they fight there?" And he said, "No, they don't fight there." And I said, "Well, then I want to go there." Uh because I'm I'm a small guy. I still weigh 165 pounds. I mean, as as my sons call me, who are all now taller than me, they call me victim weight. Dad, you're still victim weight. So, so anyway, fighting wasn't my forte. And so, uh, I went home to my dad and I said, you know, I want to go to prep school. And he's like, how did you hear about prep school? And I said, well, Lance told me. Now, Lance's dad was like the local surgeon and Lance was half Iranian and half Italian and, you know, the kids kind of picked on him, too. And and whatnot. So, um, he and I were sort of bonded together and and that really changed my life. And so, my dad figured out that I needed to take these SSAT tests. So, I took the test and then and then I applied and and they let me in and we didn't have any money, so they just paid for So exit or paid for it. And so that that really set my whole life off in a different direction. And I, you know, I had, you know, uh, used clothes from Goodwill and everybody else had fancy clothes and, you know, but and everybody was grinding. We just grinded. And so by the end of my junior year, I had skipped out of the first two and a half years of Princeton engineering. So at the end of that of of the high school, they said, you know, you can uh you can choose Harvard, Princeton, or Yale cuz you've achieved all this stuff. you built a hovercraft that went 35 miles an hour. You're clearly an engineer. You know, pick which one you want to go to. And I said, "What's the furthest place from here?" So, I have been assisted by the whole system all the way along. And uh you know, people talk about beat their chest and say, "I'm a self-made man." And it's complete [ __ ] Like most most of us are function of a sixth grade friend who put us on a completely different path. Right. And you went from selling worms for 50 cent making, you know, 50 cents a worm to how much money does NFX have under management now? Uh, close to 1.6 billion. Yeah. Does that blow your mind? Like blows my mind. I've written here a bunch of kind of like the greatest hits. So these are some of the big ideas that you've shared with me. Let's see your life on network effects. So the nfx.com website is the second most popular VC website in the world and and produces a lot more content. They've got like 600 people, you know, right? We have 10 people, but we're the second most popular. And the most popular blog post was called Your Life on Network effects. Can you do the quick explainer? So, for somebody who doesn't know what network effect is, a network effect is every new person who uses your product makes the product more valuable for the other users of the product. And the great example is Twitter. The more people who are tweeting, the more valuable Twitter becomes for everyone. Facebook, Microsoft operating system. more people using Microsoft operating system, the more it's more valuable for Word Perfect to build their software on top of Microsoft so that more people can use it. And the more people that are using Word Perfect, the more I can share my word perfect, um, you know, file with other people. So these are all network effects. So if you look at the top, you know, uh, seven companies in the world in terms of market cap, five or six of them have network effects at their core. And that was not true 30 years, 20 years ago. Uh, and so most of the big things that dominate our life, whether it's Comcast or whatever, these all have network effects businesses. And so we study them, we invest in them. We have spent the last 20 years becoming sort of the world's experts at them. We've identified 17 of them. They're mathematical principles, right? And in talking these through with Eric and others, he started to get these wide eyes like, "Oh, that affects how I'm dating. Oh, that affects where I should live. That affects what happened to my dad. And I was and he was realizing that the analysis of networks and the network topologies and network dynamics was actually really applicable to how we live our lives. So give me a simple example. So where's besides business? How does network effects work in my life? Dating parent uh you know friends the simplest and most relevant is where you choose to live. So a city is a network right and if you choose to live in a city you are choosing that network. And so basically what the article says is don't think of yourself as choosing a job or choosing an industry or think of yourself as choosing a network. Okay, my company is a network who I hire into my network. Which journalist I get to write about, I bond that person into my network, right? Which investors I bond into my network, right? So we think of everything. Once you start thinking of everything as networks, like the whole world looks a little bit different to you. Where should I go to find a spouse? Well, think about your network. when you get married, you're joining her network, right? And she's joining your network. You're gonna have to have Christmas and Thanksgiving or whatever with her parents forever, right? Like, and what your life on network effects does, it breaks it down into seven phases of your life where you are basically choosing a network and and it'll have a really big impact on how your life plays out. Hey, let's take a quick break, but instead of an ad, I have a freebie for you. Uh it is my pitch deck template. So, if you're a founder and you're ever looking to raise money from investors, the reality is most founders are pretty bad at telling their own story. Their decks are bad. I've seen thousands of decks. I can tell you that most decks don't do the business justice. And so, I actually made a template of what I use for my own companies. I've given this out before in my newsletter. Thousands of people have downloaded it and I get emails all the time saying, "Hey, thanks for that template. I used it. I raised my round." So, it's a freebie. If you want to ever raise money from investors, go grab it. There's a link in the description below. And it just tells you like slide by slide like put this here, put this here, put this here with a little bit of commentary of why you're arranging the structure in that order. I think it will raise your odds of successfully raising a funding round. So go ahead and grab it. It's my free pitch deck template. Let's pull another card. See what we got. Okay. Okay. Savage founders. Yeah. So uh so you know, look, I've been a founder four times and then the fifth time is starting a venture firm. So I have been a founder myself and I've invested in I don't know 300 uh different companies over the years and the thing that keeps coming up is that in order to do something extraordinary you have to be relatively savage which means you have to be very fast. You have to be very competitive and you you tend to have to be pretty aggressive and and you just can never can never stop. And a lot of people say, "Oh, they need to be missiondriven." But that gets confusing with that word or they need to have had childhood trauma. And that that's that may be true for some people for sure. But in the end, we use the word savage just because you just go for it every day. You know, it's like you wake up every morning and you're listening to Bring Me to Life and you're just, you know, you're cranking um and and that sort of thing. And that's that's what we look for in founders. And that's who I like to be and that's who uh I like hanging out with. And who what are the traits of a savage founder? So you so I think people would immediately gravitate towards like maybe hardworking or determined things like that. So the number one thing that it it rolls up into is speed. So you could you could lay out 16 characteristics that you're looking for but all of those lead to one thing which is speed. And so if we measure speed when we're meeting with the founders, that's the main thing that determines and and if you look at their speed over the next 5 6 7 8 10 years when we're working with them, that's the main thing that determines their success is that now to get to speed, you typically have to push out people who aren't fast. So you end up firing a lot of people um who aren't willing to sacrifice uh who don't enjoy, you know, type two fun, the fun that you look back on and you suffered, but you look back on it as if it was fun, right? Type one fun, fun in the moment. Type two fun, look back on it. Is that it? That's right. And type two fun is you're suffering through the whole thing, but but at the end you look back and realize it was fun. Like staying up for a hackathon for three straight days and then winning the hackathon, right? Like that's fun. Um you know, not sleeping very much for 18 months, but then it succeeds and you've got this giant company. It's really cool. That's you look back and you're like, I want to do that again, right? you know, uh, you think about, uh, women giving birth, like it's type two fun, like, you know, and they look back and like, I would do that again. So, you know, uh, I think that that's that's a main character, but it rolls up to speeds. The other thing is that you can't be afraid of pissing some people off like, and the people who aren't afraid of it, of just saying what they're thinking or having a different view and not pleasing everyone in the room, right? Those people end up doing a lot better because they see the world differently. They're not they're not scared. They we can measure their their personality type. Actually, if you look at the best personality test in the world, it's called the five-factor personality test. McCrae McCosta 1972 North Carolina, right? This is the best test in the world and one of the attributes is agreeableness or disagreeableness. That's a scaler. One of the five scalers that they use is agree. If you are disagreeable, you end up doing better as a as an entrepreneur and a founder and as a creator because you don't have this need to please everyone all the time. And but it's simple things like, you know, I remember I went out on a date with a girl when I was a teenager and she asked three or four times to get ice cream from behind the counter, you know, and I'm like at some point you just got to buy the ice cream, my friend. And I was getting a little upset because I'm more agreeable and other people were more She was just very disagreeable, right? She was great. It's just a personality trait. And so those sorts of things end up showing up in savage founders. I think about that within founders we've invested in, too. It's like they have these almost rough edges that are and and they have things they believe that they're going to do and they don't really care if you think it's nice. They don't really care if you think it's right. They believe it's right and that's kind of all that matters. And whether they whether 99% of people would agree with them or not, doesn't matter. And those people might not end up having great friends. Yeah. They might not have a normal peaceful life, but they're going to potentially do something extraordinary. And as a venture investor, we have to look for that. And in general, I've tended to surround myself with people who are both extraordinary and nice, like yourself, but other people don't don't really care. So, you know, like more of a Peter Teal type or whatever where he's just like, I just want the truth. I I don't care if I break people's beaks, you know? Right. Who comes to mind? Savage founder. Cuz, you know, I have this theory that you don't know what a level 12 like on a scale of 1 to 10. You don't even know what 12 looks like. Then you meet someone, they break your frame. You said, "Oh, I thought I was already 10 out of 10 hard work." And then I met David Gogggins. Yeah, I realize, oh, I don't know the first thing about this. I'm a seven. That's what a level 12 is. So, who kind of broke your frame as like, wow, that that's the real savage founder. Yeah. I mean, a couple people like, you know, think about the Poshmark CEO, right? Um, he was so determined. He was constantly revisiting his flows. He was constantly rebuilding the product. He's constantly changing his mind. You're running a very complicated marketplace product. You have to abandon what you were doing six months ago and do something brand new. It's a very difficult business to run. and he did it for like 11 years and exited for billions of dollars right Manish Chandra he's amazing guy but he's also a nice person you want to have lunch with him so he's he's in that boundary layer which which I really appreciate a guy like Khan Gune who nobody knows yet he's the CEO of Firefly which is those videos on top of you you've got six different businesses you're running inside of that is a very difficult business to run he went through co he lost 95% of his revenue he had to adjust to that um because no one was on the street to show ads to and so he survived they're now profitable big company. Everyone's gotten out of the space like Tim, he's going to win the space, right? People will tell his story later. But yeah, just savage founder. And you said it all up to speed. Yeah. But you've also said something which is speed is not what you think. Yeah. What does that mean? I actually don't know what you meant by that. So most people think speed means you're working 18 hours a day. It's not that. It's about an emotional flexibility that allows you to abandon what you were doing before and do the right thing going forward. It isn't speed on your original idea, it's speed toward success. And that isn't typically what you most ideas don't work. You know, I always say I have 83 ideas a week and every 3 weeks I have a half an idea that's good. I mean, it's literally that volume of ideas. The difference between what's good idea and what what doesn't work. And it's okay that most things don't work. And the flexibility to move toward what will work is what speed is. And it's mostly your emotional tenor. And it's how you manage your network around you. It's how you manage your spouse to let him or her know what's about to come. It's how you manage your employees so that they know, look, we're going to iterate this. We're not going to iterate this twice. We're going to iterate this 28 times. You know, that's where Snap came from. I think it was their 27th app. Like, is that true? What was something? I I don't know their story in detail, but I understand that it was many many uh attempts before Snap actually worked. And if you look at, you know, our gaming company that we did, it was our seventh game that finally worked. If you look at my first company, it was our 27th test which finally got V, you know, viral. You have to prepare everyone around you for all the changes which ends up producing speed. So Stan and I have never failed. We've never lost a dime for anyone. We've always made people money for the last 25 years because we had speed toward the goal of success, not speed toward the original thing we were going to do. And and so we got out out of our own way emotionally. And so I actually have this lecture I give in private about all the emotional barriers you are putting up in front of you that causes you to go slowly and you think it's fast because school taught you what time looks like and then maybe you work for a big company to get a good brand like Google or Microsoft or whatever and now you think this is how the world moves. You're you're wrong. Your speed bar is wrong, right? And you've got to you've got to raise your speed bar. I have a thing on here. I think it's called the where is it? the uh art of unlearning. Yes. Is that what you're talking about? Like you're taught things, you learn things, but then as an adult, there's almost like these I don't know, five, seven things. I have to unlearn these things. What are those? And this is I mean there's so many things. It's about speed. It's about um you know, the emphasis on human communication, relationship versus the actual product. Like everyone focuses I want to build this and do. No, dude. You've got to talk to people. You've got to talk to your customer. You've got to think about that communication. We have these mindsets that that get bred into us by the normies. And if you want to do something extraordinary, you have to get out of those mindsets. I mean, why is it that sort of 85 90% of all returns in tech have come from the Bay Area? It's because the mindsets here are slightly different from New York and London and LA and other things. And as a result, things just happen a lot faster and things happen a lot better. And we should say that again. So you're saying the world of technology which is open to everybody to compete. Everybody's aware of it. We've all got phones everywhere on Earth. And you're saying 85% of all of the returns, all the money that got made comes from this. How many square feet how many square miles is? It's like 7 million people. 7 million people in the Bay Area and 85% of the returns happen here. Yeah. You got to ask yourself why, right? And and what you're saying is one of the things is there's a certain mindset, a certain way of doing things, a certain speed of operating that is different. Yeah. And those are all just assumptions and mindsets we make, right? But the it's literally an order of magnitude. You can go faster than you think you can. And once you understand that, once you set your speed bar that way, then life opens up for you. And that's what savage founders do. They realize it. Mike Cassidy is the founder. He was he was the original speed guy. I don't know if he was Mike Cassidy is a guy who founded Fire. He founded um Direct Hit, the one of the first search engines. He sold it for 500 million after 500 days. He's he's done I don't know four or five businesses. They've all worked. He ended up at X for a while doing Lon and he's just he taught me about speed. He was the one who originally figured it out in the 90s. What did he tell you? What did he what did he say? He's like you don't need to take you know 3 months to raise money and get an office and all that stuff. You can do it in four days. I can raise money in two days and I can get an office in a half a day and I can hire my team in three days and I can have my product out in two months and everyone else was taking 2, three, four years, right? Right. He was literally doing it 2 3 4 months. Is this a shoot for the stars and you land on the moon situation where okay, even if he doesn't do it in two days, he does it in five, but five is way better than the default 5 months. That could be it. Yeah, that could be it. I have a a couple of stories. Sometimes I hear these stories about, you know, Elon built the Colossus data center in 122 days. Normally it's two years for permitting and then and you hear these stories and it's like, wow, that's pace, that's speed. But it's also a little bit like well I'm not building Colossus so it's almost distant for me but I'll give it like another story. We have a buddy I think you might know him Sului Ali. He we were advising a company. The company was like we really need to raise money. Desperately need to raise money. He's like okay we'll be on the let's get on the phone now. And they're like okay uh we don't have it ready yet. So you just told me you desperately need help. Let's go. So we get on a phone call and we say just give us what you got for so far for the pitch. Yeah. and they give it to us and um we give them some feedback and they're like oh wow this was really really useful um and so goes great um how long do you think it's going to take you to make these changes like well we'll reach back out next week and I really like so thankful for your help want to see what happens he goes next week I thought this is important it is important he goes cool like I think you could probably make get these changes done or most of them done 80% of them in the next few hours he goes so let's talk again 3 p.m. by lunch. Yeah, exactly. So, he was like, we met at 11:00 and he's like, we're going to meet again at 3:00. Yeah. And I just didn't even know that was like a norm you could do, especially externally to someone else's company, be like, why are we not having two meetings today? Why not? Why not do two days? And as soon as I saw that, my own speed bar got raised cuz I realized like something that was almost an invisible wall really wasn't real. And I could change that. I could make that that small difference in my own speed pace. Right? So most people think of speed as process or standups or schedules or cananband board. It isn't. It's your own emotional mentality. That's what speed is. And you're saying there's like this list of emotional blockers. So if I'm a founder, what are the most common emotional blockers slowing me down from being higher speed? The big one is just fear. You're fearful of getting it wrong because you were taught all through growing up that getting the answers right on the test got you love, got you appreciation, got you status, got you into the right college. And in the real world, that's just not the case. You're just got to like like Elon, just blow up the rockets, blow up the rockets, blow up the rockets so the rockets don't blow up anymore, right? And and so his his speed bar is what you see, right? And so he has broken through into a completely different realm. The one that Mike Cassidy has always lived in, right? And there's just a few of us living in that realm and so much is possible once you live in that realm of your mind. Yeah. You now that you say you can see it everywhere like Doge, they set a target which was Doge will wind down in two years or whatever. He's like, "We don't need the full term. Why would I take the full term? Two years we'll be done. We set a date from that was like the first thing he did was set a date, right?" Um and people burn out and people like, "Oh, I worked there for four years, got my equity, and I'm gone, man. and I never want to do that again. It was miserable. Uh they look back and you know what they talk about at Thanksgiving? Well, when I was working at Tesla, when I was working at SpaceX, like it's the most amazing time of your life. You talk to people who are in World War II and they're like, what was the best years of your life during the war? We were together. We were bonded. We had a mission. The you know, so this is type two fun and and going fast is part of that. You have this diagram I thought was pretty cool. Yeah, it's a technology window. You have actually like two little things here. So you have this one which is the technology window curve. I hadn't seen this before. And then you have this kind of uh historical thing. It's like railroads the technology was window was open for 40 years. Cars 25 years radio 24 years. And so you and now AI 8 years so far. So far. So can you make me smarter as a founder because it seems like this is important cuz timing is everything. Being early is the same thing as being wrong. Being late is the same thing as being wrong. So getting the being knowing where you are in the window seems important, but I've never really talked about it this much. Yeah. So look, I I you know, as I said, I went to Harvard Business School and I lecture at Stanford and lecture at Berkeley and MIT and and I've never seen anyone teaching this. And it was really surprising to me. And basically what you realize is that most big interesting world changing companies are a result of riding a particular technology wave. So if you think about the railroads, the giant railroad, southern Pacific railroad, which transformed America, they leveraged a new technology which was railroad technology. Both the steel for the rails and the the steam engines and all the stuff that came with that technology and that that window in the United States was open for only 40 years. If you were, and that was between 1830 and 1870, if you were trying to start a railroad company in 1880, you got your ass kicked, right? and they all wanted to be rich and famous like the people who had been building it the 40 years earlier, but they couldn't anymore because the technology window had closed 90%. It was just closed. You you wouldn't even think of starting a railroad company today. Pretty obvious. But then you look at other technologies like cable and that was open between like 1970 1984 only a 14-year window during which all the cable companies that were meaningful were created. Anybody who tried to do it afterwards got their SK. Same thing was true in consumer internet. Once we looked at it and uh you know it it opened in 1994 because remember 93 nobody used software right no consumers no small businesses no enterprises very we had some AS400s running around and it was all onrem software and blah blah but it was it was very small suddenly we now have four billion people using software and that was because of the browser and the internet and TCPAP that opens up and between 94 and 2013 it was a fantastic time to start companies in the consumer software space and invest in from seed or series A. In 2014, the window just closed. You can look at the number of unicorns created in two from 2014 to today. And it's it's really small. It's like Discord, Tik Tok, you know, um Starlink, Chatbt, there's like 10 of them in the west versus how many, you know, during the the previous let's say like 10 years, you might 10x that number. 15 a year, right? And so what we haven't been talking about is that the technology window closed like it closes for every technology you know window. If you look at automobiles same thing that all the automobile companies that we know of were started between 90 1898 and 1928 right until Tesla when the underlying technology window opened around lithium batteries and electric engine. And now we have two interesting companies Tesla and Rivian. Okay. So this this opening of the technology and the closing of the technology window is very predictable. We don't know how long it's going to be. Sometimes 40 years, sometimes it's 8 years like with cell phone networks in the United States was just 8 years. But the the phases of it are very predictable and there's just six phases in it and and you can see it and so once you see that that's these six phases. Yeah. Once these six phases the first phase is just it's a hobbyist is really interested in the h in in the technology because of fun right geeks basically. And this is kind of like the uh what the nerds do on the weekend. we'll all do in 10 years type of thing. That's right. What was a toy before is now a big thing. That kind of idea. And then there is the the second phase is the status and money phase where suddenly some geek makes a ton of money and gets status and then now everyone's interested. Oculus sells to Facebook and everybody now can understand it because the the the abnormal people, the savage people are probably just hobbyists but normal people are money and status seeeking. Right. Right. So they can understand money and status. I want that. How did he get that or how does she get that? I want that. So that's when the knowledge diffuses. What's going on over there with those with that internet thing? Podcasters like us start talking about it. Bloggers start talking about it. There's conferences pop up about the AI wave and agents and all this. We're shoot we're diffusing the knowledge now. More people are getting in on the secret. That's right. And then you get uh tons of competition flows in. A lot of investment money comes in. Teams form. Everyone can understand the idea because the knowledge is diffused. And so five or six people get together and start a company and then they get funded. blah blah. And then the incumbents arrive. The incumbents arrive because they found the network effect. They had a better management team. They raised more money and crushed the other people. Something happened to give them their defensibility, right? And they establish themselves as the incumbents and then they just squeeze down and it this the window closes. If you want to watch an interesting, beautiful dramatization of what this looks like, watch the movie Tucker with Jeff Bridges. Okay? It's a story. I think the the movie came out in the '90s. It was about something that happened in 1952 and it shows you what it's like to build a car company in 1952. Okay, you just get your ass kicked by the incumbents. You the window is shut. Your ass kicked. There's nothing you can do. There's nothing you can do. And so we see this pattern over and over again. And I think it's very important for us as the window opens due to the technology underlying technology and it closes because the the winners get network effects and their flywheel is spinning so fast that even if you're hardworking and you're super smart and you got great design and great engineering, you can't compete with a network effect once it really kicks in. That's right. And it could be a network effect, it could be an embeddedness, it could be uh a scale or it could be a brand. Those are the four defensibilities in the digital world that now exist. So you want a quick example of each of the four. So like uh let's do a simple brand. So a brand network effect would be something like Ford. People just keep buying their Fords because they're loyal to Fords even though you know the Toyota trucks might be better. Um you have a brand effect around Nike obviously. I mean I feel a certain way when I wear it, right? You know I I project something. Everybody knows what it means when I wear Nike. So there's sort of a a knowledge network effect, but we still call it a brand effect. It's quite close to a network effect. It's just in the mind with like all luxury brands basically Louis Vuitton etc. Yeah. Yeah. Those Exactly. So those have brand effects. The network effects are the most powerful because they're really unstoppable. I mean look at Facebook. I mean they're now one and a half trillion or something. And um the more people are there the more valuable those those networks are. Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook. That's classic network effect. You've got embedding like Oracle. They they embed that software in your operations. you're going to retire before you rip that stuff out, right? You're just they charge you 25% more next year, you're going to pay, right? There's nothing you can do, right? It's just We had a startup that was trying to get rid of it or the birthday alarm. They're trying to get rid of Oracle back in the day and uh it took us like a year and a half of of the of the worst work that every engineer hated just to get off our Oracle dependency, right? And how much was it worth in the end? I don't know. So, that's an embedding. And then scale would be something like Walmart. It's just so many stores, so much buying power. They can buy cheaper, they can sell cheaper. Everyone just goes there because it's always going to be cheaper there. Where is Mr. Beast fit in as a you as a content creator, right? Like is he's kind of scaled basically. He gets he gets paid the most so he invests the most so he has the biggest kind of set productions. He can give away the most money which creates a lot of scale effect. That's a scale. It's a scale effect and it's a very weak one. Yeah. No, he's very vulnerable. Yeah. Just like BuzzFeed was very vulnerable and wasn't going to go anywhere. And uh why why is that? So explain more there. Well, because he's in what's called the fresh produce business, which is he has to keep producing fresh produce and putting it on the shelves and then it has a it times out. Uh and he's not building any network effect. He's not building any embeddedness. It's just you're you're consuming his stuff on YouTube and other channels. They have the network effect, right? Um and and he's just he's playing blackjack at the blackjack table. And as I've taught my sons, you don't want to be playing blackjack. You want to be the house. And what would you do if you're a content creator then? How would you if you're Mr. Beast right now? How do you not be the first produce business? You think about how to create a network effect. You think you think you go and learn about the 17 network effects and figure out which ones you could build, right? Uh I would go for um so like he's got this chocolate brand now, right? Selling feastables and he literally told me he said something great. He goes uh we he took us to Walmart. So he got into Walmart which is like a hard once you get there in bedding, right? He's like I have shelf space now. It doesn't matter if you make another chocolate brand. I have shelf space. And he goes I sell this color of blue. He's like, "People don't even He's like, I just need to keep showing this color of blue and I need to sell this baby blue thing is, you know, that's that's my game. Hershey sells this dark brown color and I sell this baby blue color." Yeah. Yeah. And and he might end up building a brand around that chocolate, right? Uh but it'll take years and it'll take hundreds of millions of dollars and um it's not clear that it'll happen, right? What's an example of somebody who you think has been clever about this and done it um whether they're a content creator or something else where maybe most people in their industry would have done something that's a bit of a doesn't have network effects but somebody figured out somebody who was a little bit smarter or stumbled into something figured out a way to do it with network effects. I can tell you a a funny story about where it should have happened and it didn't, which was Dana Carvey asked me about what should I do with dana carvey.com and I said what you should do is you should get Robin Williams and one other guy and the three of you should create the standup comedy website like for for that niche of YouTube and then you guys judge every week who's the best and have contests and whatnot. I said you create and each of you own 33% of the company you raise some venture capital and then you sell it for a billion to whatever. And I explained all this to him and then at the end of the hour and a half he said, "Yeah, so what do I do with dana carvey.com?" Like he just he just couldn't get out of I had the same conversation. I went to uh hust become a friend and he was on the podcast and he was he was asking me afterwards like what what would you do? Yeah. And I asked him, I said, "What uh comedians today, they all sell their specials to Netflix." Yeah. And they're super happy. Like, we got the bag, right? $10 million, 20 mill. Well, I don't know what Netflix plays, but let's just assume it's tens of millions of dollars for Dave Chappelle or whoever. But it just makes Netflix's network effect super strong, right? Like, so they might make 10 million, but Netflix is going to become a multiundred billion dollar company in the process. But comedians could especially be at Louis and Chappelle, you could theoretically say if we just put our content here, we own the network where all the comedy content is. And that's a much more valuable thing to own than this special. Um, but it was kind of the same thing. It was like, yeah, but they're throwing a big bag at us. And also, um, yeah, I want my stuff to be seen. That's, you know, if I go there, I get distribution. If I go if I try to make my own thing, I'm giving up distribution. I don't know if it's worth it. That's right. But somebody if somebody played that long game, I think that would be very That's right. And that is all network bonding and that is all network dynamics and that is exactly the game and very few people think in that way like a vampire attack like Saudi Arabia tried to suck off some of the PGA guys and and create a new golf thing and then they ended up merging back or the USFL back. What's a vampire attack? A vampire attack is when you go into a network and you try to suck out the blood from what makes that network work. Okay. and you you essentially try to create your own network effect on your platform by sucking out the energy that had been developed on their platform. So, was it smart what Saudi Arabia did in the live tour? Was that like did they executed well or what's what's your take away from it? I didn't follow it that much. It looked like it was only a two-year effort and then they they collapsed after two years. So, I don't know that it was perfectly executed, but it is the right idea. Right. It is the right idea because they were being told by the they're you know they're trying to improve their brand, right? They're trying to do brand association to improve their brand. Everyone's trying to ratchet up the status of their own brand, whether it's Saudi Arabia or whoever. And uh they they were trying to borrow off the PGA and the PGA was putting all these restrictions on them and they were they didn't have a a free operating field, you know, they were it's like they were on iOS and they were like, I don't want to pay 30% to you. Let me do my own thing. And they tried it and then it's just hard. There's an article on on nx.com which people should read. I think it's one of the better articles, but it might not be as read as it should be. It's called network bonding theory. It's a little bit boring title, but u I wonder why people didn't network bonding theory. It's it's and it explains it. He uses Messi as an example uh uh within the social within the soccer networks and how much he makes for the whole networks. Oh, so what what's the story there with Messi? The basic story is that in the it was funny because this is before he went to uh Miami, right? Um, I said, um, you know, PSG offered to give him X much a month of money and some tokens because they were doing these like crypto tokens and, uh, they still aren't paying him enough. Like everyone was outraged at how much they were paying him. And I said, "They're still not paying him enough because he moves the licensing for TV rights and he moves viewership and he he is going to bring so much more attention to the French soccer system so that every comp every um game that Messi plays around the French system is going to be watched three or four times more by the world than it would have been last year, right? And the value to them of that is way more than they're going to end up paying him, right? And so you look at Tiger Woods, if Tiger Woods plays, the PGA makes one and a half billion dollars more per year. And if he's not playing, it's like these nodes in these networks. And so if you could get Tiger to go over here and you could get this and this and if you did the right vampire attack, you could actually create a higher status better thing, right? But it's literally about measuring the nodes and measuring their effects and then having a strategy for the order in which you get them, what you compensate them with. You can compensate them with money. You can compensate them with titles. You can compensate with status. You whatever they want. Figure out how to compensate them. And that's what the article walks through is all the different ways you can compensate people to come to your network. I have a real world example of this. When I was at Twitch, Microsoft tried to do a Microsoft YouTube, they're all trying to do a vampire attack on Twitch. So Twitch was the number one gaming network for watching people live stream video games. And the number one streamer was Ninja. So Microsoft came out and they offered him something 20 $30 million. Come to us. He might have been making 6 million or 7 million a year on Twitch. I don't know. These are hypothetical numbers, but like some they offered more than he was by, you know, 2 or 3x. So, he leaves and it's code red inside Twitch. And there's the there's some people who are like, we, you know, we have to keep the integrity, you know, we have to keep our community. We can't let them just poach our streamers. We have to fight. And then there's the finance people who are like, that doesn't make any sense. That's too much money. M and then there's people who are like I think if we lose too many people at some point there's a critical mass where people will leave Twitch how do we solve this problem and finance people wanted to use the finance tool the community people wanted to make an impassioned heartfelt argument and you know there's other people who are the strategists who were trying to make an argument about like hey there's some tipping point we don't know where it is but there was some math there was like you said there's like this is a mathematical principle and so one thing one of the ways that we looked at it was for every viewer forget the streamer for every viewer how many channels are they bonded to you the word bond. So it's like they come every every week and they're watching three channels, four channels, five channels. And it turns out if you just take one of those channels out, they'll just swap to another channel, no problem. But as soon as they lose a certain number of of channels in their bonded network, they'll just go wherever that is. And so strategically, if one of those other companies had figured out which network of streamers to go after, not the ranked list, cuz they would take Ninja, who's a Fortnite streamer, but they wouldn't take the other Fortnite streamers. they would take this other guy who plays this other style of content and their fans didn't overlap. So, it was very ineffective. Whereas, if they had gone and been like, "All right, these 15 streamers are all part they're all core in a network. All the cluster each other clustered." If and they may not look like they're the biggest, but there's a that would have created the tipping point, but they didn't have the data or the knowhow to beautifully described. That's exactly right. That's a great story. That's that's a perfect example of network bonding and how you can do the math on it and and you have to think about it right or you're going to waste all your money and time, right? Which is what they did. Yeah. All right, let's take another one. So, what do we got here? Language first. Uh yeah, so it turns out that look, the way I look at it, there are five things in the world that kind of explain everything. Okay, one of them is language. One of them is networks. Like if you look at network dynamics, like why do rulers rule? What's going on with Trump? What's happening with elections? These are all network dynamics and if you study networks you can really understand all that. Energy is another one which is who has the oil, who needs the energy to live because our our bodies are just absorbing energy and expending energy and countries absorb and expend and households absorb and spend. You can actually understand the entire world just by studying energy and energy flows. Um but one of them is language language and mindsets. And what do you mean by language? So what so language? So talking about English or more specific than that? More specific. So, um, there's a guy named George Loff that people should study. He's a, uh, semiologist over at Berkeley, and he was the one who found out that the Republicans in the 70s said, "Look, we are never going to win another election unless we changed the dialogue in this country, in the United States." So, they went around and they created a three- ring binder and they created language. They said, "When we talk about tax, we're going to talk about not tax cuts, tax relief." Because we're going to use the word relief because we're going to imply that it's a disease or a sickness, right? No one's going to be thinking this opposite of stress. Relief, right? What do taxes do? Stress you out, right? And so so they went through and for every subject they developed they thought about the language they were using and then they took they printed tens of thousands of these three- ring binders and they went all around the country and they took every Republican. They say, "Use these words. Everyone use these words and we will turn the situation around." And that was that was just like eight years or six years before Reagan got elected. Wow. And it was very very effective. And George Loff is like, "Hey, Democrats, you guys have to start thinking at this level." And he's been streaming this. He's just a consultant or who's this guy? He's a professor and then a consultant and he's got his own institute and and I think he's retired now, but um you should study. Everybody should study whether Republican or Democrat, doesn't matter. Like this is the way the world functions. It functions on language and you have to notice that game being played. Like people are like, "Oh, we're gonna build a product and then we'll market it." I'm like, "No, dude. Pick the word first and then figure out what the product does behind the word because the word has a promise to it." So in in Silicon Valley, I feel like you described it well. People think name of your company doesn't matter. Just pick one. It's fine. Yeah. Oh, look, Google. It's random word. Don't worry about it. So people think names don't matter and people think marketing and language comes after you build a we just build a great product and then at the right before it gets out the door we'll slap a few labels on it write a description that'll be enough. You believe the opposite. So you believe names really matter. Yeah. And that language really matters. Could you give me why names matter? Very practically it lowers your cost of user acquisition and increases your lifetime value to actually give you the business that you want. So we were building a game. We knew we wanted to build uh a particular type of role playing of of um strategy game and we had to decide what to call it. So we tested out names and we we went on to Facebook. We spent $2,000 on ads saying wars of Mars, wars of space, wars of Atlantis, wars of uh the Amazon, wars of Egypt. And we tried all these different places like where were we going to have the wars? And the number one clickth through blew our mind. It was Atlantis. And so that's so funny when you just said them. Immediately when you said Wars of Atlantis, I was like that like my my pick would have been that one of the five you just said. So that works. And so so then we said, "Okay, we know it's going to be in Atlantis." Now, what is it? Is it going to be Amazon of Atlantis? Is it going to be Realms of Atlantis? Is it going to be Wars of Atlantis? Is it going to be Dragons of Atlantis? Blah blah blah. And we went down, we did another 20 of those, and we spent another $2,000. And the number one clickthrough was, well, the number number one clickthrough was Amazon's of Atlantis, but we knew what people were clicking for. They were looking to look at, you know, girls, girls drawings, drawings of girls. So, we discounted that and we said, "What's number two?" Number two was Dragons. So, we're like, "All right, that's the game. Dragons of Atlantis, right?" And we knew we would lower our click-through rate or our our cost of click-through by 75%. Right? Which would give us a massive advantage over the other gaming companies that were buying ads on Facebook at the time. And so, we then told the game developers, "It's going to be dragons and it's going to be in Atlantis." And and so then the game rolled from there, right? And and then in the end we were doubling every day and then in the year two I think we did 120 million of revenue. I mean it's you know we merged with Kabam and then and then um and then and then the company grew like crazy. I think we were 55% of the revenue when we merged. I don't know. It was like crazy. Yeah. By the way, language is one of the ultimate network effects, right? Yeah. English. Why why are people in India and China studying English? Cuz it's English is a more valuable language. has a higher market cap because more people speak it especially in markets that matter. Um you know you can't go to New York if they don't speak English. So uh I don't know Mandarin today or you know I don't know Swuahili but if 95% of the world spoke Swahili I would have to learn Swahili. It would be the most important thing I could do in my life is join that network of Swahili because that would that's where all the the value is. So well said. You had said something about language too where you said it's not just about you write language that will describe it to your customers first. You're you figure out the words because you're describing to yourself what you should be building and it basically gives you clarity as a product builder. Do you have any stories or examples that that kind of drive that home? Yeah, we had a we had a company is I don't know two decades ago we had a a product that was allowing you to store your digital photos. digital photography was new and we're like store your digital photograph photographs here and people would come but not very many people were coming because it wasn't a multiplayer game. I store them there. I retrieve them there. Single player game. So I said, "Okay, guys, we're just going to change the homepage to say share your photos." And I just changed the name. I changed the word on the homepage. And my team said, "But James, our product doesn't let people share photos. We're lying to people. That makes me really uncomfortable." And I said, "So fix it." And so 3 days later they had figured out how to put in features that allowed you to share your photos and within 6 months we' registered 47 million people virally. 47 million. Yeah. Back when there was like 800 million people using the internet. So it was extremely viral because we changed the word. Wow. You also had a lot of virality with tickle. Yeah. Tickle is an interesting name first and then um you had a lot of virality there. Do you have any good tickle or viral stories? Yeah. So, I I I learned about the importance of words in part because the first name I had for the company was Emode, which none of you can know how to spell or know what the hell that is. And when I changed the name to Tickle in the middle of it, uh my board almost wanted to fire me. Uh the entire engineering team threatened to quit. They came to me and they said, "We're all leaving. We don't want to work for a site that sounds like a porn site because you're changing this name to Tickle." And um everyone was against it and I knew everyone would be. So the process of deciding on the name I picked the two most language savvy people I knew in my company and it was just the three of us who decided and then we announced the change. We did not let anybody else a little bit like the Luca Donic right um trade. It's just if you want to get something done you got to kind of keep it close to the chest because you know people will be against it and they'll want to complain and whine and do all the things they do. So, we did it and the traffic went up 30%. In a week and we had gotten an offer for 45 million as a company uh when we when we were called Emote and then 6 months later we got an offer for 110. So, it literally doubled the value of the company by changing it to a good name that was spellable, memorable, interesting, fun to talk about. And so, I learned, wow, you can double the value of your company by having the right name. And so that then led me down to watch more and more language and then learn about George Lake off and all that kind of stuff. And so we had to use that language ability for our viral past. We were in the fresh produce business at Tickle and we didn't have a network effect initially and so we had to reinvent the growth channels every 3 months. Explain what it was. What was Tickle? Tickle was a site where you could take self- assessment tests. So think the first Buzzfeed. Okay. So we were the first people to put self- assessment tests on the internet. Is that a fancy way of saying personality quizzes or personality quizzes? Yeah. Yeah. And um we had, you know, five PhDs on staff and it was it was legit. And you weren't trying to make something silly. You actually wanted to make like kind of MyersBriggsy type of stuff. You could actually learn something maybe meaningful about your yourself, your character, your how you're wired so that you could make better life decisions. Yeah. Yeah. That was kind of what you wanted to sell. It's not what the market wanted. Yeah. What the market wanted was something like which breed of dog are you? Or who's your celebrity match? or which Victoria's Secret painty are you? You know, that kind of thing. And those tests all did really well and got a lot of traffic. And so about 80% of the tests taken were silly and 20% were serious. But how did you even discover the silly ones? Like did you one day you were just like, "Ah, let's try this at lunch or how did that happen?" What happened was uh we were off salary. We were running out of money. Uh we were almost dead. And never even heard of off salary. Is that just like the phase right before death? Yeah. Yeah. Uh Rick Rick Marini uh was my co-founder. We were living in Boston at the time. And we we were off salary for 6 months uh at that point and um we uh said well [ __ ] it. Yeah. You know, so we get to the [ __ ] it moment uh which is always the best moment. The two most powerful words in in the entrepreneurs dictionary, right? You know, you get you get clarity finally uh that you're not going to do what you set out to do. You're going to do what's going to work. And I said, "Well, [ __ ] it. Let's just do something that will get traffic because we got to grow this thing so that we can survive." And I had a friend who worked at an advertising agency in New York and he said, 'If you want people to remember your ads, put puppies and babies in the ad. And then we watched the Super Bowl ads. And sure enough, they all had puppies and babies in them. And so I said, "Hey guys, let's do a puppy test and a baby test." And they said, "Really? Finally, we can do something fun." They were so excited. The team was so excited. And I said, "Sure." And they said, "Well, if we're doing those, can we do the who's your celebrity match?" I'm like, "Ah, [ __ ] it. Go ahead." And so we put up the dog test and the baby test and the celebrity match test and eight days later a million people were trying to get on the website. Wow. It was just super what we call novelty viral. There was no mechanism for it. There was no AB testing that we did. We didn't manufacture the virality. It was novelty. Right. Novelty. That person had to tell another friend. Show they wanted to show another friend voluntarily. That's right. It was such a cool thing for them that they they had to bring it up at lunch. And And you sell this company for 110 million or something like that. Um, were you rich before that or that was like your moment to like make it? I was not rich. I had a white Toyota Corolla I bought for $10,000 and we my wife and I had two babies and we were living in a rented apartment. And was the company like really successful? Like did you think it was worth $110 million or you like, "Holy [ __ ] why are they offering me $110 million for this?" No, no, it was definitely worth 110 million. Um, it was worth more than that because the company that bought us was Monster and they needed our viral ability. They needed our network effects thinking. They needed all the tests we had for all the But as a standalone business, was it kind of like going to be worth a lot or no? No, we would have had to iterate into something else. We would have had to become the Yeah. We would have had to become more like uh Facebook. The problem was we had started our social network without real names. Right. And you you told me some story about when you sold you're like you did something at the last hour or last minute of the sale. Yeah. Uh what was that story? So, um, we were flying to New York with the four of us to finally pitch the 16 person board of Monster. They had a $7 billion market cap at the time. And the night before on the red eyee, I actually lowered the projections um to be more realistic to what we were going to do. And it freaked out my team, right? They were like, "Dude, they're not going to do this if we lower the projections." And I'm like, "No, we we need to be more honest with them. This is going to be a long-term relationship. um these are good guys blah blah blah blah. So in the end um we meet with the the 16 person board they decide to do it and then we go up to the top floor of the building overlooking Manhattan and this guy Andy McKelie amazing guy at the time he was probably 64 or something. He's or maybe 68. He had he had acquired 220 companies to build Monster he had bought for $400,000. Wow. when he had bought an ad agency in Boston and they had a side project called the Monster Board. He didn't even know that he had bought it. He bought an agency, happened to buy Monster that became the $7 billion value is. So he was just he was just acquisition animal. Yeah. Just an East Coast acquisition guy. Um he had a lot of character this guy. Um anyway, he says, "So, you know, I offered you, you know, 91. would you take take a you know is there any room to negotiate and I said sure take 10% off and he says interesting what do you want I said I want you to pay all of my employees out before you pay me and I want you to pay my investors before you pay me and he's like well you know I can't do that because then the people will leave I was like they won't leave he's like but don't people just stick around for money I'm like no that's not why most people work so you wanted them to get their money first and you're like I'll mine will kick in a year later or whatever is that you wanted And why did you do that? I mean, that's a crazy move. Because I felt that was the right thing to do for my for my employees and for my investors because they had stuck with me over this crazy 5-year ride. And did you decide that like in the moment or had you been thinking I'm going to do this? No, I decided that in the moment. And and he he said, "Wow, interesting. So, what do you want?" I said, "I want to pay all all my employees." And he's like, "Will you promise me they'll stay even if I pay them out?" And I said, "Yeah." And he said, "Okay." Um, well then in that case, I want you around a long time because I can see your character, right? I can see that you're a real leader, right? You're a mench. Yeah. And uh and he said, "Okay, I want to put a three-year earnout on this based on revenue. What about this?" I said, "That sounds good." And in the end, the acquisition price ended up being not 10% less than 91, but it ended up being 110 because we outformed. Yeah, we outperformed. Wow. That's a great story. Yeah. And so it was and and had I brought if I had introduced an investment banker into this process, he would never would have returned my email or walked away. This is about humans. It's about people. Yeah. You uh I have a picture here. I actually met you before I met you, I met your business partner. Yeah. You and uh Stan Stan Stanowski. Yep. He's amazing, too. Yeah. And he told me a story. So when I first time I met him, he was at my office. I remember Michael had this uh glass table so you could draw from EVO. He had this glass table you could like whiteboard on the table itself and I had just been writing notes as he was talking and I wrote like business bromance and I circled it question mark cuz he told me you guys had been doing you've been partners for like I don't know at the time maybe 15 or 20 years and I could just tell it was like wow like you know when you see a couple at dinner and they've been married for 30 years but they're like it's like they're on their first date and they're just having fun. They're talking. they got their arm around each other. It's like, "Oh man, that's what you really want, you know, when you get married. It's not the wedding day. It's the 20 years later. What if we're still at dinner like that?" Uh that's how he was kind of like talking about y'all's partnership. And so I asked him, I said, "What's the key?" Like, "How did you make that work? What's what's been made it what's made it work?" He told me a bunch of things. Uh I want to hear your take on it. But one story he told me, he goes, "When you sold a company at the time, you owned the vast majority of the company, maybe 90%. I think you were wealthier. You had put more money in at before that or something." I was not wealthy, but uh you said you you own neither of us had any money. You you owned more of the company and at the time of the sale, you at the last minute sort of like equalized it in some way. You gave him like a you know got it to more like a 50/50 arrangement. And I was pretty blown away cuz you you really know what someone's like when the money hits the table. Yeah. And that's not the story you normally hear of what happened when the money hit the table. The guy who had had the leverage gave instead of took. Yeah. Um that was inspiring to I still remember that. That was like 15 years ago I heard that story. Yeah. Well, look, Stan's a special guy. I mean, I think he said it pretty well. He said, "James turned it into a giving competition." I think that's the that's the phrase I think that will help people understand the way he and I look at the world, right? Turn your relationship to a giving contest. That's what he told me. Rule number one. Yeah. And look, I think that uh you know, I've read a lot of Greek tragedy. I learn all the classics because I went to Philip Sexer, so I got classically trained. And you have to have a long arc uh and and looking at what is a good life and what matters and um you know what matters is in the end is deep friendship like if you work hard like even if you don't work look my point is the billionaire life is available to you today. It's just in your mind because I know a lot of billionaires. I'm not one, but I'm nearby and they all wear the same socks you do. They eat the same steak you do. They drive cars that are as safe as the car you can drive if you can drive a Toyota Camry. They have a hot shower just like you have a hot shower. The distance between your life and a billionaire's life is 99% in your mind. And so, it's really not about the money. It's about the creativity. It's about the connection. It's about the friendships. And it's even harder to make friendships once you have a ton of money because money freaks people out. Yeah. And so just accept where you are. Like I I say, look, you can have a fun normal life and live like a billionaire. You can have a fun strive life where you go and try to build something, do rollups of, you know, basement manufacturing, whatever. And then you can have sort of a global greatness life where you try to be Elon and you try to be Steve Jobs and all that. Those are kind of the three ways to go. Either way, you could live a billionaire life and have a fun life. And either way, you can make yourself miserable with your own mindset. And so it's up it's all it's all it's 99% in your brain. So with with me and Stan and and with Rick Marini, who was also a co-founder at Tickle, it it you know, and Rick and Stan and I just went to Namibia together. We're going to Turkey together. Like I'm still friends with all these people that I worked with starting in in 99. I'm still friends with people I went to school in fourth grade with. I mean that's it. That's life, right? You know, and and without that, what's the point? Without that connectivity. Uh there there's really no point to it. What are you going to be higher status than someone? What are you going to be richer than someone? It doesn't matter past even a basic point, right? And so I never wanted to covet whatever capital I could. I just want to make sure something cool would happen and that I had enough to keep creating. And look, I think that 25 years ago, people who were coming to the Bay Area were coming because they were generative. They were coming because they wanted to create. And then because so much money was made by 2008, 2013, it's changed the tenor a little bit here and we're ruining the experiment because people are so money focused. And I I love the My First Noing podcast. I I listen to it. Oops. I love you. And the only thing I would say is the naming indicates that it's about the money. And I actually think the people love your podcast because you deep down know it's not about the money. Now we have to talk about money because everyone thinks they want the status and the power and you know Tech Crunch will only talk about your product launch as if it's with a financing because it's talking about the money. It does get the clicks, but you you guys know that it's not about the money, that it's about the creativity and the generess, right? And and the connection with people, the way you connect with each other, the way you connect with me, the way you connect I see that in your life. And so that's I think why people really listen to you is because that's what we all really want. And yeah, there's money involved, but doesn't matter. Right. It's just gas in the tank. It's not the tank. Right. Right. Right. Right. Yeah. The uh somebody said it well. They go, you know, you're trying to go on the road trip and you want to get in a car. You want your pals inside and you want to have this kind of adventure you're going on and you need gas. You need fuel to go on the road trip, but this is not a it's not a nationwide tour of gas stations. Don't forget that. Right. Right. That's a great way to put it. I love that. I love that. Yeah. So, yeah. So, I I turned it into a giving competition with Stan and then he turned it right back into a giving competition with me or and uh and Rick did as well. And and uh yeah, it's been great. I want to do some of some more of these. I want to do one uh that's not positive. I want to do regrets. You had told me something when I came and hang out with you. You said you were talking about a mistake you had made. You go, I had my first success or whatever. And then you go, I kind of isolated myself. I wanted to do my own lab partly due to ego and you know whatever and you started doing your own thing and you go and you said like you drew this diagram on a whiteboard and you were like I was in the core the white hot center of the network of Silicon Valley of Silicon Valley. I knew all the right people and they like me and I like them etc. And then you're like I kind of went over here to try to build my own empire and you're like the smart thing would have been to just join Facebook or invest in Uber or what? And you gave me a couple of quick examples. No, that's that's right. I you know in 2006 when I left Tickle after the acquisition um I wanted to just build more stuff and I had this great guy Stan who I just loved living in his brain, right? and he seemed to love living in my brain. So, we just were happy to get an office and live in each other's brains and build stuff. So, we created an incubator and we built 24 different products over the course of three and a half years. And we had so much fun. I we were just spending my money, right, my post tax money and um um we had a blast and we we were so creative every day was we were doing eight different experiments, you know, on the internet to see what would happen. And in the end, we came out with three companies from that that ended up working and making people money and raising venture and doing all that stuff. But we did it in a way where, as my friends told me later, we didn't know how to be helpful. We didn't know should I send you deals to invest in? Should I come work with you? Should I send you people to hire? Should what should I do? Right? What? And and so our structure of the incubator wasn't super network ccentric. It was creativity ccentric. It was isolated a little bit. And that was a mistake. And had I gone and worked at Facebook and learned more about that ecosystem or had I gone and um become a venture guy or or opened up a shingle to say, "Yeah, I'm doing this, but I also want to be investing on the side. I don't want to make 12, 15, 20 investments a year as an angel and I can be helpful. And I didn't do any of those things and that was just a mistake. Now, I just had four kids in 37 months and my wife and I were moving houses and you know, my parents were my mom uh got dementia and you know, we were busy. There's excuses, but I didn't have the clarity. And as a as a mentor, I would suggest to people think again about the network. Go back to my life on network effects. Think about everything you do as how does this affect the people and the network connectivity that have or don't have going forward. One of the things you said there you were like uh you told me you go you got to create your API API people who don't know it's basically like you know you say you make a website if you want other other developers to other engineers to be able to like make their product compatible with yours you put out documentation you say hey here's what I could do if you ask me this question I can give you this information I can give you this data you know Twitter has an API hey you want to see the tweets here's the tweets you want to see the most trending ones here's the trending ones that's what I can offer you and here's what I want back. You know, here's the things I'm working on if and maybe I can tap into your API. And so you were like, you need it sounds like what you had at the time was just a fuzzy API. People didn't know how to plug into you. They didn't know where you could help. They didn't know how you wanted to be helped. Um you but you were in a creative mode. And that stuck with me cuz I was like, I do the I have the same problem. I need to to make it clear like what am I trying to do? Uh because actually when you help people, there's a lot of goodwill that's built up. People love to help you back, but not if they don't understand what game you even play and what you like to do and what your what your dreams are and what you what you're great at, your superpowers. It's all fuzzy. And I think making that less fuzzy was one of my big takeaways from you. Yeah. Yeah. It's a great idea. And you know, I think that the Bay Area more than other cultures is a non-zero sum thinking environment, right? It's one of our key traits and that's fant that's that's furthered by this idea that here's what I can help you with, right? and and here's how you can help me. And what do you think about people who leave California, leave San Francisco because they don't want to pay taxes. I think it's shortsighted. I look, anyone can move. It's very sensitive, very emotionally sensitive to people about their choices about where they want to live. And um you know, if you don't like it here or somehow you feel like everyone's smarter than you and therefore you feel bad every day because you have low status and whatever, like go get a therapist. Don't like don't move out of the state just because you're feeling bad all day. But a lot of people don't like it uh for whatever reason. I I can't imagine why, but they don't. And so they'll leave or they'll think I can go be a big fish in a smaller pond somewhere else. Um but generally they're moving because their husband's mother is nearby and they can help raise the kids. There's a network, we call it network gravity that pulls you away from from the Bay Area and you just have to fight all the network gravity and just go there and be in that ecosystem. And if if I can earn, you know, 20 times more here and pay 13% extra tax versus New Hampshire or Florida, then isn't that worth it? Right? And and if I'm not smart enough and good enough to earn 20 times more or even two times more, uh then yeah, I should leave. If I'm, you know, if I'm not good enough to play in the NBA, I shouldn't be in the NBA, right? But this is the NBA, right? And so a 13% tax on being able to play in the NBA is nothing. Yeah. Yeah. I remember you said that cuz at the time I think this was like co times or something a lot like tons of people were moving and they were moving not for not cuz they didn't like it. They're moving because they were like ah why do I if I can work online anyways might as well just be somewhere else uh I'll save 13%. And I remember you just being like that's insane. Like like if you if for that reason cuz one idea, one investment, one comment, one comment, one serendipitous conversation, one brunch you go to, you used to host these brunches, one one connection there has paid itself off, you know, many times over and that that that definitely reinforced that um for me. One of the things I want to ask you about is you you've been early to a lot of big things. You wrote a blog post about Bitcoin before Bitcoin. Yeah, you were in social gaming before social gaming really took off. You were in social networking before Facebook was invented. So my natural question is what's next? What do you see around the corner? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We also got into uh tech bio in 2016 which is you know software driven biology and we also got into AI in 2018 which wasn't quite as early as venode with with open AI and and Elon but it was pretty close. Um yeah I mean so what's next? A lot of things is next. This is what's interesting about the current time. Um, there is going to be opportunity in robotics that hasn't existed before. There is going to be opportunity. I mean, we're just we're just seven, eight years into the tech bio thing and that's going to go that window will be open for 30 years. We're going to learn so much about DNA and what's going on there. And then AI is going to touch everything. Uh, and so I think that AI has created a whole new set of consumer experiences. I think the window there will be open for three to four years for people. It hasn't even really started. I mean, we're we're writing a a a blog post about consumer AI stuff, and it's hard to find interesting companies. Like, you've got AI Dungeon and you've got, you know, Voli and Character AI. You've got like 15 or 20, but you don't have 50, right? Interesting consumer attempts and we're waiting. So, Consumer is back. Yep. Uh Tech Bio. Yep. Uh robotics. Yep. Those are three. Yep. Space continues. I think the space window is still open for another three to five years. Uh but it'll start to close here soon because remember SpaceX started 20 years ago and and services. Services services. What do you mean by services? Anything that's a service like my accounting firm or my tax firm or my um but now with AI. Is that But now with AI but now with AI. So I think that PE firms and startups are going to grab AI and go in to transform all the workings of corporations but also service firms, banks, right? Everything that's a service to you as a consumer is going to be transformed by by AI faster, cheaper, better, easier in ways we can't imagine completely rethinking it. U and so I I would encourage people to think through what are services businesses in my area that I could bring AI to and lower the price by 30%. And just take market share. What's an example? A good example would be, you know, architecture, contracting, building building houses, uh, lawn care, like what can you do for my lawn? So, let's say there's a lawn care place, lawn care business near me. It's making a million dollars a year profit. Guy's ready to retire. I think, okay, I could buy that business today at a fair price. But I know that with AI, I'm going to be able to do what? I'm going to have a robo kind of receptionist and uh so I'm going to and I'm going to go around with a video camera and the video is going to notice what all the plants are. So to catalog the entire I can now produce a beautiful thing for this owner that he never saw or she never saw before. I'm going to know what every plant is. I want to know what their water amount like AI is going to give me X-ray vision for their landscaping and allow me to provide them a service no one's ever been able to provide before. And um I can schedule stuff more easily. I can all the customer service stuff goes to AI. Uh and I provide a much better service. So you could either charge more for the high-end clients because you can do something better or you could charge the same and give them a better service or you could charge less, right? And just take market share. Right now with AI, there's like a fog of war. You have all these companies. They're all competing to the death. Billions and billions of dollars getting invested and it's unclear who's going to win. Where's the value going to acrue? And I think from if I was if anyone was going to have an answer, I would want to hear yours because you think about network effects, which is the thing that kind of creates the long-term defensibility value for these companies. So what do you think of people who are investing in open AI or the the sort of the models? Is that where the value is going to acrew? Yeah, I don't get it. I don't get it. I think they're making a big mistake. And in 2022 when we first started writing about this, we actually came out and said it on our blog post, which is AI is going to be like water. You're going to get free unlimited AI processing on your CPU on your phone within 3 to four years. There there's no doubt it's going to free. Mhm. Uh in the same way that I can use my phone. I don't have to pay anybody anything to use my phone um on, you know, for hours a day. And I don't understand why everyone's plowing so much money into this because it's so clear that you're going to have open source whether it's 3 months, 6 months, or 9 months behind. When you're actually thinking about defensibility, you have to think about 10, 20, 30 years, right? So it doesn't matter. The open source is going to end up just taking over and you're going to be able to do it on CPUs. So both Nvidia and all of these giant LLM companies who are spending all this money on training are going to go to zero eventually. And that's why that's why Nvidia is trying to get everyone to use CUDA because that's their operating system level that locks people into their software which is more of a Microsoft it's an operating we call it a platform network effect. They're they're trying to force a platform effect while they have the hardware that everybody wants, right? So that they can be durable long term. It's smart. I get it. We'll see if it works. And the same thing with OpenAI. Like I don't get it. Like I don't know why everyone's plowing money into it. I think it's crazy because they have to move up to an operating system layer where there's a platform network effect or they have to move up into the application layer where there are network effects because otherwise deepseek or the 20 DeepS seeks that are coming are gonna are gonna not cause them to get any revenue. So, I don't know what's going on. Uh, I'm not sure why people don't see it that way, but I've seen it since 22 and everything I'm seeing now teaches me the same thing. I mean, deep sequels obvious. And look, the 98 I don't know what the percentage is, but let's say 96% of all the processing in the world is still CPU and these models will start working on CPU in the next 24 months and then what do you do with the Nvidia chips and why do you need these huge clusters? So, it's going to be I I think people are making a lot of bad bets. There's going to be a lot of money lost and one of the arguments is uh oh but we have the data you know maybe Elon's we have the X data feeds that's going to make our model better Chimath has come out and said it's all about who owns the data you know what's your message to Chimath yeah I just think that's wrong I just think it's wrong I can synthesize your data I can steal the data I can cobble together different data sets to approximate the data and as we know if you go to Google and just type in data network effects like it the first article you're going to get this explains why data network effects aren't They're asmmptoing in terms of their defensibility and they're just not that powerful. They're they're valuable to an extent. They're they're valuable to get to a threshold and to get into a range, but you know, if if if JT GBT sees what I'm typing and then gets incrementally better, the next guy behind me can't see that it's incrementally better. The increment in which it is better is too small to be perceived by the user. Right. Okay. And so, uh, I don't think that it's all about the data. And I and I think this is a fiction that uh Google and Microsoft tell Wall Street and their employees for two reasons. They tell Wall Street because they want Wall Street to think that they're going to be the winner because they have the data, therefore they win. And then they tell their employees, why would you want to go be an entrepreneur? Why would you leave the the beautiful confines of this giant company because you know we're going to win because we have all the data, right? Um there might be some applications where that's true. I'm open to the fact that there could be some, but there's very very few. And in the end, Microsoft and Google are not going to win because of the data. They're going to win because of their scale, right? And they're going to win because they already have the distribution, right? Customers already got if I type it in, I'm defaulted to their their service. So that's because it's already in my way. So they they won the game 20, 30, 40 years ago. And that's why they get a chance to win the game today. Not because they have the data because I can get your data, dude. So buy or sell Nvidia. I don't give advice. I don't trade. Uh so like opinion like you know you think they're they're Oh I I I mean opinion is that I would I would sell Yeah. Nvidia um compared to long-term I would still be a Google and a Microsoft buyer because of the distribution, right? Because there's going to be tremendous value created for both consumers, small businesses and enterprises and they already have their hooks into them and they're the incumbents and we are in the age of incumbents when it comes to software and they are going to win because of their distribution but not because they have the data. That's just a fiction. If you were the CEO of OpenAI, what would you do? I would I would try to build an operating layer and get everybody to sign in to my operating layer in the same way that Microsoft has their operating system layer and then I would create two or three applications uh the way Microsoft did in the '90s like Office or whatever and then I would just go buy up other companies just like Microsoft did just run the Microsoft playbook. The problem is that Microsoft's main product was the operating system. So they had the network effect from day one. Whereas OpenAI does not have a network effect at all. Um the the main thing they have right now is distribution and the subscriptions, but the consumers are fickle and SMBs are fickle and they'll move off to something for 10 bucks or five bucks or as long as it's good enough and maybe they'll have some other thing they like better because it's for their vertical or who knows. So where do you think what do you think is the juiciest kind of opportunity whether you're an entrepreneur or an investor? I we think it's in the application layer in the operating layer and so we are investing in things that can build network effects and we're looking at verticals typically uh where where people can get uh rapid growth and network effects so that even after a year or two their scale allows them to have a network effect which makes it hard for anyone to compete with them. What's an example maybe something you invested that you're excited about you think has kind of the right architecture to do well? Oh something like an AI dungeon which is coming out with a multiplayer uh I don't know what that is. AI Dungeon is a um a role playing game based on AI. It was the first sort of AI gaming company and they're still the biggest and they're still the most advanced and um they're in our portfolio and and I work with those guys and they're going to build out a network effect around RPG games that are powered by AI. So, so you think of gaming companies adding AI, but we were thinking AI companies creating game creating games or things like a company like an evenup, which is uh uh AI for personal injury lawyers. It's a vertical Microsoft and Google don't want, right? But it's still $80 billion a year. They need software to help them run their business. It's a great business. I saw two billboards for personal injury on the way here. Exactly. We were just talking about it. Like, exactly. What is this industry, right? And and and people don't what are they doing with AI with it? Well, they're they have to submit these 300page documents to the court to and they also have to evaluate the people who come in the door to see whether they should take the case on or not. Right. And the AI helps them collect the data, analyze the data, and then figure out what the court case would look like and whether they would actually get the money they want from this or not, which the the judges actually like because then they're not bringing specious cases. They're only bringing cases that that, you know, should have some sort of compensation. Okay, there we go. So, application layer, operating system layers, u specific verticals. Um, we're also investing in some um speedups for the the uh overall tools and architecture, dev tools, dev tools and stuff like that because we think that you can get distribution quickly and then build lock in the way Atlassian has done. M and if you were 25 again and it's 25 in the year 2025. Yeah. And you it's you Stan Rick you guys are hanging out again. Yeah. What do you think you would be doing? First I would have the conversation do we want to have a fun normal life, a fun strive life or a global greatness life? Right. And what's your answer? My answer is sort of um global greatness. I think that it's just fun to play in that game. Uh to see if like like we at Tickle Weed registered 150 million users when there were 600 million people on the internet like right that was that was touching the world. It was kind of fun. Uh I think it's fun to do stuff at scale. I'm really interested in scale right things that scale are software media money a few other things and just I like to work in those mediums but you would have to decide like don't don't think that you have to be Steve Jobs in order to live a great life. M realize you can have a fun normal life. You're in the g global greatness game, but you seem like you're not Steve Jobs. You seem like you're happy. Like it was one of my notes was like I love this guy's lifestyle. Like you you showed up in a in a fun shirt. We hung out for a couple hours. You told me how you know you're like I spend a couple months out of the year with my kids. We try to travel as much as you can. That's as many months as they'll have me, you know, but I want to max that that bar out. You were writing a TV show for fun. like you weren't like Elon running six companies, sleeping on the factory floor. That wasn't like you didn't give that vibe, right? Yeah. You seemed like a happy, you know, happy dude who had kind of like balance, but you were still scaling. So, like, you know, are you in that game or are you some other Yeah, I'm kind of I'm I'm upper middle class. I'm lower upper class sort of in that in that area if you want like in that zip code. I'm on that borderland. You know, I get invited to the rooms where the global greatness is happening, but I love spending time with my wife and my kids, right? And that's my priority is to have a great family life. And you know, everyone tells me that I look younger than I am. And I'm like, it's because I love my wife and I don't drink alcohol. It's pretty simple, you know. And uh yeah, we've taken the kids to hike to the Ever Space Camp. We've sailed across the ocean. We we got attacked by orcas and our boat was destroyed. Like uh we go snow camping in the winters and live in eagloos and yeah, we do all the fun stuff with the kids. Did you have to wait till you were wealthy to do those things or were you doing it all along the way? Cuz like I think if I'm listening to this, I'm like, "Yeah, good. Well, cool. You're sort of rich and retired. I get it. I want to get rich and retired. But until then, I'm going to grind." No, no. What I did was right after college, I moved jobs every six months and sailed across both the Atlantic and the Pacific. I learned how to paraglide. I learned how to scuba dive. I did all the adventure stuff. I lived in Hong Kong. I lived in Beijing. 20s. 20s. Yeah. Um and then I realized that I wanted to do some global greatness. So I started grinding. And so I ground for three years at Battery Ventures as an associate in Boston. And then I ground uh actually I had a lot of fun at Harvard Business School for a year and a half um where I met my wife and then I um I ground in my startups. But then what was interesting is once I had plenty of money then I ground again because it was fun. It was type two fun. Yeah. It was creativity. It was generiveness you know. And this is the thing I love this word generative because if you want to understand what Elon is doing, he's just generating. He's generating tweets. He's generating kids. He's generating companies. He's he's generating he's just moving stuff around. And and and a lot of people here in the Bay Area, I find are like that. Not as extreme, but like Craig Donado, who who you know is the head of uh revenue at Roblox, that guy has generated he's like he's like Howard. He's like John G. The guy's like terraforming the American River to create an incredible camp for him and his friends, right? And he worked on it. He bought it for $240,000 and he worked on it for 22 years. with his own hands, right? And yet he's worth way more money than any of us need because that's what he loves doing. It's type two fun. So there's there's always been this this approach to adventuring that I've had. Um and I ground and tried to get someplace for like I don't know eight years and other than that it's all just been you know pick up the adventures every minute you can because life is short, right? you um you don't seem maybe this conversation feels different, but like you didn't seem to me like you were somebody who um was kind of like in the like a lot of people like Elon worship camp. It's like, oh, I like, you know, he's the north star and like everybody else is just some like some, you know, standard deviations away from Elon and and you should just feel bad about yourself for not being standard deviations close to Elon, whereas like I think you you're kind of in my camp, which is like you admire parts of him, not all. And of the parts you admire, you sort of incorporate that into your your game or your life, you know, whether it's his speed or maybe his fearlessness or things that are like unquestionably admirable. Totally. Um, I I am curious like who do you admire? Who do you learn from a lot? Like who's who's kind of like your mentor? Whether you know them or you just read about them a lot, like who are the people that inspire you? Um, I'm certainly inspired by what Elon's been able to do. You know, when I when I knew him in the 2000s, he he and I were in some of the same circles. He just seemed like a a normal guy. Really? Yeah. He just seemed like a really generative, cool guy like Craig Donado or like anybody else. Um, you couldn't have picked in a room. You wouldn't have been like, "That guy, that guy's going to be the one." No, I wouldn't have. I wouldn't have or somebody else might have, but I I wasn't capable of doing that. And I remember in 200 what I admire about Elon is that in 2007 after the the third rocket blew up, I emailed him and I'm like, "Elon, the next one's going to I said I said, "It's going to work eventually and when you do, it'll make it all the more sweet, man. Just keep going." Wow. And he he emailed me back like four hours later. He's like, "Thanks, man. I needed that." You know, like he was in the trenches. he was putting everything on the line. You know, he's an entrepreneur uh doing entrepreneurial things and that's what's admirable about him. And whether you're doing a bakery or whether you're doing a construction company or whatever, you're going through that same journey. And that was what was admirable about him is that he was cleareyed in his effort toward doing that back then. And and he just keeps expanding the purview, the sort of scale at which he's he's operating. You also had this idea for one world currency. Yeah, before Bitcoin in 1997 there was a thing called Cyber Gold and I was at Battery Ventures at the time and I was trying to convince my bosses we should take a look at this because we were going to have softwarebased currencies and where'd that come from? I mean that's not obvious. It's not obvious. Were you reading sci-fi or No, it's just I was an associate and I was talking to companies and this guy approached us and he said, "I got this thing called cyber gold and I think that we're going to have softwarebased gold and it's going to be currencies. We're going to pay each And I said, "That actually sounds like logical. That sounds like the real future." And then the second thing that happened was we were at Tickle a few years later and we saw a Korean company that was selling a digital rose 32 pixels x 32 pixels or something or 64 x 64 for $4.95. And I was one of one of my engineers said, "Hey James, come take a look at And it was in Korean, so we didn't know what was going on, but we could see that there was a price on this little digital thing that I could send to a girl on this social network that they had, right? And Stan was standing behind me and I turned around and I looked at him and he looked down at me and I goes, "There it is. People are going to buy pixels." This was, I don't know, 2020, 2002, something like that. And people are going to buy pixels because it's just like buying a thing because it just affects your brain, you know? It's all in our minds, right? And then we realized, okay, so now we're going to have digital goods that people pay for even though there's nothing to it. And um we got Cyber Gold and and then Second Life comes along. So I had this funny experience. I go to a tech conference called PC Forum and there's this guy there and he's sitting next to me during a during one of the lectures and we go out and he's like, "I want to show you my thing." And I said, "Great." And so he waves over these other two guys and it turns out it's Larry and Sergey. And so the four of us sit on a couch in the sun and he opens up his laptop and he's like, "I've got this thing and it's a virtual world and it's called Second Life. This is how it works." And and I'm like, "So do you have a currency?" He goes, "Yes, we do. It's called Lyndon dollars." And so I said, "Okay, very interesting." D. And so he gave us this demo and it was very cool. And so I went out to him. He and I walked outside and Sarah Sergey and Larry went elsewhere and um I said to him this this is going to be like I said to him the only question now is Philip what color are the robes meaning I see what you're doing you're creating a religion like you're you're you're moving humanity into this other realm and he was like oh he's like you really know what I'm doing like you you you get it at a deep level I'm like yeah and so I ended up on his board with Mitch Kapoor and Bill Gurley and whatnot for 5 years and and Second Life got big. It got big. It was on the cover of every magazine. It it was the talk of the town. They raised it over a billion dollars from Goldman and others. And in the end, it didn't end up becoming the world changing thing. But they what what Zuckerberg is trying to do right now with his virtual world is still behind what Cory Andrea and Philip were able to do with the technology in 2003 and four, right? And they still behind it. They had I've never seen any company that was 20 years ahead in the digital realm and they are still that far ahead. In what way are they ahead? Well, just the pixelation, the controls, the the world, how the world functions, right? The integration, creating an actual functioning digital world. The cool thing about that is a lot of games have an in-game currency. That's not what the Lynon dollars are. the people, the players of the game like use the currency as a real currency to buy, sell, trade like at a like full level, like it's been going for for years and years years, right? It was like a fully baked currency, not like not just like, oh, I got to buy gems to get the power up and then I'm I'm out of here, right? Like it was so multiplayer, everybody's using it with each other. People really valued it and you could trade lend a dollar against US dollars and British pounds, right, on open exchanges, right? and we would manage the fluctuation of the currencies and we had it took us a few years to figure that on us. It took them a few years to it wasn't me doing it, but I was watching them do it and I was meeting with them and learning about how they were balancing the currency so it didn't have that many fluctuations. And so um we saw that we saw all that and and you know the way we measured the world was $760 million of GDP and what are the number of people who are making more than $1,000 a month in Second Life and we would watch that chart like because it was actually people were living in there, right? So, we realized that money is just completely made up in our heads and that you can exchange it whatever. We went off the gold standard in 72. There's nothing to money. It's all just in our minds. And so, when you say it's all in our minds, you just mean as long as as long as we all believe it, it works. As soon as one of us doesn't believe it, there's nothing underneath it besides that. It's the belief network effect. It's the belief network effect. It's actually on the one of the 17 um network effects. And Bitcoin is just purely a Bitcoin's a memecoin, right? We just all believe in it. It's the best one. It's It's just the best memecoin, right? Um it's on a spectrum. It's not a different thing, right? And the dollar is also a meme coin in this. The dollar is a memecoin. Absolutely. And they just list out the reasons to believe. What what underlies the belief. Why do you believe in the US dollar? We have aircraft carriers. We have tax base. Yeah. Those are all reasons. Those are more reasons to believe than Bitcoin, right? But with Bitcoin, you can't print anymore. And that's like a negative for the dollar. So you just list out for every believable thing, you just list out what are the reasons to believe, right? and and they're on a spectrum. It's not it's not a different thing. So in 2004, I bought a URL blue.com because I was like, we should create the world's cyber the pricey domain. Blue.com, that's premium. It was pricey. Yeah, it was pricey, but you believed. But I believed. I believed. And I believe in language and I believe in naming and all that. And so I went to Philip. I said, you know, we should create the world's global currency and we should, as one friend says to another, as one friend say to another. And we should call it blue because you have green backs like like dollars and then you have the blue currency. So you have a global currency. And so we got together every week on a Wednesday afternoon with Mitch Kapor and Philip and me and Stan. Um and we would talk about how we were going to pull this off. And so this was not just shooting this year. This was like we were planning. Yeah. This is 2007 200. Not just one drunk conversation. No. It went on for a bunch of weeks. It went off for a bunch of weeks. And the what we had back then was Bit Torrent, right? So Bit Torrent was a distributed thing where everyone had a copy or pieces of the copy of the movies and we could all share. And so what we were going to create, we were going to create a torrented currency and it was going to be encrypted and we were going to leverage it off lined to start with. It was going to be an independent company. It was going to be its own thing. We were going through week by week. We were sort of nailing down all these topics. Then we came to something we couldn't figure out which was this creates seniorage to the US dollar which is illegal after the laws in place after the civil war. Remember there was 1,600 different currencies in the US before the civil war. Senior just means creating a currency creating a currency that's above the US dollar. Above meaning senior you can't you can't do anything that's above the dollar. meaning seniors essentially outlawed any currency which wasn't the US dollar to be used and so we knew that if we were to do it the FTC would come after us at some point. Now remember the SEC and the FTC did shut Facebook down from launching Libra because Facebook was already too powerful and the government saw them as a threat and it was there was going to be some senior and some crypto. So, we were right that at some point, but we knew what had needed to happen is we need to have an immaculate conception. We needed to be born so that no one knew it was us because Philip had four kids. I had four kids. We had plenty of money. We had all of our friends target on your back. We like being an American. We don't want to have to move to the Bahamas or or the Cayman Islands. We don't want to have a target on our back. We don't want the M16s banging on our door in the middle of the night. The we had too much to lose. So we had to figure out how can we do this and not be known as the people doing it. The problem was we had talked at the lobby at David Hornick's lobby about one currency to rule them all. Philip and I had led a talk with about 20 people about this to get their ideas and at the end they said well I guess we know who's going to go do this. So we knew that there was 20 people outside of the room who knew we were working on this and eventually someone would track it back to us. And so we couldn't solve that problem, right, of anonymity. And so we didn't go forward with it. And then about a year later, I get an email from Philip saying, "Is this you? Did you do this?" And it's the Bitcoin paper. Wow. And I And he was pissed. He was like, "You cut me out. You cut me out." And I was like, "No, dude. It's not me." And in fact, we both know that of the two of us, it's more likely to be you. Is it you? and he said, "No, it's not me." Wow. So, so we we missed out on on creating Bitcoin. So, did you buy? Yeah, of course. Of course. And I was lecturing about it. And then what happened was the next lobby I went and I led a a a session on Bitcoin and about 35 people came and a whole bunch of people went and bought and um six people have come up to me and said, "I owe my house to you." Yeah. Yeah. So, why are you not like a 100 billionaire then? You had the idea before the idea, right? before the price was I uh did cuz I I bought a bunch but I didn't buy an infinite amount. Did you have the uh I have entrepreneurial uh stubbornness which is when I had an idea and somebody else did it. I sort of become like egotist I don't know I I want them to fail slash like I I don't invest in it when it's like wait I thought you believed you want you believe in so much you almost wanted to do it. Yeah. I have a resistance. Yeah. I don't know if it's uh uh I think it's creator uh stubbornness. You want you want to have been the creator rather than the participant. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. I have that too. I have that too. The other one I was going to bring up was this great line you had. You go, you talked about some therapy, couples therapy you dip into or something like that. You said, uh, therapy is just realizing how much of an [ __ ] you are. Makes you a better partner for your for your wife. Yeah, totally. That was great advice. Totally. No, I am I am a big fan of, as is my wife, of taking any self-improvement thing that comes along, right? Why not? What if you have to lose? And anybody who's hesitant to do that stuff, not only do I find you not courageous, but I also think you're missing out on the fact that interpersonal relationships is the most important thing you do in your life. It determines whether you're going to be successful at your business, right? It determines whether you have a good death. Like all the things that are important are determined by that. And yet we don't spend nearly enough time on it. You know, I I uh have a friend whose boss told her once, "Oh, you don't need a coach. you're fine. Like what? She wants a coach. Like everybody should have a coach. Like awesome, right? Like just you can always get better. And I and you know I I learned this just in life and it's kind of obvious. But I also learned it from my wife who's the nicest person in the world and of anyone I know. She's the person who needs therapy least, right? And she heard about this thing, Landmark Forum, from our friends and she's like, "Oh, I want to do it." And I'm like, "Why?" She goes, "Oh, because then I might be able to love people better." Right? I'm like, "Oh, that is awesome. Yeah, what an attitude, right? And uh and so she and I took these five classes at the Landmark Forum over the course of two years and I don't think I'd be married without it cuz I just hadn't been developed in the basic ways of you know if you go to Stanford Business School and you ask people what's the best thing you took at Stanford they're like touchyfey and if you go to Harvard Business School and say what was the most important thing you learned at Harvard Business School I say lead lead and and and touchify are the same class basically in the two different schools and I find it's the same thing in the world. It's like the most important thing you learn and people don't focus on them. You go to conscious leadership. That's a great program. You got Joe Hudson doing programs. You got Hoffman Institute doing programs. There's all these ways to just further yourself and deepen yourself. And that makes relationships like Stan go easier and you can have as much money as you want or as little money as you want and still be happy as hell, right? So what what are we doing? You know, and and and literally on the fourth course at Landmark Forum, I'd suddenly like over my eyes. I'm like, "Oh, I'm a total [ __ ] I understand. I'm I'm you know D in all these ways I'm [ __ ] and unless you admit to yourself you're an [ __ ] How can you stop being an [ __ ] Right. Step one of the [ __ ] recovery program. Yeah. Love it. James, thanks for doing this, man. Long time coming. Yeah. Thank you, Sean. [Music]

Oracle versus Microsoft. Have you heard this story? No. Microsoft, if you remember in the 90s, was doing antitrust cases. He was being accused of a monopoly. Monopolistic behaviors. This really was a problem for Microsoft. It couldn't acquire companies. They couldn't release a competitor and kind of use their distribution to win. While it's in this situation, the Independent Institute, the National Taxpayers Union, they're coming out in support of Microsoft here. And Larry Ellison from Oracle's like, "Nah, no way." Hires these private investors to go dumpster diving. And so they're digging through the trash of these independent organizations, finding links where they got paid by Microsoft, and they get caught, but they're also caught that Microsoft funded these organizations. And so they go to Larry Ellison. He's like, "Look, I had nothing to do with this. I wasn't made aware of it till the end." And I agree this was a bit unsavory, but he goes, "Corporate espionage. This is a public service. We're doing our civic duty here. We are taking hidden information about how Microsoft is funding these supposed independent orgs and we are making it public. We're doing God's work out

Have you heard of this company called Solid Core? I've been described as that person, but never a company level. This was like mindboggling to me. So, and she goes to LA and she takes a Pilates class. I I've never done one, but I've heard it's like incredibly challenging. She starts doing these classes and she's like, "This is awesome." And the class was really cute and darling and she was like, "I want to do this." So, she quits her job, I believe, in August and by November she started her studio. Solid core, that's the name of the business. It's like that Pilates thing, but it's kind of has like a berries kind of edge to it. The music is just like 40% too loud. Yeah. She starts this thing in month one does $90,000 in revenue. She kept growing it and by year 2 she goes I was able to pay myself a million in salary. This thing took off. 2013 she launched it. By year 2016 she has 11 studios. And then finally after 10 years she eventually has sold the whole business for something like $250 million. And across all of the rounds, she had taken off the table something like $90 million.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
For a lot of my friends, this is their only business. This is literally their lifeline. And so I find it very not cool is my official diagnosis. Super uncool by the orange guy. All right, Sean. Mahalo. My first question is, what's it feel like to be an extra on the set of White Lotus? As long as I'm not the guy who dies, I'm good. All right, so that's my that's my white lotus game plan. I I thought I'd be festive for you. I think you look good, dude. I was uh So, as you know, I don't leave my house and um took the family on vacation. So, we're in Hawaii and I texted Ben. I go, "Dude, I'm getting recognized left and right." And he goes, "Really? Uh that's awesome. Like, how many times?" Like 10, 11. And I go, "No, dude, two left and right." Hey, I got it happened twice just now. I had to text you right away. This is amazing. Where did you get recognized? At the airport, dude. Someone voice recognized me. I was like coming around the corner somewhere. I'm talking to my kids and some guy just runs around the corner. He goes, "Hey, are you are you Sean?" I go, "Did you just recognize my voice?" He goes, "Yeah, I listen to like I listen to the podcast a bunch." Dude, there's been so many times where like I've met someone and I like we should hang out and then they text me. You want to get on this flight? Yeah. Do you want Do you have a ticket? Well, like if I'm like flying home and like someone's sitting near me, I'm like, "Do do you want to like be friends and like get together sometimes and then they'll message me a week later." I'm like, "What are they doing?" It's like going to the grocery store hungry. Like I'm just like making bad choices. Um, can we talk about tariffs really quick? First of all, I want to let people know I don't know anything about this. Like I'm not like an economist, which everyone is uh all of a sudden. But I want to know, did you go to Hawaii because you were sweating and you're like, I need to find peace or or what? Dude, the last time I came to Hawaii, I don't know if you remember this, was in 2022. Wasn't it like a some crypto thing like you crashed? I landed and the same day I landed, crypto had the biggest crash. Uh like uh Luna basically went broke and it brought down Bitcoin with it. And I basically landed and then lost a million dollars and it was just trying to hang out with my wife and just be like, "Okay, cool. Uh I'm just not going to mention this like how expensive this vacation has got." And the worst part was because I was on vacation, I didn't have like any of my normal like computer hardware or anything. I couldn't sell I couldn't I couldn't do anything. Yeah. Like you know, oh this cold storage is working out great. So I was I was basically stuck. And then this time, same thing. Went on vacation. Oh, the S&P 500 has had the worst like 3-day losses since like the bubanic plague. And I was like, oh great, here we go again. I'm not coming to Hawaii anymore. When I've been going through this, as everyone knows, I'm I'm heavy on index. Uh, and when I have been going through this, my I've just I just don't look. I just I just I don't look. I just I pretend it doesn't exist and I don't look. Although I did I I invested a little bit more than normally I do every month and I went a little bit heavier, but I just didn't look. I just I can't log in. It it it makes me too anxious and it really ruins my day. Yeah. I Well, I asked a simple question. Am I going to do anything? Is my plan do do I have some trade I'm trying to make right now? Is there some some genius move? Am I just trying to panic sell? No. Okay. If not, then there's really no point in even looking. It's just going to ruin my vacation. So, I I don't look. Um, but when I landed, I there was something I had to look at, which is these tariffs. So, not only did the stock market crash, or maybe because of this, the stock market has been crashing, which is that Donald Trump has created a new holiday, Sam. Liberation Day. Yeah. Uh, happy libs. Happy Lib Day. Somebody was like maybe he meant liberation day in the sense of liberation like the Buddhists think where we are being liberated of all of our possessions and we just aren't going to own anything anymore. I don't have any material goods anymore. Thank you. Thank you. So he came out and he has this giant poster board slam to every country. That's basically like his slam board where he's like China you're getting tariffed you're getting ter everybody's getting tariffed. And and then since then he so he came out with like a 50% uh or whatever it was like a 35% plus a 20% uh tariff on China. So it's like wow 54% that's it's going to be crazy. And then since then he added another 50% on top. So now we're at 104. And um I suppose there's just no upper limit as to how hard how high this could go cuz this morning as of this morning China retaliated with its own uh escalating retali retaliation 80 something% tariff. So, we're in a trade war. And does that mean for you as an ecom owner when you buy $10,000 worth of goods from um China, if you do buy them from China, that now you're be you're going to pay $20,000? Yes. Exactly. Okay. So, it's as simple as that. Got it. It's as simple as that. So, basically, uh and and the reason to talk about this is not because I'm a tariff expert, which I'm not, but because I have an e-com store and I have a lot of friends at e-commerce as well. And for all of them, I mean, this is like D-Day, basically. So, most of us manufacture in China, not because we're like, "Oh, I really want to have the lowest cost goods from China." That wasn't really the impetus. In fact, when I started our company, we first looked at manufacturing in the US. We were like, "Oh, that'd be great. It'd be great to manufacture in the US. It'd be a great story to tell to customers. Also, maybe we'll be faster lead times because we're not having to put every item on a boat and sail it across the sea." So, I called all the manufacturers I could find in the US and I was like, "Hey, like, do you think you could do this?" And most of them were just like, "No." And one guy in LA was like, "Oh, yeah. We could do this. Do you want it for double the price, half the speed, at half as good?" And I was like, "Is that your sales pitch?" Yeah. He's like, "Look, I'm just being honest with you." He's like, "Cuz if you're comparing factories, you're going to find this." He's like I was like, "How could it be half the speed? There's no boat. There's no sitting on a on a boat for a month." And what he explained was he was like, number one, all of the inputs to anything you're going to make. So even if we make it, we're going to import all the parts. So we still have the parts on a boat for a long period of time. Secondly, we don't have the labor that's skilled at doing this. Uh third, we don't have the machines. He was like, actually, it's the machines, not the labor that's the problem. He's like, basically, when we kind of de-industrialized, all of the best machinery to do this work went to China. There's only like so many machines that do this right now. to get a new machine takes like a year and blah blah blah cost a bunch of money and so we don't even have the machines and I was like okay so then dude how does this guy answer the phone is he like f you this is Derek you know what I mean like I don't want your business how are you is there anything I cannot get for you yeah like all right have a good day bye-bye now go f yourself like that just how that's just how they they answer their phones honestly a great gig as far as I'm concerned like maybe he's like a retired guy and he just wanted to keep that going. Really? My dad would like to do that in retirement, turn people down all day. And so, uh, what are your friends thinking in the industry? Cuz it seems, dude, you guys just get beat up constantly. You know what I mean? You just get punched all the time. Yeah. It's like, okay, make America great again. Where where's the great part? What's happening? Where? All we're doing is putting like all these small businesses out of business and raising the price on consumers, right? So, here's what's happening. So, just to give you a scenario, I have a friend who is doing really well with his business and the business has been growing. And so, prior to Trump taking office, he's, you know, he was growing the business. Trump takes office, he says he's going to have a tariff. He says it's going to be a 20% tariff. So, we're like, okay, mentally prepared for 20% tariff. So, he places an order. Just to give you a sense like orders have like a forget about moving your manufacturing which is a multi-year process that may not even work by the way just like changing your like sourcing from one place to another is you know 6 months to a year to get it up to scale. This guy you know basically he's operating on a four-month lead time meaning from the day he knows he needs an he needs a an order he has to place it four months in advance. So he placed it four months ago. Now, four months ago is basically, you know, before Trump even took office, right? So, he placed that order and now as that order is he's got five containers out at sea about to on the ship and they're like, "Yeah, it's 100% tariff now." So, he has to pay a million dollars in tariff. He doesn't have a million dollars. So, he's like, he's like, "Dude, I literally don't know what I'm going to do. Right? I don't have a million extra dollars lying around in my business that I could just pay this tariff. I also have five containers. I have thousands of units just sitting there. They can't be rerouted. I can't tell them to go back to China. I can't I can't He's like, "What do I do? Just shut down my business?" Like, he's basically like totally screwed. And so, and this is common. This is a lot of people are dealing with this. Hey, let's take a quick break, but instead of an ad, I have a freebie for you. Uh, it is my pitch deck template. So, if you're a founder and you're ever looking to raise money from investors, the reality is most founders are pretty bad at telling their own story. Their decks are bad. I've seen thousands of decks. I can tell you that most decks don't do the business justice. And so, I actually made a template of what I use for my own companies. I've given this out before in my newsletter. Thousands of people have downloaded it and I get emails all the time saying, "Hey, thanks for that template. I used it. I raised my round." So, it's a freebie. If you want to ever raise money from investors, go grab it. There's a link in the description below. And it just tells you like slide by slide like put this here, put this here, put this here with a little bit of commentary of why you're arranging the structure in that order. I think it will raise your odds of successfully raising a funding round. So go ahead and grab it. It's my free pitch deck template. You and I have a mutual friend. He said the same thing. He was like uh he's like, "My container, you know, the price container got screwed during a bunch of stuff in the last two or three years. There was so many different things. There was the Panama Canal or what Suez Canal. I forget. Whatever. There was the ship got stuck. Yeah, a ship got stuck. Then there was this and then there's that. And then now he's like this thing. He's like, I don't have enough money to buy the goods that I have coming in because I placed the order like a month ago. Like all like it was like in transit it changed the price. It's sort of it's like when a parent is like ah you say another word. Five more minutes a timeout. Oh, there's five. What? What did you Yeah. Five more. Five more. You just got yourself five more. Totally. In fact, I'm going to stop start calling it tariffs with my kids. I'm just going to start using that lingo. Maybe maybe it'll be fun to be on the other side of the tariff for once. Um and and there's a little bit of uh so now people are trying to find you know whether it's workarounds or you know trying to figure out hey does this apply because it's kind of unclear even how this applies. You know does it matter if I got my goods on the boat beforehand. Either way whether whether this shipment gets tariffed a million dollars or not. Point is, it's very hard to survive as a business when you're you operated, let's say, an e-commerce business that has 10 to 15% profit margin if you're doing things right. You know, 20 if you're really kicking ass and you've been business and been in business for a long time and you have economies of scale and you have a large returning customer base, but like 10 to 15% profit margins and then your cogs go up by 100%. Is not going to work. Like they're going to go broke. And so the the only alternative is you have to pass that to the customer. So now you have to tell the customer, hey, what this what this means to the customer, the math is if a normal, let's say a unit of your thing cost a dollar and now it's going to cost $2. Well, before you sold that $1 thing for let's say $3 or $4. Let's just say $4. A 4x markup, right? So your COGS was 25% of your 4x is is is I would imagine is very normal. Yeah. A standard markup, let's say. And that that sounds like greedy. Oh, you're already marking it at 4x. Well, no, because you have to pay for marketing and advertising and your staff and the fulfillment and all all this other stuff. You end up with a 10 10% 15% profit margin by the end of it, which is like restaurant territory. And so, you know, it's not some we're not some fat cats over here in the ecom land. Go look at ecom. You just see a bunch of tired scraggly fools who like are just playing the wrong game. And so, you you take that dollar item, now it's $2. Well, that means you have to raise the price instead of being instead of it being four originally, now you got to raise it to five to make up for that, right? So, you're all your goods are going to go up by 25 to 30%. So, that's inflationary, right? So, if you thought, you know, inflation was bad before the price of eggs and all this stuff, well, wait till Christmas season comes and nobody could buy a toy because all the toys are made in China, right? This is things all the shirts are made in China. All the toys are made in China. And if they're not made in China, they're made in Vietnam, which also got tariffed. And so it's like uh you know there's a few countries that make all the stuff and this plan really doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Now maybe I'm just being sensitive cuz I have a business. Yeah. Yeah. So well and less so for me cuz I have a lot of businesses but for a lot of my friends this is their only business. This is literally their lifeline and so I find it um very not cool is my official diagnosis. Super uncool by the orange guy. I think you need to create like a Sean's homie private chat uh lobby. Uh and you guys could spend literally thousands of dollars to lobby the government to change their opinion. Dude, I'm going to go to the lobby of this hotel and just see if I can get someone to change their mind. Is that what lobbying? That is the only lobbying I'm doing. And you'll declare bankruptcy down there by yelling it declaring it. Exactly. And so by the way, I don't know if you've read uh Molson who uh I don't know if you know Molson Molson Hart. He wrote a great post on X that I think is worth reading and it's basically called the America underestimates the difficulty of bringing manufacturing back and he gives 14 reasons about like why even if he took the generous side of this like policy and you're like oh you know what short-term pain for long-term gain, right? Cuz I think we could all agree there's short-term pain, right? The business owners have short-term pain. The consumers who are going to have their prices raised short-term pain. The factories on the other side have short-term pain. The stock market is crashing. That's short-term pain. The 401ks are going down. So, that part's pretty unamiguous. The short-term pain. The question is, is there even long-term gain? And he wrote a post that basically outlines like, you know, very, you know, thoughtfully why there's some problems with this. And he's basically like, you know, one one argument after another. It's sort of like um not only does moving a manufacturing plant back to America take a long time like by the time somebody by the time a business owner who today is getting hit by these tariffs assuming they could somehow survive spend millions of extra dollars opening up manufacturing in the United States which is not going to happen and is a multi-year period before they get it all online and then they magically find the labor to do this because we don't really even train people in America to do this type of work anymore. U there's going to be a new president and like you don't even know what the tariff situation is going to be by then. It might be a totally a total fool's errand to do it by then. So nobody's really going to be able to make that move. Most likely what's actually going to happen is like he's like, you know, we tried to do this in Trump's first term and all we did was make Vietnam great again. Like basically this manufacturer just shifts to one of the other lowcost Asian countries that has lower tariffs is what's going to actually happen. That's not going to like magically bring jobs back. Oh, and by the way, you don't want to sit there and knit t-shirts either. Like, this is not a job you want. Like, these are jobs China doesn't even want. You want it? Dave Chappelle was like, "I want to wear Jordans. I don't want to make them shit." Exactly. Perfectly said. Like, there's these memes going around of like, you know, it'll be like Chimoth like out of like a sewing machine trying to make a shirt. It's so true. It's like, is this what you think is going to happen? Is this America being great again? I'm not sure. And so, you know, political stuff aside, I think that the the tariff situation is really crazy right now. And as a business owner, it is very very tricky how to navigate this amongst your friend group. Is it going to put anyone out of business or is it just going to destroy their margins? Like, is this like um a complete huge risk or is it like you've just made my life more challenging? It's going to for sure put some people out of business because you had to like I was telling you my my friend with the stuff already at C or trying to scale their business. They might not be able to sell their product for an extra let's say they were $100 product before and now they're $140 product in order to maintain you know still some profit. So on one hand demand is going to go down right I'm going to have less customers because I had to raise my price. My costs went up, my cash flow that I had in the business went down and maybe down to a point where I'm needing to borrow money in order to just pay the tariff bills that I have of stuff that already in flight. Um, it's a very very tricky situation. You know, what we did in our business was I was like, "Okay, here's how you deal with situations like this. You have to create like a immediate SWAT team and let's open up a Google doc. Let's make six bullet points. It's like what are the six levers we could pull?" Okay. So, uh, pricing, we're going to have to create, uh, some sort of tariff sir charge. Um, and we think it could be in this range that'll offset some, but not all of the amount because we can't pass 100% of it to the customer. It'll kill demand. And so, we're going to pass, you know, a few bucks to the customer this way. Uh, the next thing we could do, we're trying to source from another country. Okay. It looks like, you know, maybe it's Mexico or it's India or it's one of these lower tariff countries. Okay. You're you're working on that. um you over here, you're going to work on um you know figuring out how we're going to lower our cost of goods. You're gonna have to go negotiate with the factory, ask them to share some of the burden with you. You're going to have to look up the talk to the lawyers and see what's going on with the stuff that's already in flight. Hey, we're going to have to bring down the purchase orders because we have to be way more conservative. Hey, you're going to have to go secure more debt because we're going to need a line of credit to make sure we can withstand the storm here. And so we created this plan. And I was like, we're meeting every day. These five people, like the five core people in the company, whatever other priorities you had, they're gone. This is your priority now. We're going to meet every day and we're going to work on this plan for the next, you know, n number of days until this plan is executed. And I think it's going to take that level of of intensity. I think a mistake I made in the past is when things like this happen, you sort of take a little bit of a wait and see approach. I think that could be very um every day that you don't act could be very costly as a business owner. And so I think one of the key things to do um and like in our business we have a CEO, we have a full exec team, but when I heard how they were planning to approach this, it was like, yeah, this is like really important just like these other four really important things we have. And I go, no, no, no. You need to like have a public, you know, PSA that this is the most important thing you could do. We're gonna meet every morning. There was there's a name for this team and this this is the most important thing we're doing and this is your top priority. You need to cut off some other [ __ ] right? Like I think just raising the level of intensity is very key in a situation like this or people will go out of business. So you going to go snorkeling? Yeah. And this is so funny. I'm on the call talking about how we have to like raise the intensity and there's literally just like aloha. There's like this like calming like Hawaiian music behind me and like clearly like palm trees and I'm like guys guys this is life or death. And and I like I like I'm going down a water slide on the Google Meet. I didn't plan it this way. All right. You You stop like mid talk to like get your drink that has the umbrella on it and you're like looking for the straw with your mouth. That's awesome. Um well that sucks. Uh, is there a world where is there any time you know how like what do they what what did George like is there anything I can do? No, there's nothing you can do. Dude, I I met with a guy the other day and I thought I was like why do you want to I never take phone calls with people but he wanted to talk and I thought he was going to end the conversation with like look like you know I've loved watching you get big and be on the pod and you know is there anything I can do and I thought he just like could do to help and he said is there anything I could do to be a guest on the podcast? Uh, and I was like, "Wait, what? Uh, I thought you were going to ask me how you could help me." And then he just ended it with, "Is there anything I could do to be on your podcast and to have you promote me?" [Laughter] Uh, I was like, "No, there's nothing that you could do." Wow. Hell of an ask. Yeah, it was a bold ask. Um, do you want to talk about something more fun? Please. All right, let's talk about something more fun. I think this is actually going to be really fun. I'm going to try and take your mind away from um the fact that the company that you've spent decades trying to build with your I'm going to try and uh take you uh take your mind off of that. It just you know four decades you spent building this company. Now it's vanish never send Sam to like the cancer ward the bedside man. We don't have time much we don't have a lot of time left. Uh so let's get to it. Sorry. Uh I meant you don't have a lot of time left, so let's have to get to it. Um but I did I did I read something interesting that I when I read it, I was shocked by it. And the reason I read this thing was because my company Hampton, it's basically like an events company. We host hundreds of events a year. And so I'm trying to learn how other like event-based businesses operate. And I found one that I totally didn't realize how amazing it was. Uh and I just forgot about it. Have you ever heard of the uh medieval times generally? Yeah. Yeah, sure. No, the restaurant series like the restaurant franchise. No, you've never heard Oh my god, you are going to love this. Okay, Google. Is it like Rainforest Cafe but for like more? Oh, there's like basically it looks like a small castle like the Excalibur Hotel in Vegas. And then inside there's like people on horses jousting people. I always thought this was just like a joke. I thought this was a joke in like '90s movies like for where people were going uh for dinner. I didn't realize it was a real thing. So, let me tell you the story. So, Medieval Times, it's basically dinner theater. And so, they do a 2-hour show where you go with you, your wife, and your two kids, and you spend something like $80 ahead, and you see people host a medieval show. There's like 200 actors, and they like do jousting. They do um like some type of theater stuff. It's it's it's almost like circus delay but it's medieval stuff and it's like it's like WWF or something like wrestling like it's all like uh acting. I did not realize how big this was. So let me tell you the story. So the guy who started it his name was Jose. He was a Spanish guy. He had a small restaurant in Spain where he would uh like have like medieval like circus performers like doing juggling and just really small stuff and inside of a barbecue joint in Spain. in the 80s, for some reason, he decides to move to America, and he's like, I want to create what I did in Spain, which was a really small thing. I'm going to do it in America. And he convinces a couple bankers to uh invest $8 million into his first restaurant. And that first restaurant was in Florida. And he creates what is now Medieval's Times. And he creates this thing where the idea is we're going to host something like 20 to 40 shows per month. I'm going to hire 200 actors. He spent a year training these guys how to sword fight, how to joust, uh how to like be like legit actors. And he's like, "We're going to serve you turkey legs and other medieval food, like whatever like the stereotype like stereotypical medieval food is, and we're going to create this dinner experience." And that's what he launches in 1983. Well, fast forward almost 40 years now or 40 plus years. His son has taken it over and they were recently sued because a bunch of their performers tried to unionize and apparently they were preventing them from unionizing and so there was a ton of articles written about this company and a lot of people were talking about their financials. They're enormous. So this company does some so basically they have it's estimated around two to 2.5 million people a year coming to the restaurants and they make something like 150 to $200 million a year in 10 locations hosting these dinner theater shows. It's amazing. I had no idea this was this big and since 1983 they've hosted close to 80 million people at these events. Have you ever been to one of these? No. So there's 10 locations and I haven't lived in any of the places. Dallas, Myrtle Beach, uh Scottdale, uh like places that I've, you know, haven't really lived in. So, I've never been to one. Uh have you? No, I've never been to one. Say the numbers again. So, how big is this? So, 10 just on 10 10 locations. on 10 locations. During the union lawsuit and things like that, reporters were doing back of the envelope math and they were like, "We think the company does between 150 and $200 million a year in revenue and there's 10 locations and each location hosts something like depending on the the how popular it is, but the lowest one does something like 20 mill uh 20 performances a month all the way up to 60 performances a month. So, two a day for 30 days. It's insane how much demand there is. And it was estimated that it was around two million people a year attending. And on their official website, they say something like 80, I think they say 76 million people have ever attended a Medieval Times restaurant for one of their performances. Is that insane? So, you know, 10 to$20 million per location and they might be making, you know,$1 to2 million of profit per location, something like that. So, that's my guess. Or more. So, the way it works is uh it's not a normal restaurant. And so, you don't order the food. It's all pre-selected. And so, it's like uh it's like an assembly line. At the same time, all 1,00 guests get the exact same food. So, like there's a lot of like maybe potentially significantly more efficiencies than a normal restaurant because there's not like, you know, uh a whole menu uh of stuff to do. And get this, their performances, they only change their performances every 5 to seven years. So they spend a lot of time like making their performance and then everyone else just goes and learns it and they perfect it over the course of 5 to seven years. So they don't even change it that often and it takes like 200 performers for every show. Yeah, it's pretty rough for uh you know night performers, right? Cuz you have like the step down between Game of Thrones and the Medieval Times restaurant. It's so fast. Like the second place is is is pretty rough out there. Knight's got to do what Knight's got to do. So, this is hilarious because you were like you were like looking this up as an analog for Hampton. Are you thinking about getting in the turkey leg business? What's going on? Well, the way that we uh are going to grow is through launching cities and I'm like, you know, trying to study like how launches work, how do you have like general managers of each city, of each region? Do you I'm just trying to understand like the logistics of it and I'm looking at a variety of unrelated but still in the event space just to figure out how do they do it? How do people do it? And so I'm just looking at a ton of different ways and I was just curious about uh for some reason I came across these guys and I started thinking about it. I'm like, "Oh, they 10 locations. Are they franchises? How do they work?" And uh it just caught my eye and I was shocked at how big they were. Can I tell you a goofy story that's kind of similar to to what you just described? So I've been writing this book like on the side. I'm not sure if I'm I'm going to actually publish it or not. Like, but I kind of got I went down a rabbit hole. I got interested in it. And it was um it was around how uh creativity works. So, how people how to be more how to be a more creative person and ultimately like make hits. So, like where do the hits come from? What's the title? Uh bad art. Bad art. Okay. Yeah. So it's like because there's one of the key like obvious it sounds obvious in hindsight but like when you go look at the creative process of the world's most successful creative people you would think oh wow the ones who make the hits the things that we all love the high quality stuff they just nail quality and if you listen to any of their interviews you watch their process they don't give two shits about quality u directly what they do is they focus on quantity and their belief is basically that quantity is the only way to get to quality so they play a volume game and they're like, "We produce a lot of bad art and that's where the one or two things that are real gold come from. If you just sit down and try to make gold, it doesn't work. You you actually end up not creating at all." And so, one of the things I've been looking at is like how some of the big breakthroughs came from doing what you're talking about, which is like you learn from an adjacent space. So, you go and you you know, the Wright brothers who ended up creating the first airplane. Dude, George I I've read their book and they're amazing, but George Mack summarized their book amazingly in his high agency blog post. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And so they, you know, they were a they were not funded. They had no education. They had no team. They had no no specialty, no experience doing this, no nothing. And like meanwhile, there was a guy over there funded by the Smithsonian, had $2 million in funding, had tons of engineers and scientists on his team, had all the press, the fanfare. It was clear that he was going to be the win. He was the favorite. Uh so how did the underdog win? Why did the underdog have the creative breakthrough? And like one of the reasons why is the two brothers, the Wright brothers, they owned a bike shop. And so they they because they had no money, they did like 200 prototypes in the time that the other guy did two. And their 200 prototypes were basically like they weren't even didn't even look like planes. They were just testing like individual parts of a plane. Uh like they'd make a glider or a wing and then they would make the wheels and they would try to find different ways to test these things out. And even Kittyhawk even the selection of where to go they were like thought from first principles like where should we launch this thing like oh maybe we should launch it from this spot where we're going the best way that etc right so they they weren't like tied to anything that was like there was they were not tied to anything everything was first principles thinking and so similarly I don't know if you've heard this story about the uh the Yankees bats have you seen this uh you'll have to enlighten me but basically the bats are heavier in the area where the ball mostly hits. Is that right? Yeah. Like the story I mean uh take the physics of it aside like the story is just kind of interesting because here you have baseball this game that's been around for like I don't know 100 plus years or whatever. And then you know just kind of in a a bit of a high agency way the Yankees were like hey can we just make a better bat like within the rules of the bat like you know we're not going to make a heavier bat. We're not going to cheat. And they hired this MIT guy to think about it and he was like, "Oh yeah, you could just like move more of the barrel to this one sweet spot." And if you hit that, it's going to go way further, way harder. Um, and you you'll have less misses, uh, less near misses because you're going to have the thicker part of the bat right there and you'll have more barrels. And sure enough, the Yankees start the season off with like way more home runs than anybody else this year. I don't know anything about baseball, but is it statistically significant or do they just have ballers on their team this year? Is it like it is the bat? I think it's the bat. Um, but I don't know if it's statistically significant. I can't I don't know if you could say that, right? Cuz it was like they started talking about this when it when they like jumped out to a big lead in home runs, like 14 home runs already and it was like nobody else was even close. Like so we'll see, you know, we'll see if this this lands. But the important part cuz like who gives a [ __ ] about baseball? The important part was like, dude, if if baseball, this like hundred-y old sport that like, you know, people spend the teams spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year trying to like find any edge they can, if there's still like an edge like this to be found, it just proves how like so much of the world is like unoptimized and underthought about. And like if you actually just took a lot of focus and intensity to any one problem and you don't assume that people have already figured it out, that's, you know, one of the key things you need to have a breakthrough. And so like the way you're talking about studying these other models, um I think it's so important to do that. I remember when we did our our our restaurant, this is my first startup, but we did pretty much everything wrong. Like every now that I look back, I'm like, "Oh my god, so embarrassing." Every like the way we did our business plan, we wrote a 300page business plan. It's like, dude, now nowadays I write one page if if that. Um we literally printed out in a binder. We were so proud of it and we thought that that was like, you know, a mark of our brilliance when actually it was just a mark of our stupidity. um our marketing, you know, I used to just go door to door knocking on doors trying to sell sushi like an idiot. Like I didn't know anything about Facebook ads or Google ads. I didn't know anything about anything. But one smart thing we did was we were like we were a deliveryon restaurant. So today they call that cloud kitchens. Back then that didn't exist. Doortodoor sushi I think is the worst idea I've ever heard. Right. But I was like, "Oh, let's try it." Actually, by the way, who doesn't want to eat this at 10:30 when it's 95 degrees in Dallas? No. No, what we I did is I went door to door. Uh I went floor to floor. Really? I went into a skyscraper. I went I just went in the elevator. I pushed a button. 1 2 3 4 I get out and I just talked to the office manager of each floor. And if I could get her to cater the lunch, it was like getting 50 orders. And it actually actually worked pretty well. So that was kind of like a bit of a bit of example of this of ignorance is bliss. So the the other thing that we did was we looked at delivery. So traditional food delivery like you were talking about city to city expansion. We looked at how all the all the big restaurant chains did the delivery. And what they did was they would basically have a delivery driver at the restaurant kind of waiting and waiting for a batch of orders. So you would order, but they wouldn't just take your one order. They wait till there's like five or six orders to go, right? Cuz if I leave then with one order that's inefficient. So they would first wait for five or six orders. Then they would drive out. They'd go one place at a time trying to deliver these things and then they would drive back. And what I was so confused about, I was like, how is this restaurant that's one mile away? Why does delivery take 40 minutes? Like it just didn't make any sense. Like the route is like two minutes. So like how how is it possible that it takes 40 minutes for the order? And so I watched them and I studied them and we had our buddy Dan become one of them and it was like Dan, you you work for Noodles and Company now. You got to figure this out. You were doing the deal move before deal did it. You had a Yeah, we sent it We sent it a spy. Yeah. Let's be honest. All he came back with was just like, "Dude, don't eat the food at noodles company. There's so much salt." And we're like, "But what about the delivery?" He's like, "Oh, I didn't even get delivery. I got to sign soup. Signed tomato soup." He's like, "So much salt in this soup. It's insane." So, but we we figured out a breakthrough. The breakthrough was basically we realized that it was the slowest part of the delivery was not the drive. It was um the driver doing that last kind of not even last mile, like the last 200 ft to your door. So, like finding the exact house or or apartment and then you go there and you knock and you wait and then they come out and then whatever. That was the where the slow part was. And so what we did was in downtown Denver, we created something called the drop zone. So in between a whole bunch of skyscrapers, we just had one guy stand there. He was our delivery guy on the ground and then the driver just kept going back and forth dropping off orders to him non-stop. And this sped up delivery like crazy. And suddenly our delivery times were like 15 minutes, 16 minutes, 18 minutes. And we were just crushing everybody on delivery. And like the restaurant failed, but the learning of like you can't really take for granted that like everything's just figured out. And if you just do the first principles thinking of like you watch, you look for the slowest part, then you think, okay, what can we do? Even if it sounds a little weird that we're going to have a we're just going to put a dude there at the bottom and he's going to stand there holding the orders. The delivery guy is just a stationary dude. But that would eliminate all of the lag of the driver having to wait for that last, you know, to do all those last mile deliveries. That was the key uh for us I found when doing this there's a few hard parts like just doing the exercise. The hard part one is knowing what things to question and what things to accept. For example, uh let's say you're creating Tesla and you're like well an electric battery that that probably can go long enough like if I look at this the math behind it but they didn't like change the shape of the wheel. That's a very obvious one, but when you're running a company, it's very hard to decide what to question and what not to question. It's also incredibly challenging to get yourself into that mindset of first principles thinking and more challenging to convince your staff or your co-workers, whoever to just like come with like an open mind and and actually get on board and being open-minded to trying this exercise. I found that to be hard. What's hard about it? And then how did you try to tackle that? for example, just like the um people saying like, well, it it has to be this way for these reasons. And it's like you have to say to them, I know, but just like I know you think that, but just try to get beyond that just for a few minutes and let's just have a conversation where it doesn't happen that way. What would happen? There's this book called The Six Ways of Thinking for Design. I forget exactly. Uh do you know what I'm talking about that book? No, I haven't read that. Basically, it's like an exercise where there's six different colored hats and you're like, "All right, your green hat, when you put your green hat on, that means you're just thinking of profit." When you put your red hat on, that means you're going to come and be very pessimistic and poke poke holes and everything. Your black hat means you're open-minded. And so, it's this way of saying, "Right now, I'm going to put this hat on, which means I'm going to by default, I'm not going to hate on anything because a lot of people default to this is why you can't do it to I'm going to figure out all the reasons why this could work." Yes. Yeah. And so you did that. You tried that. Yeah. And it helps, but it's still I I guess what I'm saying is that No, I didn't have any hats. No, it helps, but there's still like it's still a challenge to get into that mindset, at least for me. And also to like convey that to teammates. It get an open mind and question everything is actually way harder to do than it sounds. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I found that people like it. Like so once you give people permission to do it, they actually get excited about it. Um, you're right that you have to sort of like frame it the right way. If you just go into a meeting and your hope and expectation is that people are going to be like open-minded and creative and come up with a novel solution. It's like not going to happen at all. Like you have to either tell a story at the beginning that gets them in the mindset. So, I've done that before. Which is basically the the Yankee bat thing. I mean, that was pretty good. Yeah. Like it'll be one like that or it'll be like I remember back in the day I watched this um thing on YouTube that was like really inspiring to me. I don't know if you ever seen it. It's the IDO grocery cart challenge. So IDO was just this design thinking lab this group. So companies go and pay them lots of money to come up with like novel innovative solutions and designs. So I think 60 Minutes or somebody went to them some TV show and they were like hey we want to understand how you guys think and so we have a challenge for you guys uh as part of the show and they were like we want you to redesign reimagine the grocery cart in a day. you have 24 hours, 40 hours to do this. And so they break up into two teams and they show their process of how they do it, right? And so like there's like a process of like fact gathering. So they first they go get a grocery cart, right? Or they go watch it in a grocery store. They want to see how the customer uses it. They don't want to take anything for granted. So they're like, "Oh, like certain set of customers actually use this as like a kid babysitter. It's like their kid sits inside it. They need a thing to play." And that's like a key part of this. Like if you lost the kid seat, you would lose that mom as a customer. um oh other people are loading up and they need the two racks and then you know so you're seeing how people use it then they were like cool you and you state those observations they put them on index cards you start throwing them on the wall and the guy sets the tone he's like we're in the diverge phase and basically he draws this little cone I don't know if you ever seen it's like a like a cone going out and he's basically during the diverge phase it's like whatever a predetermined set of time our team knows how to do this which is when you're super crazy wacky ideas free play what if mode and you don't judge the ideas during this phase. You're just trying to riff off riff as many ideas we can and then we're going to switch modes, switch hats and going to go to converge where we're basically ruthlessly narrowing down the set of possibilities of where we might go with this. Um, but we we distinctly have two phases because you don't want in one phase the one brave person to be courageous and throw out a halfbaked idea and then somebody immediately smart guy slam them and be like why that wouldn't work and now nobody wants to suggest ideas again for the rest of that hour. So you have to like really explicitly be like what you're allowed to say during this hour is only you know yes ands and then during this one it's a no but and then they end up with this redesigned grocery cart where it's like it was basically like I don't know you could look up the image of it online but it was like a a thing that was designed for uh a new type of grocery cart. And I thought about that. I was kind of inspired by that cuz a I just thought wow what a cool job these guys get to be creative for a living. The top this video is 15 years old and it says the top comment is they're still making us watch this for school by the way in 2024. Yeah, I I actually think there should be a Netflix show of this uh like you know you have Chopped where they give them a random basket of ingredients. You got to make a meal out of it. I I would love to see like two teams that are like, you know, engineer designer types and you basically give them like a challenge like redesign the grocery cart, like redesign uh make make the inside of an elevator more entertaining and just see what they do. Like I I would find that super fascinating as like a TV show. And I think it would inspire a lot of people to become like engineers or designers if you watch that. The same way like Shark Tank, although it's like totally like bogus in terms of like the entrepreneurship that they show, it's super accessible and it gets people excited about the idea of entrepreneurship. This book sounds pretty great. Bad art. It sounds it sounds like a pretty good idea. It's a great book. I'm excited about it. My my the only hesitation I had on it was like I feel like I already got a [ __ ] ton of value out of it doing the like research and the kind of the prep like of outlining, oh, here's the big ideas and crystallizing them in my mind. So, you're going to be like Derek from LA and you're going to just say, "F you, reader. I don't care about you." It's already Exactly. Do I need to go the extra mile of publishing it for other people to benefit? I'm not sure that I care about that. Like, I'm not going to I'm not going to make any money off this. I'm not trying to get famous off a book. What do I Why do I need to do that? So, I might publish it. The other problem is like I'm not sure how many other people nerd out about this idea of making great art, making making great products, just insanely great things and uh caring about being the like wanting to learn the creative process cuz you know what I what I figured out that I mean that's obviously foolish. What about that guy? Like that's a foolish Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You you you got you caught you caught me on the hook. Uh you got the compliments on the hook because what about that Austin guy like uh you know artist what was it called? Great artist steel. Is that Do I want to just be that Austin guy? You didn't even know it was the guy's last name. I know the book cover. What's Isn't it like a what's it called? Great artist steal. Yeah. Like I know that a lot of smart people whose books I read, they always say that that like we had u Jack Carr on the podcast. He wrote all these amazing fiction books I love and he talked about it. Ryan Holidayiday talked about it. Mark Manson, who I know you like, talked about that book. Everyone likes that book. That's the thing. It's a lot of author. Like I wrote this I wrote this thing cuz I was studying how to do this cuz I wanted to write a book. I didn't want to write the book about this, but that that's just where I landed. It's for sure super important for anybody who's like an author, screenwriter type of person. It's just that's such a small percentage of population that I'm not sure it's worth the pain of of uh publishing. But dude, if I don't know if you if the comments on YouTube persuade me enough, I might be open to publishing this. If Sahil Bloom can convince everyone on Twitter to share his book, you can too. what he's hilarious about Sil cuz Sil's great and Sil is such a achiever. He brought the PE energy to totally author PE he brought the the the Ivy League energy, right? He like PE he like achievered his way into Stanford, achievered his way to being a good athlete like a like a D1 athlete, achievered his way into private equity successfully, achievered his way into a six-pack, achievered like he just basically he's like, "All right, give me a target and like show me show me a ladder and I shall climb." And it was like when we were like, "Yo, you should do Twitter, dude. Like, your posts are kind of interesting. I think you could do this." He's like, "Cool. Monday through Friday, 6:00 a.m. get up, cold plunge, write thread, publish thread every day for the next 900 days straight." And he did. He got like a million followers. He achievered the [ __ ] out of Twitter, too. It's amazing. Yeah. And now you're going to have to do the same with bad art. As Elon once said when they asked him, "Are you afraid of failure?" He said, "It is not in my nature." That's how I feel about achievering. It is not in my nature to do this. Is that going to be that should be the reply to everything now? As the great Elon Musk has once said, "This is not in my nature." Dude, how sick is that phrase? How how how like timeless and alpha is that phrase? All right. Is that it? Are you going to go and enjoy the um enjoy the sand or doing whatever you do? Do you even leave your apartment when you're in Hawaii? Yeah, dude. I'm in the ocean. I'm in the I'm at the beach. I got kids, dude. They want to do everything. Are you going to wear Tweety the same day every day for six days straight? Like it's the same day, but they love it so much that I I can't help but love it, too. All right, that's it. That's the part. [Music]

He owes like 27 or $30 million. He was like, "I'm going to start this festival." And we were just like, "Maybe don't. I think you shouldn't do that. There's a lot of things you can do because you're famous, but Firefest 2, maybe you shouldn't do that." He's doing exactly that. Article came out today. Firefest 2 is off to a a rough start again. Allegedly taking place on an island off the coast of Mexico. local tourism board claims they have no knowledge of this event. For us, this is an event that does not exist. If you go to the uh location that they list in the middle of the ocean where there's no land, the most expensive tickets are $25,000. Yeah, it's not good. But hey, listen, I'm an optimist.

All right. Today I want to actually tell you a story. So there's a story called The Happiest Man in Atlantis. Have you heard it? Probably not because I wrote it this morning, but I want to read this to you. I think it's a good one. So let's try it [Music] out. All right. So once upon a time, there was a prince. And this prince was the richest man in Atlantis. He drank the finest wines. He wore the finest clothes. He slept with the finest women. He had servants attending to his every need. And yet the prince was unhappy. Every day he would wake up in the palace. The servants would bathe him and robe him and he would look out into the land and he would just feel empty and unhappy. And so one night the prince decided, "Enough of this. I'm leaving here. I'm running away." And he dresses up like a common man. He sneaks out of the castle. And along the way, as he's leaving the castle, trying to leave the royal palace, he uh stops at a bar and he's drinking his sorrows away. and he hears two sailors talking about somebody who they call the happiest man in Atlantis. They said that the man is very old and that he's supposed to die in 3 days. So the prince interrupts them right away. He says, "I need to meet this man before he dies." They said, "Well, you could try, but he lives far away. He lives in the cave near the cliffs. Um, he used to be a rich king, and now he's given it all up. He lives in this cave. So the prince decides, what do I have to lose? Just another day of elegant misery? No. packs a bag and he uh he grabs his backpack and he just decides, "Okay, I'm going to go." So, he gets to the cave and he says he meets the man and he says, "They call you the happiest man in Atlantis." And the man says, "Well, names are curious things. I've never claimed such a title, but it seems to have found me. What do you seek?" And the prince says, "Happiness. I have everything that a man wants, and yet I feel nothing but emptiness." The man says, "Uh, ah, I see you. You seek what cannot be bought, but is freely available to all, and I could teach you. It's actually very simple." He draws a triangle on the cave wall. He says, "Everything you need is in this triangle." And he says, "Okay, tell me." He says, "Come back tomorrow before sunrise and I'll tell you then." And the prince says, "Tomorrow? What? Can you just tell me now?" And the man says, "What kind of guru would I be? This is a story. I can't just tell you now. Come back tomorrow before sunrise." So the prince agrees and he decides to come back. So he comes back and he says, "Um, okay, I'm ready. Tell me, tell me what it is. What's the answer? Um, I want to be happy. I want the answer." And he says, "I could tell you, but you really wouldn't understand. So I will help you learn." And he says, "Okay." And then and the man gives him a coin, single gold coin, and he says, "I want you to go down to the market. Do you know that shop at the top of the market?" He says, "Yeah, it's the the one with all the finest antiques." He says, "Yes, go in there. I want you to find their finest golden cup and buy it with this coin." And he says, "One coin? I mean, that would cost thousands." He says, "Go buy it with one coin." So, the prince agrees and he goes down to the market and he goes to the shop and he takes the coin and he he picks up the cup and he says, "Um, I'd like to buy this." And they said, "Okay, sure." Uh, and he hands them one coin. They say, "Is this a joke? this cost thousands of coins. He says, "I'll take it for the coin. Can I buy it for this one coin?" And they say, "Get out of here." And they they shoe him away. He comes back to the cave and he's pissed. He said, "That was stupid. Um, were you just trying to embarrass me? That was impossible. Why did you do that?" He says, "Why was it impossible?" He says, "Because that cup is so valuable. Why would he give it me for to me for one coin? He won't just give away something valuable that's essentially free. And so the man asks him, "Let me ask you, how valuable is your happiness?" He says, "What do you mean?" He says, "How valuable is your happiness?" "It's the most valuable. It's priceless." He says, "Then why do you give it away for so cheap? A servant spills your wine and you trade it for a piece of your anger. A rival succeeds and you exchange it for envy. A storm delays your ship and you barter your joy for worry. these small inconveniences, the forgetful servant, the rainy day. You gladly hand over your happiness to the lowest bidder. The prince was upset, but he knew it was true. And the man goes up to the triangle and he adds one word. He writes the word focus. He said, "Today you learn to focus your attention on what matters." Because at any given time that the world is throwing a thousand things at you that you could choose to focus on. But choosing to focus on focus on what's valuable on what actually matters and not the small trivial inconveniences of your life is the first thing. It is robbing you of your happiness. The prince turns over the coin and he reads what's on the back of the coin. It turns out this wasn't just a normal gold coin and it says never trade what is precious for what is trivial. So the prince says, "Okay, I got it. What about the other two?" He says, "Come back tomorrow for number two." So he returns the second day and he says, "I'm ready. Tell me." And the man lays out two bowls, two clay bowls, and he fills them both with water. And so they're filled with water. And now he takes a pile of rocks that he has. And in the first bowl, he just splashes the rocks in, just dumps them in from a height. And it's splashing. The water is turbulent. It's spilling over the edges. And in the second he just takes it takes each rock puts it in the water gently and the water remains roughly calm. Small ripple but roughly calm and the prince is just watching this and he says did you notice? He says yeah of course. He says great today I want you to go to the market and for the first hour I want you to react like the first bowl. Really exaggerate it. Okay. So whenever anything happens to you I want you to react fully and violently just similar to that bowl. But when the lunch bell rings, I want you to mentally change your state and react like the second bull. Okay? So, he goes down to the market and sure enough, he's looking for uh for he's looking for a fight. Somebody bumps into him and he shs them. He curses at them and he's reacting to every little thing that every every person does. Somebody shortch changes him. Uh one of the merchant short changes him and he gets gets angry at him and and grabs his coins from him. But then the lunch bell rings and he remembers the second bowl and he changes his state of mind and um he waits for it. Sure enough, a boy comes and he steps on his foot basically smudges his shoe, spills his tea, but instead of reacting and shouting at the boy, he simply helps him to his feet, buys him a new tea. The boy smiles, thanks him, gives him a hug, and and carries on. It begins to rain, but instead of reacting to the rain, he simply sits under an awning and enjoys the pattern of the puddles that are being made. And then he goes back up to the cave and the man asks him, he says, 'Well, what did you learn and the prince says, "I saw that the world did not change, but I did. The first bowl, everything was a disturbance. And the second bowl, the events were simply events. They were neither good or bad until I made them." So the man says, "Yes, this is the second key. You learned to calm your state of mind. You became the second bowl because you cannot control the pebbles, but you can control the nature of your water. The calm bowl still feels the pebbles, but it does not allow a small disturbance to overtake its entire nature. And this is the difference between reacting and responding. And so he wrote on the wall the second word state. He said, "When you learn to manage your state, when you enter a situation, choose how you will feel. Because if you enter a situation optimistic and charming and playful and determined, you will make totally different choices than if you enter a room feeling tired and stressed or frustrated. You will make completely different decisions. And those decisions become your destiny. So control your state of mind and you will control your life. Come back tomorrow for challenge three. It's going to be the hardest one yet. So he comes back the next day and he's ready for challenge number three. But he says, "Before you come, make sure you bring all the gold in your vault." Just all the gold in your vault. I can't do that. This too much. He said, "Bring a thousand coins of gold." So the man goes back and he drags a thousand coins of gold to the cave. He's like, "Oh, you're one of those kind of gurus, huh?" And uh the guru laughs and he says, "Okay, I will take the coins uh in exchange for the stone." And he hands him this small stone that looks, you know, average. And the prince says, "Is is this a joke? I'm not buying this stone for a thousand gold coins." He says, "Really? Because this stone was given to me by your father. Your father who died when you were young, he came to visit me at the cave as well before he died." And he told me, he said, "One day, I hope this never happens, but if my son ever comes to give him this stone," he says, "Is that true?" He said, "It's true." And he said, "So this stone might look worthless to others, but to you, I'm assuming it it means something." He says, "It does." And he agrees to trade him the the gold for the stone. He says, "No, no, no. I don't need your gold. I'm dying tomorrow." But you can see you've learned the third lesson, which is the power of a story. And he goes to the triangle and he writes the word story. He said, "You see, a story can make a stone precious or or worthless. A story can change a punishment into a blessing. It could take a disaster and turn it into a triumph. And um the world is simply full of events that are really meaningless until you choose to give them a label. You choose to give them a meaning. It is the story you apply to something that gives it its weight and worth in your life. It gives it the meaning in your life. And he says these three together that I have showed you. Your focus will determine what you see. Your state will determine how you feel and the story determines what it means. You master these three and you've mastered the art of living. And the prince understood. The prince gets up. He thanks him. And the man says, "You know, you came to find the happiest man in Atlantis. Did you find him?" And the prince laughs. He says, "I did not find him, but I became him." Hey, let's take a quick break, but instead of an ad, I have a freebie for you. Uh, it is my pitch deck template. So, if you're a founder and you're ever looking to raise money from investors, the reality is most founders are pretty bad at telling their own story. Their decks are bad. I've seen thousands of decks. I can tell you that most decks don't do the business justice. And so, I actually made a template of what I use for my own companies. I've given this out before in my newsletter. Thousands of people have downloaded it and I get emails all the time saying, "Hey, thanks for that template. I used it. I raised my round." So, it's a freebie. If you want to ever raise money from investors, go grab it. There's a link in the description below. And it just tells you like slide by slide like put this here, put this here, put this here with a little bit of commentary of why you're arranging the structure in that order. I think it will raise your odds of successfully raising a funding round. So go ahead and grab it. It's my free pitch deck template. All right, I hope you enjoyed my story. I had fun writing it and I hope you had fun listening to it. Maybe you learned a little thing or two. Maybe you like the prince can learn to either up your level of focus, focusing on what is what is truly valuable, not the trivial state. So choosing how you step into a situation which will change the way you respond and those decisions become your destiny. And lastly the story. So the the labels you put on things. You broke up with your boyfriend. Is that the end or is it the beginning of something? Right? You get to decide. That meaning is up to you. And that meaning will totally change how you uh how you approach the next situation in your life. So hope you enjoyed this story. Uh I'm Sean. Thanks for thanks for listening. Oh, and by the way, if you're here right now, I don't know when you're listening to this, but April 16th, I'm doing something fun. You should check it out. I'm doing a CEO boot camp for um for anybody. It's free, totally free. You can come and I'm basically going to share my method of running companies uh that is very similar to what what uh in YC they're calling founder mode. And I want to explain what I think founder mode is and how you actually do it. Um it's going to be pretty awesome. April 16th, you can find the link in the description below. Thank you for listening.

The New York Times is a games company. The the numbers behind the New York Times and their gaming products is pretty amazing. And what's their revenue on that? Take a guess. $100 million. Just in Q4, their digital only subscribers was $289 million, which is all it's a little bit of their cooking product as well, but it's like mostly their games revenue. Gaming basically has pushed their annual subscriptions over a billion dollars a year for the first time ever. Few years ago, games was roughly 15% of time spent. Now, it's over 50% of the time spent is on the games product. It has overtaken news. And what's cool about it is almost every game on my phone is just trying to like how do I take all of your time and all of your money? And the New York Times thing works way different. It's you have one a day. There's one mini cross word a day, one cross word a day, one word a day. Should we just start calling the New York Times a gaming company? Yeah, exactly.

This Tik Tok thing really does seem to be the best opportunity to go from like no net worth to like 1 to 5 million with no skills, no background, no tech. Shop so beautiful because the model itself incentivizes it without us having to change hands. How much does like the most successful creators make per month? What do you think? I've heard there's like 20-year-olds that are able to make 100 grand a month. Yeah. And the important part is these are not influencers. Show me a video. I think this video had made this kid close to $50,000. Just got into office one day ago and is already going after one of the most He's riding the news trend. Trump. He's taking a video of like an Android phone. You don't think this is an advertisement. Got Dana White. More social proof. Antimicrobial. You get the idea. And then he still hasn't sold you. I've been taking two of these pearls and it knocks that right out. The only bad thing about this product is how fast they sell out, especially around this season. See that orange cart right there? That means they are still in stock and the flash sale is still live. That's a masterful Tik Tok shop

My First Million is a HubSpot Original Podcast // Brought to you by HubSpot Media // Production by Arie Desormeaux // Editing by Ezra Bakker Trupiano

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
That episode was a whirlwind. Yeah, we just recorded with our buddy Will O'Brien. This episode was like my favorite conversations living in San Francisco where you run into a weirdo who knows a lot about something you know very little about and like 45 minutes your mind gets blown like five times and you just get smarter. So, this is a get smarter episode for me. And it wasn't just about like the business and the ideas that he talked about, but the mindset and how he thought about just like the philosophy of life that I was inspired by. Yeah, exactly. So, okay, what are we talking about? We're talking about how the ocean is the new space. Uh how there's companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin, all these companies that are doing cool [ __ ] in space. He knows a lot about companies that are doing cool things in the ocean, which is something I honestly didn't know anything about going in. Now I'm pretty fascinated with. But then we talked about the conversation toward the end gets really fun. Conspiracy theories, why conspiracy theorists make for great founders, his summer living with monks in Nepal, and what he took out of that. It was the end is really good. So get there to the end. and I promise you, you will enjoy this [Music] episode. All right, what's up? We got our friend Will O'Brien here. And Will is an Irish guy who talks my ear off about the ocean. And I honestly wasn't thinking about the ocean at all until I saw maybe a tweet of yours which was basically saying the ocean is the new space and how there's companies like SpaceX and others that have built huge hundred billion dollar plus companies about exploring space about putting satellites in space about reusable rockets and that there's an opportunity for a similar wave of uh of disruption for startups in the ocean. And I love that idea. I honestly I'm never going to do it. So, I'll just put that up front. I'm never going to do something like that. I think 99.9% of people listening to this will also never go do that thing. But just from a I don't know, just as a fan of the game, just as a founder, I kind of love the the theory and the the intellectual idea here of what is the opportunity. And then if you're one of the rare few hardcore founders that can go do this, you know, this is going to be right up your alley. So, that's my interest in it. Sam, I'm curious from your perspective. Are you the same as me? Dude, I won't even go on a cruise ship. Like, like I was at a party the other day and the the the uh like oneliner or the icebreaker was what? Something you're deathly afraid of. To me, it's being in the ocean to where I can't see land. So, like I'm not even going to be out there. But yeah, I I agree with your premise. And uh will did I kind of frame your argument right as to like the potential that you see as far as you know the business opportunity of of building startups that are are focused on on the ocean? Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Um yeah I think like yeah the framing is like you know something like this. It's like you know you know everyone is like here standing on earth like looking looking towards um the stars and and absolutely we we you know we should be doing that and we should be going like you know full pelt with like trying to go interplanetary trying to put a base on the moon and take you know take the take the dark side of the moon and then you know go uh from there and use that as a line going to go to Mars and we should be trying to fly supersonic as well. But then look, if you're if you're trying to build a startup, like you're always asking yourself like where, you know, what is everyone else looking to do? And like what where where is everyone else going and where is like underrated? And I suppose uh you know, I grew up by by the seaside in like the in the in the southwest of Ireland. I've always been obsessed with the ocean if I wasn't like on it in it or near it growing up. Um you know, there was there was there was something something wrong in the same way that you're you're afraid some of it. Um, yeah, I'm I'm kind of like when I'm when I'm away from it, I I feel something wrong with me. And um, so I've always been been thinking about it. And I mean, if you just like look at it in like, you know, fundamental terms, like the ocean economy right now is like already massive. It's not like, you know, the future space economy is going to be massive. Like the the ocean economy is massive. It's like $3 trillion in like annual spend in different ways, right? It covers like 70% of the planet. Three billion people rely on it as their primary source of food. a billion as their as their primary source of income. And then you know while we have like you know robots on Mars and you know these like lowcost drones going in our skies um the technology like in our oceans like still pales in comparison like you know you look at like the ships that are out there today like much of the technology is like very same and similar to like what we had years ago. The unmanned you know underwater drones um are like you know pretty much like the same as well there. um like the the kind of key core technology stack supporting like the the key pillars of the ocean whether it be transport, fisheries, defense, energy, um you know, biodiversity, all these areas. It's just like it's the same old like stagnant incumbents, large scale incumbents offering solutions that, you know, are running on like ancient software and there's just like very little innovation going on there. It's like, you know, you you you ask someone like what is like a sexy ocean startup and it's like they're kind of scratching their heads for a bit, you know, whereas you ask them about space, it's like SpaceX straight away. It's like you know it straight away. It's like you ask them about aerospace, it's like ah boom. Um so yeah, this is like the kind of like the the core of the thesis. Sean, you just wound them up really easily. This is going to be one of the this is going to be one of those podcasts that we've had uh we've only had maybe five of them ever where at the end of the hour we are like we're no longer podcasting. We're getting into the ocean business. Yeah. Like I I Let's go. So Sam, he's just said a bunch of stats. So which of those surprised you? So I'm just going to rattle a couple back. He said, "All right, this one probably doesn't surprise you. 70% of the earth is covered in in water. I think only 25% has ever been explored." He said, "A billion people rely on uh the ocean for their primary source of income. Three billion as their diet." Explain that. What What's the diet and the jobs one of the income one? Oh, it's just like people like you know most of um I mean the human societies generally settle along coastlines like this is like a very like common trend. Um yeah, but I'm in New York but I don't eat fish every day. Yeah, but in developed countries it's not as you we've developed logistics which means you can go down the street and walk into some sushi bar and get like you know blue fin tuna probably flew in last night from Japan. However, if you are in um you know Mogadishu or like Somalia or something like that this might be a bit more difficult because the systems are not set up. So um and it's important to remember most of the world does not live um in you know you know developed countries. So um yeah mo most humans just live along a coastline um naturally then easiest for source of food for them to get is um is uh fish. All right. So what were some other stats Sean that caught your eye? Uh a billion people rely on it for their income. So what are the jobs that you're talking about here? So you're talking about fisheries, shipping, is it like defense? It's like what is that the are those the big three or am I missing something big and obvious? The the framing for me how I think about like the ocean economy is like uh you you generally kind of break it up into like three categories, right? Like you have like the biosphere, right? Which is like your fisheries, it's your like ecosystem restoration, it's like your environmental mapping, it's um science and the ocean. It's like all around like biosphere management. Then you have like you know the kind of prosperity oriented part around it. This is like the kind of commercial. So this is like your energies, your infrastructures, your oil and gas, um it's your like data infrastructure, uh you know these sorts of things. It's your like logistics, shipping, and then you have like uh you know keeping this the seas safe, which is like defense, defense and security, border security, critical infrastructure protection, deploying ships in the South China Sea, these sorts of things. All right. A few episodes ago, I talked about something and I got thousands of messages asking me to go deeper and to explain and that's what I'm about to do. So, I told you guys how I use chat GBT as a life coach or a thought partner. And what I did was I uploaded all types of amazing information. So, I uploaded my personal finances, my net worth, my goals, different books that I like, issues going on in my personal life and businesses. I uploaded so much information. And so the output is that I have this GPT that I can ask questions that I'm having issues with in my life like how should I respond to this email? What's the right decision knowing that you know my goals for the future? Things like that. And so I worked with HubSpot to put together a step-by-step process showing the audience, showing you the software that I use to make this the information that I had chat GBT ask me all this stuff. So it's super easy for you to use. And like I said, I use this like 10 or 20 times a day. It's literally changed my life. And so if you want that, it's free. There's a link below. Just click it, enter your email, and we will send you everything you need to know to set this up in just about 20 minutes, and I'll show you how I use it again, 10 to 20 times a day. Um, all right. So, check it out. The link is below in the description. Back to the episode. And so, give me an example of a startup today that's doing really well as based on this kind of ocean economy that you're talking about. Yeah, I mean um there's, you know, a lot of these kind of like, you know, legacy players and like ship building and like unmanned systems and these sorts of things. I think one player that's like interesting in the unmanned systems place that's been around for for a long time um I think over a decade now um and was really kind of one of the first players to start doing interesting new things in the ocean is sail drone. What problem are they solving? What does sail drone do? Um I suppose they are uh solving the kind of data gathering at scale um in in in the ocean problem. They build these like uh autonomous sailboats, these huge vessels. They look amazing. They look awesome. They they build these like huge vessels that these massive sailboats that can basically stay out sea for many many months at a time. You can put a load of, you know, fancy sensors on them, you know, that can take data from the water that can, you know, gather video footage at the surface and these sorts of things and then relay them back to uh someone like in the United States. It might be like a state a government agency like Noah who want to know how much fish is in the in the al in the Alaskan in the seas off Alaska. They could sell it to the US Navy to know uh you know how deep is the waters in and around Guam or something like that. Um and then they yeah they sell these things as a service. Um but you know there was a very interesting founder there. Uh you know seems like a super sharp guy who's been obsessed with sailing uh for decades. Again like a lot of these ocean founders you see they're very very obsessed with the ocean. It's the very thing people very often get obsessed about and then try to make a business out of it. What's your what's your business do? Will Ulysus Ulysis or Ulysus? How do you say? Yeah. Yeah. Ulysis Ulysis. We're building um a general purpose autonomy platform for for maritime operations. Say that like we're stupid. Just like just pretend pretend that we're stupid. Yeah. Yeah. I know it's hard to believe, but just go ahead and dump that down for me. Autonomous robots for the ocean to do to do important things. Okay. And what's one important thing that you would do? You would uh like for example, you would go to a pipe in the ocean and determine if it's got a hole in it. That that is something you could do. I our first um our first business line has been in this um working with this weird plant that you've probably never heard of. Uh there's this there's this plant in the ocean uh that's probably about 10 times more abundant than uh coral reefs. It is 35 times better than rainforest at removing carbon. It supports about uh it holds about 20% of the carbon in the ocean. Supports about a quarter of the world's most critically important fish stocks. Um and it's called seaggrass. It's basically just grass in the ocean. And this plant is dying off at an insane rate all around the world. about 7% loss peranom. If you follow these trends, we lose all our 7% a year of this thing is going away. Okay. And why why is it dying? Is it cuz pollution or what's the cause? Yeah, there's like a few um there's a few few things. I mean, water quality is like a very common uh you know cause for loss. Uh other things are just like construction, construction um around like coastlines, digging it up, dredging, uh you know, changing uh ocean temperatures, uh changing like ocean currents, these sorts of things impact it. And uh and and and basically, you know, the the kind of context there is there's a lot of governments in around all over the world like really really panicking around this like if they lose their seagrasses, they lose their fish stocks. if they lose their fish tax. You have the 1 billion people who rely on it and 3 billion people who um you know rely on it for food and and the billion people for income and you know they're they're in a they're in a tough situation and basically restoring it um i.e. bringing it back uh is currently a very manual process. And how and how are you guys doing that? We're we build autonomous robots to do it. And you're actually building the robots yourself or when you said you're building a platform, I thought that meant you're allowing other people to build it and use your technology to like track them. Yeah. So for this first use case, we've built we've built a kind of custom robotic payload, you know, like when you're when you're starting and trying to do something new, it's kind of important to to kind of get, you know, initial traction in a weird place. And I think if we just built something and hoped that people would use it for for something if we just built the platform which is like an underwater vehicle and a surface vehicle that that that dock together, you know, we might have trouble getting traction. But we started off with this initial use case. We we basically built these like attachments that go onto our underwater vehicle that do collecting seeds, planting seeds, measuring their growth um to kind of get this initial traction. So you know in our first year we did um a million dollars in in revenue just kind of like you know f first first year five person team based here in San Francisco. Why would someone pay you to do this? So the reason people pay us is because it's you know it's a critically important like ocean ecosystem that you know if lost has these like very negative downstream impacts. Um that's like you know one reason. Another reason is like lots of governments now around the world have implemented laws that restrict uh your ability to damage this plant if or if you damage it, you have to pay someone to plant it. Uh so they're paying us to plant it. It's compliance driven restoration. Uh so that's the kind of cont we have contract in Western Australia, we have a contract in Florida, we have a contract in Virginia. Um and they're all kind of for like these general reasons, either compliance driven restoration or voluntary restorations. Sam, I put uh how important is seaggrass into chat GPT? Here's what it said. Seagrass is wildly important to the world and then it basically says it captures carbon 35 times faster than rainforest, which I think he said. And then it says it's like a baby crib for the ocean. The seaggrass basically is where small fish, crabs, seahorses, and even endangered uh species and turtles um they're born and they live early on in their life. And if lost then you would uh entire it says lose the seaggrass and entire marine ecosystems collapse. Yeah. Well, what's crazy is you Okay. The mission check like on board. Amazing. You kind of skipped the headline. Sean, did we He he built a robotics business that in the first year you've only I think I think you said you only raised $2 million or something like that. So with only two million in funding in your first 18 months of business, you did a million in revenue. Is that right? Yeah. And just five people as well. Is there something new about building like a robotics company today that lets you do it way cheaper? Like did something change like oh we all use whatever you know it's like when the Raspberry Pi came out then it's like oh we can now have this little computer for 35 bucks or whatever. Uh is there something that does that's made it a lot cheaper or maybe just there's more talent. What's changed? 3D printers has been huge. Like that's just like a game changer. It means just like the speed of iteration has gone up massively. It's, you know, it's easier now to get parts overnight as well and just like get like sheet metal sheet metal cut and the cost of a lot of things uh has gone down like massively as well like with like the advent of like electric vehicles, batteries kind of went down massively and a lot of electronic components with drones uh like motors went down massively in cost. uh you know for us as well like a critical enabler of what we do right is Starlink uh because you know the way our system works is like we have this like autonomous boat it's like a surface vehicle this is like our mother ship and then we have a docking system that releases these uh these daughter um robots these like uh uh autonomous underwater vehicles to do the actual critical activity in the ocean that you want to do and uh you know we wouldn't be able to communicate with these assets without something like Starlink you had before but like the bandwidth on that wasn't that strong. Um, so you have like other like kind of wine now uh features like that. And that company you were talking about, Sale Drone, they've raised like over $und00 million. It looks like they're valued $500 to a billion dollars. That's that's interesting. There's another one called Seronic. Sam, do you know Seronic? No. How do you spell it? S A R O N I C. And Will, you probably know a little bit more about this company than me. I think this Joe Londale seated this company, right? Yes. Yeah. God, this looks sick as well. So, like when we had Joe on the podcast and I was at his house, he was telling me about this company, should have just invested on the spot, but he was basically like we're we're building drone like drones for the water and you know, drones in the for defense just like Andre is doing it for the sky and and you know, modern warfare has turned into to drone base. They're building these unmanned surface vehicles, USVS for the ocean. And they talked about how did you know this like the US Navy Sam just take a guess how many ships are in the US Navy fleet just what's a number oh I don't know 500 what I it's hard to even say 100 okay you're a lot closer than I thought I would have guessed that we have thousands of ships we have 300 ships in the Navy is a ship considered like an aircraft carrier because those are huge right those are like cities sure but oh my god but only 300 that's just like a very small number to And we have 67 submarines. That's it. 67. Dude, I had more kids at my three-year-old's birthday party. Like, that's insane to me. So, we got 300 ships or whatever. And basically, every ship is like uh I don't know the exact cost of it, but let me let me pull I think they're like, well, correct me if I'm wrong, but like the average cost of these is something like or maybe it's the average cost of these contracts like $250 million every time you get contract to do one of these. And so you're a startup like Seronic and you're like all you have to do is basically say all right we're going to come in we're going to build the most innovative autonomous vehicles here and we're going to operate. You know what Anderil did was was remarkable. So what Andrew did was in Silicon Valley the smartest tech people nobody was working on defense. Google had famously shut down its defense project and defense was taboo. Like you're going to make weapons. That was not cool at the time. And it was there was basically zero uh zero weapons startups in San Francisco. And what they did was they said, "We're going to do this. We're going to use the Silicon Valley method in talent to do this. We're going to change the cost structure." So all the big defense primes were operating on what's called cost plus model. And so their incentive really was to have really high cost um operations because they were making 10% on top of whatever the cost was, right? So the incentive model sort of screwed up. And that's how you get, you know, a single airplane that's like a billion dollars or something like that to to get made. And so it was costing the government a lot. These guys had no incentive to innovate, no incentive to cut costs. And they were using talent that was not the smartest engineering talent in the world, which was all centered in Silicon Valley. And then Andrew comes out, Paul Mali and um Trey and others, they basically came out and what they said was u we believe this is important. We believe that America needs this and we believe we should put the best talent in the world on this problem. and they've built now a 20 to30 billion dollar company doing this. And the reason I find this exciting is that um I love these huge opportunities that are hidden in plain sight. I talked to a friend recently who knew Elon and I said, "What was Elon like? Were you impressed with Elon?" He goes, "I was impressed with Elon, but not cuz he was the smartest guy in the room." You know, we would be at a party, there's 20 people. You couldn't say, "Oh my god, that's the guy." He goes, "But the thing that Elon did better than everybody else was that Elon looked down at the ground and saw a trillion dollar opportunity that was just sitting there." You know, before Elon, it's not like there were a bunch of people trying to build uh, you know, rocket companies or electric car companies. It wasn't like they were trying and failed and he succeeded. They weren't even trying. And he goes, "The beautiful part about Elon is that he saw those and he didn't ignore it like the rest of us." Any that that idea of let's go to Mars was there. It was available to all of us. and we were all blind to it. And so similarly, I think Anderil did that in the defense space. And now it looks like Seronic is basically doing that in the um the sort of ocean defense space where um you know, you have this combination of get elite talent at robotics and AI and autonomy and you pair it with this old industry and I think you have a pretty um unique window to build a very big company doing this. Yeah. like they're they're building um I I I think of it like they're building the Humvees and we're building the Toyota Hiluxes, right? Like they're building like these like ultraast like defense focused like vehicles and and like they're you know going to make the South China Sea a hellscape and make China not want to cross that um that that that ocean and keep Taiwan safe if they keep going on the path they're doing and they're doing like an incredible job at that. Uh, and then we have like we occupy like a different niche like we're like we just want like every single like you know day-to-day task that is like done at sea want we want it done like on our platform and so like we want like all the servicing done by like Ulyses platforms and these sorts of things. There's like a lot of things that are making the ocean like very important in this century more than previous ones. Like warfare is a good example. Like every other single war we've fought in the last like three decades until now has been like in a desert. Right now we're going to the ocean. that requires a complete retooling of the military. Um, you know, and just even how we think about warfare just needs fundamentally needs to change. Like the climate question is ultimately an ocean question. Like the ocean is like the world's largest natural carbon sink. It is like where most of the life on earth lives. Um, it is uh, you know, one of our biggest sources of like food. Um, in a world where like a population is growing and food scarcity is always a question. Um there's you know even just like you look at AI right like the data infrastructure build out for AI is going to be like enormous right and basically that's going to require more data infrastructure i.e like cables connecting different parts of the world, transmitting data. Um, we're going to need more data centers. We're going to need more energy. These are all things like we're already putting and testing putting data centers in the ocean. The cooling costs go down massively. They become like more efficient. So, well, let's let's go back. So, there's there's already pipes under the ocean that basically like internet pipes under the ocean, correct? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean most of the most of the the information that tried our our internet connection now is mo most of that is like traveling through um is traveling underground and who built that is that the government built that or Google built that who who put that who put those pipes in the ocean to do that. So a lot of the initial infrastructure build out for for for it in the ocean um came from telecom's companies actually. Yeah. Like in the 80s Sean there's a handful of telecom companies that were startups and they are some of the fastest growing companies in the world. So like imagine the AI companies today that are scaling to 100 million in revenue in uh a year. That was what they did they die or what happened there? A lot of them are still running and then there was some of the you know if you look at like one of the biggest frauds on earth uh like it's like Bernie Maidoff and then like the third one is actually one of these telecom companies that was laying pipes in the in the in the ocean. But a lot of them are still around. They're just like small B they're not small but they're B2B companies that you wouldn't even know but they can be like a10 billion dollar a year company but in the 80s right well maybe I don't know if you know this if I but in the 80s that was like the the birth of a lot of this wasn't it yeah yeah yeah massively and and and now you're seeing a transition to the buildout being coming from fang from like big tech uh and soon I think it'll be like the the AI companies so what you're saying will now is that AI companies need these data centers just a you know huge amounts of GPUs in a data center and those data centers need cooling, they need power, they need tons of things and they need to ideally they need to be close to places where people are using it and what you're saying is that somebody's going to build a data center in the ocean or people are already building data centers in the ocean and what who's doing that or or is this a future idea and why are they doing that? Why is that a good idea? Yeah. So I think um the first experiment of this was a Microsoft Microsoft project. They did it. Um there's a YC startup as well run by uh friends of mine uh Sam Mandel. Uh he's got a company called Network Ocean. They're building and operating starting to building and operate these things. Are they actually underwater or are they on top of the water just out in the ocean? The plan is for it to be subc. Um, and again like these are the sorts of businesses that like Ulyses we want to be the kind of servicing partner for in the future when they need maintenance, when they need like inspections done, when they like it's like us they're coming to and we're selling them like a kind of in the box solution to I think the the biggest opportunity in this like you know paradigm in the future where more and more data cables are being laid subc is actually in the protection of them. Right? So, I don't know if you guys are familiar what's going on in like the Baltic Sea and places, but like I think in the last year about 11 cables have been cut by foreign actors. And like, you know, basically the kind of And these cables, by the way, they're like it's like a humansized tunnel, right? Are they on the ocean floor or are they like floating in the ocean if you're like to say cable, we're not talking like a like a rope that you're pulling. It's like a it's like a tunnel, right? Yeah. And and like Okay. Like literally the the like the Chinese are literally publicly advertising these cutters that they have these cable cutters, right? They're literally putting in the South China Morning Press, China unveils powerful deep sea cable cutter could reset the world order. They're not even they're not even [ __ ] hiding this. Like they're they're cutting the cables. They're like like yeah, we're just look how big our cable cutter is. Like this is just like the new parad. And then like, you know, they send these like little like uh, you know, Taiwanese ships into the or these Chinese ships into the Baltic Sea on like fishing missions, right? Like what the hell are they doing in the Baltic Sea on fishing missions? Like they're clearly just cutting cables and then like 2 days later, oh, cable cut. I want Dude, calling calling this a cable cutter is like calling a robo a ship. You know what I mean? Like maybe technically it's it's correct, but they need to rebrand this because what you're showing us is basically a like a huge submarine. You know, like I'm thinking of like a clip. It's not scissors. Yeah. This is insane. So, they're going down and they're cutting this. And what does that do? Like uh does a country lose internet or is it just like I mean damage. Okay, I'll give you this vision, right? So, these cables run between like military bases as well, right? And okay, let's say there's like a hot war breaks out in like the South China Sea, right? First target then is going to be like a military base in like the Pacific somewhere like Guam, right? What if you if you want to like completely scramble what you know their understanding of and situation awareness of what is going on, you are going to be laying sending these subc drones down there to go and cut the cables that is giving them like comms that's giving them energy and you're going to be like scrambling their airwaves with like you know um electromagnetic interference and that's how you're going to like just completely prevent like American military responses in in the Pacific, right? But how many how many cables like we're you're talking about two dummies. How many cables does America rely on? There's there's like not actually that many, right? Like as in like there there's like an insane amount of data that goes over them, but there's only about like 600 active. I'm so impressed that you knew that number. That's insane to me. So there's not a lot of redundancy you're saying. No, no, not at all. Like they're they're very difficult to lay, right? Uh and you need to respond quickly. Uh so yeah, like I mean there's like many critical things that rely on them, but like yeah, you're you're way better off defending them with unmanned water drones than trying to lay backup pipes down there and leave them undefended. be persistently out at sea like century style in the same way that like Andre like have the you know started with these like border um you know systems to like see what was coming in and over like the land border like we need the exact same type of systems out at sea like permanently just sitting there on top of them. Um they need to be cheap so that you can deploy them massively at scale. Um you know you can't have the ocean is huge so they need to be cheap to be scalable. Um, you need to be able to see what's going on at the surface and you need people say see what's going on subsurface and and funly that's like the platform that that we've developed. We have this like surface vehicle with a docking system. They can drop it an underwater vehicle and we've made it like all about 10 times cheaper than anyone else. So like that's you know seas is like a nice place where we started. Um, how how deep do your vehicles go? Do they go to like the bottom of the ocean where these pipes are? So for the Baltic Sea, I mean it's one of the shallower seas and this is like a major the major kind of like um you know uh activity area of activity where this is going right now. Um so our our vehicle works in that sea uh you know at all depth wells in that sea. So for the Baltic Sea part of it, it is uh it works. When you get into like gnarlier parts of the ocean like some of the Pacific where you're getting down to like 8,000 mters, right? Like Mount Everest, you know, levels of depth. We can't go there yet. Um it just starts getting difficult but like yeah we will be adding future vehicles to the fleet that can that can How old are you will? I'm 27. Sean so when you and I moved to San Francisco in well I moved there in 12 and we're about the same age. It was the sharing economy. That was the thing. So it was Airbnb and Uber andyft were the winners and then there was a bunch of derivative things like Airbnb for garages or or you know or for storage. A few years later it was AI or crypto. So like Bitcoin and Coinbase were winners and there's a bunch of like silly things. Uh right now this is so strange to me. It's AI but it's also will it's whatever category you guys would go in. You're not quite defense tech but it's like wild to me that this shift has happened because 10 years ago I would have told you like you know that was when boom supersonic was starting and a few other things. I was said this is this is foolish. What are you guys doing? We're technology this is a technology city. Why don't you do like software? It's to hear you say this it's so foreign to me. It's also so interesting like for me it's like a no-brainer. I mean like uh you know the lowhanging fruit of software has been eaten, right? You guys like you know it's like um we ate it a step like like how many more CRMs are there? Yeah, exactly. The boomers got cheap real estate, you guys got like B2B staff, right? Like it's like that's like and now it's like on us to do like something where like the next frontier is which is like fundamentally hardware and then like also it's like it's like a no-brainer. You look at like the top 10 most valuable uh companies in the world right now, it's like seven out of 10 of them have like a hardware like an extreme like hardware component, right? Like the biggest companies being built today are hardware companies. And also in a world where you can just like vibe code overnight like a CRM or a Salesforce or not Salesforce but like a Calendarly competitor. It's like okay well is there really a mode in like these sorts of things anymore? It's like Yeah, you're right. You're absolutely right. And I think it's so fascinating because if so when Sean and I lived in San Francisco, if if someone who looked like you, so you look, you're wearing a Ford Broncos shirt. I bet you you're wearing cowboy boots and you got a little bit of swag to you and you like if you were to if you were to talk about what you're talking about, it would have been like you're you're so out of touch. You're out of touch for the for the for the YC group of out of touch people. Like it's just so interesting to me and I think it's great. So there's a u I did a podcast with James Krueger and he has this thing about technology windows. Sam, did you ever see this part? No. Technology windows. So he basically says, "All right, there's a reason there's a there's a almost like a scientific reason why why you just described happens happens." And so he basically says like when a wave of startups comes out, it's because of a technology change. So you know, for example, an inflection. So when we you right when we first moved to San Francisco I moved in 2012 and the mobile window was open and that's when Instagram, Uber, Snapchat like a bunch of companies got built that relied on you having a computer with you at all times that had internet connection that had an accelerometer that had a map uh GPS uh feature in it and then all these companies could get built. But that window opens for a very like a a fixed amount of time and basically like he said the lowhanging fruit all gets eaten. And so he he went back all the way to the railroads and he's like the railroad technology window was open for 40 years. And like if you just look there was not another successful railroad company after that 40-year period. And um because all the opportunities basically got eaten. Automobiles was 25 years. And so in a 25-y year window you got Buick, Dodge, Ford, Cadillac, GM, Chevrolet, Lincoln, Chrysler, all of it within a very short window. And then you had nothing for another about 80 years. And then the window reopened because of battery technology and you got Tesla and Rivian. And so that was a almost a new technology window around automobiles because the tech had changed again around batteries. And so he was basically saying like B2B SAS has had a 20-year window and now AI software AI starting in 2016 and that's like the current window that we're in. And I would say, you know, what will is doing and what a lot of smart entrepreneurs are doing right now is they're in the technology window of AI, robotics, and 3D printing. And basically, those three technologies have have opened up the door to build new things that couldn't have been built 10, 15, 20 years ago. So, this is what a technology looks like. Just check this out. If you're on if you're on audio, you have to be on YouTube to see this, but I'm I'm sharing my screen here. So it basically says like step one the techn is invented and only the hobbyists are playing with it out of interest and creativity right and then two is the status moment one of the hobbyists achieves status and wealth using the tech. So you know for example so this is like you know Mark Andre on the on the cover of time barefoot because the hobbyist internet guy became rich by building you know the browser and then this happened again with social networking. This happened again with um uh with Elon and Palmer Lucky and all those guys right now who who've had their status moment where you know Palmer was like literally like living in a RV building VR headsets for like 90 bucks using spare parts. He was a hobbyist and then the hobbyist got the wealth the status moment when he sold to Facebook for $3 billion. And then you know same thing with Elon. Elon was building in relative obscurity. Both OpenAI uh you know OpenAI was a nonprofit. It was relatively obscure for the first 5 years that it was out that they were doing their thing. U but now Sam Alman and and Elon and um and and Palmer again with Andrew have had a new status moment. And then there's what he calls knowledge diffusion which is suddenly there's conferences there's podcasts like this there's newsletters there's Twitter where people are sharing ideas about how to do this what's going on and you get this explosion of stuff and then competition floods and then the new incumbents are born and then then then the new incumbent regime is uh takes over due to their their defensibility like they build something that is defensible maybe it's because it's hardware maybe because it it requires scale maybe it has a network effect and the technology ology window clos is 90% closed and you'll only have a few exceptions from there on out. It's so funny, Sean. Uh, and to meet Will, who's like in the thick of actually what you're describing? Yeah. Will, when did you start were you like were you a hobbyist and when did you start with doing what doing what you're doing? Like when were you messing around with drones or ocean tech? So, um, yeah. Yeah, I mean like I like as I said, I've been like you know in the ocean on the ocean near the ocean since I was a kid. Diving um surfing uh you know whatever um wakeboarding all these sorts of things growing up. Um uh but never never had built in it really before this. Um you know I was you know when the this kind of scooter sharing startup uh thing popped off I was like you know working um you know in that uh you know my my co-founders all kind of had been you know tinkering and uh and these sorts of things but again none of us had ever actually really done anything in the ocean which I actually think is a massive benefit right like because none of us came in with these like uh preconceived notions for how like subc drones should work you know my you know two my co-founders were building aerial drones in a drone delivery startup before. So, they took like a lot of the primitives from that. One of them had worked on self-driving cars, took some of the like ideas from that. But again, I think there's like definitely this like idea that I agree with that like you know, to really actually shake up an industry, you it's probably good if you don't come from it. Um because we came to it and like you know, we we thought initially that we were going to be maybe using someone else's platform and repurposing it, but we looked at all of the subc drones on the market and they were crap. They cost like, you know, they were like one of the ones we were looking at which like actually had the specs that would have met what we wanted to do cost like 500 grand. Is that that's like a quarter of our prece to do what we want. Like it's like and then like my my my our CTO um Jamie H just like went into a cave for a few days and just like came back with like a a design for like a new type of like autonomous underwater vehicle and then we like tested and we were like, "Oh [ __ ] this works. Oh [ __ ] it's like 10 20 times cheaper than like anything we could have bought." Um, you know, so it's like sometimes you just need like a new idea and like an artist to go into a cave and then you can uh you can like change things. That's how uh all the great things that's how all the biggest problems have been solved. This is like I mean all religions like Muhammad went into the cave like Jesus went into the desert you know like all these like prophets like they go off into the old and they come back with like this like secret and then you know someone else spreads the word for them right like it's like St. Peter does it in like the Catholic church and like others. So yes, this is a a common archetype that um yeah, that does work. Yes. You you said something earlier about um how a billion people rely on the sea for their food. Has anybody done you know food or like tuna or salmon in a way? Are they doing anything interesting there with like whether it's like lab grown or or something innovative? Yeah. Yeah. My my friends got a very very interesting startup called Wild Type which is like sustainable sushi grade salmon. So basically that's like cultivated seafood. Um so their first product like they're But it's what do you mean by cultivated? It's grown. It's grown. It's not like farmed in or or caught at sea like grown in a lab or grown? Yeah, like in a Yeah, exactly. in this like industrial um process. Yeah. they can basically grow cells um and then put them together in such a way that it tastes like sushimi grade salmon. So, you know, in the same way that Elon started off with like a a sports car, right? They're starting off with like uh you know, sushimi grade salmon, the highest end salmon to get. And I've tried it. It's great. This is in San Francisco. It it looks like a brewery. Yes, exactly. It's like similar similar ideas. Um I mean look breweries are like where so much of the like best um kind of biotech uh innovation has like come like from people building like mass industrial processes for um you know cultivating food for like a very long period of time in fact. So you're telling me that someone is growing salmon that I can go and eat right now? Yeah. Yeah. I mean I got it through through my friend. I don't know if they're in stores yet. Um they're still going undergoing uh FDA approval, but like yeah, no none of these nasty heavy metals or microplastics in them. Uh you know, it's reducing pressure on fish stocks. Uh you know, this is this is good stuff. It doesn't have any of the nasty like parasites that you get in some of this like farmed salmon as well. Uh so yeah, definitely I think I think the things like this will be will be important. Holy [ __ ] this is crazy to me. This is crazy. Is it is it like the lab grown meats where it's like $10,000 an ounce? It's like it taste we can we made you either pick you either have the cheap thing like Beyond Meat or Impossible Foods but it doesn't taste great or it's not good for you. It's made with a bunch of chemicals or you have the real thing but it's super expensive and so nobody can afford it. Um well I think given that like uh my friend shared it with me that it's not that expensive. Uh but uh it's you're not that good of French. Oh, no. Exactly. Yeah. But I think this stuff is like sooner than we think. It's Randy quarter. Wow. These guys did a $100 million series B in 2022. That's pretty crazy. What? What else is cool? Tell tell Will, tell me everything. What? The guys like you are into like uh some more ocean [ __ ] Some crazy ones. Yes. Yeah. Okay. All right. This one is is wild, right? Buckle up. Okay. Ocean treasure hunting, right? So there is actually uh like you know hundreds of wrecks out there in the ocean today uh that potentially have like more than a billion dollars on them, right? Like gold bullions that like the Spanish were bringing back from their conquests and then you know they got hit by a storm. Um or these sorts of things, right? And there's like probably thousands that have like millions of dollars of funds in them, right? So governments that the source governments, so like the Spaniards, the Portuguese still have claim on these things. However, there is precedent in history for you to do these kind of like profit sharing agreements where it's like if we find that and we restore we give you back all your artifacts, we give you back everything, but you know, we sell some of them, we get to we get can we can we keep some you can do this, right? It's it's like these models where it's like these uh SAS negotiation companies like, hey, if we go and save you money on your vendors, we keep 20%. It's that except for you go to the Spanish royal government and you're like, "Hey, there's if we find any hidden treasures in the ocean, can we keep a couple bars for ourselves?" Exactly. Ram for piracy. Who's building this? So, what my my friend used to do this uh his name's Chip Foresight. Uh and he would be like, "Hey, I'm going off the coast of whatever to go." Bro, you did not have a friend that used to do this. That's insane. Chip Foresight, you know. Um he went he went off the coast and just what scuba dive for? What was he doing? It was Chip and AJ Foresight who I think you've met AJ. He's crazy. His brother Chip, they basically the way it works now is it's kind of like a movie. Like you have these crazy people and you get other people to finance it and you say if we find this treasure, you know, here's the agreement on how we split it and they would go off the co they would somehow narrow in on where they think it is. They would spend a week trying to find it and most of the time you don't find it, but occasionally you hit the lottery. Is that I mean is that right, Will, how it works now? Pretty much. Yeah. Yeah. Um so there's like fundamentally two parts of like a mission. It's like or three parts. There's like there's like you know the pre-mission uh you know you know negotiating like you know looking through historical records to see like where we think it could be you know kind of scoping it out and also getting permission so that when you do the recovery you have like some chance of being able to hold on to it. Then there's like this kind of scouting where you're actually on site and you're doing like scouting and you're like basically using sonar to scan this the seabed and understand what's there. And then there's like recovery where you're bringing out these like gnarly like JCB style ROVs um remote operated vehicles that go down and just like dig it all up and bring it back up and and you have your party. And is anybody doing this? Like has anybody do you know someone who's like made like $10 million finding treasures in the ocean? I I know some people working on this that haven't like shared their plans publicly yet. So I won't like share but there is like some exciting developments coming in this um space that that we we may or may not be helping with. Did you Did you say there's three million shipwrecks at the bottom of the ocean? So, um I'm not sure specifically on like a total amount of shipwrecks. I wouldn't be surprised if there's like that many shipwrecks, but there is like there's like hundreds that potentially have billions on them. Wow. Okay, that's insane. What else? So, there's Okay, I'll give you like a banger quote, right? Um there's this like Canadian billionaire called Ross who had this quote a few years ago. said, "Give me a tanker of iron filings and I will give you an ice age." Right? What he meant by that is like you can actually alter like the kind of weather of the earth by like dumping iron into the ocean. Right? So basically like many many parts of the um the ocean are uh low in iron. They they need more iron and if you add iron to these parts of the ocean you stimulate like algae growing at the surface. Algae then draws down carbon um and then the fish eat it and then the fish die and they fall to the bottom of the sea and then so the carbon goes from the air into the bottom of the ocean, right? So this is like generally good because there we have too much carbon in the atmosphere. We also want more fish, but you need to balance it because you don't want to put too much in and then just like there's too much salmon and then there's like salmon take over like you know a certain like ecosystem which is maybe like not good or something like or you know there's a basically when you're doing stuff in in in in like with ecosystems they're very it's very like difficult to predict how things are going to pan out. So you need to be careful. So this dude um didn't wasn't did do it that carefully. He went out like off the coast of like Vancouver, partnered up with these like Native Americans and just did like this experiment uh where he just like basically dumped off a load of iron filings, removed through his quantifications like thousands of tons of uh of of carbon. Um and the they had the off the coast there that year they had like the biggest like take of salmon ever um as a result. Um but the um the kind of del of Hardies did not like his experimentation and like the Cana Can Canadians like the CIA like busted his home and uh he got like yeah like a warrant and uh yeah he got in a lot of trouble so people haven't really done it since then cuz he kind of got like you know he was the kind of first crazy maybe like the first hobbyist to do something like this at scale but I think there is going to be like a billion dollar company built in like uh marine geoengineering of some description. I think uh I think it's like you know there's this um so I'm I'm I'm Catholic so it's like there's this like a lot of my beliefs around like environmentalism and stuff like that comes from like this Christian not notion of stewardship that like we should like look after our lands and our seas because it's like our duty to and uh I think I think this is like I think this is like kind of like where we're going with like how we we manage the climate like climate used to be this kind of let's like avoid the worst case scenario and it was just very like kind of like let's like stop emitting carbon But like I think there's like a more interesting idea of like this like stewardship I think of of of um of environmentalism where we actually just like control um you know we we we steward the planet right we like we take control we get involved we you know someone like Augustus at rain maker can make it rain when we want it to rain you know someone like Ulyses can come in and bring back the the the seagrasses when we need the seagrasses you know someone could like you know when we want to draw down carbon can do like or increase fish stock somewhere we could just like do a bit of this I think it's going we're going to have to build these tools, right? Because these we need these in tandem with um you know growing the size of the economic pie if we want to keep doing that. You know, we don't want to just like shut down the um economy. We don't want to like just stop doing like emissions altogether. It's important for us to have these other kind of compensatory mechanisms. And yeah, I think marine geoengineering is like an interesting and like underexplored space. I think main things we need to get right there are science, better science on it, u better technology and governance. the governance about it because the ocean is like a public space. It's like, you know, you just need to get the governance part right. Have you seen Sean? Have you seen this guy uh Augustus uh the founder of Rain Maker? Incredible mullet. Oh my god. There's this whole cohort of people of which will appears to be one of the like, you know, class presidents where there's this like they're very strange. They don't fit this stereotype when you think of a tech entrepreneur. They're like kind of manly men or they're t like they're not the they're not like this engineer like typical thing that you and I grew up with, Sean. Like there's something about them that is different. And I can't tell if you guys are going to take over the world and be billionaires or if you're going to go broke. But it's only going to be one of the two. Do do you understand Sean? Like this this new genre that I'm trying to describe. I don't I don't know exactly what I'm what I'm saying. Well, maybe you can like put words to it, but there's this new like breed that that Austin and San Francisco had a baby. You get the the stash and the mullet of Austin and then you get the insane ambition and tech tech chops of of Silicon Valley. And that's what's happening here. For example, this guy uh uh Augustus, I think his name is, he had he's on the cover, I think of Forbes or something, and he's sitting on a on a bench press like a like with like a like a working out. that is not something that Brian Chesky or uh you know Travis Kalanick would have done in 2012. I think there's like um there's like it's emblematic of like um of kind of the evolution of the technology industry though. I think like you know we we began like as this kind of like hippies that found computers with people like Steve Jobs we were like actualizing on like the axis of like the spiritual uh you know realm and then it was like you know you had like people like Bill Gates and Zuckerberg who were just like nerds like actualizing on the sense of like mind you know they were like smart and nerdy and now you have like people who are like openly flexing on like we're actualizing on the sense of um of like uh of like the body right like we're like becoming strong and like you have like this like full integration of like mind body and spirit and it's like no wonder that this uh you know uh like tech becoming like fully actualized on all of the access like that a human needs to develop on is happening at the exact same time where you have like Elon who is like chief tech bro in the [ __ ] White House, right? Like these things this is like no coincidence to me. It's like tech has like found its voice. It's like found itself. It's like self-confident and it's like ready to like actually change the world now because it's like it's you know it's it's like spiritually like aligned. It's like mentally there, you know, we're smart and like we're like now uh like a strong group of people as well who are taking health and fitness seriously. And it's like yes, this is why I think like we're at like the most interesting time in technology right now. I like that poetic. You know, last night I watched a uh a clip of the final scene of Ratatouille. You seen that, Sam? No. It's a great movie. And the final scene of Ratatouille is the the critic the critic who who's who's the the most fearsome critic in in all of uh the town writes the review about the restaurant where the rat has been cooking and um he just gives this beautiful monologue. Maybe the maybe the most beautiful four minutes in all of film is the last four minutes of Rat Ratatouille here. The monologue will I think you're up there with the last four minutes of Ratatouille there with your mind, body, and spirit analogy for tech. I I think that's kind of amazing. I've actually heard that before with just the technology part of it. So it's like you had the initial, you know, the bicycle for the mind. So you had Steve Jobs talking about how the how computers will enable creativity and then you had, you know, sort of AI, it's like, oh, we gave computers a brain and now they can think for themselves. And then with robotics and self-driving cars, it's like we gave the computers a body so they can move around and pick up things and do things. And I like how you uh you extended that to to you know the the entrepreneurial will has uh has has grown in that way. Look at Bezos and Zuckerberg. They're getting jacked like they're doing TRT. They look like look like this is like uh I think emblematic of like the spirit is in technology now. It's like you have the like you know one of my favorite podcasts besides yours, you know, the tech bros um you know and like what Jordy and uh and John are doing there. It's like they're like they're you know the the technology brothers. They're like leaning into the fact that they're like tech bros. That used to be a slur right now. It's like, "Oh, I'm confident in it. I'm like, I'm owning it." And they're like doing these like hilarious promo videos of them like sipping Dom Perin. Like, it's like there's like a confidence and an air of like, okay, let's do it now. You know, we're not like we're not going to be like at like the events and functions anymore kind of lying about not neutered yourself. I got an email from this guy named Jamie at the Wall Street Journal. So, Jamie uh is a reporter for Wall Street Journal's style team and he listen to this. He goes, "I'm writing a story about tech guys embracing western wear," so basically cowboy clothes in the past recent years. Uh, and I want to write about how the tech bro uniform has changed from quarter zips and allirds to denim shirts, cowboy boots, and uh, like when I saw this and he said tech bro, I was like dude, that's amazing. I was like, I don't think I could talk like this is not going to be also life win that he thinks you're the expert to go to, right? Yeah, life win. But I was like, I'm not exactly in tech, but that's amazing that you think that I like I am a fashion influencer officially. No. Uh, reply. Mission accomplished. Um, dude, that's amazing. And and you're right. Like, dude, is there any difference? You know, the first time you saw Zuck doing MMA, do you remember when that video came out? Is there any difference between that video and the first time you saw like a Boston robotics or Boston Dynamics do like robot dog getting kicked and like jumping around and like doing back flips and [ __ ] Like there's no difference between the two videos. It's the same video. One of those days that everyone remembers where they were when they saw it. It's like, wow, I didn't know the robots could do that. That's how I felt watching Zuck. That's how I felt watching Boston the Boston Dynamics robot. Well, uh uh one of the last questions. Um can I invest? Yeah. Yeah. Great. Okay, cool. Cuz I think this is awesome. I uh you guys are you guys are insane, man. This energy is so wild. I'm not convinced that it's going to end one like Okay, so on one hand, it it goes both ways. So on one hand, there's the hubris where, you know, you're like a, you know, uh in the case of Androl, you're Boeing or you're one of these huge companies and you're like, you know, Parker or Palmer, you know nothing. You know, just go back to It would be better if they called him Parker. More condescending. uh little Parker, listen Parker, they would be like, "Palmer, you know, you know nothing, you know, you're just go back to making Facebook apps, you know, uh and like probably eight out of 10 times that idea is uh right, right, where like there's an incumbent and like they fail because it's really hard and there's centuries of of hard work to go against in competition." And so that's the same with you. I I would have to imagine where you have these young really smart people who have no experience and is this the 10% of the time where you guys are just going to take over the world or is this another time where someone's going to be like look this is exactly what you told you it does not work. All right listen that guy John that that guy who said give me half a tanker of iron and I will give you an ice age. Here's what I say. Give me a 100 mullets and I'll give you a 10x portfolio. I just need Will. I need Augustus. I need Palmer with a mullet. Right. Three mullets. I need 97 more mullets and I'll give you a 10x return. Okay. Give give me the fund. I'll find I'll find the most for you. You find the mullet. Like I can't I don't know enough to know if this is if this is achievable or not. I definitely understand that feeling. Yeah, for sure. I I'm not qualified to judge the feasibility of something. But I think in general it's not about any you know if nothing if anybody if anybody who's doing a startup like this thinks it's a sure thing or a sure bet you're nuts right like you're going to have to perform a miracle right and that's okay the the important thing is oh wow we took a portion of our brain power that was otherwise going to be building X or working at Y company you know working at Facebook optimizing you know ad clicks or starting a company that was going to be doing you know uh B2B HR or whatever software and instead now we we peeled off a portion of that talent and now we sent you know 100 mullets at these problems and I think that that that's the winning strategy is 100 or a thousand shots on goal like this and then the winners will obviously emerge. Well, I can assure you what we're doing is very real. You wouldn't have a million dollars in our bank account um without it. We wouldn't have done all the things we've done in the last 5 months. If you want to come here to San Francisco and see some real robots in ocean, the door is always open. Um, same for you, Shan. I I I got to ask you two quick questions. Number one, seaggrass seems so random. And when I if you started this company, you might have thought, "Oh, I'll do drones like for warfare." Uh, how did you arrive at the seagrass thing? Was it instant? Was it was that the initial idea or did you do some discovery to figure out the initial idea? It was the initial idea. came to one of my co-founders. He was on a surf trip and he kind of um the same one who went into the cave and designed our AUV went heard about seagrass and went into cave and like went deep on seagrass and came back to us and presented like this is this is a very interesting space and we kind of heard about seaggrass on a surf trip from who? A marine biologist friend of his who was um working on a guy out a guy out in the wave. Yeah, dude. This co-founder is absolutely carrying your company. Yeah, this guy built the tech and figured out the go to market. I love it. Yeah, he's the um well, yeah, he he found he found the kind of he was the one who brought seaggrass to us and then myself and my other co-founders kind of put it together and like this is what the business probably should look like. Um but then yeah, we kind of went out from there into other areas and like you know like I think any brilliant company finds a local monopoly to build in first. Uh somewhere where there's nobody else doing stuff with technology where you've you know it's a great time and nobody's ever heard of what you're even doing initially and you can it's a pretty big market. you can, you know, bring cash into your business as like a lifeblood. And uh so it's been a great place for us to start. It's like the best place for us to start. Nobody's ever heard of it. So I think that's always a good place to to start off on and then yes, we're going to use that as a kind of launching point to do other interesting things in the ocean. Who do you admire, Will? Who do you want to be like? Steve Irwin, probably. Um dude, [ __ ] I was going to say this earlier on. I go, you are Steve Irwin. I do. I You got C vibes hardcore, man. Do you got any khaki shorts on right now? Not right now, but we have a picture of him up on the wall here. Oh, I You scream Steve Irwin. You have Steve Irwin vibes through and through. Yeah. Yeah, I know. He's um I'm Yeah, I'm hopeful I can get the the Irwin family uh on the Ulyses train at some point. We got to h we got to holler at Bindy. Bindy Irwin. That would be great. Robert, I love those guys. Yeah, Robert as well. Um, yeah. You know, look, Steve, I think is like, and it's so funny. You people say Steve on a podcast in the tech it's like Steve Jobs. It's like for me it's Steve. You should have just said Steve at the beginning and then let us fall into your trap. Dude, Sean Sean, there's this famous video. I I know you've seen this. Well, there's this famous video of uh it's Steve Irwin and his wife. What's her name? Uh I I forget her name. And anyway, there's an interviewer who asked Steve like, you know, you don't seem like you care. Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam. Just look. Just look. Just look what's on my screen. Just look what's on my screen right now. Oh, there it is. Thank you. Just look what I was pulling up because I love that clip with you, brother. I love this clip. I love this clip. Play it. Play it. What good is a fast car, a flash house, and a gold plate of Dunny to me? Absolutely no good at all. I've been put on this planet to protect wildlife and wilderness areas, which in essence is going to help humanity. I want to have the purest oceans. I want to be able to drink water straight out of that creek. I want to stop the ozone layer. I want to save the world. And you know, money, money is great. I can't get enough money. And you know what I'm going to do with it? I'm going to buy wilderness areas with it. Every single scent I get goes straight into conservation. And guess what, Charles? I don't give a rip whose money it is, mate. I'll use it and I'll spend it on buying land. This is how every man should be, by the way. Like you're passionate about something that's good for others. And like his wife's just like eyeing him. And uh that's one of my favorite clips of all time. Yeah. It's it's and so I think the traits in him that I just like this like raw passion this like this like unbridled passion. It's like this like nonsensical passion. It's like you think I'm going to have a conversation without a microphone. No, I'm going to put a microphone there. I'm going to record a podcast. I'm going to record a podcast every day and I don't give a rip who's listening cuz you know what? I'm a podcaster and I'm going to podcast my ass off. It's a whole lot more lame when you're not talking about like saving the earth. You know what I mean? Like I tried. I tried. like when we're talking about like conversion rate optimization or uh B2B dude in fact will we kind of my generation and the generation before me we we you know what do they say uh uh hard times create or no uh like we need hard men to create soft times that's what I did for you you know we went and did the B2B software stuff so you guys could do this fun amazing stuff so really you're welcome thank you thank you can we do just a quick happy hour of two topics that you had on this list that I you know Sam if you got to run or whatever you feel feel free but I just got to ask you about these. So um I want to do the fun one and then the spiritual one. The fun one is conspiracy theories. You're a big conspiracy you're a fan of conspiracy theories I believe and you like people who like conspiracy theories. So can you just give me a rant on why conspiracy theories are underrated here? I think um well I think it's like uh you know a lot of the traits of like a conspiracy theorist are like those of like a like a great like a founder. I think like someone that like believes in something that everyone else tells them is like not real. Um or like you know that they shouldn't believe in or like you know people that are like able to see patterns that others can't see and you know they they just like go down these like rabbit holes. Uh and I think like just like this contrarian spirit I think is like very very good and I think it's just like a very important you know the default is like doing things that other people do. And so I think it's very important to cultivate uh an ability to see the world differently. I think it isn't it funny how contrarian is this like really positive description and conspiracy theorist is like this like negative description you know what I mean it's the same thing I just think it's very important to you know have weird ideas and take them seriously right like if we just had heard the seagrass idea and just like rubbished it you know we wouldn't I like I don't know what the hell I'd be doing today you know it's like you need to take something weird and go with it and so like I don't believe like don't blindly believe every report of telepathy and non-verbal autistic children every like late night UFO sighting, but like I refuse to dismiss them outright. And I think, you know, history shows us that breakthroughs often happen at the edges where people are curious enough or foolhardy enough to investigate the unexplainable. So it's like whether it's like Christian mystics, you know, who swear by miraculous healings or physics experiments that like challenge our understanding of spaceime, I think it's very important to like lean into these weird things and ask um what if? And yeah, I think conspiracy theories are just kind of like fun as well. They're like kind of like horoscopes for dudes. So they're like if any if not if if nothing else like they're just like it's like uh it's just like a fun thing to kind of like spend your your your time uh reading about. On here you talk about aliens. We are with Joe Gibbia uh recently who's like the 90th richest person in the world. And I was like Joe look you're worth like $10 billion. Like if there's Illuminati like you are either in it or you're friends with the people in it. Tell me one thing that like you guys talk about. And he looked at me he goes aliens are real. And he went on a he went on a big uh he had a big diet tribe on his passion for like uh you know UFOs and aliens and how he absolutely uh is on board with them. 100% is on board with them. He came off very passionately like it is absolutely a thing. And the funny thing is if you meet Joe he's he's a serious dude. Joe doesn't just say wild [ __ ] for wild shit's sake. You know Joe's not like oh he's a kooky billionaire. No no no. Joe is like an extremely principled artist. He is a uh a very serious individual. And so for him to say something like that, it's not like you don't discount it with the same discount rate you would if uh John McAfee was the guy saying it. You know what I mean? If if if your reader's walking down this rabbit hole, the best website I recommend going is um a website a friend of mine runs, u evidence.com. Is there any other dope conspiracy uh that I should go look into rabbit hole that would waste a nice 5 hours of my time? Uh, I think Les of a Conspiracy more like wacky weird uh rabbit hole you need to go down is you need to listen to the telepathy tapes podcast. Um, I have and I love it. What's uh what what is this? Is this like I can read your mind. So, basically there's this group of people that people have been calling crazy for like the last like two decades, right? It's basically the teachers and parents of children with non-verbal autism because they've been convinced that their kids have been able to like read their mind. And now for like the first time with teaching kids how to spell on like iPads and also with like getting researchers in to study them, they're actually verifying these telepathic capabilities, right? So like a mother will like go into one room and she'll be shown like a random number generator and her son Akquil in the other room will hit the exact same three numbers 100% of the time consistently in tests. That's awesome. Yes. It's like the serial podcast but it's this woman investigating these claims and she's like, you know, like an NPR skeptical, let me call it, right? So she she comes in, she's like, "This didn't make a ton of sense, but I'm open-minded." Is she turned? I I didn't finish the whole thing. I I listened probably the first two or three, but I was listening to while I was going to sleep and I just had some like wild wild nights there. So I decided, all right, I need to only listen to this, you know, not falling asleep if I'm going to do this right. By the way, Will, did you walk away from that, you know, half convinced, three-4s convinced, totally convinced? What did you walk away? I was going into it already with some sort of like priors that I thought that like consciousness consciousness isn't local to the brain. Like we like to think that like our brain is this kind of like DVD player um where like consciousness is playing and it's like being played to us and that's how we experience things. I think we're more like I always kind of thought and for different reasons that we're more like a radio antenna. You know, you have these stories of people like their their son dies in an accident and they just know something's wrong, right? They just like know, right? Like there's like the you know, everyone every family has these stories of like death or like something bad happened and they just like knew. They woke up in the middle of the night and they're like, I couldn't sleep. Then after that and they wake up the next day, they hear about this awful accident or something like that. Or you have like this like knowingness and these other things like just like telepathy twins telepathy and stuff like and there's like this world of parasychology which is like the study of these kind of sigh phenomena. There's like actually very reproducible experiments in it like the Gansfeld experiment which if you allow me to go on this like very short rabbit hole but like the most reproducible experiment in this field is basically you take two people you put them in like two separate rooms these could be twins these could be husband wife they could be two artists they could be two people who don't know each other different settings and basically you give me a picture and you give uh and you're the receiver then in another room and I'm in one room and I'm talking about this random picture I've been given let's say it's one and four different pictures I get a picture of an element for five minutes. I talk about elephants. I saturate my brain with Africa and wild animals and savannah. You're in the other room. You're listening to white noise and you're talking basically about what you're sensing, feeling that they could be about. And then at the end of the 5 minutes, I I stop and you get replayed what you were saying to yourself for 5 minutes and you get the four random images and you get to pick one of the four. And then you would assume if complete chance, you know, you would 25% chance of getting it right. pretty consistently you get like 30% or above in this like experiment. And then when there's like twins, husband and wives um or artists, they actually score like more consistently 35 in some instances like 70% in some of these experiments. And so I've always kind of been like primed to think that like actually maybe we're more like we're touching into something and like that explains a lot of the spiritual and woo woo stuff. And then I see this and it's like very good experimental evidence and really well done and I'm like okay no that's 100% legit. Like our brain is not like this like AI chip that like runs and just like tells us what to do. It's like an AI chip, but it's like it also has a radio antenna that can connect to other people, can maybe connect to God, spirits, other things. We don't really know. Dude, I'm so bummed that I grew up in the B2B uh era of startups. Yeah. So bummed. Well, I wish like I wish I was 10 years younger. You were 10. I wish we could have hung out. Dude, let's grab some beers. I went to a bachelor party this weekend and everybody on uh the girl it was a it was a bachelor party where the bachelors and the bachelorettees were both at doing it together basically as a as a party together and the bachelorette side was so cool. Like every single one of them just you know those tattoos that aren't like filled in. They're just like it's almost looks like a pencil sketch. Just seven or eight of those. Some piercings. Sense of style off the charts. knowledge of beer and music way beyond my recognition. You know, sexuality was a total spectrum. You never knew who was who who who's dating who. Anybody could be dating anybody in the room. It was insane. I just felt like I literally felt like I came from a I was a caveman and I was like or or like like I was the gingerbread man. Actually, I wasn't even a real human being. I was a cookie cutter shape that was placed in this room. That's awesome. That is so funny. I think one like universal law about technology is that like it breeds variance, right? Like it just like it it creates like skewed outcomes. And I think you probably like see this in like younger generations as well. Like you've got like weird like kind of like skitso people like me that will like burn your ear off conspiracy theories and like you know go down like these weird rabbit holes, but like I think you also it's like on the like maybe on the more negative end that could send you like down like some pretty dark places that maybe you wouldn't be a productive member of society if you go down like those like into those like very dark corners of the internet. Um or similarly like it's you know you have people who are like doing like great things but then you also like you know I think there is like a very interesting question that's posed in technology right now is like you know where are the um you know the the kind of like less than kind of 25 um you know uh you know billion dollar uh company founders. This is like an interesting question that I think is still not really like there's no satisfying answers around like previous generations had like the Collison's pretty early. Um you know we had like Alexander Wang like who's maybe like a few years older than me pretty early. Still doesn't seem clear why there isn't one in this generation. Maybe we have to wait another year or two for companies like US or Rain Maker or others to like to to get there. But um there is um there is definitely like a I think a bigger skew in both the ideas that young people are interested in today. I think that's like broadly just like downstream of um yeah technology. Are you gonna become an American? Uh yeah, I think I'm gonna get I'm on the green card um path. Yeah. My last question was the spiritual one. You said you lived with Buddhist monks in Nepal and for a summer he learned a lot and one thing I liked you said I couldn't come around to their view which states that zero desires leads to enlightenment. Um and so you and then you said like you know I you wanted to be you wanted to be actionoriented and do something with your life rather than sit and sort of renounce everything. Uh and then you said something like I came to I came to explain my five desires or six desires. Can you just exp give me give me the quick story on your summer with the monks and then what you landed at? Yeah. So yeah I just um kind of want I just had heard that that you you could do this right. You can actually just like find a monastery to like basically put you up if you teach them English. So I I did that, found a monastery in Nepal that would like put me up. It's pretty rural, a few hours outside um uh Kandu, went there through there, taught them I taught myself to teach English before I came over, was teaching them English and then like in the downtime was like able to speak to some of the older monks who had like good English and like ask them about their ideology cuz there's just a there's just five monks with like a thick Irish accent speaking English out there. They're like, "Yeah, I learned from an expert." Wild actual segue. I was out running in the middle of Nepal one day and I bumped into a dude who was wearing a Galway Bay 5K t-shirt and I was like I was like you might have like no English but I was like where did you get this like t-shirt like this is like we're near where I'm from and he was like he was like had like kind of like an Irish accent. He's like oh well you know I actually work with an Irish guy. Um he has like an orphanage and like a charity out here. And I was like oh wait like what's this like Irish guy's name? his the Irish guy he named was like the one Irish guy that my my neighbor who's like my mom's friend my mom's friend was like my mom was worried about me going to Nepal she was like well you know I you need to have a contact in Nepal when you go over there you know I was like and so then my neighbor knew a guy who's in Nepal who had a charity out there anyway like this random guy I met in this like tiny village worked with him so this is like you know there's like Irish people everywhere everyone's just talking like kind of like all these monks are like little I box the you'll do nothing I box the bullets off them Yeah, you'll you'll do nothing. Literally, there's there's people everywhere. We have We have We have people everywhere. That's like the kind of moral. Is that what the monks are are saying? We didn't hear to come. We didn't come to take part. We came to take over. All right. So, so sorry. So, you go there and you're uh Yeah, I'm curious about the ridge and I'm asking them questions about it, but one thing I just couldn't get over was like, you know, they don't believe in desire. Like, they believe desire is like what leads to this suffering. If you desire for something, then you're creating a contract with yourself to be unhappy until you have that thing. And I'm just like, dude, I'm very like American dream pill. I'm like, you know, I should want for things. I should want for things. But I can see how that can go wrong as well, right? Cuz that leads to like, you know, keeping up with the Joneses type lifestyle. Um or maybe like, you know, kind of like, you know, the fatties on on the chair at Walmart kind of like thing, you know, like that's like probably like when it goes like uh maybe like too far. Hey, you better watch it, Will. That's our demo. You better watch what you're saying. No, you're not that fat s. So anyway, so that's where I can see where I can go wrong, right? But I do think there was like an essence of truth in there where it's like maybe you should like actually try to trim down things as little as possible. And I had this like bizarre experience where I was I was I went and did Ever Space Camp afterwards and I was thinking a lot about like the things that they were saying to me. And again, I feel like I had like a download, like one of these experiences where like something just came into my brain that I don't think I hadn't been thinking about it before. And I genuinely think it was a download from, you know, something spiritual that like gave me like some guidance on how I was literally, it sounds crazy, but I was sitting on a rock um like just like on a break in the hike, this like 10day hike up to a base camp and uh I like was like thinking through it's like okay well if you have no desire like what do you do? It's like oh maybe you should have desire but the minimum amount of them. Then I was like, "What is like important to me?" And I was like on my hand I was like, "Oh, my family, my friends, my health, my wealth, my craft." And I was like, "Oh shit." Like that's like five things that's like nice and clean. And then I like had this like idea at the same time of like a rose bush. Like rose bushes if you like leave them go unkempt, they basically just grow like briars and they go thorns and the flowers don't really grow. You have to like cut them back to let the energy go back to like the rose. And I was just like I had this like very clear vision of like roses and I was like, "Oh, okay. Right. this is it. Okay. So, whenever I'm like down over something, it's like if it's not one of these like five important things to me, then it's like, okay, just like let it go. Like, stop desiring for it. Um, and I found that to be helpful. You had a girlfriend? Uh, no. That was your reaction to his story about the Buddhist monks and like realizing like the meaning of life. You want to dude? You're telling me an Irish guy with that in his profile isn't just going to destroy the whole city? Give me a break. Saving saving the world. Uh saving the world seaggrass, former monk, Sam's five desires. Family, health, wealth, fitness, and will. Those are those are Sam's five desires. This is so good, man. You're the best. Will, this is awesome. People should check you out. Where? On Twitter. You're Willow O'Brien. What's your What's your hand? Willow Bryant. W I L O B R I. Okay, great. And uh good luck with the company, man. Thank you, dude. Thank you. All right, that's it. That's the pod. Thank you. [Music]

I still think the big opportunity in the media space if someone wants to take a big swing, someone wants to go build a billion dollar company. It's Wait, so say what were you saying earlier? How you hated me or No, you didn't hate me. No, I didn't hate you. Like I hated you. Just to be clear, I hated you. I I did not hate you. Like I I feel like also part of like my shtick has always been like I don't hate anyone. And I try to kill people with kindness. I I try like people have to feel like douchebags for hating me because there's no way to hate me. Like I feel like that was my MO for a while. But I remember Yeah. I remember being on the phone with Tim Sha and he was investor in the hustle also. Right. Yeah. I was so mad at him for investing in both of our companies. I was so angry. Yeah. And I remember being on the phone with him and I was like, "We're talking about you for some reason." And I was like, "Yeah, like I I would love to talk to Sam, but I don't know if he wants to talk to me or us." And Tim was just like, "Yeah, I don't think he likes you guys very much." And no, but anyway, I didn't I didn't hate you, but I I was jealous of certain things at the hustle. And one of the things I was most jealous of was the welcome email. Like, I remember reading the welcome email and being like, "This is so freaking good." And I'm so angry that we don't have one that is as good as this. I would have traded you the welcome email for your guys's ability to be like financially like just you guys are far more than competent, but I was barely competent. So I I So like the envy went both ways. Um all right, so here's what I want to do for this show. So here's the deal. So wait, do you guys say what you sold for? Is that public or not? We Yeah, we could say 7 75 million I think is the the uh uh public number. So, collectively the hustle of Morning Brew, we sold for like hundreds of millions of dollars and I we were sort of like the graduating class of like 2020 or whatever. We were the early people in the newsletter game. We didn't like invent it, but we kind of helped pioneer a little bit of what is popular today. And now officially, as of a couple weeks ago, we are both or all three of us are officially out of our companies. I've been out for a minute. Alex has been out for a minute. Now Austin is out. and we could finally reveal like a bunch of information. And sorry, Sam, to be clear, I'm technically uh executive chairman, so I'm no longer dayto-day, but I am executive chairman of Morning Bro. You are no longer operating, but I think you guys uh do you still have equity ownership? No, we're we're both way up. All right. So, that's what I mean. And so, what I wanted to do was I wanted to go year by year when we each started. And I want to explain to the listener what we were doing in that year, what our revenue and profit was, what our subscriber growth was, things we learned, and also we have to add this, things that we would do differently if it if we were starting again today, and things that we wish we had done. Does that sound good? Yeah, sounds good. I'm also excited for it cuz at the time, I didn't know any of your numbers. So, this is like the first time I actually know your numbers as we were going through it. I think I've like shared with Austin like my whole data room at this point. The cool thing about having a data room is like you're supposed to have, you know, all the information that's easily accessible so you can like go back and look back. Yeah. But this is this is the first time it's all been in one place. We've peacemealed it, but I think it'll be fun to to side by side it. So we you guys started in 2015. What was the original premise? And weren't you guys both in college? Yeah. So I was a senior at Michigan, Austin was a sophomore. Um I mean both of us were kind of on the finance track. the general premise and it's so funny because like we've told this story so many times about how it started. I don't know if it's actually the truth. It's just what I remember is the story, but basically was I was helping students prep for job interviews. I would ask kids during these mock interviews, "How do you keep up with the business world?" Every single student would say, "I read the Wall Street Journal, but my but it's dry. I can't get through the whole thing. My parents told me I have to read it." And so, at some point, I was like, "This is crazy. these kids are about to spend their whole careers in business, yet they don't have something that they enjoy reading. So, I started putting together the kind of OG version of Morning Brew, which was called Market Corner, and it was a PDF that I'd attached to an email lister every day, and Austin was one of my readers. Can I tell you what I think the real story was, cuz it's probably the same story as mine. Sure. You saw the success of the scam and you just said, I'm just going to do this for finance people, or in my case, tech guys. Definitely possible. Yeah, I I think that's partly true. I do think Alex started the the PDF version. Like there were two there were two versions. There was the market corner and then there was turning into Morning Brew. The evolution of Morning Brew was totally inspired off of wow if if these two women in New York City could get millions of people I think maybe a million people at the time reading like why can't we do the same? There's a bunch of you know we at the time we thought dudes in in finance who wanted to read about uh the business world. And uh did you have any revenue in year one? No. No. Which by the way I'll say was a huge advantage for us that I don't think you had with the hustle is Austin and I were still in school. So we basically had a year and a half to two years of like fake timeline where we didn't have to worry about bringing in revenue. So in 2015 I think I was 25. Uh it wasn't the hustle. It was just an event called HustleCon. And that year, I think it had made around $400,000 in revenue and like $200,000 in profit. Like it was like a good event, but we and it was basically like a TED talk for entrepreneurs, but I was so scrappy and I honestly regret it. One of my biggest regrets in life is buying the supplies that I needed for that event at Costco and returning the stuff that we didn't use. And I didn't realize that you throw things away once like Costco throws it away. And it was like the most shame that I'd ever felt was like doing being that like uh cheap and and horrible. And that was Was the hustle that profitable? Like when you did it that first year, was it profitable? Yeah. Yeah. Cuz it was just me and then I and then I asked uh my buddy John to help and it was just us two. And yeah, it made it so like when we started in the year 2015 or sorry, so the next year in 2016, I started the hustle because I was like conferences suck. I want to create a uh a newsletter because I saw the skim. I read about thrillist on mixerg.com and a bunch of other and like a bunch of other newsletter businesses. And when when I started that business, I had $500,000 in my bank and it was all from conferences. It's pretty wild. I think what you said is interesting about the math, right? I think at the time and we have a funny story we can tell now that we we've held back for a while uh about John Steinberg and our first interaction with him. But so many people came to us and they would say like this is so stupid. Why are you doing this newsletter thing? It makes no sense. But Alex and I would sit there every night and we'd go through a spreadsheet and it was the most basic spreadsheet of, you know, newsletter subscribers grow five or 10% a month and CPMs stay flat and over time you can get to hundreds of thousands or millions of of dollars of revenue a month. And I think it was really that simple. I had the exact same spreadsheet. I listened to every interview with Ben Leer and I'm like, "Tell me what the CPMs are." And then I met with Business Insider reporters and I said, "Tell me how many people visit your tech part of your website. 80 million." Okay, then. Yeah, like you're giving me some numbers to to triangulate. Yeah. And like at the time, everyone was was spending millions of dollars putting video on Facebook. And you know, I don't think we were actually that smart. I just think the people around us were really dumb. I do think one of the big advantages, you know, they they say at a poker table, uh, if you look around and you can't find the sucker, you're the sucker. Well, I think we picked the industry with a lot of suckers. There are a lot of people who started 5 or 10 years before us and they just weren't smart. They were doing the same thing that they did for 10 years and you know even in 2015 2017 we were like BuzzFeed it just doesn't make sense. It's not worth a billion dollars and for 5 years I think people didn't believe us and over time I think we we proved that our model while it seems silly it actually works. It it worked and it made us a bunch of money. All right. A few episodes ago, I talked about something and I got thousands of messages asking me to go deeper and to explain and that's what I'm about to do. So, I told you guys how I use chat GBT as a life coach or a thought partner. And what I did was I uploaded all types of amazing information. So, I uploaded my personal finances, my net worth, my goals, different books that I like, issues going on in my personal life and businesses. I uploaded so much information. And so the output is that I have this GPT that I can ask questions that I'm having issues with in my life, like how should I respond to this email, what's the right decision knowing that, you know, my goals for the future, things like that. And so I worked with HubSpot to put together a step-by-step process, showing the audience, showing you the software that I use to make this, the information that I had chat GBT ask me, all this stuff. So, it's super easy for you to use. And like I said, I use this like 10 or 20 times a day. It's literally changed my life. And so if you want that, it's free. There's a link below. Just click it, enter your email, and we will send you everything you need to know to set this up in just about 20 minutes, and I'll show you how I use it again 10 to 20 times a day. Um, all right. So, check it out. The link is below in the description. Back to the episode. All right. So, fast forward to 2016. Where are you guys at? Uh, how many subscribers do you have? What was your revenue in 2016? What's the business? Yeah. So 2016 was the year when at this point I'm working full-time on Wall Street doing the brew in basically, you know, let's call it 7:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. every night falling asleep with my laptop on my lap. Where were you working? I was at Morgan Stanley. Was that miserable? Yeah. Yes, it was. Uh my my entire life was like built up to that point because remember like my dad was a trader on Wall Street for 20 years. My mom was like this is all I knew. But it was horrible. And going back to what Austin was saying about um just like there not being a a lot of smart people in media, I actually think the best thing we did is like I call it like IQ arbitrage where I was on a trading desk, everyone was a PhD in math. I was the dumbest person on my desk. Like not even a shadow of a doubt. And just by moving to media, I became not the dumbest person. September of 2016, I quit my job. Also, it was hilarious. Right before that, I almost got fired from Morgan Stanley because they were worried I was insider trading through Morning Brew's newsletter. So, so they basically HR found out about Morning Brew, which I was supposed to have permission to work on. The guy who was supposed to give me permission and told me he would got fired in a massive layoff at Morgan Stanley. So, I didn't get permission. and they basically had me meet with Morgan Stanley lawyers, two litigators that were defending Morgan Stanley, saying you can never tell anyone about this meeting, but um we are concerned that you are trying to make investment decisions uh and get private information using your newsletter. So that was kind of like the last draw for me. Made me really not enjoy the job. Quit my job. We raised a small round in 2016. 2016 is also the year when we talked to John Steyberg as he was starting Cheddar. And John Steyberg is like a media executive. Did you guys see the Facebook message? Yeah. That he sent me. So this guy named John Steinberg at the time I think I'm 26 and I'm just like a guy in a shitty apartment trying to do this newsletter and John Steinberg is the president or CEO of BuzzFeed and he's about to start a new company called Cheddar. He was at BuzzFeed. Then he went to Daily Mail North America that he was the CEO of. He stepped down from Daily Mail and then he sent Austin and I an email. Awesome. What was the subject line? Like what did the email say again? Yeah. So it was from his G. We had no idea who John Steinberg was. We didn't know the media industry and we get an email from it's like John Steinberg some numbersgmail.com and he emails us intro uh subject line intro to founders body of the email like what you're doing period. That was the whole email. So, we look the guy up on LinkedIn and we're like, "Holy [ __ ] this guy's a big deal." You know, we give him a call and I mean, Alex can tell the story better, but he turns it, he flips it on us, he makes us think that he's excited in us. He's going to he's going to invest in us, all this stuff. And then he brings Alex to his office and I'll I'll let Alex take it away. What happens? Go ahead. Yeah. So I I go to John's office, which at the time was a uh tiny like closet of a wei work space, and it was him, Peter Gorstein, who was his co-founder and the chief content officer. And I get there, and I think the conversation is going to be about how John is going to invest in Morning Brew, or how Morning Brew maybe will have a segment on Cheddar that would create, you know, audience and distribution for us. Instead, he starts interviewing me. Yeah. Because he wanted you to work there. Yes. So, he started interviewing me. He's like, "Okay, so, uh, Fitbit earnings come out. You need to get an expert on the story to talk about what this means. Who are you talking to? How are you finding them? Let's go." And I was like, "Well, I'm going to find figure out a way to get to the CEO." And and I was and then at some point in the conversation, I was like, you know, to be honest, I'm, you know, I'm not interested in a job at Cheddar. like I thought we were going to be talking about a partnership with Morning Brewer. Are you guys investing in us? And I will never forget this line. Honestly, I have some respect. He said this cuz he wasn't wrong. He goes, to be totally honest, the cost of the legal fees to do this deal would be more than I what I would pay for you guys. And I was like, damn, he's right right now. He's right now. Dude, I have an ex very similar story. First of all, related to John, I just found an old message on Facebook that I got. Here's his opening two lines. Have we met? We should meet, dude. He He's He's amazing. He he he's done it like four or five times and that guy's motor just runs. Like he is just unbelievable. So this is we're in the year 2016. I get a email or maybe I cult email Ben Lear who uh started this thing called Thrillist which became Group 9 like a billion dollar company. Then he's one of the co-founders of Lear HIPPA which is like one of the most pre-minent uh VCs in New York. We start talking and I think he's going to buy the hustle right out the gate. And I'm like, "Hell yeah." Like, " $5 million? I'm I'm I'm That's how much I have right now already." Like he the offer is going to happen. And he brings in the president of the company and it turns into an interview, the exact same thing. And I was like, "Oh, I thought you were going to buy us." He's like, "Brother, this is a newsletter. This will never make more than like $2 million a year." And I was like, "Well, I don't know, man. Like, if you do the math," he was like, "No, like you should come and join us. Like, you know, we're we're a real company. Like, if you want to like make this work, you have to join our company." And I it forever that has been a chip on my shoulder. And just think about like how valuable it was that we were all kind of like both had conviction and were like irrationally confident in what we were doing because like you could see so many other scenarios where someone's like you know googly eyed by someone who's super successful and goes and joins their thing and it basically cuts all of the possible upside that you know we ended up experiencing with our businesses. So this is all right so we're in the year 2016. The hustle launched on 4 2016 and so that year we did 400k in revenue. I think we had at the end of the year we had like a 100,000 subscribers. I had this strategy where I was writing these crazy blog posts and getting like 500,000 to a million people a month coming to our website and that's how we grew. And I think of the 400k I think a 100,000 was advertising revenue and I think it was four of us at the time. where where were you guys? So, that's that's amazing because in 2016, we did our first ad deal. Uh it was a watch brand called Emil Hart, I believe. It was about a $3,000 deal for for three We used to call them exposures. We were so naive we called them ad exposures. Uh it was three of us. We had a writer who, ironically, we poached someone from BI. I I think I'm not kidding. I think he made it like 70 days. Like, he barely made it at the company. He quit because we wanted him to work more than a nineto-five. But you know, we did 25,000 that year. You did 400,000. We were three of us that I was still in college. But mine Ours were events. So it wasn't advertising, which is way less like But you guys did what? Still 100,000 of ads. That's pretty good. Yeah. We started advertising, I believe, in June. And I looked up my first deal. It was $4,600. I cold email a guy named Chris Martinez at Wealthfront. So funny. I that's the funny thing is it it kind of reminds me of like if you go to my LinkedIn and look at my DMs from the last 10 years, I have basically DM'd every human being that has worked in growth marketing or media over the last 10 years. And I remember that name, Chris Martinez, cuz I probably emailed him 12 times over that year to try to get him to do a deal with us. I don't know who Chris is anymore. I haven't talked to him, but if you're listening, thank you. The things I would do differently from 16 is we raised a little bit of funding. I would not have done that. I thought and and in fact I tried to raise way more money but no one invested which ended up being a blessing because I made uh a lot of money because I owned the majority of the company but uh that's what I would do differently. So if you're listening to this I if I were starting today I would not raise funding at all. Would you agree? I think raising funding is all about your business needs. Right. I certainly wouldn't have raised more money than we did but we did need the $750,000. I actually uh specifically remember this is now fast forwarding 2017. It was December like 27th 2017 and I didn't realize that payroll goes out early if it's if it's New Year's Eve because they don't do payroll on holidays. And I had a check in my hand that was going to make payroll and I had to sprint to JP Morgan because they were going to close at five o'clock. It was like 455 and you know people say you were you were close to missing payroll. I was literally two minutes away from missing payroll. So, we didn't need every penny from a cash flow perspective because obviously media companies uh the accounts receivable on them. You might you might need 30 60 90 or 120 days just to get paid. So, we did need the money. But yeah, for a media venture, I don't think you should raise you should raise as little as humanly possible. I will I will say there is one thing I would have done differently and like one big lesson from that period and the raise. The first is we had 28 individual investors. So, we had 28 people who wrote checks from $2500 to $100,000. But if I was to do it again, I would have way fewer. Uh I would also try to sus out if these people are going to be difficult because we'll fast forward at some point, but there were some very difficult investors when we sold the business. The second is time is a crazy thing in startups and you always think you can get more done in a shorter period of time. And I remember we had a slide in our investor deck that showed our one-year plan to investors. And that slide, looking back on it now, took us nine years. We tried everything in that slide and took us 9 years to try everything. And most of those things did not work. But yeah, it took nine years to do accomplish our one-year plan. All right. So now we are in 2017. Do you remember we ended the year? I tell the story differently. I tell the story that we went from 100,000 to 500,000 in subscribers. I think I missed a year because I went back in 2017. We ended the year with 250,000 subscribers. We had 2.2 million in revenue, 400K was events, 1.8 was advertising. And my big learning that year was hiring a sales team. I did a I think I did the first year of ad sales and I was horrible at it. I didn't realize how uptight you had to be. You had to be like button up. I didn't know. I didn't understand this. Where were you guys at the end of 2017? Yeah. So 17 was the year that we were both full-time or I was only full-time half the year. We ended at 100,000 subs. We did $300,000 of revenue. We finally started taking a salary. We're taking 60k each. But that was the first real year. We hired our first We hired Tyler Denk who now is the CEO of Behive. I'm sure everyone listening knows Beehive. And he was transformational for us. What was his job? Everything. Dude, do you remember his Do you remember his first title, Austin? Do you remember? No. Growth engineer. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he did everything. And And between him and then we had Michael Schwarz, who also now works at Beehive, who was our first writer, and then we had he brought on Neil Fryman, who still works at Morning Brew today. He is I mean, like, look, Alex was the the visionary of the Morning Brew voice. But I do think Neil was really the the executor and took it to the next level. Neil is I think I spoke about him last time I was on the podcast. Neil was huge for Morning Brew. He he really did what Alex and I couldn't do, which was take this idea in our head and put it on paper every single day, 365 days a year for now 10 plus years. I also think Neil is a great example of what we did well at the Broom, what you did well at the Hustle, which is I think about our first three writing hires, Neil, Michael Schwarz, and then this uh woman Nikki, and all of them were non-traditional hires. Like I think both the Morning Brew and Hustle were really good at finding undiscovered talent and seeing a ceiling in them that other people didn't realize. And it was the same thing for you. Like I remember, we'll talk about it later, but like I watched your writers like a hawk. I could read a hustle story and knew knew who wrote it without seeing a name attached to the story and and I knew their backgrounds and none of these people were what media companies would traditionally hire as talent. Dude, I tried to recruit media people and they laughed at me. Like I emailed this one famous journalist and she said, "That's cute. Thank you." like like I I tried to and so the only people I could a afford and b convinced to do this stuff were like for example Lindsay Quinn was a blogger at like a procurement startup or something or I don't even like she was not a writer but she could write and wanted to write and you seldom on the dream of like wouldn't it be fun if you could do this hobby all the time and make money from it and that's the only people we could convince to join us. She was she was my writing hero. The number of times in my career I've tried to poach her is very nonzero. Yeah, she was fantastic. And this really fast forwards to 2018, but Alex isn't kidding. We knew every single writer you had. We knew and Alex in particular knew every single story who wrote them and and we would come to work every day, end of 2017, 2018. We would for the first two to three hours print out morning brew, print out Axios, print out the hustle, print out the skim, and with a paper and pen and Alex led the charge would go through every single story. He'd circle what he'd like. He'd exile what he didn't like. And look, Alex is the most likable person on the planet. You now know this, Sam. I'm sure a lot of listeners know how likable Alex is. The only person on the planet I know who doesn't like Alex is our first writer because Alex would sit there and just, you know, cross out half the words he put in the newsletter and be like, "Look, Lindsey Quinn wrote this same story better than you did. Like, be better." And it I mean, we were we were maniacal. We we were, you know, we lost our minds the gate. We we were crazy about this newsletter thing. And for the record, I didn't do that. And that's a regret. Like now that I'm older and understand how co company building works, like I would I would like if if you told me you were doing that, I'd be like, "You guys are insane. Just have fun. Do what feels good." But that does not like once you get past, I don't know, 5 million in revenue or something like that, you you could and that means you probably have some type of product market fit. You could absolutely iterate your way to being like wonderful, you know, starting like you're at a B or a C+. You can get yourself to A plus through iteration. And and honestly, I think a lot of me being maniacal with the content came from like what Austin had taught me along the way around standard setting. And basically this the standard of your business is what you allow. And so like if you allow suboptimal content to be written, that is the new standard you set. Like basically you're implicit by saying not saying anything to something you're implicitly saying that that is okay. And to me, that was my biggest fear is if I said okay to things that were not exceptional content, that was the new standard of our business. How old were you guys then during this era in 2018? I was 22, 23, right? Yeah. And I Yeah, I mean, I'm what, a year and a half older than you? Yes, you were 24. Dude, you guys were like I I'm I'm like what you guys are in when you were 22. Today, I am now a 22-year-old Austin and 22-year-old Alex. Like I totally buy into everything you're saying back then I completely would have laughed at you and your way but is 100% the right way like being it's crazy how mature you guys were at such a young age. Yeah. When we sat down at first to set our core values two and at the time I thought core values were fluffy. Now in hindsight I actually regret that we didn't you know write those in stone and keep those. We we we messed around with them a bunch. But two core values were really important was one have an ownership mentality. Act like you're an owner. And if you own something, you're going to every day critique it. You're going to give it feedback. You're going to care a ton. You're going to drive every single day to that. And the second is underdog mentality. We came into work every day a group of misfits. Uh a group of people who had no idea what they were doing in the media industry and we just act like an underdog. It's March Madness right now. And you just see that the way these underdogs show up to games. They're loose, right? They don't have this weight on their shoulders. And every day we came into work. And we were like, "Screw it. We are going to kick the [ __ ] out of all these legacy media companies who raised these," we would see $100 million of funding. Alex and I would would sit down, it's like, "What could you possibly do with $und00 million of funding?" And what they did is they burned it on fire and flushed it down the toilet and added no value to their companies. Yeah. I I I also I also just think it's like at the time Austin and I like we just had such a fire and I think for Austin, similar to you, Sam, like Austin kind of creates like an opponent in his head and that is enough to basically just create this like insatiable drive to win. I think for me, I actually have less of that, but the thing that compensated at the time was like the two things. It was like my my dad dying and feeling like I needed to provide for my family. And I told you this last time when we saw each other in person, Sam, like me being bullied from fifth grade to 12th grade and feeling like I just wanted to prove that I was like worthy, that was more than enough where I think even when the the brew was small, Austin and I had this like deep in our bones feeling that we were going to succeed. Like the business would ultimately sell and it was just a matter of time. That's what I've always admired about you guys was you have this really cool combination of optimism and pessimism where Austin is like afraid all the time yet like is logical enough to be like I'm going to do this this this and then like the likely outcomes are a b and c. Uh I did not feel that way. I I was I was a scarcity mindset. And so in 2018 you guys did 3.1 million in revenue. You had 10 employees. And how many subscribers did you have? So 2018 we went from 100,000 to a million subscribers. So, in 2018, I think we ended the year at uh 500,000 subscribers. We had 5.1 million in revenue. About a million was from events. Uh and I paid uh we had 160 grand in profit. And that was the first year that we spent on advertising. I went and looked back. So, we got to like 200,000 organically, and then we spent money on ads, and I spent a million that year. Did you guys spend money on ads that year to get to a million subscribers? We spent every penny we possibly could. I would track daily cash flow to make sure that we had enough money and we put I mean 2018 was the year for us. That was the year that I mean there were days in 2018 we were growing 20,000. You know this we would do these MacBook giveaways. We would grow 25,000 25,000 subscribers in a day. So, yes, we spent every dollar we could possibly find. And my only regret is we couldn't figure out a way to find more money to put more money into Facebook ads. Uh, if I remember by the end of that year, we were spending like 500K a month on ads, right? Yeah. At least. At least. That's crazy. Uh, I I was being I had such a poor mindset where I didn't look at it. You guys, because you had this finance background and also I think you are just more like this naturally anyway. you had this mentality of like, well, I I will spend $1 to make like if $1 turns into $1.1, I will spend every $1 I have. For me, it was like 80,000 a month, that's astronomical. It doesn't matter what the return is. Like, you know what I mean? Like, like that that was a failure. That that's an immature mindset. I also feel like part of it was like Austin and I were younger than you. We also like you know at the time we were only making 60k or I think we had upped our salary that year to 120k and I don't like I think part of maybe your mentality for the hustle was like this is kind of just like a cash flowing lifestyle business for me that I'm going to just like I can continue to pull money out of the business as like the the vast majority owner of it. I feel like Austin and I at the time weren't thinking about monetizing it for ourselves in the same way. Yeah. And Sam, I knew you thought that, right? Because, you know, a deal in Ribling, that whole thing just happened. And we certainly didn't have someone in your slap. But we would talk to all your former employees. We would get every bit of information we possibly could. And I knew that you had a profit threshold. You're like, I want to profit this every month. And I said, well, that means Sam's taking his foot off the gas. And so Sam's taking his foot off the gas. I'm going to do the opposite. We're going to Which is funny. We did I didn't make a lot of profit. I didn't actually make a lot of profit. uh like we grew revenue like 50% most every year but like I did not so I yeah and I think that you were talking about values I wish I would have so you know I think I think you guys matured earlier than I did I was still really immature um and I didn't codify my values and I didn't codify the culture I started the company when I was 24 25 and I I I think I evolved to where I am today when I was like 31 you guys were kind of like 31year-old Sam when you were 21 but had I done it over again and if you're listening I would codify your values early on and stick to it. Also, what a lot of people do is they buy ads cuz so back then, this was only, you know, a handful of years ago, back then it felt like buying ads was more like there weren't that many experts now to buy ads. It's like commonplace, like you you it's way more common. And so, uh uh people buy ads way earlier for their products now. And I actually think that's a huge mistake. Totally. Yeah, I totally agree. I mean, that's the part of the story that uh we didn't talk about is like we didn't do paid acquisition until 2017 really. So 2015 and 2016 to get to 100,000 subscribers, it was entirely organic growth. So by the time we actually were paying for subscribers, like we knew we had a great product. We knew how long subscribers were staying. We also knew how to like work within scarcity of not having money but finding ways to grow regardless. And I think that muscle of you skip over it is a really bad thing. Okay. And another thing that I learned that well I learned so I'll say in 2019. So we're in 2019 you guys did 3.1 million in revenue with 3 million in profit. 13.1 sorry 13.1 million in revenue 3 million in profit. A salary each of 250 a team of 25. We did about 8 million in revenue which uh with 640 being from events. We did profit of 200,000 but we did cash flow of 1.6. 6 million and we had uh and I'll explain why. So at that point I sort of switched the business to caring about cash flow and I had subs about 1.2 million and that year we launched this podcast Sean uh uh under the hustle name launched uh my first million this year in 2019 the thing I learned was that you know how like a lot of social media companies they're like who cares about revenue who cares about profit just grow your users. This was the year that I learned that to be true. That if you know that you make a certain amount of revenue per advertising uh via advertising or subscription per user, that's the only thing that matters. It's just getting more users. And I wish I would have understood that a little bit earlier. Yeah. I think what we learned this year was we started to see the plateau of not just newsletter growth, but of the economics of newsletters. Morning Brew got to a point where we started to ask ourselves, how much could you make on a single newsletter? I think it was $18 for us per subscriber, right? 50 cents a month for advertising maybe. That that sounds right. I don't know exactly. Yeah, 75 something like that. I I I think that that makes sense. But what we learned was at some point and the answer ended up being far far down the road. But we started to ask ourselves, you know, do we just want to be a single newsletter or or are we going to get to a place of diminishing returns from pumping more and more money and we were spending this year we probably spent6 to 7 million on paid acquisition. So we spent what you did in revenue almost just pumping growth back in and we started to ask ourselves does this make sense and that's where we learned about industry dies and we started to really take the approach of wait our audience works in retail they work in marketing they work in as CFOs or in finance uh what if we took that path the CPMs are higher you don't need to grow as fast it's not a race to the bottom it's more of an engagement play and so that's when we went into our industry verticals yeah And and what I would say is also that year I actually think of all the years in the business 2019 was the most important year. Um because that was the year when Austin and I I can't remember what month it was, but basically I would say Austin and I really never got in big arguments or fights in the history of the business. But in that year was the year that I could tell Austin was or a single day Austin was most upset with me because basically what I remember is Austin and I were still working in the business. Like we were in the freaking mud and all we could think about was like making sure the newsletter went out tomorrow, making sure we were getting an ad deal for Friday. Like we could not see a month or a quarter ahead of us. That's a really stressful time. Yeah. And I remember one day we're in Weiwork. I get a a message from Austin on Slack saying, "Hey, one of our investors who is this guy Scott who uh created the Snuggie um and he has a bunch of other products." He told Austin cuz Austin had asked him about like what are things what are resources you have to like operationalize your business and run your business and he goes I use this book traction and you're going to read it and you're going to adopt in your business. Austin read it and he gets back to me. Uh he messaged me in Slack and it's like, "Dude, you need to read this book yesterday and this is what we're gonna do." And I remember a day goes by and I did or a few days went by and I didn't read the book. And Austin messages me and says, "Did you read the book?" And I said, "No." And he says, "It's something along the lines of, I don't understand why you're not doing the thing that is the most important thing in our business right now." And I could tell for the first time that like he was actually pissed at me. So I went that day and I read the entire book. I did not work. I went to the the highest floor of our weiwork and just read the book. And I think a few things happened. One is traction was a gamecher for our business. I also think that really became the inflection point where Austin really took over as CEO of the business in kind of not in title but in uh action. Um and like I think it was a transformational year for the company. uh I read that book around the same era and it had the exact same impact on me and in fact on Tuesday it's Wednesday yesterday I hired an EOS impletor and I met with him yesterday to implement it into uh uh Hampton and so for those listening EOS it's called entrepreneurs operating system it's a framework to run your company it's based off a book called traction uh that's so funny that we all came across this at the same time yeah I'd love for you to do a full episode of my first million I think everyone was where you kind of do a postmortem and talk about how you implemented it uh reveal as much as you could because we didn't hire an implement. I thought it was a waste of of time and money. It's totally worth it and that's my biggest regret is not hiring an imple because I didn't want to be the bad guy. I didn't want to be the bully. You you basically spend you could say I don't know probably thousands of dollars $60,000 us like the guy I talked to it's 60 grand a year. Wow. Which by the way which by the way is why it's an unbelievable business. is basically like a digital franchising business. It's It's such a cool business. Yeah, it's but it's worth it. It's basically it's 60 grand a year. It's basically an executive coach organizer, but it's so funny that it happens. If you're running a company once you get to like the 5 to 10 million mark, that's where it's like, all right, what we're doing is mostly working at least good. Let's do more of it. and how do I do more of it without killing myself and creating redundancies and building a company and transition from going from a business to a company and that is where that book helped me 100%. Yeah. I kind of thought about it at the time as like first chapter of morning brew was newsletter as a hobby. Second chapter of morning brew was newsletter as a business and third chapter was like newsletter business meaning multiple newsletters and there was no way we were going to be able to do more than one newsletter unless we figured our [ __ ] out because we were too in the weeds. How many subscribers did you guys have at the end of 19? I'd say probably about two, right? We probably went from one to two, maybe from 1 to 1.8. But again, that year was defined as us maturing as a business. So Sam at the hustle, where were you in terms of maturation of you? You had you were doing more than we did. You had events and you had an ad business and you launched My First Million. Like how was the business actually being run? Oh, and I have to say we launched Trends that year. And so Trends was basically a $300 a year subscription where like I had this woman named Julie and Steph Smith write a weekly email and then we had a Facebook group where you could talk about like interesting companies. That's why we we started measuring cash flow cuz I learned the importance of building $300 upfront versus monthly. So at that point in the company, I just had so many like demons that I was still just getting out of and like what I learned about running a company at that era was that the issues that you have as a person transcend into like the company and I w I didn't have like you guys had each other each other as like right-hand man and I didn't have that like at the company where I could like confess to someone all the things I'm nervous about and so I ran the company using EOS and I had Brad, Adam, Ryan. So Brad did content, Adam did sales, I think I had Scott Nixon who did growth and I and I think we had one person who did events who I couldn't remember. And then I had Steph Smith who did trends. So I had five people who reported to me and I was kind of beginning to get a little checked out because I was so exhausted at this stage. You know, exhaustion kicks in around year four or five and I was starting to get dead from running the company and I just did not care anymore. Like Sean came to me wanting to launch MFM and I was like that's stupid. like I hated everything and I was like this is stupid but if you really want to do it you you know we'll be the publisher so we own it but uh show me an episode and he sent me the episode and I was like fine we'll do it and like but there was no and I published it the next week there was no planning there was nothing and I really was immature for not doing planning not having longer term thinking and for exhausting myself out yeah one one thing I'll say is I think in that year that you kind of felt like mentally toast and like a little lost like that that was the year that I felt the same way. I think for different reasons. Um the other thing that's I think just an interesting observation is like you you mentioned like Austin and I had each other as right-hand people as we're going through the business. And I think that's true to some degree, but I also think Austin and my relationship has evolved a lot over the years because I think we started the business so young that the way like when I co-ound a company now and the kind the level of direct communication and feedback to each other that I have with like even for storyard with my CEO, it looks very different than the way that Austin and I would give feedback to each other in the brew. And it's not because like it's not for any other reason other than we didn't have the maturity to speak with like radical cander and speak openly. I think we were like afraid about critiquing each other, giving feedback. And so I actually think at least for me a lot of my growth honestly came through like things like therapy or like dealing with it on my own. I It's funny. I think Austin and I as co-founders today will look so different than us as co-founders, you know, in 2016 through 2019. I will say for me I think my big mature like I I matured a lot during the sale process. We dealt with so much and so many different stakeholders and look Alex and I are really lucky like we grew up with with nice families and we started this business and basically from day one everything took off. like we had no hardship and the hardest part of running the business professionally. The hardest part of running the business was when we had the sale process and we had some investors who were pissed at us for selling too early. The same investors who 6 months early were begging us to sell. We had employees who felt as if they didn't own enough of the company. And and what you learn is when it's when you sell a company, there's a huge lump sum of money that's in a paper. And when everyone sees that lump sum, everyone starts thinking like, "Oh, how can I get mine? How can I get my money? Sure, I only own 0.25% of this company." But actually, I kind of view myself as a co-founder. I kind of view myself as more than worth.5% of this company. And I think I took that very personally. It was very hard. It was very hard for me. And at the time, I was I was a bull in a bull in a china shop, right? And I remember uh taking these calls and my my now wife was in the other room and I'm on the calls of these people and my wife goes like, "Austin, you're an asshole." And I'm like, "What do you mean?" She goes, "You're a total asshole." And I'm like, "But I'm right." And she goes, "You're totally right, but you can be right and not be an asshole." And I was like, "Oh, I I didn't know that was possible. I didn't know you like that. That was a thing." So I was just a total [ __ ] up until then. And I think I've matured a little bit since then. Well, you're still a bull in the China shop, but in a great way. The thing, you know, what I was telling you earlier was I would never want to have an argument with you. I don't want to fight with you because you will win a lot of times because you're so smart and you're you're uh you're just like intense. And so, let's go to the year 2020. The the year 2020 is the years we both sold. So, 2020, you did 20 million in revenue, 6 million in profit. We did uh uh 12 million in revenue and I forgot how much profit we did but we had about three million in cash and we had 1.5 million subs. I think you had three and the beginning of that quarter Q1 we were probably in the same spot. I thought we were going out of business. Co hit. We thought I thought it was over. Did you think that? Yeah. I mean I it's very interesting like I can remember with these big moments like exactly where I was pacing in a room talking to Austin. Like I literally remember pacing back and forth in my now in-laws main room talking to Austin. We were talking about one of our biggest sponsors who is a financial uh services company that I can't remember the exact number but let's just say it was like they had an uh $75,000 sponsorship coming the next day and the day before as CO was starting they canceled it. So, right, $75,000 gone in one conversation. And then basically the floodgates opened. And I can't remember the exact amount, but let's just call it like in a period of a few weeks, 30% of all revenue that we had booked vanished. And I remember Austin and I going back and forth being like, how the hell are we going to make enough money to just not fire people? I remember the first lever we pulled is we basically turned paid acquisition, paid marketing down to zero. But him and I literally like we brainstormed everything from starting a Patreon and asking people to donate all the way to our education business. Like we ended up launching an education business at the brew, which we've since shuttered. But the reason that started was to bring in short-term cash. And that first education thing was a partnership with Scott Galloway when he was starting section for his section 4. We did the same thing. We did um an educ like a course and it made $300,000 in one month and it like helped save us. And that was the year that I learned what the word force majour meant. Um, and uh, it was crazy. I I uh, I thought we were going out of business. And I remember you guys had just signed like a $80,000 a month like office lease. And I was like, "Yeah, I hope this brings them down. I hope this is their downfall." And I remember during this era, I remember I got a um one of our advertisers who we shared because when we got going, something we didn't say earlier, advertising in newsletters wasn't really much of a thing. We had to convince like early adopters to give it a shot. And so we had a lot of the we had shared advertisers and I would beg them like, "Show me their click-through rate versus our click-through rate." And what I learned was like it was basically like the same for a lot like it wasn't like significantly different. But the fir the first half of that year I thought we were going to go out of business. The second half everything [ __ ] boomed. It was crazy. That was it was like the business was booming. Like our trends thing was selling like crazy. People were spending like crazy. It was a boom. And we ended up getting um like I remember we got what was that called where the government gave you money like P something? Yeah. P. Yeah. We like got some of that money because our events business got shut down entirely. And I was like, I don't I don't know how I'm going to make payroll. And then it turned out I'm like, damn, I kind of feel bad because we killed it. We killed it that year. Like it felt great. I remember the emotional journey of the acquisition was crazy for Austin and I because our I don't know how long your sale process was, but our 90 days. It was uh it was LOI. LOI to LOI to closing was 90 days, but then there was like 30 or 60 days of flirting. Yeah. So, ours looked completely different. Our process like end to end was 11 months. So, the first conversation with the person at um on the Axel Springer side of things was November of 2019. And I remember we first got deal terms. I can't remember when it was, but let's just call it like January or February. March. Axel or from who? Yeah, from Axel. And I remember what happened was in March, world shuts down. There's a period of 3 weeks where Austin and I are like, forget a deal. We don't even know if we're going to have a business. And then after those three weeks, starting in April, everything ripped. And we went from Austin and I being like like we not that we don't even think we're going to have a deal. We don't even know if we're going to have a company after this, too. We're way underpriced. We're doing so well. Are we even being uh paid appropriately for how much the business is ripping now? And that roller coaster in those three or four months was insane. It so we both sold that year. The sales process that was the most intense part of my life. It was horrible. Like it was so miserable. I was so bummed for like almost every day for 3 months. Um, this woman who works with me, her name's Edie, she still works at HubSpot, I believe. I hired her earlier that year or maybe a few months before CO hit and she was probably 63 or 65. She basically had birthed her daughter a little bit later in life in her 40s and was like, "Now that my daughter is 20, I'm going to go back to work to prove to her that young women can kick ass." And I was like, "Hell yeah, you're the best. I'm going to I would love to hire And so she was like our HR person and our accountant person and she was great. But then I learned during the deal process like I would we would be on a meeting with like me HubSpot which had like six people KPMG accountants six people and then six lawyers. So it's like uh that would have been like it like like like a $20,000 meeting. And I hear Edy and I kind of see her bring her iPhone up and take a picture. And I was like, "Edie, what the hell are you doing?" And she was like, "I don't know how to take a screenshot on my computer and they're talking about Dropbox and I don't know how to use Dropbox, so I'm trying to like take pictures." I'm like, "Edie, I got to teach you how to use Dropbox, man." So, and she's like brilliant. She like nailed it and she was so good at her job, but she didn't know some of the technical stuff like using Dropbox. So, I had to teach her during this process. And I'm like, I can't tell them that. Like, we This is how scrappy we are. Wait, did you use a banker? Dude, I hired a banker. So, the first time I tried to sell, I hired a banker and we ended up getting an offer from Vice and it was an all stock offer. Thank God I didn't take that. And I And you be working at McDonald's. Oh my god. It like I went to tour the office and like no one was there and I was like where is everyone? And they were all in sexual harassment training because like incidents there were like so common. I'm like you guys suck. And so I hired a banker for that and I hated it. And then I always thought that HubSpot or a company like that should buy us. And they reached out to me. And um I was like, I don't need a banker. Like I'm going to negotiate this. When I started the company, my goal is to make $20 million by the age of 30. I was like, as long as I make that, I don't care. And the deal allowed that to happen. And so I didn't hire a banker. Um and I actually talked to Kip, the CMO of HubSpot, and he told me that he tried buying you guys. And he was like, I wanted to buy both of y'all and own the business newsletter space. And he was like, but they were too far along. and you guys hadn't talked to anyone, so I knew we were going be be able to buy you, but not them. Yeah. So, I don't know if Kip is totally being truthful there. I think Kip wanted to buy us. I got the impression at the time that they weren't going to make a $120 million bet on on email newsletters. they were really interested, but because we did a better job of monetizing each subscriber, you know, we were more expensive and the hustle didn't care or HubSpot didn't care about uh that extra revenue like, you know, okay, it's or profit, right? What's $10 million of profit to the the HubSpot? They cared about our users, right? The classic vertical integration. And I think that you you said you always thought you were going to sell to HubSpot. I always thought we were going to sell to Fidelity or Erade or uh Robin Hood. I thought it made so much sense as an acquisition play and as a retention play. And uh you know we we we pitched Alex and I were talking about this last night. Sam, I don't think I've ever told you this story. I definitely haven't told it in the podcast, but we pitched uh SoFi, and the CEO of SoFi at the time was formerly the CEO or COO of Twitter, I think, Anthony Notto, and he really liked us or at least liked the business. And we went, we pitched a group of executives at SoFi, and it's over Zoom. This is during COVID. And I'm like, Alex, this is our pitch. Like, this is our moment. We're going to sell for hundreds of millions. We're get all this stock in SoFi. And it's going crazy. And we pitched him for 15 minutes. And the woman, I'm not kidding, dead pans, looks at Alex and goes, I don't get it. And I'm like, which part? And she's like, why would we buy you guys? I don't get the whole thing. And I was like, well, you know, content to commerce. We have an audience. And the the other guy, like the head of business development, flips the the background of his screen and he shows SoFi Stadium, right? He shows that their big stadium and he goes, "300 million eyeballs a year." I'm like, "What?" He goes, "That's how many people see this stadium? You think we want 3 million emails? What are we going to do with 3 million emails?" And that was the entire call. What a douche that they Your wife should have talked to them. That's insane to me. But but I think Alison Austin, I feel like you made a good point about like just the lesson in incentives there. Yeah. I mean, at the end of the day, we were telling the the marketing team of a company, we can market your product better than you can. You know, what CMO, what head of marketing is going to buy a company unless they have a ton of humility if they believe that our pitch is we can do your job better than you can? And and I think that she was pretty fearful. And so that's why that's why that deal didn't go through. So, you know, and we couldn't even get in touch with the Fidelities of the world, the E Trades, the world. they they didn't ex like that wasn't even a conversation. So that's when we went to to more uh media buyers like Axel Springer who already had made the offer and and a few others. Uh and look, we we we shopped I don't know about you. I'm curious how many conversations you had. We shopped it to everyone and we got no we shot it to all traditional media companies. No one was interested. Hurst her hurst wasn't interested. Like New York Times wasn't No media people were interested. And frankly I hate the media industry. So I was kind of happy. Yeah. And that's part of the reason we sold is we were we were I mean a couple hours before we signed we were unsure. I was talking to all these people getting all this advice but we came back to we own the vast majority of the company and we didn't get a single offer in writing from another company and that was just terrifying to us. We said what if Axel Springer goes away and we're never going to be able to sell this company. Of course in hindsight that's not true but at the time you're so scared. It was a, you know, we made a a decision. I think it was the right decision in hindsight, but we did it partly because we were scared. Can I All right, I want to rattle off the So, my story ends there. In 2020, we sold um you guys sold half the company and then later sold the rest. I want to rattle off the future numbers, but then I want to talk about like future stuff, like what people listening can learn. So, 21 you did 46 million in revenue and 10 million in profit. 22, 70 million in revenue, 10 million in profit. 23 was the same numbers. And so I imagine the business now is in the 70 80 90 million range, something like that. But you guys aren't um owners anymore. What do you think people doing now? Newsletters are really popular. So I remember when Substack started, I thought it was the dumbest idea ever. I chose not to invest in Beehive. I thought that was a silly idea. I was wrong about both of those things. What do you think that the people starting now are getting wrong and where's the opportunity in your opinion in the space? I think the number one thing that people get wrong is they view this arbitrage that we had in 2017 and they think it exists today. They think the same economics exists today cuz they read a blog post that Tyler Dank wrote in 2018. the value of a subscriber is significantly less than it was when we started because there are so many newsletters out there. Uh and people forget that the most important thing it goes back to what did we do in 2018? We printed the newsletter out every day and we were not maniacal over the content. Every person out there I see now on on beehive not 99% like oh here's an untapped market. let me write like C++ or B minus content and let me use all these growth hacks and I'm gonna get to a million subscribers and I'm gonna sell all these ads. And then they get to half a million or a million subscribers that they can and their ads don't sell for $50,000, they sell for $3,000 and the economics don't work because there's not enough engagement because the content's not good enough. And so just people aren't focusing on the content. It's all about the content. That'd be like selling a SAS product and the the the code not being very or the product not not working that well. Like you have to focus on the content first. Everything else follows. Yeah. Uh I would just add on and Austin and I have obviously talked about this at length, but the more niche the better. Like the internet is just this long tale of millions of niches and the more niche you go especially if you pick the right niches. Not only can you get higher CPMs and I would argue that like in this advertising pullback that has happened for like the brew or just media companies in general B2B has been less impacted. But the other part about it is you know the trouble we had at morning brew which I think you had less of at the hustle is we didn't know we could not figure out how to monetize our audience directly. We tried everything. We tried selling uh merch to them. We tried the education product. we couldn't figure out a good solution for your audience. Like I think Huzzle Trends was a really smart product for your audience. The more niche you go, I think the more clear it becomes how you can directly monetize your audience. I think um a big thing to learn for people starting now is my strategy was partially right, partially wrong. The strategy that I had, I hated advertising. I remember, do you guys remember how like the sales guys always wear jeans and a plaid shirt and these bright brown shoes? I remember I bought a pair of those brown shoes and I wore them to one meeting in New York and I took them off at the end of the meeting and I threw them away and I like went home in my socks. I was like, I'm never wearing these [ __ ] brown shoes that tech salespeople wear ever again. I will never wear these brown shoes. I just like distinctly remember that. Uh cuz I hated it. And so I was like, I want to create products to sell to my audience. And what a lot of people get wrong about that is they go outside. So like, you know, I think Adam and Becca at workw week wanted to sell like software products or something like that. And uh that strategy that they and many other people if who or I don't even know if they did do it but whoever wants to try and do that it will almost always fail because in order to make a business like this work where you sell stuff to your audience you almost always have to be it has to be within your core competency of content. And if the founder is not like what Mark Zuckerberg was to Facebook of being like a tech wizard, you need to be that about content. Otherwise, it's not always but almost always. Otherwise, the the business sucks. And so I think that for the people listening, if you are going to build something, go super hard on content. Make money via advertising, which is the right thing to do. And then if you do make money in other ways, you will almost always want to make money in ways that fit within like the eeky guy of like your company's core competency and what the world wants is some type of contenty media thing. Yeah, we we see it all the time uh where people start a media company, they try to sell a product and it's really hard because you're pivoting from a content company to a product company or software company. I it's really really tough. It's like Buzzfeed like doing um um haven't they tried like making ovens or something like that? Yeah, with Tasty they had like their entire cookware brand. Yeah. I think at the end of the day it's like basically you you just are adding so much complexity to your business especially the more you get out of your core cuz it's like people like a media company and content like content is the product. A media company is a business. Then what you're basically saying is you want to create an entirely different business. And now what you need to figure out is the entirely different business. Is the product exceptional? Do you have someone who understands it deeply who can run it? Then the media side, can you keep that going in the right way? And then also, is there an intersection where your audience not only trusts you, but trusts the thing that you're now selling them? That's a different product. Like there are so many more moving pieces. What else for um uh different um opportunity you guys had on here that you being based in New York helped? I agree with that. It helped you guys a lot. I think being like if you are an AI company, being in San Francisco is beneficial. If you are a media or content company, being in New York is beneficial. I think that was huge for us. I think if you want to build a a big brand uh in media, you have to be where the ad agencies are. And I mean, Alex was just grinding going to ad agencies, meeting with people, talking to people. If he lived in Austin, those people weren't there. He was never going to be able to meet with them in person. Yeah. It's like you're you're way you're you're not in it to win it if you are not in New York. Yeah. One other thing I would say is like I think actually Sam, you and I um feel differently about newsletters now. Like I know kind of your perspective is like newsletters are so much harder. You you wouldn't necessarily do it today. My my general view is like I feel like we're like past early of every media channel on planet Earth. Like I don't think anything's early anymore. like podcasts have been saturated, YouTube's been saturated, newsletters have been saturated, like everything is harder in my mind. So, I think like the game overall has become harder. Um, that said, I still think there are going to always be opportunities, especially in a niche that you know a lot about to succeed. So, like I would say um I am still bullish on newsletters as a way of owning your audience. I just think the the level you have to play the game is higher than where we had to play the game. Um, one other just random thought is I used to always hate the news business. Like I thought the news business was such a bad business to be in because you need so many people to crank out content. The economics are horrible. I would actually argue with kind of where we are in society now and you know rel like general distrust of news broadly of traditional news broadly. I think there's a ton of opportunity to actually disrupt news as an upstart and I think we've seen that with like Barry Weiss and the free press and I think we'll see more of that over the next few years. So here's want to know what one of my takes on is for like where interesting opportunities are. I I would bet my life I bet my life you guys agree with me. Um quarterly or monthly hardcover magazines or some type of physical newsletter. Yeah, I love that. I almost made so we did Moneywise a podcast about it's like a personal finance podcast for high net worth people. I almost made that uh I was going to make it a $500 $2,000 a year uh shows up quarterly in a manila envelope with stapled printer paper but really well-written articles to keep it like like to feel like a mom and pop type of like underground zen. That's what I thought about doing and I still think someone could pull that off. Have you seen uh Arena Magazine? Is that the thing you love? Yeah. So, I think it's really cool. Uh it's this guy Max Mayor. I believe he worked at 8VC with Joe Longdale and he started this magazine. It's quarterly now. I don't I can't tell you if it's going to be a big business, but they tell the coolest stories and it's beautiful. like this thing is done, you know, like a magazine from 20 or 30 years ago where you're selling super high gloss paper and the graphics are amazing and then you're probably charging a $7,000 CPM to some beauty brand that it's amazing and Stripe is making these really cool ads and ramp. It's it's awesome. Everyone should should check out Arena May. What I would do is so you said beautiful. I would make it the opposite of beautiful. I would pick an industry that has a lot of employees, whether it's like the financial advisory industry or the advertising world industry, something where there's like a hundred or a few hundred thousand people, but you are only one or two degrees separated from each person. And the whole name of the game would be name as many names as possible and as many companies as possible in it. And so you would want to like buy it for all of your staff and you would have like rankings like the top this person this quarter and it would because it was almost like the difference. Do you remember when Oscar started advertising in the subway versus on like a computer? If for some reason when you see Casper out in the open versus on Facebook, you think, "Oh, wow. This is like way more legit and exciting." I would do that right now for an industry and I would name as many names as possible. So they would just be paying money an annual fee per year just to have their name on paper. Yeah. The par 30 under 30. Something like that but for like financial adviserss or something but I hate financial advisors. So it would be like like you all suck but here's the least sucky ones. Uh any other interesting opportunities that you want to bring up? I think that's I mean the media space I I I think that's it for like the newsletter stuff. I I still think the big opportunity in the media space. If someone wants to take a big swing, someone wants to go build a billion-dollar company, it's to do what we're talking about in or what the hustle did, right? Use content to build something like a trend, but do it to the extreme. So, I think the best example right now, look at what Overtime's doing. O Dan Dan Porter who's been on the show is amazing, right? And for the first three years of this business, I didn't get it at all. I said, "Over time." I thought it was so stupid. So dumb. I was like, "This guy is an idiot. He left all these awesome jobs. He could do anything." And he built another company off a ton of funding and all he did was just put sports on social and next thing you know, he's doing basketball tournaments. I'm like, "Huh, that's like kind of cute." And then he's running a league that's trying to compete with college basketball. And I'm like, "Holy [ __ ] this guy is on a different level. He's trying to compete with the NCAA and the NBA. That's a big swing." like you know if if in a couple years I build another big company I would think like that right whether it's you know basketball like that or or pedel I think is really interesting or there's people now thinking about doing in tennis there are so many interesting niches where you can go take a massive swing and try to compete with you know the biggest organizations in the world yeah I have I have uh a few I want to add on top of that the first is a media company focused on alternatives what's an alternative alternative to what? Like alternative investments. So like real estate, private equity, venture, etc. Like my whole thing is alternative investments are becoming a bigger part of people's portfolios, but they're more opaque. They're harder to understand, but they're also really interesting ways to monetize uh people who are investing in alternatives. I think basically a company that becomes like the go-to source for figuring out the complexity of investing in alternative assets is going to make a killing. I think that's uh the first. The second is basically for a long time Austin and I talked about how a an amazing way to monetize our audience if we could figure it out would be like our version of Mly Fool. And the reason we never did it is like Mly Fool's built an incredible business. Yeah. But but but our thing was like the marketing just does not feel good to us. And so I think if someone can figure out how to support retail investors in a way that makes them smarter about not losing their money in the markets and media is just like you know the funnel to it. Even like when we were at that newsletter conference two weeks ago, right? And James Alter was talking about what he makes on his premium thing. He said he made a hund said it on stage. He said $120 million a year in revenue. Yeah. And so, so I think that is still a massive opportunity as well. Um, this is awesome, guys. Thanks for doing this. Um, how do you feel? Feel good. That was like therapy for me. That was the most therapy I've done in my life, I think. But for the record, you know, I I never hated you guys. I hated the story that I made up of you. And um, for the listener, over the past like three or four years, Austin and I have become very, very close where our families are hanging out on Saturday. Um, Alex, you and our we did a family hang two weeks ago. I have nothing but love for you guys. I consider you guys family and you're some of my closest friends. And so, it's it's been fun to to get soft instead of like, you know, wanting to uh compete because now that I know more about you guys over the past like 10 years, I don't want to ever compete against you ever again. You guys are very formidable and not people I want to go against. It was horrible. Nothing but love from our side. Yeah. quite the 180 from 2018. It was all a story which by the way I think if you're listening to this and you have a company having that story was so helpful. Yeah. Like going having an enemy was so helpful even if it's made up. Um it's funny you say that. I will use this time uh to plug my new newsletter that's launching and one of my first newsletters that I I've written is about enemies and I think having an enemy whether it's real or fake, right? For us, it was the skin, then the hustle. I think it's really, really important. Um, you know, Beehive has Convert Kit. Uh, and I think it just motivates everyone just a little bit more. And I know Nathan and he's the sweetest guy ever. I've gotten to know Tyler a little bit and he seems like a wonderful guy. And I'm like, I'm not going to start stop you guys from fighting because I think a fight's good. And also, I know that you're both wonderful people and you would love each other in a different world or when this is all done, but you ha I'm like, you have to have that. So, I'm on board. which ju just six six years from now, one of them is going to have a podcast, my first email, and they're going to both be on it, and it's going to be all hugs. What's your thing, Austin? Where do they get it? You can just find in my Twitter DMs or sorry, my Twitter uh bio. Well, I appreciate y'all. And uh thanks for doing this. If you Google your name, Austin, by the way, it's that stupid photo of you guys on the white wall that you've been using for like 15 years, and it's your last episode of My First Million. So, it's funny how we have all come to work together. Um, all right. We appreciate y'all. That's it. That's the pod. Thanks. [Music]

In the 1920s, there was this guy. He was the mushroom king of America. And he had to rent a cave and grow mushroom. And for some reason, those damn Europeans started undercutting them and started selling cheaper mushrooms. And he was like, "My mushroom business is going to go under. I got to figure out what to do." He bought a bank vault door and he installed it in his cave, went to a local bank and was like, "Hey, you guys have a lot of paperwork. I have the safest place on earth to store the this paperwork." And he started this thing called Iron Mountain. Google Iron Mountain Market Cap, $30 billion company. Since 2000, they have created a billion dollars at least per year in free cash flow and they now own 80 million square ft of storage. They have everything. Princess Diana's Will is in there.

all right you want to do a little intro here's a little beh Bes behind the scene tips or look as you can see I can't talk that well so I asked Sean to do all the intros yeah today when we're live is a bold choice to do the intro yourself this time yeah I'm not the intro guy I've got I say I got a thick tongue I can't say certain words all right what's up let's say what's up to people in the chat we got RJ oo boy aam Ryan Hoover what's up D Ryan Hoover my guy always supporting always supporting us I really appreciate that Ryan I was with Ryan the night before he launched product hunt and I thought it was a horrible idea and I was like a social network for products it sounds so lame and he launched it and he totally proved me wrong not only that a few weeks before that he had been interviewing at our company I wanted to hire him it didn't end up working out he launches he tells me he's launching product time after it launches I call him two weeks later uh um and I was like Hey like you know I don't know how you're feeling about that whole thing but I got this new idea for a role I tried to recruit him again and he was like no I think I'm going to see this thing out and then it exploded and became the coolest thing in silic Valley for like it was awes to see firsthand um all right someone just said you're a smoke show this is why we don't this is why we don't we don't let Arian camera she she shows us up all right so what are we doing we're doing a live AMA people have been tweeting us questions there's people in the chat we're we never do this live but we're going to do it today and um let's see how it goes so AR you're gonna read the questions me and Sam are gonna answer let's pop this is so distracting by the way with all this chat in here it's gonna be really challenging to like look it's so distracting that I just said let's pop that's not even a phrase like I'm the Pringles man let's pop uh all right first we're going to do some role play so this comes from poo he said hey guys so I'm 16 rejected a 600k offer for my 25k a month agency and launched an aib B2B SAS which hit about 6.5 Mr in the first 31 days I'm curious how would you guys go about reducing churn for an AI SAS this is a we're starting off with a you started with the worst question all right first of all you ready all right there's a dock where we said yes to questions those are the ones you're supposed to read Sean you under that you said I'm ready for this one oh wait no that was the one okay scrap that we're going to say okay yeah we got to start with the new one also that question by the way that's like at those conferences where somebody raises their hand to ask a question but actually there's no question it's a statement and it's a brag he's like I'm 16 years old I'm already rich I just rejected an acquisition offer oh my side project Mr is up my question is what's up okay we're going to we're going to dumb it down if coding is no longer a skill to master what would you advise an 18-year-old to focus on learning and this question comes from denesh palala which is hell of a name um all right so Sam do you want to go first or you want me to go first my I got to think of a non-stereotypical answer that I'm GNA say what what would yours be okay so the question is basically if he said if coding is no longer a skill to master what would you advise an 18-year-old to focus on learning okay so to me here's here's how I think about it first I would Zig when everyone else is zagging because I reject the premise of the question I don't think it's true that coding is no longer a valuable thing to do and if that's what smart people think I would be really excited right now have you have you guys tried to use like repli and all this stuff you you need to know how to code yeah exactly you go on there and you could kind of half make something that doesn't work right go open cursor and see what happens it's not like you just magically oneshot your dream app that's not how it Works um and even if you pro project five years down the road let's say it's true that you can basically command the AI to build things it's not going to be perfect um and you know I think what that actually says is if you actually know how to code maybe it's not about typing all of the syntax but it's about understanding how to think in programming terms how to build things U you're going to have a army of robots a fleet a fleet of robots at your command it made you 10 or 100 times more productive so I think that's the first first thing I would do I would also say like look if you're 18 years old it's not about picking the right thing if you're 18 years old all this is about is figuring out what are you interested in going at it really hard and learning how to learn because the world is moving way too fast for any one thing to just stay King coding might be automated in the future might be partially automated in the future you just got to get obsessed with being adaptable you need to master the mental models that run the world you know I would focus on the things that don't change so if technolog is changing really fast humans and the human brain doesn't change very fast so if you understand human psychology behavioral economics if you understand uh how to sell to people how to persuade those are the things that are not going to change and if you're 18 years old I think that's where you want to um sharpen up your skills that's exactly what I was thinking of saying there's a book called um influence by Robert Chini Sean have you ever read that book I have and it's a classic I read that book when I was around 18 or 19 something like that and it honestly changed my life um like a lot of like 16 17 18y olds I was trying to just like meet girls and I was like how do I persuade them into uh going on a date with me but I read that book and I've used that book more for business than anything that got me into copyrighting things like that uh I would read that book and then a hard skill that I wish I knew all the time that I'm like struggle with I wish I knew how to uh design web pages like landing pages like literally like um uh like make the pages look great I know how to persuade people with my words I always regretted that I didn't know how to like do at least some type of front-end code and some type of light design work were you ever in that boat oh 100% and I you know I I taught myself Photoshop and sketch and figma just enough to be able to annoy the designers but now if I was doing that again you know you don't need those anymore you could basically skip to lovable or one of these AI Tools in fact if you're 18 years old and you said how do I spend the next four years years of my time best preparing me to be successful in life which arguably is what college should be doing right I think you would get way better bang fore Buck if you just spent two years obsessively playing with all the AI tools trying to build little prototypes trying to solve little problems for people and you would get way further ahead it's just that you don't get the fancy degree and you don't get a stamp on your resume um but you would actually learn some pretty ridiculous things so let's go to this next question Sean it says let's imagine your kids are hitting College in the next couple years forget degrees what set of experiences would you encourage them to collect to be the most AI resilient when they graduate and yes for mere morals do not say uh starting an AI company or winning a teal Fellowship can I tell you something that I realized uh you're you did an interview with Joe lale that was really really great and I loved it and I've noticed a pattern amongst our favorite my favorite guests on here is they're not just thoughtful but many of them have a philosophy background and I used to think that getting into a philos Philosophy degree was kind of silly I thought what are you just going to teach philosophy but looking I was trying to connect the dots the other day of all the people who I like dude they're really fascinated in philosophy have you noticed that who who comes to mind so Joe's one so I was listing out people who I think are unique thinkers and who are really thoughtful and I made a list and uh Peter teal Joe Lonsdale uh karp these guys are all in the same like crew which makes sense but like the way that they're thoughtful but also the way that they go against the grain and they are very logical about things which is important because I think as humans uh we're emotional beings and we should lean into the emotion sometimes but in order to like get past certain fears uh you have to be very logical and you have to think it's no big deal if I'm made fun of or if I'm mocked for doing this because if you look at like like you can like logic your way into like starting something do you know what I mean yeah I I although I think that you can't just go into something saying oh I think this is what successful people do or this will make me successful because it's what other people did I think other people what they actually did was they followed their interest and they didn't care what other people thought and I think the job of a of the individual is to First dabble and date to figure out what are you actually into you might think you're into something but you need to dabble in date do you like blonds do you like brunettes do you like people who who are wired this way do you like people with this side do you like this type of video game do you like that type of video game the only way you know is by first going and actually like trying out a bunch of things and being really broad with that and then the second job after you dabble in date is to Double Down regardless of what it looks like to the outside so you know if your thing is that you love um you love League of Legends and you really want to get great at League of Legends great get let yourself get obsessed with something for a period of time um and of course there's some healthier obsessions than others right like Fitness is a really healthy Obsession people can get into um but I think more than anything just become the type of person who figures out what they're interested in figure out your taste palette and then double down on him and then let things um let things play out as they naturally would I think if you're trying to try to do what Peter teal did that worked for Peter teal I don't think that's necessarily what you should do for yourself did you I think you just created something you said uh dabble and date double down now we need a we need one more D and then we're GNA have your whole philosophy completely lined up Sean's Double D philosophy yeah yeah that sounds right uh so you met uh so you met Logan Yuri our good friend uh she's my my wife's uh best buddy and so she's like family to me she did a podcast the diary of the CEO and she was talking about dating and uh you know I'm not going to like brag or anything but she explicitly named me as a good example of how to date uh a successful person and uh you know marry above your your your league so I'm just stating the facts that I was this dating experts uh example of how all the Nerds can effectively do this should I go endorse you on LinkedIn right now is that what this is yeah I told you to read Robert chini's influence book so like it worked um okay what about another one Ari all right this one Sean said he was he was ready for so here we go uh this is from routa if you had to make a million dollars in 12 months starting from zero but here's the here's the catch you're only allowed to use your phone no laptop no network no investing what steps would you take uh Sean how many of your followers are Indian I mean that's a tough question have youever have you ever looked on Twitter demographics no dude no let's just say 20% why would you get that 20% that's it I don't know I think does it tell you how is there a Twitter analytic of how many of your viewers are Indian because that'd be amazing if there is uh I there used to be there yeah there was like which country are they in because I think you're uh incredibly popular in India I think I think you're the type of guy that many young Indian boys like want to be like when they grow up I can't tell if you're complimen me or insulting me but I'll take it either way it's a huge compliment people people look up to you okay so then what uh is that just I just the question all the best qu all these questions are Indian guys all right so rud ask what is he asking he said basically you want to make a million dollars in a year and you have no existing network no connection you can't just invest the money to get there and you're only starting with a cell phone is that right Sam you hate this type of question do you even have an answer otherwise I'll give you the answer dude I hate these questions it's just nobody wants to hear you wi about it I I do you like these questions yeah because I also would have asked this question when I was younger so like I get it like I get it people want to you know it's like called my first million and we talk about everything except for except for how to make make a million dollar so I understand the frustration there it's it's no I'm frustrated because you're you're Sean's interest in set is so different than rudas you know what I mean so like how are you supposed to like do the same thing sure sure that's true I think there's many ways to do it okay so here's how I would do it let's just put it that way okay so the question is how do you make a million dollars in one year using just one cell phone you don't you don't have you can't use your existing Network or reputation I think that this is one of those riddles where the cell phone is a is a red herring right it's like you know you think about oh I have a phone so I have social media I guess I should try to do things on Tik Tok and you suddenly end up in some corner of the world you don't want to be in you're you're suddenly doing dance routines on Tik Tok um have you ever done that by the way you ever have you ever secretly not uploaded but tried to do a dance TR no man do I seem like I would do that yeah yeah you do like I do a lot of really lame things I mean I collect denim but I do I will not dance in front of a camera bro You' privately texted me your skateboarding trick trick videos so you know do you're only one step away but I'm not I I'm not there but yes I I I have my flaws but dancing is not in front of a camera is not one of them all right so I'm saying ignore the phone the fastest way to make a million dollars is to make somebody else $20 million and then try to take a 5% fee right because you're not going to be able to build a business or let's say you could build a business but you're taking a lot of product risk Market risk Etc along the way what I would try to do is I would Target people who are doing big deals and I would try to broker a deal with them so what I'm thinking about here is uh people who are doing real estate people doing private Equity people who are owner trying to sell their business somebody who's doing a 10 20 30 million dollar deal and I would go to them and offer them a no-risk structure so like hey I know you're trying to sell your business if I can bring a buyer to the table and you actually end up doing the deal with them would you cut me a commission on the sale um same thing with real estate hey if I was able to find your property and underwrite the deal do an analysis and it's a deal you actually end up doing would you pay me a finder fee for doing the deal um because it's pretty shocking how much you know a broker or a salesperson will get as a commission for big ticket deals and uh so I would spend a year hustling my ass off trying to broker a deal for some I would try to find what the what that person is looking for somebody who's already playing in big dollar amounts um you could you could do this very easily by the way you could look up in your area who are the most successful real estate developers and you can go and you can meet with them you can find out what's in their buy box so what do they look for and you could say you could after this say hey you don't have to pay me anything I would love to learn this industry I'd love to bring you deals and um and if you do a deal I would love it if you would cut me a you know a commission in that would that be something you'd be open to and by the way somebody did this for me uh a 15-year-old did this for me back in the day he said I'll show I'll go Scout for Venture deals and if I find a deal that you do would you cut me a finder fee I said yeah sure if I if I end up doing a deal because I really like it fantastically and you're going to go work for free no no problem um and look I think your odds of actually doing this and pulling this off are still pretty low I think you're a 10 to 20% chance you know one in 10 or one in five chance of actually making a million dollars doing this way in a year uh but that's better than most and the good thing about this is that you still you might have only a 10 or 20% chance of making a million dollars but you have a 100% chance of building a really good Network learning how really smart successful people think what deals they like what deals they don't like what they're looking for um to learn how to hustle how to do research how to do sales how to write deal memos how to like think in a logical structure format and you're going to find some rich guy who ends up liking you and looking at you and being like I wish my son was this motivated and you're they're going to take you under their wing and so I think you have a 100% chance of good things happening in your life um and you have a small but you know possible chance of actually uh actually cutting a deal and and getting a fee of maybe it's 250,000 500,000 or a million dollars so go to modernize.com so modernize.com it used to be called something else um I forget what it used to be called but basically it's a website for uh they say empowering professionals and homeowners from inquiry to install meaning uh you need an HVAC company they um have reviews for them and you are a homeowner you submit your information to their website and then an HVAC company will contact you and the HVAC company call pays modernize $200 for giving you that information so listen to uh this is the play off what you were saying about making someone money do you remember that time I uh was I I told you this time about I had this like 20-year-old over to my house to in like set up my camera and he had he was charging companies I think he was charging them $500 a month or $1,000 a month in a retainer then he would get a portion of all the sales that he sent to a company and it was like a it was like a it was like someone who would repair driveways and my buddy built websites that said something like you know will repair your driveway or we'll like send you a contract send a contractor your way and he bought an ad on Google so if you Googled San Jose driveway repair uh you know he would contact you to the a driveway company he had contacted and would you know they would pay him $100 per lead he was at my house and this woman named Rosie uh called he goes hi uh you know I'm uh I'm Gabe how can I help you goes hi this is Rosie I I need a driveway repair to come in he goes all right hold on let me uh patch you into the other person and he like dialed it on his iPhone and merged the calls and then put his phone on mute and put the thing in his pocket he was making $20,000 a month doing this and this company called modernize I know a guy named Gabe who did this exact same thing in San Francisco where he went door too and he found out what type of services each person needed and he would spend eight hours a day going door too and eventually they made something like $500,000 doing this manually and they used that money to turn this into this website called modernize that makes millions of dollars a year and so this is exactly what you were talking about of like taking a small cut of business that you create you don't even really have to create a service you don't have to create a product but you can just grind your ass off and make it happen yeah I like that you could even just go in Craigslist you can just Farm Craigslist for services gigs for interesting businesses and then go and try to solve their problems if you if you really wanted to so um all right I think that's a good one uh here's a fun one this is kind of a a hard one maybe uh to answer uh or maybe it's a little bit of a longer one actually here let's do this let's do this one in second jyang asks what is your worst self-sabotaging behavior oh man mine's easy I make sometimes so many to choose from yeah I mean like how much time you got uh like uh but I would say that I tend to make decisions quickly in emotional states and I should probably like take 24 hours to think about things like something will happen and it will piss me off or make me happy and I make the decision right there and I call it getting dug in I say I am dug in I will not change my opinion any further and it's not a a it's not a um figurative speech you've literally told me that phrase yeah you've literally you literally say those words out loud I go I dug in and so I I struggle to change my opinion once I've already made it and I tend to make my opinion quickly when I'm being emotional what what's an example give us an example let's let's let's be real here people showed up live let's give the people what they want for example example if someone uh a candidate will interview for uh to to work at my company and recently they had bad facial hair and they looked sloppy in the interview and they had told me they had just moved I was like I don't care like I in my head I just like this person was sloppy when they showed up they are dead to me I can never work with them and my team was like like I I just will make these like really fast decisions I just I it's really hard for me to get past a certain uh impression and I just will not change and so we didn't hire the person like that's a really specific example or is this self-sabotaging yeah or here's a here's like an example where it hurts me it helps me a lot of times it hurts me where an employee will make one screw up and I'll be like they're done it's over like I be I'm pissed off at them they are done quick to judgment quick to judgment and you think that costs you because um that judgment that quick judgment is not correct yeah or you don't make certain opinions when you're you know you don't you don't go to the grocery store when you're hungry so when you're pissed off you don't make like decisions that's good I like that um yeah I think also it kind of gives you a lens right like let's say somebody starts off on a wrong foot then you have this filter over everything that they're they're doing where you're sort of scanning for that evidence of uh and and you're trying to confirm that bias all right uh my most self-sabotaging Behavior would be I mean I got simple ones dude I like I have a private Chef I have a personal trainer who comes to my house I have a food coach and then I'll door Dash Taco Bell so like come on you know there's something deeply wrong with me when these things happen right that's a self sabotaging behavior um but the real ones that I would say because that's you know not that often and and and like it's not that yeah it's not that common it's just silly when it happens uh the big ones I think are really your most self-sabotaging Behavior I think is always the shadow of something that's your real strength right so I think a real strength of M is that I'm a good salesman I'm a good Storyteller and that's great when I point it outwards but when I use it on myself I can talk myself into all kinds of [ __ ] right and so I have to be really really careful that I'm not just s yourself yeah I persuade myself all the time because I'm aive guy but like yeah of course it's kind of like I actually just really want to do you know I really want to quit doing something because it's hard but then I'll talk myself into why this is not the right thing to be doing rather than just being honest and saying it's really hard right now and I don't really know the answer and I'm not comfortable in the discomfort and therefore I just want to stop actually um that's just an Impulse but I'll I'll make it sound great and I'll convince myself that's so funny this can happen for simple things like you know last night you know I was like I wanted to just stay up late and I was talking myself into why this is the perfect time I should I'm having inspiration right now I should strike while I have inspiration I should do this it's like actually just go to bed just get it just go to bed it's easy you could do tomorrow no problem um and so like I could talk myself into bad habits I could talk myself into doing deals where I know I I could make it happen but that's not really one I should do um and really it's all about the most costly version of this is Project selection if I talk myself into or out of a project because a project has a really long lifespan like you know a year two years three years five years and I have to be really careful that I'm not going to convince myself to do something um that I don't actually really truly knows the right move for me have you used chat gbt to combat this combat this cuz I have and it's like amazing where I'll be like be cynical and point all the holes in my thinking exactly I do that I say you are my you are my friend who has my best interest at heart you understand me and you are ruthlessly honest with me and I'll say force me so I don't ask chap GP questions I force it to ask me question I'll say Force ask me questions and force me to structure a logical argument as to why I should do this and if I have any logical flaws or logical fallacies you can push back on it or simply ask me is that true um and then I by the end of it and I keep having it play Back The Logical argument so it's saying like 0.1 Point 2 3 and then I can read that and be like all right do I do I agree with this or not you uh you tweeted out uh something that was funny you said um um the reason I love chat GPT as a therapist is because it doesn't judge which is like one of the very few I got clowned on for saying dude it's one of the cringiest things youve said but it's also incredibly true I do the bad part is I I you usually you know when you're doing something cringe right it's like what somebody's about to like you know poke you in the stomach you could Flex real quick so you know you know you're you know something's about to happen you can just tighten up yeah I wasn't aware dude this is a blind spot I had to question myself like why did I not see that this would read as lame I thought it was being just honest look I thought it was useful it was just a little bit novali you know what I mean that it was like a Nal thing and you are not uh wait nal's cringe oh no I I'm way off Well you aren't cring because you're funny uh that was a non-funny thing but you also in your five tweet uh email you said um uh you shared about how uh research is showing that uh cognitive inperson therapy and having an AI therapist are uh I don't know if it was that they're having similar results or if the AI therapist has been proven to uh uh help people and I completely agree man I've been using chat gbt this way and it feels embarrassing to admit this but it's incredibly helpful for solving these problems yeah I don't know why that's embarrassing oh I mean dude it's just like to me it's obvious would you ask out loud everything that you Google search no of course not why do you so so why is that well partly because it's faster and other part is because you can ask a dumb question and Google doesn't judge you Jud is the same thing um but I guess what I was pointing out was that people think AI is so useful because it's super intelligent but actually that's great IQ is great but there's the EQ benefit also which is that you could be comfortable being a little bit stupid or or ask or being really honest with it and um you don't feel judged or I don't feel judge at least um all right what's what's the second question or the third question um okay let's do another one oh here's a here's a fun one so it says Max who's at couch Money Max great handle uh Max ask you can only connect the dots looking backwards he's talking about the Steve Jobs uh philosophy that you can only connect the dots of your life looking backwards he says what dots led to the positions that you and Sam are in today I like this question I don't know if this is going to be interesting to anybody else but I honestly felt like thankful that he asked this question because like what a what a great question to reflect on this actually a really good chat gbt prompt like a like this is like a whole hourlong session exactly this is like therapeutic in a way and I think I did the exercise and I actually think everybody should do this this interesting exercise you take the things that you're most happy about your life today and you sort of trace the creative the the the lineage the the roots of of that of where you are today to the key decisions or events or lucky breaks in your life that got you there I think that's just like a great thing people should do did you do this yes I did and I was trying to boil it down what it was so basically there's a there's only there's only been a handful of decisions that I've ever made that you know how Warren Buffett has like you know he has a 70-year career but he's like you know most of the value has come from like six or eight to decisions I kind of feel the same way with my life and probably most people's lives where it's like there's probably just like three or four good decisions and I think the trait that has helped me most and it's not a I don't do it for the reason that think people think but I've always been pretty good about focusing on something for a while and getting that one thing right and that unlocks so many other things versus having a wide Focus so for example um uh when I started my first company the hustle it was I didn't have income from other sources it was like this thing must work and I was all in when I uh was dating my wife like with like right after meeting her I was like I'm all in on this like and So within three weeks we were very serious and we were going to get married um versus um like having like a a certain business partner my most successful business partner relationship is with my partner Joe we were very thoughtful about it and then I made we made the decision I am all in I will do everything with you from now on want and so just like a uh not having a bunch of different options and choosing one thing and only doing that and saying no to a variety of other options that's uh that's great um here's how I would answer this so if I think about the five kind of best things in my that the best things I have going for me right now and I look back at them so the five I would say are my family um like my like my house my household which is like my wife and my three kids and my dog um then I have by the way you never talk about your dog is is is your dog to you like a roded or like a family member shame on me no dude our dog is the queen he's like your family member oh my god dude that like I I will take you know I'll ignore a lot of people I'll ignore your text message but if I walk by like my dog will be laying on the side and she just flaps her tail without getting up but that means like get your ass over here and you give me a little three-minute belly rub like I will go there you know oh crawled up to her and just and just hang with her like she's she's amazing um as all dogs are dogs are dogs are incredible all right so my family this podcast I would put there so I would actually say this podcast is very different than like career in general I think this podcast is like an outlier of a cool thing like I get to talk to my buddy two hours a week we get to be rich and famous because of it it opens up all these other opportunities it lets me just kind of be interested in life because my job is just to talk about what's interesting to me like that that's such a life win uh three is Health which I couldn't figure out like if there was really any decisions I made that like to connect the dots it feels like a lot of it was god-given and then maybe the decision to like find a trainer who I really like to work out with what was the God given what did God give you oh just like I don't have any like health problems inside right I'm good like I don't have cancers or anything in my body like that I couldn't control that would obviously be like kind of nuking my life right now um and then I would say by fourth and F so I got Family podcast Health outlook on life I think that's actually like one of my best attributes is I have a very good outlook on life which lets me deal with any situation that comes my way with like kind of just like laugh and roll with it uh and then the last thing I wrote just a little bit romantic to get romantic on you guys you can light up a chandle write up a couple of light up some candles in the chat here Ben uh Ben is one of the best things in my life and so and then I look back and I was like a good kisser there's a question on here of have you and Sam kissed I think we need to finish with that one so we we'll save that for the end that's a cliffhanger all right um so I took each one of them and I just Look Backwards so like you know family it's like I remember how I met my wife like I was helping somebody move their apartment so I just said yes to that saying yes to being helpful let me meet her I had the courage in the Meetup to like ask her on a second date basically um and then you know we broke up at a certain point so the decision to you know like give it a second chance and actually believe that people can change like oh like yeah we were fighting a lot we were arguing a bunch honestly I was probably kind of skeptical that that wouldn't continue to be the case but then it totally changed it was actually like oh wow so you can give people the benefit of the doubt that that they all actually like you know um change their behavior which I think a cynical version of me wouldn't have wouldn't have believed um dude I have a phrase that I say to like my team like I'm like people don't change that's but that that behavior that that belief will get you some places in life it'll defend you from a bunch of traps but it'll cost you some like really great opportunities you know um having kids going on with them or like you know outlook on life I think the decision to just pick up and buy a ticket to a Tony Robbins seminar in New Jersey when I really didn't know anything about Tony Robbins and I thought self self self-help was a little bit corny I mean that was like a pretty like huge moment in shaping giving me a a philosophy for how to do life um health I would say a decision to hire a trainer who does uh like functional patterns in Mobility I think to I think me in 20 years will look back on that dot and be like oh thank you you know me on 20 years in some like deep squat position that feels comfortable will be like oh thank God you started doing that then when that wasn't in Vogue when everybody was doing weightlifting and just running you decided to do that um and then the podcast one I think is a useful one so I decided to do this podcast the day after our deal closed to sell twit to to Twitch so we sold the company that signed the paperwork it was officially closed diligence was done and I knew I had like a life-changing amount of money coming my way and I went on a 4-Hour walk with my buddy suly through the mission in San Francisco and we just walked up and down the street almost like walking ourselves we just like walked ourselves into a frenzy and we were just like I I'm feeling good you feeling good let's walk and we didn't sit down we didn't do it when I was tired and I think making a decision when your gas tank is low leads you to make certain types of decisions but I got into an energized state where I felt super optimistic I was walking around with my best friend and I really just felt uh enthusiastic about the future and in that moment I committed to being like I'm going to do a podcast I should go for it I had wanted to do it for years but I had never really like gone for it and I the reason why I told myself at the time oh it's because I'm busy oh it's because I don't have the time or the money to do whatever the truth was I was scared to just do a podcast that yet another podcast that nobody listens to and when I was on that walk the key thing was it didn't change to suddenly I thought oh everybody's going to listen to us no on the walk I decided you know what f it I'm going to do it because I want to do it and I don't care if nobody nobody listens to it it's still worth doing and I got comfortable with doing it even in the scenario where uh it was embarrassing that nobody was going to end up listening to my podcast and that's how this podcast started what month was that in year was that June of 19 2019 yeah yeah so that was uh it's coming up on six years isn't that crazy yeah that's wild I I really haven't done much for six years you know like six years is a long time for me that's insane that was six years ago in the first episode it was you and suly and that launched I forget when I think either September or what late summer it got 64,000 downloads which was like looking back that's a that's a home run and then it it peaked really fast the next one got like 50,000 and then it and then it went down to like 10,000 and it's been a slow very slow climb and that's been six that was in six years that's amazing how long that's been yeah by the way the whole chat is just talking about how cute Ari is this is amazing why are we even here let's just put Ari on the camera for an hour a week what are we doing AR right how does that make you feel I'm like pouring my heart and soul into the St the story the decisions that changed my life and then every's like canari see us I wonder if she smiles she's cute why don't they show her more someone someone like they're using words like they're using phrases that I'm not sure exactly what they mean like talking about slur could be a compliment yeah like she's locked in uh said she is the mogger bro what is what does moer mean oh I have no idea yeah you do you have a lot of ideas that's so funny hold hold on let's find out chat what does mogger mean I Googled it one who mogs okay that didn't help what's going on yeah people are saying they've fallen in love with you Ari yeah okay never doing this again again or we're going to do it all the time don't make don't make our uncomfortable okay um where do you want to want to do the retirement or do you want to do productivity tool let's do the productivity tool what's the what is the question there oh that's a great one Ari uh we could bring that thing up but here's uh here's the question what tool sorry Ari go ahead say no you go ah you go ahead all right so it says what tools do you use to stay productive one uh from one task to the next as well as day-to-day week by week Etc and how do these keep you on task in moving forward I got a very from zackly zackly music ask that yeah Zack you got a a great mustache uh you want to let me show you what I started doing Sean I've been doing this since like December we got an answer on mger mger is when somebody is drastically more beautiful than the others around them Ah that's why I've never heard this word before tot explains it you're usually the one mogging nobody's ever said that to me got it life is about either being the or getting mogged and I've been getting mogged my whole life what what's the root of that word I've never who that's is this like the spelling be like can you tell me the root language of the word I mean is I don't even understand like Riz is charisma uh what is where does mger come from I think it's like a noun I think you are you are the mger meaning not she she doesn't need to do it she just is so she's when you are the Ager you are the one that is way ahead of the the others I mean if uh Mr mysteries in the YouTube chat is to be believed then yeah that's true okay all right sorry so productivity tools so Zach wants to know what do you use to stay productive from one task to the next do you have anything that's non-obvious yeah I uh all right you want to share the screen or no I basically have this it's very simple dude and this works I've always done this so I've dude I just use notebooks most of the time I always have a notebook with me but now I do it in a Google doc and it's very simple I say what my q1 goals are I say what my strengths and what my weaknesses are can we zoom in on this it's hard to read so this was an old this is an old one um can I read this out loud yeah all right so q1 focus it says get myself out of MoneyWise and transition it to video to grow Hampton and it scratched out assuming you did it we did it perfect this weekly routine to stay focused and avoid distractions run a 21 minute 5K and BGE press 300 pounds crossed out no big deal um tell sir how much I appreciate every day didn't cross that one out yeah man will bench 300 before he tells his wife how much he appreciates her uh don't use my phone at dinner also not crossed out right and my essay on men's wear achieved I don't think you intended for this to be as funny as it is the difference between the goals you did and the goals you didn't do is so funny I wasn't always on top of Crossing out the things that I accomplished you know you use EOS at Hampton crossed out did that implemented a whole $25,000 productivity system have fun and stress about unnecessary things Noe didn't do it that's amazing and then it says remember your strengths and weaknesses Sam hold On's going crazy uh you're a big thinker great at creating bold Visionary ideas you have energy and drive for starting new projects once committed you move fast and decisively weaknesses you can be easily distracted by notifications that pull your focus you dislike routine details and prefer strategic work you sometimes feel restless with too much time uh too much free time or lack structure and then it looks like there's some maybe todos every week every Sunday I make my important things that I need to get done through for throughout the week and I'm I'm always referring back to is this helping me achieve my goals is this you know like am I using my strengths and weaknesses things like that it's so simple it but this honestly like is gamechanging for me just really simple stuff and then what I'll do is all my calendar I map out time when I want to accomplish those things the week before very simple [ __ ] so you've been doing this for a while or what yeah yeah a long time I mean previously it was just on my notebook but it would be every Sunday I would write it out what's the most useful part of this that I wouldn't um I wouldn't appreciate at first glance of hearing how it works planning planning your week not just doing things planning your week and setting setting aside time on your calendar to actually get it done if you don't set if you don't set the time for for example uh like if I ever what I've noticed is if I ever take a flight or something happens where I can't get my workout done or I have a lot of free time throughout a day I will not get up early to get my workout done but when I am saying like oh I got to take a catch a flight at noon meaning I got to be at the gym at 6:30 and I got to be home by 7:30 so that's 6:30 to 7:30 time because it's scheduled I know exactly like I need to get after it when I have too much time it just will never happen gotcha I would say this word might be getting this word might be in that cringe Zone that I'm not I'm not aware of but love you said planning no no you said planning I would say being intentional right so it's not even that you planned it but just being like all right I have only so much focus and time I'm either going to just improvise and shoot it at whatever thing pops up or I'm going to focus my laser beam at the thing I want I'm going to choose and the tip I would give is not a tool for productivity it's not a system I'll just give like the one new thing I've been doing that's going to sound very stupid very simple a little bit hippie dippy but honestly has been paying pretty big dividends for me and that is trans working on the transition between uh between things so I have a day I have a like crazy day right I'll wake up and I get my kids on a bike and I bike them to to school you wake up I wake up at 7 usually um and so I'll get them to school by 8 so I kind of get them ready get myself ready and get get them to school by by 7:40 roughly drop them off at school on the bike and I bike back so I'm back home at 8:00 and then I do the podcast and then after the podcast I switch into like do my one big thing usually my new creative project that I'm working on I'm doing that totally different than the podcast and then after that I'm do it a call maybe it's about taxes or maybe it's one of the companies we're working on a deal and I'll do some like CEO [ __ ] for one of the different companies all right cool then I'll switch and I'll go back to kids then I'll switch and I'll work out right I'll do different I have like all these switches and what's helped me in my day has been literally just take like five to 10 seconds in between activities and transition transition between them in a like more thoughtful way because I was blending them together right if I was working and then it was time for lunch I'd be still thinking about work while shoving food in my mouth and now I'm like sort of stress eating in that process um or if I was going from work mode to Kids Mode I still have one eye on my phone and I'm still thinking about that while my kid is like so excited and for to play with them and do another thing and so my ex actually the food coach she was like Hey I want you to do one little practice which is in between transitioning between things literally take 10 seconds take a deep breath like kind of give yourself permission to go into that next mode and just like leave one and go to the next be ready to leave one and go to the next mentally and that simple thing that sounds kind of stupid is been really really helpful for me I realized like how much of my life was just blurring together I think partially because of my phone and partially because of my own like just the way my mind was working it's just like con like full my brain was full of stuff and um doing that I don't know it's like 100 times easier than meditation and it just like makes an impact in the moment itself have you ever done a chore or even like walked from the grocery store parking lot into the grocery store and you're zoned in on your phone and then you look up and you're like wait how did I get here yeah has that that feel dude like it's crazy how that feeling I don't know what that show Severance is about I'm pretty sure it's about me walking to the grocery store and be like wait how the hell did I get here that's what that show SE is that's season two I hate that feeling and whenever I feel that I get so guilty where I'm like three minutes of my life literally just did not exist I don't remember how I got here and that's that's insane what else am I missing isn't that such a weird feeling yeah and by the way the trick to this is your not just like uh you're not just about it's not just about being present which is obviously a superpower like the core of most philosophy is just be here now um so it's not even just about the presence but you could kind of choose like how you're going to walk into that situation you could choose your mood basically so you're like all right I'm about to go play with my kids let me bring them a bunch of energy oh I'm about to see my wife um let me have that honey I'm home energy right now and you just sort of get to choose like how you're going to do it not just what you're about to do little little life hack so uh I'm practicing that right now that's my new that's my current practice um all right you want to do one or two more uh yeah let's do another one so let's do which one's a fun one um if you could pick one person have 10% of their future earnings who would you pick and why Elon Musk easy next um how about one of your friends though um I think I picked my buddy suly I think he uh he rolls out of bed and makes money like I it's he's it's in his blood it's in his zone of Genius he can't help but make money and he's just demonstrated it over and over and over again and you know the test here is when I have a business challenge he's the guy I go to I I just trust his judgment I trust his judgment and his generosity meaning like I don't know he he has my best interest at heart and I think his judgment is in it's the highest signal Judgment of anybody I know and so if that's how if he helps me with my business stuff then you know having that judgment every day on his own business stuff is obviously a winner the only trick there is just I think he's passed caring about money I think like at some at some point he's just not as hungry for money so if I'm only getting their future earnings I'm basically compounding you know I'm begging on their compounding of what they already have which is obviously pretty good what I've I've tried to figure out his attributes and it's really hard because it's sort of like watching like when you watch like a professional MMA figh you're like this looks easy or if you watch a professional Runner running a 5k they're flying right but because they're so smooth it looks really easy and you're like oh that's all you're doing this seems really simple that's a little bit of my problem with him is that he makes decisions seem no big deal in obvious and things like that but there's definitely Mastery behind it there's something behind it what attributes it's super hard I was at dinner with our buddy Ramon and Ramon is probably his best friend like Ramon I think spends the most time with him and can't even tell we were both laughing like God how does this guy do it like what is his secret and I was like Ramon you know him better than me cuz when he tells me sometimes he makes it sound like I don't know I just I just did the thing I was like I can't tell is he withholding is he like kind of sandbagging and withholding information I was like rone I know he doesn't withhold anything from you I know he doesn't sandbag he's so he's totally honest with you and you spend five times more time with him so what's the answer and he also couldn't do it which is a very frustrating thing but I think you know at the end of the day it's like all right the thing great at is Judgment I think his judgment on people is really good um like you know we were hiring exec for my company I did all these interviews I was like I think this is the guy he talked to him for 15 minutes and sort of identified like this guy's full of [ __ ] about this thing and then I verified it and he was full of [ __ ] about that thing um so I think his judgment on people is very good his judgment on what products are going to hit and and succeed and fail like he just can of kind of zero in on a business really quickly and see its business potential um and also like deals like doing Investments and Deals he just a very good judgment on those and so how do you develop that judgment that I wish I had a great answer for he's one of the few people that I've met well with with him I I I truly felt that money-making was a talent you know what I mean like you say bolt was built this way and he refined it uh there's some people I think who are built to earn and he had that that skill set but it was one of the few times where I met someone I'm like oh this is just natural and also you work but it's natural yeah yeah all right let do this oneing on him you guys uh you're you're 36 you can't I don't think you know you're too old to use that phrase uh but we could try uh I'm just mogging right now right yeah by the way they they gave us the root somebody actually looked up the root word you want to know what it is yeah so mger which AR is the MOG of the group is based on a AOG alpha male of group so if you're mogging you're just being the alpha of the group and you're just mogging on everybody so we're the betas she's the alpha all right that all right now I understand um we're not doing any live streams anymore right you guys meet a lot of people out of all these interactions what's the sentence or phrase that has never left your brain it doesn't need to be motivational man mine is uh amjad from repet just talking about how he was like uh he was telling a story I forget exactly what the story was but it but the but the Crux of it was he there was some illogical thing like move to America and try to apply to YC or something like that where the odds were small and he just asked himself what would be the best story and he decided to do it and there was many other examples where there was an illogical thing but he was like yeah but this is just the best story I should do that and uh I have thought about that often times this is a really hard one there's so many um all right I'll tell the one that was most useful for me at that moment in time and this actually came from my dad and I was at a Crossroads where I didn't know what to do should I go in the left path or the right path um should I do this thing or that thing one of them was the one I was doing at the moment that was fun and interesting but I had no idea where it would lead and it kind of looked on the surface like it wouldn't really lead anywhere and the other path was way more well-defined but I was just less excited about it and my dad made it very easy and he goes um motion not Direction and he goes you know there are many times in your life where if you have Direction fantastic easy no brainer it's like you have Checkmate if you have Direction fantastic just go um but there are many times in your life where you don't know the direction to go and in those moments don't get stuck with analysis paralysis don't get stuck overthinking the situation focus on motion because motion actually can create direction or reveal the direction so you know imagine you're on a island and you want to get to Paradise you know it's out there somewhere you're standing on the beach you can't see it it's foggy and um you know you could just sit there waiting for the fog to clear but guess what the fog is not magically just going to clear for you and the better bet is to get in your boat and start rowing even if you're kind of rowing in the wrong direction once you're in motion it's actually not that hard if you're intentional about it to sh shift directions if you get more clarity you get more more direction from there and so this idea of motion not Direction was just a very valuable thing for me at a key point in my life and um and I've since used it many times since then cuz I'm I'm somebody who I love having Clarity and I seek it out but there's a reality that sometimes you're just not going to have it up front and it's just going to look too hazy and too foggy for you and the mistake I make in those situations is when I um I just wish that you know I wait and I wish for things to be clear when in actuality I just got to get moving and once I start moving um the clouds start to part and I can figure out my way there's been about three to five stories about your parents that I've actually stuck with me um that one's a good one the story that you told about your mom coming from India to America I've repeated that story and I think that I've like changed the it yeah but like because I like you you when you told that you'd made jokes but I was like I don't know if he's joking or not like for example you said that she like was unfamiliar with forks or you're like she said that like the you said the airplane that she called it a bus in the sky uh like you just told these like you none of these are true but let's not let the facts get story but you were tell I think that the way that you like yeah where you were like the truth was she got on the plane and didn't like you know like an airplane Buckle seat Bel is like no if you've never been on an airplane you've never seen that object before and it's not obvious how those two things actually connect it's like kind of so she was very confused by that and she she happened to smash it in and then the person next to her was like ah you must fly a lot she was like what and and she stayed awake on a 14-hour flight cuz she didn't want to miss her stop she thought that the the airplane was a train and like she was going to miss or stop if she if she blinked so she stayed awake for 14 hours well you just told this way you told this story about your mother where it was like going from uh the opposite of America to America and it made me admire her but also like all like immigrants where I'm like I cannot believe this person did this and now her son and now your kids or her you know her grandkids are going to grow up these like yepy Suburban California wealthy privilege like it's pretty crazy like just that that transition you know what I mean and that's she should be very proud and that made me proud you know I um I took this photo of my my wife's grandmother is from Haiti and I don't know exactly how she grew up but it was not nice you know like it is here and then I took a photo of my daughter with her great grandmother and my great you know the grandma was like this dark black woman and then my little girl was not that uh and then also like my little girl is like a uh Connecticut Suburban person and I'm like can you imagine like telling this Haitian woman like your grandkids are going to be like that and I I don't know it's kind of like a proud moment I think or imagine this imagine telling Obama's grandparents your kid you're in Kenya run the Free World your kid is your grandkid is going to run the this little baby's going to run the Free World it's going to be the most powerful person in the world and you're they're living in Kenya you know what I mean like anyway that transition like I find very inspiring so I loved hearing that story about your mother you know that movie uh what's it called phone booth where the whole movie just takes place with the guy in the phone booth love it yeah col frell somebody needed to do that just of my mom's plane ride trip to America there's like 15 Parts in it that are just like so funny and it's just following this one person not saying it's going to be a hit but I would love to see that movie no I love that story that's one of my favorite stories uh that has that stuck with me and I I joke about it but in reality I I left incredibly inspired all right somebody says you got to answer your YouTube question not a Twitter question because you guys are on all right yeah someone said uh Hey Ari could you please mute [Laughter] Sean tell me how you really [Laughter] feel that's so good that's hilarious all right let's let's get a question here from YouTube before we uh before we jump all right ask your questions I think there's like a yeah a little delay someone's also like Sean just uh disrespecting twitch so much by streaming here do people think I make these decisions I show up and AR does everything like I I I don't we don't decide a lot of this stuff Sam Sam laughed at Sam said that people laughed at him when he said that newsletters could be a big business 10 years ago what do you think people are laughing at today I'll give you a good a very concrete example um I'm building a company with Hampton that I think people are going to be really surprised about the size in 10 and 20 years um that's one business example what do you and why would people underestimate it because it sounds just like a community because typically so both newsletters and communities are side projects within a large company not the main thing you know it's sort of like laughing at someone for saying they're going to create a restaurant that just sells fondue it's like dude this the the side can't be the main uh and I think that like the the math does not suggest that that is true I think one that fits this bill today that I think what is what is something that sounds silly sounds um unserious sounds like something you'd be underestimating today but going to be but people people underestimate it I would say is um learning how to make short form ugc content to sell products so there are people today that are on Tik Tok that do this they make products they make they make little Tik toks they could spend their whole day making a Tik Tok and I don't know if anything sounds like less serious than that sounds like a waste of time sounds like you spent your whole day working on a 30 second or one minute little Tik Tok video that might not even become anything um I personally know people that make $10,000 a month $30,000 a month $100,000 a month as Tik Tok Sellers and they don't even own the brand they don't own it they don't own the brand they don't have an official like they're not an influencer they're just really good at creating little content that convinces people to buy stuff and I think that more and more that's how people are going to learn to buy stuff is through little videos that show off the product quickly and in 30 seconds you got to do what you know previously people used to you know spend millions of dollars on TV commercials doing but now a person with their cell phone can make a more convincing more effective ad than what the best ad agencies in the world did with TV commercial dude listen to this and I think that sounds pretty unserious today but I think a lot of people are are doing great with it what I'm going to I'm going to tell you a story that had I told you three years ago you would have laughed at so Ramone came and visited me the other day in Connecticut because he was in New York City and one of the reasons why he was in New York City was for his company he hired a 20-year-old who I think is now a College Dropout but this 20-year-old now has employees and he hired this guy and he paid him thousands of dollars to basically go to Washington Square Park and interview like you know those videos that you guys see on in New York City where it's like man on the street interview man on the street where it's like what's your opinion on this topic uh he paid someone to make videos so Ramone can post them not only on his Twitter or whatever his Instagram but other people's Instagram basically giving him the creative assets and I think this kid might also have owned a bunch of Instagrams that were popular but basically he paid this kid thousands and thousands of dollars to go and make like 20 of these interviews that you could chop and that he would go and chop up and this kid had employees I think he was only 20 years old I think he had just dropped out of Syracuse University because he was making like 30 or $40,000 a month doing this isn't that insane yeah that's that's what I'm talking about like I think that doesn't even sound like a job today um you know to to the average person I think that doesn't even sound like a job today and I think it's a very lucrative job actually and it's a very valuable skill set that um that will serve people well in the future all right do we want to do more or we done is there one that sticks out a fast one um there's a parenting one with everything you've learned from business which lessons are your applying to your parenting methods and why I have a simple answer to this my kids are currently going through a uh a phase of just not listening to anything like uh you tell them to do something they just don't do it and my old you know whatever worked 6 months ago isn't really working anymore like I threatened to take away a toy or something like that that doesn't work and then I just feel like I'm constantly bribing or threatening my kids and I just been kind of frustrated with that for the last I don't know month I don't know didn't really know what to do with it and I just thought all right if this was my business and I had a business problem like this what would I do to solve it and the main thing was I would go read from thought like I'd go read what the smartest people do I I know that no problem I have is unique to me uh no matter how much I feel like a victim in the moment no problem I have is unique everybody's had this problem before it's been solved before and there are people who are amazing at solving this there are coaches that are great at solving this and so I went and I youtubed this problem I said Dr Becky kids won't listen and I watched this video yesterday while my kid was not listening I just kind of tuned out and watched this video for a second and she basically brought up several points and I'm sitting there like taking notes as if this is like a study session for me as if like I'm watching some growth hack video right and she was basically like well like you know here's like the situation like you're basically telling your kid to stop doing something fun to do something Less Fun to them in the moment like how would you feel if you were doing something fun and somebody tells you to do something less fun like you also don't really like it and she had this like you know little framework of like three things you could do in order to help your kids listen better and it was very useful and I was like why don't I invest the same way I'm willing to invest in reading books going to coaching seminars hiring an executive coach to be a better CEO why does it feel like I'm an abject failure or a loser to do that in the parenting realm and like that's a little dramatic but the reality is I wasn't doing it and um so I'm now applying that more to the parenting realm to to get better when I need it you know she's got a company called good inside that uh like you can pay like some amount of money a small amount of money and you use their app where it's all like Ai and [ __ ] and you could ask Dr Becky a bunch of questions it's pretty awesome that business crushes do you know how well that business does I've talked to her yeah it it does you know who the the co-founder is Scott belly's wife um and so like it's they it's a very Dynamic like good co-founder team they're gonna kill it yeah that's amazing um I'll do a quick one M well let me do a quick one really quick mine is uh having my energy knowing that energy is contagious so I used to get yell that at my company for like being frantic sometimes when I was in a bad mood and I could tell that it made other people anxious and so I had to change my energy because it was contagious but you know what really taught me more about raising kids kids raising a damn dog dude like like you know what Caesar Milan says he like there's different type of assertiveness there's like hectic assertiveness which like is not like cool to use and then there's calm assertiveness which is when you're with your dog and I had a 80 pound piple who was not well behaved when I first got him so I had to like learn how to train a dog learning how to train a dog was so helpful for learning how to raise a child so far of just like making sure your energy is on point making sure you're being calm assertive not anxious assertive things like that um and that's probably the biggest change that uh there the biggest thing I've implemented from learning how to run a business and raising a dog for my children uh is that it that's it Ari you went M us one one last time for the road have you guys kissed I mean we didn't get to that one Cliffhanger for next time I think one time we made a deal that what what one time we made a deal that if we got to a certain amount of followers we were gonna we were G to do it because there's this one YouTuber that did it was hilarious but like I don't think any of the subscribers that that person had stuck around I couldn't even tell you what it was called so like I don't know fact that we don't remember what their name is means absolutely not worth it yeah so I don't know if it's worth it um all right that's it that's a pod

Before that, he had brought Jerger Meister to the US and made it popular. He created the Jager bomb and got like Jagarettes, the girls who would go around bars pouring the stuff down college kids throats. And he made it the party drink.

So, this is actually a company that I've I've wanted to invest in for so long. If you're doing this, like, please just email me. All right. So, I wanted to have you on because you are one of my healthiest buddies. Last time you were on, I think you've been on three times already. You didn't get into a lot of the ideas because we were just like peppering you with so many questions and I wanted to be more focused. I think I asked you what are five or six like interesting health companies or health trends that you're interested in investing in and you hit hit me back with a very detailed list in a very short amount of time. So clearly you are like already thinking and acting on a lot of these things. Can we go through each of them and you just tell me what they are because I'm crazy fascinated because like for the listener you told me in 2014 or 15 that you were quitting tech like you had a software company and you were going to launch a bone broth company and I was like oh man like you like you're decided to throw your life away that sucks like you were you were going to be one of the greats and then it just came out in Forbes I think uh or was that was it Forbes? Uh you had this amazing feature about your company Kettle and Fire and how you surpassed 100 million in annual revenue and it was amazing and I'm like you definitely won and I read the article by the way and I texted like five friends and I'm like Justin does everything the right way. By the way, did I get that right? You guys you're at 100 million run rate or revenue. Yeah. North of that. Yeah. And you said something amazing. I think you said we're going to what did you say? We're going to be the best operating e-commerce company in America. Is that right? Yeah. I mean, basically like there are most of the big public big food companies were started pre-1900 and so a lot of these companies are very very bloated. They're large. You know, they've been around uh frankly I think many of them are poisoning people and then paying lobbyists and other sort of opposition research groups to make sure that like soda doesn't get removed from food stamps and all these sorts of things. And so I think these are just generally bad actors. And I think that there's a huge opportunity to both out innovate these big CPG companies and also just run a better business. Like I guarantee no one in you know Battle Creek, Michigan working at Kelloggs is looking at like how do we use AI to automate a lot of our workflows and process and things like that. Whereas like that's something we have live work streams going in kettle and fire to figure out like how do we apply the craziest technology you know move like leap forward of you know certain my certainly my lifetime to just running the the best possible company that we can and I think it's working so far we have like 34 people for uh you know for our size of business which is quite good scale. You have only 34 employees. Yeah. Wow. Is it wildly profitable or is it uh working its way to be wildly profitable? No, we're we're profitable. I mean, one of the things that I'm very proud of is like we've raised uh only $10 million in primary capital since starting the company and so it's been pretty capital efficient and you know, we've been focused on building the trend but also building a good business uh since we started it like 9 years ago. Yeah, that's awesome that you have proven me and I'm sure many other people wrong and uh you've you've been early on a bunch of stuff. All right, so let's dive deep. What's the first one you want to talk about? Yeah. So, first one I want to talk about is I think that you know there are there's this huge huge macro trend where all people are talking about maha, they're talking about seed oils, talking about all these things from a health point, make America health, make America healthy again. Um we're talking about all these things about fixing the chronic disease crisis in the US and I think that health trends specifically for dogs and other pets like tend to lag a couple years behind humans. Like basically a couple years ago, you know, you saw Blue Apron, HelloFresh, a bunch of these companies launch. And then a couple years beyond that, Farmers Dog, a like fresh dog food delivery kind of company launches and I think they're well over 100 or 200 million in revenue at this point. It's crazy. And I basically think that you can look at the US chronic disease crisis, obesity rates, inflammation, cancer, autoimmune, all these things. The same thing is happening in dogs. like something like one in four dogs are going to get cancer at this point. This is like unique. It's new. Cancer rates among dogs are rising. And again, this is because dogs like humans exist in an environment that is actively poisoning them. Like kibble is total trash and it is literally making dogs sick. And so I think that there are a lot of these health trends that like people are getting into uh that you're going to see become popular now and in two to three four years are going to be popular for for pets especially because now it's something like I think that millennials or Gen Z like literally have more dogs than babies or something like that. the the market is growing incredibly quickly. Although I don't have a dog, but I I think there's like a lot a lot of gold in that sort of like take human health thing and apply it to a dog like health product. Is this true? You say here that uh in some cities there's more dogs than babies. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's certainly true like the younger the younger you go. Uh the kibble thing is interesting. I um I had a dog for 15 years. He was my best friend and his last 5 years of life it hit me where I was giving him. So when I first got him I was poor so I would like buy the cheapest dog food and then I got you know I could afford like whatever they tell you you know like the stickick they tell you is like only buy something where it says like chicken on the first ingredient. Who knows if that's true or not but and that's the more expensive thing. And then I was like eating kibble like dried dog food that would be it would be sort of like feeding me potato chips every day. Do you know what I mean? Like and like people's dogs are, you know, what do you do when you have a dog and you eat dinner? They all come and obsessed over you and you like yell at them. And I'm like, if you gave me reffried beans for every single meal, of course, I'm going to want like be desperate for any new food. It's kind of insane, right, that we would feed them the same thing. And it's like a processed dried thing that doesn't expire. Totally. It's insane, right? It's totally insane. And you look at the ingredient, it's like full of trash, full of artificial ingredient, you know, like all of the stuff that people are trying to remove from their diets. We basically put in kibble and feed to dogs for every single meal. For every meal. I remember like my in-laws have a dog and he comes over and they're like, "Oh, don't give them table food. I don't want them to be unhealthy." I'm like, "I don't know, man. I feel like this this asparagus and chicken might be all right." Um, 100%. And we had Kevin Rose on the podcast and he had funded a company called dogagingpro.org. or and I believe what they are doing the whole premise is that uh for some reason I believe it was because a lot of times you don't want to see your you're willing to suffer and you're willing to let your family suffer often times more than you're willing to let your dog suffer but at the same time you're willing to experiment more and so the premise was that they had uh there what's the um drug that is a longevity drug that starts with an Rapomy yes I believe they were doing uh they were selling this to dog owners And what they found was like I guess there's a huge correlation between what we can do with dogs and what we'll eventually do with humans like you're suggesting and they have noticed that they have gotten dogs to live longer and their premise is we are going to start here and then eventually go there to humans and so yeah that people agree with you. Yeah. Yeah. Well I I think that they're looking at it as like you know drug uh and then we'll expand dog longevity and then we'll move into humans. I think what I think that like the business opportunities exist looking backwards like everyone is talking about water cleanliness and water filtration and stuff like this and yet when they go to feed their dog they like put their bowl under the sink and the dog gets a load of like what other toxins alcohol not alcohols chlorine like you know all of these sorts of things and like that's its daily water source. Um, and I think that there's all of these things where like why is there not a reasonably sized company just doing like Aurora, like a really, you know, RO r, like a really high-end water filter, uh, but geared towards dogs or something like that. I don't know. I think like dog saunas and dog dog cold plunges is probably a little too far. But certainly I think that uh there's like a bunch of peptides, supplements, you know, water filtration, things like that that even like doing dog kennels and things like this with more natural materials that probably would do quite well for people who already think and the view the world through the health lens and have not yet begun the process of applying that lens to their health or to their pets. Hey, let's take a quick break to talk about our sponsor today. HubSpot has put together a list of 200 AI business ideas. These are business ideas that you could create using AI and it's a list of 200. They did a huge brainstorm. So, you could check it out. If you just click the link below, you can get access to these 200 AI ideas. Uh, I'll give you an example of a couple of them. One of them is you could build an AI dressing room. So, let's say you go to an e-commerce site and you want to see what something would look like on you. You could use AI to actually take a picture of you and show you what the clothes would look like on you or what the makeup would look like on your face. It's pretty cool, right? um or AI tools for real estate brokers. Maybe something that takes their listings and makes them more more fancy, more more more beautiful and attract more buyers. So, check it out. It's a brainstorm of 200 possible AI ideas brought to you by HubSpot. You can get it for free in the link below. Can you tell me what Light Labs is? That's amazing. I looked at the website. It seems like this might this is your brother's thing. It might be bigger than everything you guys have done. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I hope so. I mean, so my brother and I, we started Kettle and Fire together and we grew it and after some period of of time, he stepped back from the business. And so his new business, which he started last year, is called Light Labs. And what they're doing is basically there are so many toxins and other sorts of like crap in our food supply chain. And at Kettle and Fire, we spend almost half a million dollars a year testing all of the batches that we're making uh of bone broth to make sure that like there's no glyphosate, there's no POS, there's no phalates, like all these sorts of things. And so we as a company spend a lot of money and a lot of energy making sure that our supply chain is clean, but we're making sure that it's clean of stuff that you can't see as a consumer yet you probably care about. And so what light labs is doing is they're basically building a lab testing toxin testing company like a modern one for consumer brands like kettle and fire where they do two things like they will test for nutrition nutrition fact panel uh run the normal like he heavy metals testing things like that but they also do a longer tale of rarer tests like phalates POS glyphosates pesticides things like that and then once they run these tests they actually expose it and push the most recent versions of a brand's lab test to both their website or if you're sold mostly in retail, the goal is to get like a QR code that a consumer can scan and see like what is Kettle and Fire's most recent lab test show around like POS and other sorts of exposures. So I I think this is like one of the most interesting things happening in the health world right now is this broad push towards transparency and like getting a bunch of these things microplastics whatever that people know are bad but don't have visibility into like bringing transparities transparency to that food system which then creates the incentive and energy to make change. So that's kind of what he's doing. I have I have a ton of questions on this. Okay. So you and I lived in Austin together and then before that we lived in San Francisco together. Both uh very much like bubble cities where Austin's like you know uh very health consscious and particularly our friend group is very health consscious and then San Francisco was like you know the the on the forefront of a lot of tech. Do people where I'm from in Missouri where you're from in uh uh PA do they care about any of this stuff? Not right now. But but I think that that's not like not 100% of people have to care for this to make sense. Like what is undoubtedly true is people are spending more time and energy focusing on sourcing toxin reduction. They're spending more money at, you know, companies like Whole Foods, on brands like Kettle and Fire, on their health in general. And I think that this is one of the things that people are going to start caring about when they shop. And like the minute that yes, it may not be like people, you know, where my family's from or your family's from. They may not be asking about phalate load in, you know, their hot dogs that they're eating or something like that, but some percentage of people will. And you only need a small increase in order for there to be demand from the brand and consumer side to inc, you know, to to basically have supply chains and agricultural resources, ranching, like all these practices that incorporate and think about toxin exposure, pesticide load, and and the like. And so I think Light Labs is the type of company that I'm super bullish on bringing transparency to the food system because I think it's just going to like once you bring transparency then there's energy to try and clean up and improve the food system behind that. And so so this company from I I don't know anything about the space it's basically like putting an organic label on your food. So a a food company would pay them and they would say Light Labs is a reputable brand. We have proof that they tested everything. We paid them money to do it and we have a dashboard as well where we can like see where we are in the process of the testing. Is that right? Yeah, exactly. So, consumer brands like we kettle and fire we already have to spend money on um you know on on these different sorts of tests and things like that. Why do you have to? Uh because you're legally required to by the USDA or FDA to do nutrition facts panels. You have to do like heavy metals testing. You just there's just a slew of tests that you have to run. Yeah, by law before you can actually just sell a product. And so that that's like a thing that you already have to do. Then what light labs is doing is they are bringing a bunch more transparency to um to the supply chain and making it so that you can look at you know momentous supplements or like any number of these things and basically see okay beyond just metals testing and things like this what are the other things that they've tested for oh wow I can see you know like no detectable phalates I can see no detectable glyphosate no detectable atrizine like some of these other pesticides that people care about um and so I think it's bringing that what has been like hidden in the depths of these like horrible lab tests run by companies that are like 60 years old to the forefront and making it influence consumers buying behavior. That that makes me so bullish. How big is the biggest lab business now or the couple biggest ones? And when your brother was raising money or when he was just brainstorming with you on describing how big this could be or like what his dreams were in 20 years, what was he saying? Yeah. So the biggest one is called Euro Fins. I think it's like an 11 or 12 billion company like in revenue. Uh no in market cap. Um so but I mean it pretty closely maps to revenue because it's like a service business you know it's it's like not a great doesn't trade very well. Uh so what he was saying is basically step one I think that we can build a competitor and be better than Euroins. Like you submit to a Euroins lab you submit an email inquiry and you get you get a response maybe in like 3 or 4 days. Uh, and then when they run your tests, they don't communicate anything and they dump like 30 PDFs on you that you have to hire someone that understands food scientists to like, you know, translate this stuff. It's really like insane. And you go to their website, euroins.com, it looks like you're like making a vaccine or you're doing like you're doing like like some type of embryo work. Like it's a very intimidating website. Exactly. And so they're not the type of company that is going to build an incredible product for consumer brands. Uh and they're not the type of company that's going to build a consumerf facing product. And so what he was like my brother was thinking is he was like wow this is going to be incredibly interesting. We can build a Euroins competitor. We can do a better job servicing CPG brands. We already know how to do that from his experience at Kettle and Fire. And then we have the opportunity to build out this entire other business where we can build like consumer awareness of these different toxic compounds uh and turn, you know, Kettle and Fire's 500,000 a year of lab testing expense into an actual revenue generating function and almost like a marketing line item. Dude, this is so awesome. Does he have any uh revenue now? Your brother? Yeah, they uh they launched a couple months ago and they've started to get revenue. Yeah. Did he raise funding or did he bootstrap it? He did. No, no, no. This is definitely the type of company you have to raise money for. It looks expensive to start. Yes, definitely. It's it's honestly it's the type of company that I think is it's it's the perfect like act two company. Like Nick has experience, domain expertise, can raise money, and when your first thing is like, hey, we have to raise, you know, millions of dollars and we're going to write a check for like, you know, multiple millions to like buy a laboratory and buy lab equipment, all this stuff. It's tough to make that bet on like a 22 year old, but on a 29y old with some experience, like it makes more sense. Is this in Texas? Yeah, in Austin. Wow. This is amazing. All right. Wow. First of all, this is crazy. How much does Oh, and the uh the labels. So, like if you go to McDonald's or fast food, they put the nutritional there, which is like way more challenging, I think, than like an M&M or a candy bar, which is more controlled. But I'm pretty sure I've always like believed that nutritional labels are [ __ ] Like in my head, I've always been like it's give or take maybe even 30% of what is presented. The calories the is it like I I would just cuz I weigh my food. I I I've track I've tracked almost everything that I've eaten for like four years now in My Fitness Pal. Wow. And like you and you weigh it and I weigh it and now I I eyeball it sometimes. But like first of all, I've noticed a few things. One, when people eyeball their food to track, they almost always overestimate or sorry, underestimate by around 30%. And then if you go and buy like a let's just say a Big Mac, the degree in which they are different is huge. And there's no way that those nutritional labels are accurate with just the calories, let alone like whatever else like the macros plus whatever else is supposed to be in it. Yeah, exactly. I mean the FDA first depending on the uh the compound um or the nutrient like they'll have a limit that is often it's 10 plus plus or - 10% for sure. often time it's upwards of like 30 40 even 50% depending on the compound. Um because as you can imagine some of these things are are fairly sensitive uh like potassium or iodine or things like this that are present in minuscule amounts like it's really hard to say exactly for every single cookie or piece of bread that you're getting or whatever that there is x amount of iodine in it. And so the FDA allows for um you know reasonably high tolerance um on on some of these errors which makes a lot of this nutrition stuff even harder to figure out. Who uh who owns the like is the certified organic is that a company? It is a I believe it's a nonprofit. I think it's Oregon Tilf is one of them. Um, but yeah, it's like a certifying body. And I've always contested that that's [ __ ] because like I just think that when you I've like I've seen farms where they have like an organic section and a non-organic section and like it just seems like when you put medicine on one of them, it inevitably will get in the other one. That is certainly true. The thing that is good for like I think organic is better than nothing, but it's certainly not perfect. And I think that there is a lot of, you know, there's a fair bit of research that organic vegetables, for example, have far fewer pesticides than their conventional kind of counterparts, but they still have some. That's not because they're directly being sprayed. It's because of like, you know, wind, water, like all these sorts of things moving these compounds everywhere. What's another good one you want to do? Function health or skin, gut health. I'm fascinated by all these. Yeah, let's do uh let's do function. So, you know, function health, superpower, like explain what those are. Expl. Yeah. So, function health and superpower, they're basically companies where you can go to their website, um, sign up, pay an annual membership fee, and they'll facilitate a tele medicine thing where they'll be like, hey, you can go get your blood drawn at, you know, a lab or have someone come to you and you can test your own blood for, uh, like, I think it's over 190 markers. So you can get things like POS exposure, heavy metals, uh testosterone, you know, um insulin markers, all these sorts of things that to just know are you healthy or do you have things that you need to work on? And so I think that like I believe that Function is one of the fastest growing companies in the entire Andrees portfolio. Like they're growing super super fast. And yeah, I think they announced another fundraising, but I think they announced that it got to like nine figures in revenue in like two or three years, like something insane. It's crazy. Uh, so it's crazy. And like there's so much demand for people wanting to understand their biomarkers, their lipids, like all these sorts of things. I think that rolling forward 5 years, are we going to know more or less about the health of our bodies and what's like going on in our systems? It's definitely more. And what I think function superpower and the like are doing is they're lowering the friction for people like you and I to understand what's going on in our bodies and our blood and all that. And that information creates a ton of potential for action. But why is why are why is function growing so fast? Because I've used inside insight or inside tracker tracker inside tracker for years and then before that there was I I don't know like there there's these have always been a thing. Why? Like, and now I'm hearing so many people talk about function health, and I'm like, I these have been cool and awesome for a decade now. Why is this one particularly awesome? I I think that their marketing is great. I think that the value prop is great. It's like one price, one annual membership, get this slew of tests. Uh like if you had if you went to your doctor and asked for the same test that Function would give you, it would be like Do they don't let you? Well, well, so if you went to Right, they either don't let you or it would be like seven or $8,000. And so function is like 500 bucks a year. I had a my friend tried to go get this testosterone checked and he went to the doctor and the doctor was like, "Ah, you're 32. You don't you're fine." Exactly. Like you don't need to do that. It's insane. The medical system is so patronizing. It's like there also there's people talking about how you shouldn't get an MRI or shouldn't get your blood work done because like will cause all these questions or scare you and you're like [ __ ] off. Like that stuff is such an insanely patronizing thing. Yeah. It's crazy. Like I I you know I've I've done this before where I'm like I want this tested and they're like but you seem perfectly healthy and I'm like dude just like write it on the paper. It means nothing to you and it's important to me. Just do what I tell you to do please. Like exactly like this this literally requires nothing from you and I'm just going to learn. It it's exactly right. I think that like the medical profession at large there's certainly people that do good but I think that many of them have this like the patient's an idiot. I know everything kind of vibe. And that is if you look at the trajectory of American health certainly uh I think that we need to change what we're doing and I think taking matter like health matters into their own hands is a huge huge thing. And so why this is an interesting trend to me function superpower and the like is for the first time I think you are going to see millions and millions of people being onboarded and understanding like what is going on in their blood uh what's going on in their bodies and then taking steps to optimize or improve that thing. And so right now if you take supplements it's like you know Sam you probably take creatine or something like that. You're you probably take it and you're like eh maybe I'm a little more shredded. Maybe I'm like you know feel better or whatever but you probably don't you're not seeing any of your lab markers change. Same is true of like thyroid or cholesterol markers or lipids or other things. I think as people get this information and start to retest over a you know 6 to 12 month period that we are going to see way way way more products and services that sprout up where people where like there is demand for people who want to optimize their biomarkers. So sort of like today we have personal trainers who help you get shredded cuz like that's kind of the only thing people can see. I think in the future we'll have like apps, trainers, services, things like this that are specific to Sam wants to lower his APOB score or Sam wants to improve his um you know LDL or or something like that. Sam wants to improve his thyroid. Like I think all of these things are newly going to be marketing angles and things that people talk about because they have this insight into their body. This company also took off. And by the way, I quit taking creatine. It it turned me into a gorilla. I got so big like I couldn't I could not like fit into clothing. Like have you have you taken it? I I have and I stopped. Um I stopped because a friend freaked me out. He was like everyone who goes on creatine starts losing their hair which I like didn't experience. Didn't know about but I was like huh I'll cycle off it for 6 months and see what happens. I went on It didn't happen to you obviously. No, not yet. But like I like like I ballooned like I just like got so it just felt like I had so much water. like it was like 15 pounds in like three weeks. Uh, wow. I got huge. Like I went from like 202 to like 215 or something and and then I was like, "All right, I gotta go off it for like 8 days and it just like all went away." Um cuz yeah, I don't know what happened, but um and this function health thing, these guys took off because uh I mean what they did was smart. I don't know if Mark Heyman started it or if he's like considered is he like the the Kim Kardashian of skims where like I don't know if he had the idea or like someone else had the idea and he was the face but like partnering up with that dude who's got 2 million or something followers like my father-in-law is like whatever Mark says I do. Uh and so like uh partnering up with a guy like this is so much better than whatever else health influencers sell like uh coaching PDFs or you know what I mean? Totally. Yeah. Like I I generally think also as a side comment, this is how creators are going to monetize more in the future is like owning chunks of very good businesses that rely on distribution rather than just like I'm Mark Hyman and I get an affiliate fee every time I refer someone to check out function health or something, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. What's this other one about um functional medicine doctor for your home? That is uh amazing sounding. Explain that. Yeah. So there's increasing awareness around how your home can basically be a source of disease. Like lighting can be bad, EMFs, you know, are controversial, but like I think definitely have some health impact. Wait, what's that? Uh EMS, electromagnetic frequencies, basically like your cell phone, your Wi-Fi router, like all of these sort of things that that are that we're surrounded by all the time. Um you know, water toxicity like offging things called volatile organic compounds. basically like the you know when you walk into a a building that's newly painted or something like that you can smell it. Dude, do you have so much anxiety all day? No, I'm pretty chill. I I really believe in the like 8020 thing on this stuff cuz like everything you're describing in my house is like, you know, like a chainsaw and they're just going to just rip me up. Like I saw a video, there's this guy named Carnivore MD and uh he had a video on YouTube explaining like his house and Carnivore MD is like the most extreme of the most extreme when it comes to like these type of granola health influencers. And like he had like uh uh a mattress that had only natural fibers, which I don't I don't know what a grounding thing is, but there was like this like is grounding for electricity. He had like a pole that went into the ground of his home and all the electricity had to like touch that grounding pole. Is that a thing? You know what I'm talking about. That's amazing. Yeah. Like it was like and then he had like um uh no LED light bulbs. He had no Wi-Fi. So there was no Wi-Fi at his home and you had to plug in if you had to if you wanted to use the internet on this one particular area of his home. Like it was crazy. Uh, and I was reading it or watching this video and I'm like that's cool and also this [ __ ] exhausting. Yeah, definitely. So, like when you just named all of these things, I'm like, I don't know, man. Like, I kind of would just [ __ ] kill me early. Like, you know what I mean? Like, maybe I'll just take that as a consequence. Yes. So, I agree. It's exhausting. It's a multiffactorial problem. It's like a thing that people are aware of, want to fix, but don't know where to get started. This is actually why I think that a like functional medicine or like trainer that makes your, you know, your house healthy is a very interesting idea. I actually invested in a company called Lightwork. Um it's dolightwork.com, but they're they're basically doing this where they can send someone to your house and do a test around, you know, what are the things that what are the things that are potentially causing disease or stress or other sorts of things in your home. Uh and it's it's like shocking what they have found like they tested a um you know a billionaire's home recently and across like all sorts of things like air quality, water quality, VOCC's, EMF exposure, all of this you know it rated very very badly like people are not looking at the home through the lens of of health and chronic disease and when you start to there's like a ton of changes that you want to make. many of those are are which are you know confusing or uh you know people don't really understand. So I think that there is a huge opportunity for people to start thinking about you know home health u or housing through the the lens of health and I think that a company like light work or others that brings this sort of home health test assessment uh almost like function you know uh function health for your house is like a really really big opportunity. So they have a list on their website. So, water quality, I assume that includes putting some type of filter. They have lighting, which I imagine that means like no LED lights or a certain type of bulbs. They have EMF, which I guess that is the grounding thing we talked about. Uh like basically somewhat. Yeah, it's it's more like uh it's more like are you sleeping over a Wi-Fi router? Like are you spending a lot of times in air, you know, a lot of time in areas that have a very high power uh you know, electromagnetic frequency. Dude, they're going to get so pissed at me when they found out that I sleep with Family Guy playing in my ear for my cell phone when I sleep on my phone. Oh god, I'm going to fail this test. They have uh uh air quality. So that means like do you have plants inside your house or what? More more like are is what is the quality of uh your air? Mostly that's contributed like things that are bad. Are some of the paints that are doing offging? Some furnitureures off gas quite a lot. uh you know microplastic fibers kind of like floating around in the air um from your like carpet or something like that. So a lot of these things do these guys make money? Uh they just started so the answer is sort of so far. How much does it cost? Uh it depends on the house size but anywhere it's it's definitely a premium product like 5,000 or 10 grand. Yeah. Yeah. And and it's I would say that it is one of these companies that starting out is expensive. concierge like all that kind of stuff. Over time, I think there's a huge amount of potential uh especially using AI and whatnot to have people kind of do a version of this assessment almost themselves where you walk around your house with a camera and all these sorts of things and this company just tells you like change this, do this, this is probably bad, this is not. Um like there's a there's a really cool potential technology solve here, I think. And the guy who started this, does he have a background in this stuff? Uh yeah, he so he got incredibly sick. Ken's wife actually um moved into a house. Uh that house was on top of a power line. Uh that house had like a bunch of mold issues that they didn't realize about when when they moved in. And over the course of a year, their health on like every marker, energy, everything just like collapsed. And so they went, you know, they went they're healthy, they're 31. Um they went to normal doctors, they went to all these people. And only after a crazy amount of experimentation and talking to doctors do they realize, wow, it's our health that like our home is actually making us sick. And that's what kind of got them down this rabbit hole of trying to understand the problem, which is that many people are getting sick, feeling low energy, feeling all these things uh cuz they're being slowly poisoned by the house they live in. Dude, I feel whenever I hear this story, I think I'm broken because like, you know, I describe my family like my where I'm from in Missouri. We're basically we're we're just mules. Like we like, you know, you eat donuts in the morning, you eat cheeseburgers and fries in the afternoon, and you eat steak and pizza and French fries at night with tons of beer, and you just do that every single day, and you just don't complain. And like, if you were to tell like you tell me that these people like if if my house was full of mold, I would just think I have allergies. It just h whatever. Like this is just how I feel. Do you know what I mean? And so like I wouldn't I wouldn't know, you know, to like do I just thought I would just think this is just life. And I and I wouldn't ever complain about it either. I would just be like h [ __ ] it. Like rub some dirt on it. It's fine. You're not alone. I mean, this is like how most people respond to this, right? I just think that as people are becoming more aware of these things. Were you not raised that way? My mom was one of the early like into organic people. Yeah. She would buy milk in a glass jug that was like unpasteurized, so it had all these nasty clumps and you'd like pour it into your cereal in the morning and a clump would hit it and the whole like bowl would explode all over you. It was so gross. Your mom's a freak. I know. At one point, I think I was like in fourth or fifth grade, the health food store where she was buying all this stuff literally burned down and all the kids like threw a party. We were like, "Yay, no more no more crappy milk." That's insane. It, you know, it is funny as my wife, you know, as we've had kids, started having kids, it's so funny. Once the baby comes out of you, you automatically become granola. Uh, there there's a there's a subreddit. Have you seen the subreddit? It's called like uh uh granola mom. Is it moderately granola moms? Yeah, moderately granola moms. A place for almost hippies. And honestly, it's like one of my favorite places to get information because it's people who are hippie hippie dippy, but they're self-aware, which is like why I like you. So, like I want like someone who's like, you know, loves the extreme stuff, but can also dumb it down to me who's more uh like, you know, I don't really want to learn everything. I wish you would just tell me what to do and tell me like what's like experimental versus what's like actually proven. and like you like kind of can help me as a more normal consumer figure it out. And uh I've noticed that my wife the second you know we we had a kid it was like no more teflon um plastic bottles are no go like things like that. And frankly I love it. I love it. Yeah. We we hung out with Joe Debia recently. Did you know did you ever go to Airbnb's office? Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know if you remember this but they were wild. So, this was back in 2000. I think they did this actually from the beginning. But they had 2,000 people working out of that office, something like that, maybe a thousand. And they made 100% of their own food and to to an extreme. So, for example, they had Air Bowl, which was some type of like Airbnb Red Bull. They had uh so the the condiments, the ketchup, the mayonnaise was literally made on site by the staff. And so, and their meats were all from butchers. Uh, every single thing they had. So, they had trail mix where it was like nuts with like chocolate that they had made. Uh, it was crazy. And I distinctly remember that and I thought it was crazy. And then I started thinking about it. I'm like, that's kind of amazing. And we hung out with Joe Gibbia and I asked him about that. I go, "What? Why did you guys do this?" He goes, "Man, that's how I was raised." like my I think he I think he grew up in Vermont or somewhere some somewhere uh rural New England and he was like my mom was basically into this stuff and I was raised doing all this and I just thought it was good for the planet and it was good for our bodies and so we insisted at Airbnb that we did this and so back then you know I don't know how maybe Joe's 40ome so he was uh raised in the late ' 80s early 90s back then if you did that like your mom you were a freak now all the young cool guys that like we follow on Instagram or who we're friends with all do this stuff and I think it's like pretty amazing. That is so cool. You don't remember that about Airbnb? Uh I went there I I didn't Yeah, I went there to like meet up with friends and then see a talk. Uh so I only went two or three times and didn't actually get that that level detail. That's so cool. It was wild. I don't know if they still have an office. I don't know if they still do that, but during the pandemic they had to lay people off and unfortunately the the culinary staff was probably the first to go. Yeah, that that feels like the first thing that a public company like activist investor kind of yells at you for. Yeah, but you know, I understand that. It's could be tough to justify when there's like no need for an office. But that was the story it and honestly it was amazing. I tell the story all the time and I when I saw that I was kind of on board with Airbnb even further cuz I'm like if they sweat the details with this they probably sweat the details with other stuff. So I think that's awesome. All right, let's do two or three more. You had one on about uh skin gut health. What is that? And whenever someone says gut health it freaks me out because the what's it called? Leaky Gut is the world's greatest branding. Yeah. So, this is actually a cosmetics company that I've I've wanted to invest in for so long. I haven't seen anyone do it. If you're doing this, like, please just email me. Uh my email is very easy to find or ping me on Twitter. But the thing that I think should happen is like there's I don't know how many hundreds of billions a year are spent on the skinincare kind of space. And if you look at research, there are certain things that work like certainly there's classes of peptides and things like that that I think maybe work decently well um from a skincare standpoint, but for most people if you're buying any sort of skinare to look younger or whatever, it's just like a waste of money or it's like marginally effective. Um that so say that again. So your your stance here is that skincare is mostly a waste. Skincare is mostly a scam. Yeah. Yeah. minus like a couple things like certain peptides, uh it's sunscreen, moisturizer, sure if you want your skin to be like more moist, but a lot of the anti-aging stuff, anti-rinkle cream, all these sorts of things. Is that uh is there one that starts with an R? Uh well, retinol A is one of the few things that's actually that's actually relatively effective. It's like all but this is the thing. It's like basically only peptides are the things that work. That's a peptide. Yeah. So it's it's a peptide. things like um like one skin uses a peptide. Uh there's something called like copper, it's copper GKU, I think, which is another peptide. These things seem to actually work. Um as well as some compounds like methylene blue and whatnot. But other compound like any sort of random $50 thing that you're going to buy on Amazon that is like anti-aging and uses, you know, Jojoba oil or like any of these things like just fra like just do not work. Um or if they do, they are so marginal it's basically not worth doing in my opinion. Um what does work is and you don't wear sunscreen either, right? No, you you that that's one of your like bold stances which is that sunscreen is I mean I basically think like most sunscreen is carcinogenic. Again, this is another thing in the in the US we allow things like oxyenzones that are not allowed in the EU. It's in almost every sunscreen in the US. Uh it is definitively carcinogenic. And so like why we encourage kids to put on put this on and like use it eight hours a day. I've not So do you use zinc? Um, so I use a a nonnano zinc oxide sunscreen just for my face if I'm going to be in the sun for like a very long period of time. Yeah, dude. Just so controversial for a white guy to just I know. I don't know. Like I I feel like I' I am happy with my skin. Um, so so yeah, so the thing that I want to invest in is there is a lot of research that shows the relationship and the link between gut health and skin health. Uh and so like if you have a healthy gut or if you work on probiotics or you work on like you know drinking bone broth doing things like this that are going to improve your gut health generally um there's research that shows that that is reflective in skin. There's something called I think it's called like bioluminescence basically but there's a way that you can measure how much light someone's like skin cells are emitting and that improves as your gut health improves which is kind of a wild fact. How how long is the is the change? So, like for example, I don't have like the greatest I I have dry flaky skin. I just thought it was just cuz I'm just like a super white dude and like in the winter time my skin gets destroyed. In the summer time I'm great. But like you know uh I always thought that it was just like the lack of sun cuz like my scalp will get my scalp will get like so dry during the during the winter time and I like need to get under the sun. Yeah. Yeah. So one of those like red light chicken lamps. Does that do stuff? Yeah. That's helpful, dude. Like during winter time, I feel miserable. Like I I like I'm like I need like the sun to like burn off everything on my head and on my face. So if I started drinking, what's the routine? If I started doing that, how long would my skin it take for my skin to get better? I I bet it would take like 6 months basically. Um basically I I think it's going to be summer by this by that time. Start now. You'll be great in December. Yeah. Um, but I I I think that the macro like business opportunity is people treat skinare as just a a topical thing that you apply to your skin, not like an an expression of your gut health and skin health and all these sorts of things. And so I think there is an opportunity to build an incredibly large cosmetics company um you know and skincare company combining topical applied skinare that's actually effective with gut-based interventions that are going to like improve your skin from sort of the inside out. And I've like wanted this company to exist for seven years now. But but isn't that bone broth? I mean what does this look like? Yeah. So I think it would be like a combination of specialized probiotics that um that are geared towards you know improving skin health. Uh, I think it would be probably a crash diet of like 30 to 60 days where you're removing a bunch of like toxins and uh other inflammatory foods from your diet, incorporating bone broth and then some sort of like effective topical skinincare and I think that regimen would outperform basically anything that exists in the skincare world today. Do you eat any processed foods? I try not to, but like do on a weekly basis. How how often? Probably very probably none. zero to yeah one so like that's easy for I understand that for meals so you pro you do you you probably cook or do leftovers what about for a snack what's a an example uh I use these actually I just had one earlier so it's a Maui newie venison stick oh I have one as well I got I got my my my uh kettle and fire uh collab with them there we go yeah dude they're so you guys you guys sent me a bunch of them I think like each stick is like $3 it's like3 or $4 I I have like $1,000 worth of these at my house. Amazing. Um so I I do those like meat sticks. I'll do fruit. Um couple of bone broth. Like those are kind of the go-to snacks. I've kind of been addicted to dried mangoes recently which But that's processed. No. Like is that not considered is is beef jerky is not considered processed? I I wouldn't consider it processed. Like if you're sourcing it, you know, sourcing it from a good place, like it's not going to have a bunch of additives. It's basically just like meat that has been dried and then some spices. Uh yeah, I do dried mango. Where do you I do it from Whole Foods, but the problem is is that like I'll eat I can do like a bag a day, which is like it is a problem, right? 800 calories. Uh and like it's basically like four Cokes. Yeah. Yeah. Although I I don't know. I've been eating like I there's there's this interesting diet online that I'm I'm currently trying. It's called the honey diet, but basically you just eat fruit and honey before noon each day and then have like a high protein meal in the afternoon. Why are you doing this? just to experiment, frankly, and to just see how I feel. But so far, I feel pretty [ __ ] good. And so the the mangoes fit within that diet. I've been doing um my snack lately has been dates and butter. Have you ever had that? No. Oh my god. It's the great I think I saw Carnivore MD do it and I was like, "Let me try this." Cuz I got a sweet tooth. Like I have a a very addictive personality and when I quit drinking alcohol, it totally went to sugar. So I'm always having to combat that. But I think everyone is. And so, uh, uh, uh, half a tablespoon of butter in a date. It's like the greatest thing on earth. I'll give it a go. Actually, Carnivore MD is very into this like meat and fruits thing. Like honey, fruit, and meat is basically his diet. Uh, and he's very into this. So, I don't know. I I actually think that we there's a good chance that honey, fruit, like we're on the the very early stages of like people realizing that sugar is not that bad for you when it comes in fruit or honey form. That's an interesting take because I would have thought you would have said the opposite which is like glucose is glucose. No. Oh, that's that's interesting. So, you do high sugar fruit as well, not just this is something I'm just starting to experiment with and so like I'm not even sure. So, I I literally I got my labs done recently uh and then like last week started this honey diet thing. So, I'm going to test again in like 3 months and see how I see how things look. That's pretty fascinating. I would not have thought that that's something you would do because I like I've read about like bananas. Uh Sam Corkos actually told me he said this in passing so I don't want to like attribute this to because I could have I could have be listening to him wrong but I believe he said that a modern banana is candy and the way it used to be was like a carrot. He was like they they were not like this as delicious but we've like genetically you know it's kind of like a honey cris apple like you know what like it's basically like genetically predisposed to be like you know wa sweet. Yeah. Yeah, like it's I think the new apple that's popular is called a cotton candy apple. That's funny. I like Have you seen they have that at Central Market? It was called the cotton candy apple. I'll have to try it. I've not seen that. So like you would eat that? Uh I mean I would experiment with it for 90 days for sure. Yeah. Like I I don't think a lot of this stuff like yes if you're optimizing for sweetness I I understand that um that you could argue maybe it's bad but I think that nature tends to like keep tradeoffs within a certain band. Um, and so I don't know if you're having organic produce or whatever, like I I I think that this stuff is like not it's not bad to experiment with it and just see how you feel. Do you eat uh vegetables? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I do. Well, Ari's laughing at me. So, and so are you. But like a lot of some of these guys are like I think Carnivore MD in particular is uh on some parts anti on some things anti vegetable. He's come off that a little bit. I mean, like to me, I I think that you just have to have a macro lens on this, which is like what have humans been eating for hundreds of thousands of years. It's not like, you know, in in the year 1900 rolled around or 1970 when like the chronic disease crisis really started ramping up that all of a sudden people are rampantly eating vegetables and getting sick all the time. It's like obviously in my view not like we are in the midst of a vegetable eating epidemic that is making everyone sick. It's like clearly like the ultrarocessed foods that are new to our food system. And so, does he have some good points? Like, maybe are vegetables less good than than most people think? Like, I could believe that. Do I think it is a thing that is like worth optimizing to never eat vegetables? Like, definitely not. Here's one um for some of these health trends. Um I think that um polyester clothing is going to um there's going to be I mean, there's already a niche of people. I'm one of them where I I I don't wear if a clothing has polyester. I I tried always to avoid it unless it's like, you know, like special or particularly amazing where but but in general it's got to be all natural fibers. Are you are you on board with that? Oh yeah. I mean polyester clothing is like the number one contributor to to microplastics basically. They like shed like crazy when you're washing them. And there was um there's some studies that have been done around uh they basically took dogs and had them wear polyester underwear and their sperm count went down like 60 or 70%. And then they switched them off of polyester underwear and like it came right back up. [ __ ] No way. So what underwear do you wear? Do you wear underwear? Yeah. So there's a company called NADS that does like organic um organic stuff. There's another company called Pacted Pac and I usually wear those. How interesting is women's I mean I don't know is w does this in does this matter to women? So it's unclear to me right now I would say potentially but it seems like the thing that is causing the loss of sperm is like there's some sort of um electrical charge thing that happens between polyester and the skin that seems to impact um impact like you know sperm generation. And so it's it's not clear to me yet. I haven't like gone super deep on it. How fascinating. So yeah, pretty wild though, right? That dog thing is crazy. So are you crazy? There you go. That's another great dog health idea. You know, dog all all natural dog underwear. That's insane to me. So I use uh Exa Afficionado and I loved it because it was uh it like would dry quickly after you cleaned it and they never stretched out, but I think it is highly synthetic. Uh oh, almost certainly. And so, but honestly, cotton underwear for the most part sucks, but there's some companies that are making like really good cotton workout gear and cotton underwear that I I really appreciate. So, like for example, what I like to do is a lot of my workout shorts, I just get sweatpants, like all cotton sweatpants, and I'll cut them. Uh, but like I'm a big fan of like all cotton workout gear because Lululemon and uh like it has like underwear in the shorts so your junk is just on the polyester even harder. Do you know what I mean? Totally. Totally. There there's actually a company there's a company called Riker. Riker I love their stuff. It's I love Riker. Yeah. It's so good. It is so good. It's the only short company for men and they have shirts and stuff too, but it's the only but the shorts are in particularly particularly are hard to do because you like if a if a workout short doesn't have the underwear then you're just kind of like floping all over. You know what I mean? So you like but it's hard to do with cotton. Totally. Yeah. So their their stuff is great. I really really like what they're doing. Um and I I use their stuff for all my workout clothes. That's great. Um can you tell me really quick? Are there I just want to know what Justin does. Are there any other Do you have any other stances like this? So, this is like so fascinating to hear some of your stances that might be controversial or uncommon. I feel pretty confident that like our current vaccine schedule is very much not good from a chronic disease standpoint. I don't I don't like make any claims around autism or whatnot, but from a food allergy standpoint, uh certainly the US is like the worst chronic disease issue and is the most vaccinated and has like the the the most egregious vaccine schedule of any developed country. So, what are you suggesting? Spacing it out or not taking them? Yeah, I I basically think like fewer shots, more spaced out is like what I'm planning to give kids. I wrote a very long post on this. It is pretty incredible. Like for example, they give a kid a HETB B shot like literally 5 minutes or less, like 2 minutes out of the womb. And I was like, well, I don't I don't know if she's going to be around like someone with HEP B anytime soon. So, well, the only way you can get a HEP B is through sexual, you know, sexual activity and blood transfusions. And they test the mom for he B before birth. And so, like, you're just vaccinating a kid against something and and the immunity wears off after a decade. And also not that many people have I don't think he B is like particularly common uh like it's basically drug users I believe. Totally. I I I mean and the other thing is like my view is that our our health organizations have been captured and uh you know by large companies and I think like you look also the co mrna vaccine was added to the infant childhood imu immunization schedule this year. It's like that is not a scientific position that is purely something else is going on. Um, so I I think that's like a relatively controversial take that I have um that I wrote a very long piece about that I think is defensible. Any other last ones? Yeah. So against like the health tribe, um I think that the Yeah, the fruit and sugar one is probably like the biggest one that I'm that I'm focused on right now. And then I also think that this like demonization of I think that the tribal stuff, tribaless of of like food cultures is is something that I I think is not not good. Like I basically am much more into nutrient density. And I think if you're eating nutrient-dense like pizzas and carbs and all that stuff as opposed to like conventional, you know, vegetables, fruits, and meats all the time that are like maximally sprayed and processed and all this stuff, like I I actually think that eating a bunch of carbs that are from a very very good source, uh probably your health outcomes will be better. That stuff's like impossible to find. Like for example, in order to do that, you'd have to find someone that mills their own grain or something like that. Like like that's like it's virtually impossible or not virtually impossible, but it's a job. Yeah. Yeah, it is. I very much agree. Um, dude, you're the man. Thank you. I just like uh you know, I text you these questions anyway and so it's fun just to get now every time just to pepper you with all types of questions that I have. But I appreciate you. Yeah. No, this has been super fun, man. Thanks for having me on as always. And we didn't even promote your company. Yeah. So, my my company um Kettle and Fire is a bone broth company, which we talked about. Uh my my company now is called True Med. We're basically making it so you can buy um exercise, healthy food, supplements using taxfree HSA or FSA money. So, if you go to trmed.com, you can see a bunch of the brands where you can spend taxfree dollars. Um, and then if you are interested in like some of the health stuff I talk about, I also have a newsletter which is Justin Mar's Substack and a new podcast. True Med has a podcast. It's great. I like it. Yeah. Yeah. We're we're doing like a couple episodes on, you know, movement, exercise, nutrient density, dude. I appreciate you. Thank you so much. God bless. Thanks for having me on. That's it. That's the part. [Music]

My First Million is a HubSpot Original Podcast // Brought to you by HubSpot Media // Production by Arie Desormeaux // Editing by Ezra Bakker Trupiano

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
you hear about these companies that going from like 0 to 100 million in like 2 years or 3 years or whatever like the equation is very simple from a company [Music] perspective what's up uh we got my buddy Imad here he's the founder of mercury an awesome company that I use and love and is uh you've created a billion dollar company dude you did it you did the thing that all of us when we were living in San Francisco and and in our 20s trying to build these companies you finally did it how does that feel uh it's funny you say that so you we raised our series B in 2021 uh which is actually like four months uh after we did our last podcast together at my first million in January 2021 uh and then we're just announcing our series C uh which is a 3.5 billion valuation with seoa leading but in 2021 when I raised my Ram that was at a 1.6 billion valuation and it was so weirdly anticlimactic uh because it's like I started as an entrepreneur in 2006 so 2021 what is that like 15 years so I've been working towards this objective of like building a unicorn company right like that's as you say like you I moved her when I was like 22 and like that's all it was about for me for a long time it was like getting this like really successful company uh and then you you hit this objective like becoming a unicorn and like nothing changes so I have this like I have this helmet behind me me cuz that's like this is from Joe Montana uh he was uh he's an investor and he's he's a uh footballer so he sent me the helmet and that's literally the only thing I got when I became a unicorn I mean obviously I had a successful company but I keep it there to show like you know like these objectives don't really matter it's like you have to enjoy the journey because you hit the objective and then you're like okay now what dude Joe Montana should make that his thing he's just he should send a helmet to every founder who becomes a unicorn I mean he sends it to the ones he funds because this says like billion dollar Club on it uh it's kind of cool all right I told you I said uh love to brainstorm with you ideas I thought you would come with a bunch of fintech ideas CU you're the bank guy but you came with a bunch of you sent me a list of bullet points none of which sound like fintech so I'm excited give me some of these ideas things that you think Founders today could be going and doing or if you weren't doing Mercury that you would be interested in doing yeah uh so I I had three trends that I think are interesting uh trend number one is space and space Tech uh there's a few reasons I like the trend number one you know I'm I'm just a Sci-Fi nerd like I love space so I think it's really exciting as a space and it's finally hit this point where like there's all of these kind of enablement factors so you number one like just a few years ago getting anything to space was like a 100 million Endeavor right like we're talking about like literally $1 million to get something in space that works because you know there was no SpaceX and all of the space satellite stuff was like these hardened like you know radiation proprof Like Satellites now the other week like SpaceX did like 8 flights or something in one week like it's insane so you know you this there's this repeatable kind of channel to get things in space it's much much cheaper and it's going it's getting cheaper every every month basically and nowadays people have these kind of micros slat platforms where it's basically computer in space like it's not going to cost you a million dollars to get like just to build the satellite like you can do it for like $100,000 or something so this is like huge enablement thing and I've invested in a bunch of companies I did this company called albo that's doing that's doing kind of very low earth orbit pictures of things so you can get like 10 cm kind of resolution pictures from space yeah everyone's kind of excited about AI which I'm also excited about that but that's a heavily you know everyone's doing it competive I think actually space is still like super open there's not that many people kind of attempting things in space um so the crazy idea sent to you which I don't love this idea in terms of like we need to come up with like why we should do this but I think a nuclear power plant in space would be really cool uh like potentially we put this thing on the moon uh and then we mine uh mine water from the Moon and you one of the cool things about water is if you can split water you get hydrogen and oxygen and oxygen and hydrogen together make rocket Fu but it's also like you get breathable oxygen which is useful uh so having power in space is pretty useful uh and there's lots of interesting things on the moon uh and you know if you have a nuclear power plant there you could probably like there's this other cool company that does this thing I don't know if you've SE seen it I can't remember the name but like it spins things super fast and then like basically fires them out I think it's very hard to get something from Earth's surface into space by like spinning around around and flicking it but you I think on the moon it's much easier the gravity is lower and there's no air resistance right um so yeah if you had a nuclear power plant you could power there uh so I thought that was cool let's see what else uh I I'll talk about my second uh theme because it ties into space as well so the second theme is defense deck in general uh obviously we've seen andero um but you there's kind of two Trends well actually three tends Trends in defense deck that I think interesting number one uh yeah there's a lot of geopolitical disturbance everyone is basically yeah we're living in like or moving into a multi-polar world which means like you know there's India there's China there's America uh and America is no longer kind of the policeman right like the only way America since the 1990s has been able to be a policeman is there hasn't been any other power to really challenge that right uh so it's not just the US is is needs to rearm it's all of Europe uh you know India whatever like everyone is like arming so so you have like all of these people that are in the market now that weren't and then number two autonomous vehicles have changed the game right there drones uh AI in general can be applied to all of this stuff and then number three yeah you're going to get a ton of drones like it's not just like big billion doll fighter planes right it's going to be actually like a thousand or million like tiny drones that are like easy to manufacture so so all of these things kind of make it so startups can now compete again in a way that like wasn't possible before so I think there's like two two types of ideas that I think are interesting number one like how do you make more things autonomous so people are doing autonomous drones but you could do autonomous Subs autonomous boats autonomous tanks right like I think a lot of these things are not being head on uh and when you make them autonomous you can change the form factor as well like you can make them smaller you can make thousands of them uh so that's one aspect and then second aspect is like uh a lot of these autonomous things kind of favor defense so I was reading about this and the Ukraine Russia war is like actually like trench warfare which is kind of crazy like we haven't had it since World War I but they're literally digging trenches and like that's why the lines are like hardly changing because it's like neither of them has a superiority uh the drones actually make it hard to get air superiority because you can have like a tiny drone knockout at like a million dollar plane uh so in that world like yeah so you've got one side is the autonomous side second side is like the kind of how do we build more defensive autonomous things as well so like you know maybe we automatically have these machines that are drink building trenches uh you could have autonomous mines that are like smart and they don't I mean I guess that sounds like bad to people but you could have it so like it's a if it's a civilian it doesn't blow up if it's a tank it does blow up right like you can you can make these like safer uh mines that move around uh and then to tie back to the space thing uh you know I think in the next kind of War Space Warfare will be a big part of it right like if you if you can knock out uh satellites you can like Che you know cut down on uh starlink and all of this kind of communication you can remove the uh the visual side of things right like these kind of satellites that are viewing things uh you can knock knock out GPS so some of that actually happened during the Ukraine war there was like some you know there's some rumors about like some satellites being knocked out but I think that's going to be a big thing so so the counter to that is how do you how do you create defense around satellites right how do you uh maybe you'll have like stealth equivalent of stealth satellites right like you kind of only move them when like the the sun is kind of obscuring the the viewp and uh you move them to a place and then obscure the Obscure them completely so they're not reflective uh yeah I know there's a ton of ideas around like defensive kind of stuff in space as well all right so a lot of people watch and listen to the show because they want to hear us just tell them exactly what to do when it comes to starting or growing a business and really a lot of people who are listening they have a full-time job and they want to start something on the side a side hustle now a lot of people message Sean and I and they say all right I want to start something on the side is this a good idea is that a good idea and again what they're really just saying is just give me the ideas well my friends you're in luck so my old company the hustle they put together a hundred different side hustle ideas and they have appropriately called it the side hustle idea database it's a list of 100 pretty good ideas frankly I went through them they're awesome and it gives you how to start them how to grow them things like that gives you a little bit of inspiration so check it out it's called the side hustle idea database it's in the description below you'll see the link click it check it out let me know in the comments what you think so what I like about what you just said is that there's probably Three core things I think about when it comes to great ideas and I will differentiate a great idea from a good idea so on this podcast a lot of times we'll talk about good ideas a good idea means a business where there's there is demand there might even be competition it might even be established but that gives you a bit of a Playbook and there's there it's not going to be winter take all there's room for everybody to eat and a good idea what it profiles out to is that you make millions of dollars maybe tens of millions dollars maybe aund couple hundred million dollars with a higher likelihood of success but you'll pretty much never get to the the billion dollar or or sort of groundbreaking new category creation type of companies doing that and what you're talking about is a different criteria for great ideas and a great idea I would say there's three test the first is the Peter teal test so famously teal went to YC and you know he was asked to give a talk and he went and he drew two circles on the white board like a vent diagram and he basically said he he colored in the middle and and he labeled one Circle sounds like a bad idea and the other Circle was is actually a good idea and he's like you're looking for the overlap because the the best ideas sound initially like a bad idea but actually are a good idea and so um now that's hard to do because you don't know what's actually a good idea you you have to sort of think for yourself there but what it is good at is it sort of reminds you not to run away if your initial idea sounds a little crazy sounds a little out there or or you know eight out of 10 people who first hear it say nah no way right and so you uh so that's the first thing it's like a great idea typically comes disguised as a bad idea the second thing is some inflection point so you talked about how for space suddenly if SpaceX is doing eight trips in a week right it's like going to space went from somewhat impossible to possible now a regular thing it's like oh I could just hitch a ride on one of these trips and the trips are getting cheaper and cheaper every year or somebody's already taking a payload up and I can just add something to it or I can build on top of their satellite platform that's already already going to be up there so I think that's a huge inflection like you're talking about the other one you talked about with defense is autonomy so just the ability to make things self-driving self-flying self um you know self- swimming you know just basically uh give a thing eyes and now it has a brain because of AI and suddenly you can take humans out of the equation for for that job and when it comes to like Warfare or defense great because that's you know Liv saved when you when you do that um so you know you have these inflections so that's thing number two and thing three I would say is um scares everybody off so like you know you were saying AI in general like you know uh if if I said I'm building an AI agent startup that's probably like the biggest bloodbath competition right now but you're kind of right that smart capable teams that are doing interesting things in space there's still like way more opportunity and way Le versus the number of teams pursuing them um and same thing in in defense that you know still the average smart capable team is not um not going after that right now and so there's just like a lot of room and you know these are huge Tams right so uh obviously like you know space and satellites that's a that's a huge market and then defense is obviously huge especially as you said the whole world is rearming so it kind of hits all three even though my first reaction when you say nuclear power plant in space I'm like all right I don't even that breaks my brain a little bit I don't even know what that means it's not even possible um I kind of like the underlying thought process you have going in even though I don't fully get the like you know the end product idea cuz I just don't know anything about the space uh yeah I mean I have like some simple ideas that are maybe good but not great but like you know more achievable um here's a fun one I thought about last night I thought it' be fun to have a billboard in space uh so you first space so so I had this like a few years ago I was like going camping and I didn't have internet and like you there was this like starlink satellite launch and I don't know if you've ever seen it but like I think they fixed it so it doesn't do this but they basically launched the satellite so they were like they were kind of positioning them so they were all visible and there was like 20 in a string in space and you could see them naked eye with a telescope or just naked eye no just naked eye you just look up and there's like a string and then initially I was like are those stars are they UFOs because they're like yeah they're like very bright like they're brighter than a star uh but they're like they're like completely in the line and they're moving quite fast because they're in like Alo right um but I was like oh that's kind of sick like I you know you can literally as a human like launch this thing that changes like everyone's view from the earth uh right I thought that was like kind of insane uh but yeah I think I don't think it would be that hard to put a billboard in space and make it so you could view it from a telescope I don't think you could do it like I mean you could probably do the natural eye thing but like obviously people complain uh but making it so you can be with the telescope I think would be actually kind of cool and then people would like buy that uh so this one's more a good idea I mean I don't think that's a billion dollar idea but do you remember there was a a whole service around uh buying and naming stars do you do you remember this this was kind of like a big idea in the '90s maybe early 2000s three body problem that's like one of the one of the ideas I hav't I haven't actually read it now it's like on my kind of to-do to read list but we um back in the day we had this business called Birthday alarm and birthday alarm was like a to remind you of when it's your friends and family's birthday and then you could send an e-card just like a greeting you know animated e-card but there was this company that had approached us that was like Hey if you add the um gift of naming a star after someone you get a certificate blah blah blah and it was like whatever 30 bucks to to buy a star in someone's name and that company was doing like 20 million a year I remember and it was just like a couple of guys and they were and they approached us to that we said no but when we had gotten to know them I was stunned that they were doing you know that much revenue um at least at that time I do think it was a bit of a fad but still that was that was very impressive to me I thought the other one that would be kind of cool is like you know when I die if I it would be cool to send like I actually don't want to be crom but if I was cre it would be cool to send some ash to space uh having like some sort of memorabilia being sent to space I think is kind of interesting as well uh and that would be easier uh in the more practical ideas I do think intelligence as a service is kind of like an interesting idea so you mention AI agents so there's tons of these companies going after to these big categories right like this ai sdrs ai customer support agents uh I haven't seen too many companies kind of go after more Niche ideas where people are willing to pay so uh AI sat T tutor right like imagine like actually like AI is great as at education because a like the content is like extremely easy for AI to do super structur B yeah B can be completely personalized C it's just extremely patient right like I mean when I try to teach my 13year old I'm like pulling my hair out after like a few minutes uh so there's a whole class of like you know you take any test and you could probably make an like a AI agent that's like great at that and great at teaching that so like you could do the bar exam you could do MC whatever a no-brainer is somebody doing that somebody has to be doing that right because I haven't heard of anyone doing a great jaw I'm sure nobody's won yet which is amazing but like you know you look at Kaplan and you look at you look at the the Big T prep companies they were built like decade like many decades ago right and they were built in the I mean I used to buy like those giant books with uh you know the practice tests in them from Princeton I think Princeton Review or whoever when I was studying for the SATs and then sure it moved to like video and online after that but now you're right like if you just did AI a personal one-on-one tutor I think that's you know obviously that's obviously the best I don't know if you've seen the studies of like are you right about the like the the two s thing when it comes to tutoring it's basically like nothing has shown as measurable of an effect as one-on-one tutoring in education yet and it's basically the the problem for a long time was I think I think you basically would get something like two standard deviations above the meain and by the way this is kind of debated and people say no that was it was measured wrong and it's not true I think intuitively it's like feels right right like when I'm learning something if I talk to someone like if I had a gun to my head and it was get the best grade possible on this test right if my life depended on it would I choose uh just showing up cold no would I choose just a book where I self-pace and self-study no what I choose a library of videos no if it was like a a tutor comes to my house and sits with me for six hours a day and that's how I study for this I'd be like that's my best shot and if it was the smartest most patient tutor with infinite knowledge and knew exactly where my level was and was ready to work with me the moment I was ready to do it all times of the day right that's an AI comp um so I think that's kind of uh kind of great because it's so scoped to you know one CH one specific um test which people are not doing because they voluntarily want to you know educate themselves but like I need to pay X dollar to get y grade to get into Z College yeah you're willing to pay yeah I think like the the good ideas right now in these kind of AI agent whatever things are like these like kind of more nichy ideas that you can expand from later like rather trying to do like all tutoring right I think that's actually like quite a hard problem and AI is not quite there yet like if you pick just one thing and you just like completely nail it uh then you can always expand from there as well right right right I like that um what are some of the most interesting companies you've invested in recently so have uh is there any company that's like taking off or doing well that you you you feel like more people should know about but they don't they don't know about it yet you know this like what I put put as like intelligence as a service company so I'm an investor in 11x which does kind of AI sdrs and I'm also an investor in decagon that does kind of AI customer support agents um you know they just have like these insane numbers uh I don't think they're public but you know you hear about these companies that going from like 0 to 100 million in like you know two years or three years or whatever like all of these ones that hit where they're like you know like the equation is very simple from a company perspective it's like hey I'm paying a ton of money for customer support or SDR like if you can do the same task uh with some sort of like fallback to humans uh at half the price sure let's do it right so there definitely across a bunch of these spaces uh and the big ones are like you know sales customer support legal uh accounting uh a bunch of these and I'm an investor in like many of these companies uh there's definitely like a moment where like they're really winning and obviously it's still early but it seems obvious to me that like a bunch of these things will be delivered by AI so on the other side every company's that has sales or CS or whatever the CEO the board is saying like Hey how do you make yourself more efficient through AI right so uh you the buyers are like really looking for Solutions and anyone there's not that many actual right in each of these spaces there are a lot of companies but like normally it's really hard to do Enterprise sales right like this is like a 9mon 12 month cycle but when you have like buyers that are just like hey I need to deploy something something to show something that I'm like I'm doing stuff in AI it creates this like moment where you can actually like have this exclusive Enterprise sales growth which is actually very rare it only happens like in these kind of rare Trends would you let's say you weren't doing Mercury right now you had all your free time and you know everything you know today and you wanted to find an AI idea a winning AI idea what would be your process like explain to me how Imad finds like kind of comes up with the ideas and vets them and sort of figures out what idea to do versus what idea not to do I approach things like both top down and bottom up so top down uh and actually did this as part of like your your podcast prep stuff I you know I went to chat GD and said like hey tell me every every human worker in the US that like does knowledge work give me a list of all of them and tell me how much labor cost for across each of them right so that's very top down and you're like okay you know there's education there's medical there's lawyer there's accounting there's yeah whatever like all these like knowledge worker type things like design coding Etc so that's like a top down approach and you can say okay you know here's the most interesting and you could do like a matrix kind of thing it's like okay here's all the interesting ones here's the Tam here's all the companies that are in those spaces here's all the bits that are not done uh you know his uh yeah maybe you want to avoid regulated spaces or maybe you want to go all in on regulated spaces maybe you're like hey no one's stretching doctors because everyone scared of doctors like why don't we just make a amazing doctor for like I don't know Africa or something because like you know there's less regulation there and you can prove it out Etc um so so that's one kind of top down approach and then I'd also go bottoms up and I'll go okay you know what what gets me excited right I love serving entrepreneurs so like i' go because I'm an entrepreneur all my friends are entrepreneurs I I love the idea of like people making things so maybe I'd say okay you know what are things entrepreneurs struggle with and you know one thing that I still don't have a great solution for is like you know as a CEO there's so much knowledge across the company I'd love something that yeah there's a few companies doing this but uh I would love to have like an AI twin of Imad that like is like continuously absorbing all the knowledge across like the company and maybe across the internet and telling me stuff it's like I think Gad should really pay attention to this and like or like even like I thought would be kind of fun to make it so like on on the slack like there could be imma twin and someone could ask it questions say like oh what what would Emma think of this idea uh yeah actually like a funny thing that just came up the other day and I was like I'm pretty sure my AI T could answer this was like someone was like oh you know our Board Room is like kind of small and we just added two people to the board like hey should we do the board meeting at a law at our law firm and I was like no [ __ ] no I'm never going to do a board meeting at a law firm like that sounds awful I'd rather stuff like 16 people in a tiny room uh than do that so I feel like in my AI twin could have answered that question uh so that would be like my Bottoms Up approach and I yeah I do think like you should really work on things that get you really excited uh like you know an AISD like I'm happy for those guys I personally would not get excited about that like I hate receiving sales emails and calls uh so I think I think doing things that you would like wake up in the morning and say like I I'm excited to solve this problem because like these things take such a long time right like I've been doing Mercury now for like eight years uh and if I you know if I was doing something boring I would like probably wake up in the morning or like why do I have to do this again so so I think that's like the bottoms up approach where you try to think of like what do I care about what do I want to see in the future and try to come up with that and then you know you kind of merge those two kind of Concepts together and and you know often you do something and you find out actually it's a bad idea as well so yeah Mercury actually had like a very smooth ramp where it was like I was like okay I like this idea and then I executed on the idea and we never had to Pivot but you know often you do like as you learn something you're like oh actually this doesn't make sense but this makes sense so you know that's part of like ideation is to like actually go build things do you um so let's let's take an idea we'll role play it real quick so pick pick one of the ideas like plausibly you'd be like oh yeah that's kind of checks the boxes it kind of top down makes sense Bottoms Up it resonates with me like what would be an example of that is it the digital twin thing or is it uh let's do the yeah let's do the digital twin I think that's like kind of the most funol so you have a you your digital twin CEO who's basically reading all the slacks the documents and in Google Drive the he knows everything about the contracts that are all there he looked at the he has access to the CRM so he can see anything in the the dashboards Etc um all right so now first few weeks what are you doing is is it like I trust these five people I'm going to bounce the idea off them do you make a deck CU that clarifies your thinking do you just go build a prototype do you go look at competition that's a great question where do you go next you know with Mercury I I had this moment where so we you know we' raised the money we were doing the thing and I was like okay you know let me go talk to a bunch of like potential um companies that could use this like you know create like a big Pipeline and also just learn what it's about and I talk to basically 100 and I remember remember like getting kind of depressed after I talked to them because I talked to 100 and most of them were like oh yeah that sounds kind of cool but like there was it's very lukewarm and it was only two of The 100 companies that were like oh yeah like I would [ __ ] use this like give it to me right now kind of thing uh and at that point like you know it was like it took us a year and a half to build this so this was like one year in so you know you're like you're kind of running out of momentum anyway because it's taking so long to build something and then you go talk to 100 people and everyone's kind of lukewarm I was like what am I doing um but you know I've was like I would really want this so I just like powered through it and and it turned out you know a if 2% of people want something and the Market's big enough that's like probably big enough for like an early adopter base uh right but if you think about it like you know talking to 100 people and having only two people get excited about something is like actually like kind of like uh tricky and you know maybe I wouldn't have talked to those two people because like you if I talked to 50 people I might have missed out on it completely uh so I think it's actually like surprisingly hard to vet an idea against humans uh like people just just don't know and it's hard to imagine an idea as well uh so I what I think I would do is you know I would do that talk and I would go talk to some VCS well like I talk to a bunch of users I talk to some VCS just get an idea of like what is the reception like uh but then I would like try to spend a lot of time and you know first thing for me like one of the things that gets me excited about Mercury is that uh you know after like last year we launched a bunch of new things like we launched uh invoicing and bill pay reimbursements and personal banking and some ideas are like hit a dead end over time right like you kind of do the idea and then you end up like 5 years later you're just like making like small features and just selling it more Etc and then some ideas like turn out to like Fork like a thousand ways and Mercury is one of those things because a there's just so few people in banking that like a lot of these spes are unexplored and B banking is like this kind of platform where it has all your money it has all your Finance team so you can build a lot of things on top of it so I'd want to think about like okay you know if I did the digital twin idea like what are the forks like why why does this become even more interesting the more users that you get on it and and maybe the interesting thing is like okay it's not just a CEO twin everyone at the company has a twin and maybe maybe some of the people don't even exist at the company maybe these are like the uh you know maybe you have like a coms person at the company that's just literally just AI uh uh I'm just like riffing off this uh maybe the maybe your AI twins shows up at the zoom calls uh you maybe it's like becomes your coach and it's like helping you through difficult times right like I think there is that is an idea that could probably Fork a lot of ways because like it has all the knowledge it learns a lot about you it's in your in your communication channels like it's got these cool ideas that like uh yeah it sounds like a pretty good idea now that riing on it but get excited yeah well you also with Mercury you uh it seems like this may be too simple but like it seems like you you had been a Founder for 10 plus years and you were like I don't personally like have a banking product I love but every startup needs a banking product so I want to build for startups there's nothing that anybody loves maybe they don't hate their thing or they don't spend too much time thinking about it but they don't have one that they love and you basically built the one you would want and then you're the BET was that there's going to be a lot of other Founders that think like me that like what I like um is that fair or is that oversimplifying it no no that's 100% fair I think generally speaking I'm a little unusual I get like if I have to call someone to do something I get so annoyed about it like press the button yeah I will delay for weeks for sure but like if I have to do it and like that's the way banks are after you know except for mercury like you have to call to like get a wire done like you know I don't want to like I guess they're kind of gone so I can probably [ __ ] about them a little bit but like First Republic like if you wanted to send a wire like you firstly you tried to do it and you'd hit a limit so you call them raise a limit and then you do it and yeah then it would go to the next phase and then they would call you and you'd have to authorize it then someone else would have to call them it's like it was like multi-week process just to figure out how to send Wes uh so I was like this is what so so you guys started sponsoring me and I was like all right cool I have an idea for the ad read because I got six Mercury accounts myself so I was like uh trust me I already know you don't need to give me the talking points I know why I use it and I was I was like I know you have all these fancy features but like for me as a Founder uh I move at a certain pace and as a Founder is one of the only advantages you have right you don't have you don't have the biggest team you don't have the most money you don't have a lot of things you don't have the most experience you don't have a brand in the in the in the market everybody knows but like your pace is the one thing that you have that all the big companies don't have the problem is if you just start hitting walls because you can't move fast that becomes very problematic so like I like to have an idea I like to buy a domain on GoDaddy in two seconds right I like to file my if I a trademark I like to just be able to file it online I want to talk to a lawyer and schedule a call if I want to start a bank and those little things they sound like one-offs but they add up and they create momentum and momentum begs momentum and so I just will always default to use any tool that can that can operate at founder speed so with Mercury it was like oh cool I can just type don't have to talk to any human being don't have to call anybody don't have to drive and park somewhere and I can get my bank account open I can get money in and I can wire money because I used to wire for my Ecom business uh at a Wells Fargo and I would have to every single month just to pay our suppliers I'd have to drive to a Wells Fargo Bank make an appointment which I always forget to do go inside they gave me this freaking fre hour to do it they gave me this thing like it's the nuclear codes and I had to have that and then it's like and then I had to sit there in an hour and then she would ask me questions and I'd have to make sure that the number's right and I'm like dude I wish I could just copy paste push a button and be done with this and then I had to get my limits raised then they had to call another lady to raise the limits because they would only let me do 50k or 100K at a time it was super annoying and so it's amazing that literally just feeling like okay these people get me and they'll build a product that moves at my speed how important that was and I also then took that to hiring I was like oh my my best hiring heris is basically did this person speed up the pace keep Pace or slow down pace and anybody who slows down pace for me even if they have other strength I found that it it rarely works out to work with somebody who operates at a slower speed like if we have a discussion or an idea and you're like cool I'll get to you next week it's like wait wait wait we said this was important let's just get it there's still eight hours left in the day what are you talking about like how long could that possibly take you um and and if you're it's not that they won't do it it's just if their default expect if their default clock speed is slow it's just not going to work I want my software fast and my my employees fast yeah so actually you know like once you describe that process like it sounds awful so I think like there's like people just get used to being abused by the current products right like I think it's in some ways like because I came from the UK I didn't I didn't I had a slightly better expectation of banking uh like the you know in the UK you can move money instantly and like the software was better for various reasons so so I think there's like some element of the fact that like I had this Outsider perspective uh as an immigrant uh and I do think that's like part of it that like people in America were like okay with once a month having to like drive to WS Faro to do something basic and like having this like beg them to let me do something with my own money convince them and sometimes they say no dude it that the term abuse is so good it's like that's going to be a new filter for me on ideas is can I describe the current abuse that the product is doing like I was in this um conversation the other day and it was like super it was I went to that dialogue conference I don't know if you ever been but like oh yeah the room was this is the dialogue Cup oh perfect perfect so I went there last like two days ago whatever and in the room was like the CEO of Renaissance techn right like the Renaissance like the best investors in the world the CE of Bridgewater like it was basically like the Who's Who and in the in the money conversation it's like a group of 10 people in the money conversation the topic of crypto came up and somebody who was a a a dean of a very famous university was basically like arguing um that you know crypto I don't know I'm I'm not convinced and I I just sort of it was the the abuse thing so I was like so you you think he's like you want to park your money and something like the dollar right cool got it I understand a bunch of reasons why but the the abuse that was normalized was so the dollar which has a a whole arm the FED whose job is to have a 2 to 3% Target inflation oh oops sometimes we we go way above that but we'll try to get back to 2 to 3% and I was like so your your default expectation is that in 30 years your purchasing power is cut in half that's like the accepted Financial abuse of saving all your money in US dollars is that every 30 years your purchasing power gets cut in half it's a lot worse than that because of like asset appreciation right like people don't think about it but like you know like houses and a lot of other things are like way above inflation uh inflation even measured where it doesn't include your house or your rent like you know like the kind of screwed up version of inflation even that even that like gain the the the adjusted the adjusted eida of inflation right where it's like this this specific basket even that's supposed to be 3% so it's like that's a system where that abuse of like what if of Savers getting penalized right anybody who saves gets penalized in the the dollar system but it's um it's a blind spot people really don't uh they've accepted that abuse they're so used to that abuse that uh it's just taken as as as fine you know it's not even problem it's not even like a known problem for them yeah yeah yeah I mean I think the part of the reason it's not a problem for like richer people is because they get the asset appreciation right so like you know people aren't sitting on cash it's unfortunately a lot of the abuse actually happens to like poorer businesses and like poorer people where they have to sit in cash because you know they don't have the living paycheck to paycheck and like most of their money is not in assets uh so I think that part is like particularly sad uh and I don't necessar you think crypto is the only answer there right like you could buy gold you could buy stocks like Bitcoin has obviously done particularly well in the last 10 years but but yeah it's it's definitely like something where like there's something a bit weird about the system for sure yeah exactly you can debate the solutions but the problem seems like not debatable but it's not but it's just accepted it's an accepted abuse tell me uh you guys had this crazy situation where Silicon Valley Bank goes through this crisis tell me where you were when that happened and then what the next I don't know 24 48 Hours what did that look like and what happened to Mercury during that time because it seems like you were the big you were a big beneficiary of of that situation in terms of customers coming to you guys or adoption yeah I mean just set the scene right like svb has been around one year longer than I was alive so it was like started in 1983 so I always remember that uh and when you know when I was working on Mercury right like svb is part of the seed deck right it's like hey this is the 800lb gorilla like this is what everyone in the silic valley uses uh at that point they were like Worth 16 billion and I think in Peak Co they were worth 40 billion uh so this is a big company so you know when this started happening yeah know I wasn't we we had obviously been competing against each other but yeah it was like kind of a weirdly indirect competition in the sense that like SBB just offers something very different right like this is like the stolid uh Silicon Valley Bank that's been around forever and then Mercury is kind know this upstar fintech right like so and like I you know we used svb in my previous company I like those guys like they were like uh they were friendly they like cared about startups I mean the software wasn't great but none none of the banks had great software so uh like to be clear I didn't feel anything bad about them and I and and I felt really bad about for the people there and you know I thought I thought they'd be fine right like when Thursday rolled along I was like Hey everyone's freaking out like people like panicking about things on the internet did you find out about it at the same time as all the rest of us or did you have some inkling or some some foresight that that might happen in the December like so the most of the the bank run happened uh to svb in March 2023 uh in December 2022 there was like this article about like the fact that the msbs the mortgage back security MBS the mortgage back Securities were like massively underwater there even been some VCS that had freaked out and like uh pulled their portfolio companies out so I had seen some of those rumors in that December 2022 but again like people always calling some crisis and yeah like if you want to like right now there's someone freaking out about something so like my default is to ignore that stuff uh but yeah I mean on Wednesday uh it kind of kicked off and like you know we started seeing like just people were freaking out and they were like hey how quickly can I get a Mercury bank account right and know uh and it went from like you know normally like banking like people don't want to switch banking services right like this is a uh a lot of the customers that mercury wins are like a day Zero like you just start a new business have a bank account you need something and we we're there for you it's much harder for us to switch people so you know we obviously like hitting up every startup in s Valley with like our sales team and other marketing stuff did you have like a uh like kind of emergency meeting like hey here's the game plan or how did you how did you organize that to like Sprint our initial thing was like Hey you know I was like we do not say a word of this publicly like we don't want to like jump on their Misfortune but anyone that comes to Mercury let's like support them and we did bunch of things so we we changed the product so uh you know we're like hey if you're non svb uh customer we can always on board you next week right right but if you're coming from svb let's make it in let's do it in a half an hour so so we you know we had this plad connection thing and we put that right at the top and we said above it svb customer connect your svb and we'll like prioritize you uh and like svb customers were really easy to prioritize because they're like you know they tended to have more money they're already vetted by uh a bank uh they're not new customers so you know it we we basically like tried to think of all the ways we could speed up the process for them and we really focusing that proc was it like 2x 5x 10x normal like what what did you see so right now mercury has like 200,000 customers um and we had like maybe 100,000 back them and but yeah svb had a lot of money but not at like an insane number of customers so I want to say they had like 30,000 or 40,000 kind of total customers so uh the volume was big in terms of dollars but not necessar in terms of like numbers it was significant um I think what we published is like around 8,000 customers moved over to us like in a two we time period uh yeah which is like big but not like crazy compared to like the normal kind of monthly growth we get right uh so the other thing we did is um you know uh everyone was saying to us like hey svb failed like why won't Mercury fail and uh you know I would say to people like verbally it's like hey you know we we're not a bank ourselves we work with partner Banks s uh and your money is like has extra FDIC insurance so at that time we had uh 1 million in FDIC insurance and and then I would say okay you know after if you have more than a million put the rest of in US Government T Bill mutual funds uh which we have as part of the part of the platform so I would say this over and over again to people but obviously like you know if if em says like hey your money's safe like that's not very fulfilling right like the S spb CEO was also saying your money safe so what we did over fre yeah exactly so I was like that's the one thing I don't want to say online so what we did over that weekend is we built this product it was called Mercury Vault and it would basically visualize where your money is we'd say okay you know this much of it is in FDIC insured account up to this much so if you had uh yeah and we also actually worked with our partner Banks to extend the FDIC insurance so we went from 1 million to 5 million over that week so it's you if you had 6 million in your Mercury checking account we'd say Okay 1 million of that is no FDIC insured 5 million is and then you know we'd help you set up up your Treasury System so youd put in US Government T bill so so we built this product and that really worked uh like it's so powerful to so you used product to build trust instead of words exactly yes uh and it's also spoke to the moment it's like okay you know instead of us like hiding away from it we weren't saying like you know let's not talk about whether your money is safe or not we were like okay let's show you right like you know you don't have to like trust like 's word or like some marketing you like we were like here's a product that shows you and it wasn't you know it wasn't like something completely new like we this basically like my general view on things is like if you're saying something over and over if customer support is doing something over and over like how do you make that in the product so like people don't have to ask you and it's just so much more powerful like it feels tangible to people uh it also just felt to people like okay you know instead of us going to another bank that could also get a run we're going to something where like you get this extra FDIC insurance and mercury is's a fintech it's not yeah at that point like you know we like we are not holding your money the money never touches Mercury's bank account and it never does like it goes to our partner Banks and that they have an FDIC sweep Network so that was really important to people that like we were speaking with product and like it's also you know I think entrepreneurs appreciate that right like they want there W like the fact that like we spend the weekend building a product for them that like actually answered their biggest question uh like made people go like oh [ __ ] like Mercury gets it right like I think that was like a really powerful moment for us yeah that's dope you have actually felt good as a entrepreneur because like I think sometimes you know when there's a crisis moment you can feel a little B like like it's like oh man what am I supposed to do here like obviously you can talk to customers and things like that but Building Product is like what we are about so as an entrepreneur I was like okay you know let's spend the weekend everyone like let's go do this like you know it gave you like something really tangible to do uh so actually the whole team like thinks like even I guess two years later like we yeah the whole team is like hey worked that whole weekend we buil this product together and like everyone's like still like excited about that moment because like it it like it did the thing that we were good at doing to solve that problem yeah yeah you got the adrenaline rush but you stayed in character you didn't go out of character and try to do something that you don't normally do um you have these philosophies that you sent over uh one of them maybe is related to what we just talked about it's go all in on asymmetric upside bets yeah can you unpack that I feel like a lot people um kind of try entrepreneurship or do things but they don't go all in on them and you know when I I did my first startup for S months in the UK and I was like you know I it was really a moment for me where like I was like okay this is what life is about for me uh like I was very you know I did College I did computer science but I was never like that excited about it I just did it because I was good at it uh and it was kind of fun uh and then I worked at a job and I hated it uh worked at Bloomberg for a year and I was like wow like you know I was worried that that's what life is right like having this like grind and like and then and then you know one of my friends was like hey let's do this like startup thing and I was like okay you know let's try it out uh and and that was like the first time I did something where I was like oh [ __ ] like this is so much fun and that startup did nothing right like it went nowhere had no users but just the idea of like working 9:00 a.m. to like midnight building something myself launching it like I just I don't know there's just something about it that like so speaks to like my core so I was like okay if I want to do this you know what is where can I do this the greatest and at the time was San Francisco I would still say San Francisco but uh at that time it was like 100% like I had to be here to do it so I was just like you know had basically no money I packed up my stuff I I did get into y com with my second startup and moved to San Francisco and I just spent you know even in that 7 months when I was in London I was all in like I was I would like code and build this thing all day and then I would go to every single event that was possible to go to and like honestly half of them or maybe all of them were waste of time but just you know you just if you work really really hard and you do all the things you'll eventually like build up a network right that's how actually like the way I came to San Francisco is I met someone through this like just extreme networking I did and they had already got into YC comat and they needed a technical co-founder and I was like okay you know I want to go to San Francisco so I'll join you guys uh so I think like I just feel like some a lot of people that do things things just kind of tough do them they're like oh you know it's my side gig and I'm doing this thing and I'm like yeah know whatever I'd had no money when I quit my job to like do my first startup but like that kind of like forceful like uh grind like where you're just like all in on things uh that just pays dividends in a way that like half doing things just I don't think really does uh and I feel like you know over time like going all and on things like you another part of my things is like going all and on family like basically like I you know I married like I met my wife 3 weeks before I moved to the US and I had a longdistance relationship and then I married her and then we had a kid like two years later uh which like I was still in like the startup grind but I was just like okay you know I'm all in on like having this family I don't know so I just feel like going all into things has just like this like big upside that like half doing things just doesn't uh and I think the asymmetric side of it is like you know the worst thing that could happen to me is if my startup didn't work I'd have to go and get another job so like I basically like I was always like okay you know at that point I was getting paid like £40,000 a year or something so I was like okay you know I'm losing 40,000 a year in salary maybe 50,000 if I get a raise or something but the asymmetric bed is like you know I could make a million or whatever but you know it's also asymmetric life better it's like I could I could either like my downside was like you know I'm going to have a shitty time and not enjoy my life and my upside was like I'll have a great life there I'm extremely motivated and excited about so uh that to me is like extremely asymmetric like doing things where you're like extremely excited and like having fun uh like that's a rare gift right like I think a lot of people don't do things that they enjoy every day and they like you know I have some friends that I like that and like it's just kind of depressing talking to them uh like having like the ability to do things that you really enjoy in life is such a such an important thing that like I think uh if you find something that is like that you should go all in on that I love what you just said cuz I go I wrote going all in right as a reminder uh I have these no cards which are usually just reminders like the the best information is not brand new information it's just true information that I needed to hear again needed to bring the front of mine or I needed to remember in my current context and I think that um the way you described it actually made it click for me in a in a new way which is going Allin is a skill and I did the same thing as you I had a startup straight out of school and I I had this idea and I was having all this fun with my friends and I was either going to go to med school as I had planned took the mcats all that or I was going to do this startup I decided I'm going to do the startup thing right then I start with that and then I got this gravitational pull I got this job offer somebody's going to pay me $120,000 uh I had to move to Indonesia where the opportunity was um but it was like this guaranteed salary blah blah blah and I remember my co-founders my two buddies I was like yeah and we told ourselves this stupid story which you know we always telling ourselves stories and I was like I'm going to go dude the lessons I'm going to learn there are going to be so useful for us like I didn't have the courage to just say I'm going there cuz I really want this this guaranteed kind of safe salary thing um and instead we told ourselves this story that I needed to learn business over there before I could go do business here and within two months when I was there I was like this was a mistake I need to be all in and I I quit my job I told the the owner I was like hey I'm out of here he's like what like it's only been two months and I just told him I was like I need to I need to see this through like I'll always wonder right like I kind of know what this is same thing like I'm not like lit up every day I had more fun over there yeah there's no guarantees over there but like I think the guarantee of feeling lit up every day is going to be like good for me in the long run so I flew back and I was like all right I'm all in and we moved that was the first thing cuz I was like is this the best place to build this company and if not why are we building it here just cuz we're already here like that seemed like a terrible reason to just do it so we immediately moved to like the Hub of where that type of company was built it was a restaurant chain and the all the top restaurant chains have been launched or most of them have been launched in in Colorado like Chipotle and smash bger and Quiznos this there's like Noodles and Company there's like eight of the big fast casual chains have started in that area it's all it's it's the Silicon Valley of like you know shitty fast food and so um so we go all in there and it was the same thing which nothing really came of that startup you know like I lost money I lost arguably a year of time working on something that didn't work but I absolutely didn't lose because not only did I set myself on a different trajectory but I more importantly learned the muscle of going all in which once you fast forward 5 years and you look back at your same smart friend friends from school who have just been in you know a bit of a corporate life that whole time you see that that muscle has atrophied they don't have that muscle and that muscle is really important because whatever you're going to do the winning idea you're going to need to be able to go all in in order to make that idea work yeah 100% all right the last last philosophy I want to hear from you cuz I I dig these is is uh there are no rules just construct your work and your life the way you want what do you what do you mean by that why what makes you say that you know I feel like when you're in Silicon Valley uh everyone's got these like you know there's so many people who trying to like be influencers like VCS like you know everyone's got these ideas they're like hey you know like I remember when you know in 2011 when I had my first kid like it was very unfashionable to have a kid and have an have a startup like people were like literally like what are you doing like you're going to fail your startup or whatever uh but actually one of the things that's like a completely contradiction is like the only way you succeed is by doing things that are unusual right because if you're doing the normal things you how can you succeed because like everyone's doing those things so so weirdly like you know if you look at every single success it's a contradiction because it had to be a really common thing in C Valley is don't do consumer startups but actually the biggest startups like Amazon Facebook Google they consumer startups right like so why we why are we telling everyone not to do consumer startups and like those are the three trillion dollar companies uh so I find like the you in general like most knowledge is like you have to understand where it comes from and why it comes from and like why you're the exception but like the only way you succeed is being an exception so like you kind of have to like just ignore the rules and like just do the thing and be the exception because that's the only way you succeed but I do think there's like knowledge out there and like there's a reason people talk about these things and you should understand why it is that you are different and like you know what are the problems with consumer startups and there's lots of them but I've just generally found in life that like actually the best things I've ever done have been like ignoring the rules and just doing things that like yeah I just think like most of the time if you do the not the opposite but like if you if you pick the set of rules that you're ignoring because you have like a strong reason to ignore them you're going to be much more likely to be successful that's a that's a great point you know there's that I forgot what the phrase is but it's like experts know all the rules and Masters know when to break them um so so you know that's the the sort of the best signal of Mastery is when you know the rules and you intentionally choose which ones you're going to break so like if you I'm learning the piano right now and my teacher will be like oh yeah this is Bach or this is what be and he'll be like he'll specifically call out he did this thing that you know normally you wouldn't do right this doesn't make sense these are two different keys or that doesn't it's not part of the scale but it works because of this and it's like they make up the reason why it works yeah they make up the reason but it's post post right exactly um it's you know now it becomes a new rule later it's like oh yeah but if it resolves tension then it works it's like okay cool um but at the time this sort of breaks breaks that rule and that's what all the all the best ones do what I like about what you just said is it made me think it's worth writing down I'm going to try this after this podcast it's worth writing down like not just how I want to win how I want to live my life but specifically like what rules what kind of common best best practices or generally accepted good practices that I am intentionally choosing to break you know I'll give you an example um the other day I was having a conversation with a guy who's really smart and wise and he said he said this great line and everybody nodded and took notes he was like um you know when you get money people come to you they want to get do business with you they want you to invest in their thing they want a loan they want whatever and he goes I have this rule um you know either our friendship is sacred or the money is sacred but you can't have both and I said so does that mean you just never do business with friends he goes never and everyone's like yeah that makes sense it could be really messy yeah and I go I don't know I think that everything you said is true and yet I choose that mess because I think there's a great upside in like finding the people you love and doing life with them like life is a lot more fun when I do projects with friends or invest in people's companies and I I you know give people I bet on people and and yeah sometimes it doesn't work out and sometimes it gets a little hairy but like I choose this mess it's like I choose that rule to break and I'm I'm comfortable living with that you know and I I can always go back and change my Approach but for now that's a rule I want to break but that's a good example way you you want to understand how to break the rule as well right like it's not just like I'm going to break the rules therefore if I don't care about it you want to go like okay you know if I'm putting money in a startup I'm going to make sure there's a contract and everyone understands like here's how we work together and like yeah I do think when you break the rule you have to kind of go out of the way to mitigate uh the potential downsides of like breaking that role like and the the breaking the rule is doing the harder thing normally uh so you have to understand why and how and how do you the rule you broke was as a startup founder in SF with all the options to choose you chose the like highly regulated highly compliance based hard have to build for a year and a half before you launch you know that's not that's not the the quick and dirty prototype Vibe code like you can't do that Playbook there so you're like all I'm going to choose to break that Norm and go this way because that's what I want yeah yeah but but I spent a lot of time understanding what I was like in for right I spent like three months just talking to people and like researching you know compliance and rules andw and like all this stuff and like I wasn't I wasn't doing it blindly yeah all right soad where should people find you and who should reach out to you who do you who do you want to reach out to you uh from things like this because when you're out there you know you attract certain people but I like to say you you want to have your API you want to tell people who should connect with you and and and and on what basis so so give give me a sense of that where where should people find you and what should they reach you the easiest way is on X or Twitter uh as it used to be um I'm just imod uh yeah who should reach out you know I'm always willing to try to be helpful to entrepreneurs so you know if you have an idea you want to uh pitch me something or whatever you know reach out and Yeah know I I try to be like quick and say yes or no if I'm interested or not uh and obviously if you're interested in Mercury uh you know go to mercury.com and sign up all right love it thanks for coming on dude yeah thanks for having me [Music] show for

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
I got to tell you about a YouTube story. Okay, so this is a story of how a guy found an underrated opportunity in the YouTube market and turned it into $3 [Music] billion. So there's this guy Renee and Renee um discovers an opportunity. Sam, do you know what the most viewed YouTube channel is? Most views on YouTube, do you know? Uh, the obvious answer would be Mr. Beast. The second Mr. Beast. Number 13. Wait, why are we talking about number 13? I'm talking about number one, Sam. Okay. Do I do the bro move where I under guess so you win? No, I I'm going to say some type of Indian thing. Probably like an Indian. Number one is T-Series. It's Indian music. So, it's just like a like all the famous Bollywood songs. But, do you know what number two is? I don't no idea. Coco Melon. Coco Melon. Yeah. God. Does your kid watch Coco or too young? Maybe. I refuse to let her watch Cocoellon because it's crack. It's baby crack. Um, so by the way, number two, number five, number six, number seven, uh, those are all just like Cocelon. They're basically kids entertainment channels. Uh, by the way, a couple of them are like Russian and Ukrainian in the top 10 of all views. So Cocamelon was this channel that was actually started back in 2006 or 2007. uh this dad who was like an animator slash like filmmaker um and his wife who I think was like a cartoonist for children's books they noticed there's like oh there's like nothing good on YouTube for kids and so they start creating very simple animations for um for kids on YouTube just like literally their if you go look go to their channel and you click pop uh click oldest and the very old the oldest one I think it's like 18 years ago is a video that's like the ABC song. It's a 40-second video. Crazy. And if you go look at all the old ones, it doesn't look like Cocamelon today. There's no character. There's no like kid JJ. There's no like um crazy cracked out animations. There's nothing. There's just like literally they're just doing nursery rhymes. So, it's like ABC, Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star, Ba Black Sheep, all the hits. And so, those start getting a lot of views. And for like 10 plus years, it's just them doing animations. No sponsors, no um no merchandise, no gimmicks, no nothing. They're just living off of YouTube ad revenue. They got a small team. They they got 20 people 10 plus years. Wow. So um that's a grind. They did that. There's another story. Uh Blippy, I don't know if you're familiar with Blippy. Blippy is sort of like the guy who sings, but it's like many guys now. Yeah. They've switched out the character, but basically it's a dude who wears a blue suit with orange overalls and a bow tie and he's like like it's me, right? And he's like basically he just goes to like abandoned like not abandoned, I shouldn't say that. Like kids like play places when they're closed and he goes and he plays in them and he like films himself playing in the in the play place and he teaches you things and whatever. Slightly educational, slightly fun channel. Wait, were you going to say Blippy is recording abandoned pl like abandoned warehouses? Like is abandoned play place like there's no one there but they're not abandoned. I think you'd be like to today's special word is tetanus like if you like you say rabbit rabbit. So Blippy this guy basically sees that his I think his niece or nephew or something like that is watching these like really lowquality uh videos of tractors like you know like kids love trucks and tractors. He's like oh man like my kids loves this my nephew loves this tractor video. And so he goes and he makes one. If you same thing, go to the Blippy channel, you click oldest, you'll see it's a video of a tractor going through a field. And his next one is like another tractor video and he's on green screen with it. He's not even near a tractor. He just green screens himself on top of it. And so he starts creating this. He starts getting a lot of views. And so what happens is there's this guy Renee and what Renee does is he decides to create a PE rollup but around these kids YouTube channels. And the opportunity is that Renee worked at a company called Maker Studios. Do you remember Maker? Yeah, it kind of ended up being like they were the hottest thing going and they raised money at billions of dollars of valuation and it didn't exactly live up to that, but it kind of created like a it was like so innovative that a lot of the employees were went and did amazing stuff. Is that right? Uh kind of. Yeah. So, basically they were early on to the YouTube professionalization and what they were trying to do was they created what's called an MCN, a multi- channelannel network. And you know what does that mean? It's sort of like an agency um like a CAA for YouTube talent. So for some of them they would own the channels and then the talent would operate them. For others the talent owned their own channel and they would do the brand deals but like instead of you the one YouTuber negotiating your brand deals they would go to you know whoever Coca-Cola and negotiate it for all 30 channels on their network. Right? So it's like creating a like a television channel but on YouTube. And this idea sounded really good. It just wasn't a really good idea. It's been tried and failed many many times. Right. It was one of these startups you have to be very very uh wary of because they um it's reasoning by analogy. So if you ever hear like Elon talk about like reasoning from first principles which is basically you take like solid truths like uh logic and you build one logic block on top of another like a stack of Legos that all click together in a chain of logic. of reasoning by analogy is to say, "Yeah, we're CIA, but for YouTube, and you don't really understand the underlying assumptions about how YouTube works and how Hollywood works, it's totally different. There actually doesn't need to be a CIA for for YouTube." Um, or it wouldn't be that valuable if you were the CIA of YouTube, but it raised money and it was a a very hyped thing at the time. They actually ended up with a good exit to Disney. I think Disney bought them for $700, $900 million, something like a big exit. But, um, it was a like kind of a failed company and it failed inside of Disney. It it like could be an okay business, just not a good business that requires hundreds of millions. Yeah. Not hundreds of millions in funding good business. There are plenty of these like a creator agencies on Tik Tok and Twitch that are like bootstrapped that'll do like a few million dollars a year of profit and good for them. So what happens? So Renee, he's at maker. He didn't start it, but he works there. And when Disney acquires it, he goes to Disney and he becomes like the head of like digital content internationally, some some like, you know, some title there. And what he realizes, he says, um, here's the opportunity. He goes, when I was at Maker, I realized that kids YouTube videos were getting tons of views, but they were overlooked by traditional PE and media companies cuz they, you know, basically they look too janky to be taken seriously. He said, of the top 100 most viewed children's bands online, none of them were owned by big studios. So, he's at Disney. He's like, "Look at the top 100 channels, kids channels on YouTube. None of them are owned by Disney or Pixar or like any of the major studios." And his co-founder, who was at Paramount at the time, goes, "Yeah, also none of those none of those YouTube channels that are getting all these views have streaming deals because the streamers say, "We need the content to be exclusive." And the YouTubers are like, "Exclusive? I mean, YouTube's my bread and butter. Why would I take the content off of YouTube?" So, they were just like, "We're not doing a deal." So they get together and they started stack ranking and they basically made a simple criteria. So they said,"I want something that has high views and has like a a quality IP. So like it has a brand name. It has a character that people might might associate and love. Something you might buy a plush doll of some like you'll buy a toy of this this thing." He goes, "If they have both of those, I'm interested." And straight out of the gate, they raised about $150 million. and they raised all this money saying we're going to do this rollup and they do three deals. So, shout out to uh the the rollup Europe Beehive newsletter cuz he had the details on this. Nobody all the traditional media, they only have the surface level details. Some guy on beehive has like a really detailed breakdown of this because these companies are based in Europe and so they're all listed in company's house. So, he was able to like go see literally like how much did the CEO make? And the headline of the story is they take that $150 million, they start buying up these channels and four years later they exit this to Blackstone for three billion. What? So they technically they they exit to candle. Candle's backed by Blackstone. That's where Kandle got the the money. U but they sell for $3 billion. All right. So a lot of people watch and listen to this show because they want to hear us just tell them exactly what to do when it comes to starting or growing a business. And really, a lot of people who are listening, they have a full-time job and they want to start something on the side, a side hustle. Now, a lot of people message Sean and I and they say, "All right, I want to start something on the side. Is this a good idea? Is that a good idea?" And again, what they're really just saying is, "Just give me the ideas." Well, my friends, you're in luck. So, my old company, The Hustle, they put together a hundred different side hustle ideas, and they have appropriately called it the side hustle idea database. It's a list of hundred pretty good ideas. Frankly, I went through them. They're awesome. And it gives you how to start them, how to grow them, things like that. Gives you a little bit of inspiration. So, check it out. It's called the side hustle idea database. It's in the description below. You'll see the link. Click it. Check it out. Let me know in the comments what you think. So, let me break it down. They go and they buy uh Coco Melon for $103 million. 92 million up front, 11 million contingent. Okay. So, 100 million on Coco Melon, 70 million on Blippy, of which only 26 million was up front. 45 million was contingent and then Little Baby Bum was the third big one that they bought and Little Baby Bum had also nursery rhymes and whatnot and they did that for 65 million. So that's that basically and they at that point they had raised more money of of equity and debt and so they raised about 400 million in total equity and debt to create the 3 billion exit. So like a 10x return roughly on the capital that they used to buy these channels and in four years literally through M&A they were able to create $3 billion of value. Here's what they did. So here's the revenue. So their company's called the the holding company is called Moonbug. So Moonbug basically 2019 is sort of like a $20 million a year business. 2020 it's about a $50 million a year business. Then it goes to 150. Then it goes to $230 million with a hundred million in IBIDA before they got taken out. Holy [ __ ] It was doing a hundred million in IBIDA in only four years. Exactly. And the founders of this thing, so each of them cleared uh Renee makes 300 million for this four years of work. Uh his co-founder makes 300 million, the head of M&A made60 million and the CFO made like 20 or $30 million um in the rollup and the rest went to the investors. when they bought these companies, did they need to be great at operating YouTube or was the they were so good at incentivizing Blippy or whatever that they're like, just keep going. You're doing fine. Uh you get this much of your payout if you hit this and that. So, these businesses are are simple and complex at the same time. What do I mean by that? One, a lot of the views are just going to come on the back catalog. So, uh you know, it's it's still wheels on the bus. It's Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star. that are just racking up views every single month. You don't have to do anything on those videos. I'm not sure if you're saying Wheels on the Bus as analogy of running a company or you're literally referring to the song Wheels on the Bus. Yeah. The song. And so, um, they the back catalog gets a lot of views. What they did, which was smart. So, Coco Melon wasn't originally called Coco Melon. Uh, it was originally called Check Gate, which sounds like a baggage company. Dude, it reminds me of It sounds like the cult. Remember the uh the cult that where they all killed themselves? It was like Heaven's Gate. Checkate. Okay. So, yeah, I don't not familiar with that. Not I need to brush up on my cults. Um, so Checkate and then they rebranded to ABC Kid TV, which if you watch the videos, it'll still start ABC Kid TV and then it starts the song. Uh, then they rebranded to Coco Melon, but that's like in 2017 or something like that. Like it was like a long time. It was like 10 plus years into the company that they rebranded and that's when they introduced JJ and the characters and the colors and then so basically that's where you get the characters. Same thing with Blippy. They had Blippy. They take out the main guy. They they replace him with a like a rotate like a like an actor basically cuz he's ready to move on. And um they also introduce Mika, this like diverse character who could come in and like appeal to a wider set of audience. So they're doing like moves in the content. Yes. But the other moves they did was they got it on the streamers. So they got it onto Netflix. It's now the most watched kids thing on Netflix is Coco Melon. Then they go into the toys business and they're doing, you know, millions and millions in toys and licensing. And so, you know, you they built out the full like suite of business basically around these. They do Blippy the musical. It's a live tour that's going around the nation and that's uh you know, selling out, you know, basically tickets. Me and my family, we all went and this, you know, there's not an empty seat in the house. And so, like these things are like they turn them into, you know, rocking and rolling businesses. They kind of used the Disney playbook, right, which is like create massively loved IP and then monetize it through everything except for they just didn't do theme parks. Have you seen on South Park where uh Mickey Mouse is uh you know comes off as this nice guy, but behind the scenes he's trying to convince the Jonah brothers that they better wear their virginity rings uh or their chassity rings because they're wanting to like have sex and he's like you better put that [ __ ] ring back on. Like first of all, incredible impression. Yeah. How did you feel 3 seconds before you did that? Before you committed, you know, uh there is no when you're taking a risk, you cannot paint a world where it's only upside. You have to accept that there is potentially downside. These are the things I tell myself before I'm ever uh taking a big risk. And I thought about that. Um I'm a risk taker. I'm a riskaker. I do impromptu impressions sometimes that I've never done before. But that's what I imagine Renee to be. He's like, "Listen, Blippy, I need you to put that [ __ ] tie on and I need you to get out there and dance." Like when when Blipp is like asking for a raise. What's the hard part about this business? Is it uh or uh convincing people to sell? No, I don't think that was that hard because they had a huge check and the huge check helps. Um, you know, like I think at the time I think Coco Melon had done like 80 million in revenue or something like that, uh, that year and then they bought them for 100. So they bought them, you know, probably like at a 5x multiple or 6x multiple of profits or something like that. I I don't know exactly the multiple, but I'm guessing they offered them like, hey, here's a bunch of money that you could have and like you've been running for like, you know, years doing this on this treadmill and like what if we could help and what if we could take you to the next level? You don't know those people. Oh, I golf with the guy from Netflix. Oh, I used to be at Paramount. Oh, I I was at Disney. I can help you get to the next level. Break down doors that didn't seem like they were open. The hard part was picking up the gold on the ground. So, this happens a lot in business is like these ideas are just sitting on the ground and it's the hard part is somebody taking a very simple idea very seriously. So, to say, "Yeah, you know that silly like nursery rhyme channel? I'm gonna go raise $150 million from like whoever Goldman Sachs to go and uh and acquire these. And you have to say that with a straight face when there's no track record of that, you know, you have to really pitch a strong case. And I also wonder, and you would actually have good insight into this cuz you worked at Twitch. I wonder what opportunity looks like. So, for example, when you explained uh Renee Rene's inner dialogue of like, hey, look at all the top 100 channels, none of them are owned by uh PE or they all are just kind of like these mom and pop shops. This seems so obvious, but I wonder what that inner dialogue actually was with uncertainty. uh in the same way where I don't know anything about streaming but you used to work at Twitch and then I know that like there was that there was like two new video get kickstream or I forget but like I wonder if a Twitch employee could have looked at been like these there's an opportunity here's a gap because I could see the data therefore we should support this other thing what was the other one called kick there's mixer there was kick there YouTube has their own Facebook has their own actually you know there was a time where we were before Twitch acquired us we were building like a tool in the ecosystem. We were getting to know a bunch of the streamers who are using our tool and we were like look this tool like the hard part is this tool like kind of caps out at like 100 million if we if we win. If we win this the size of this is like 100 million we think and the problem is that the platform is worth like 5 billion. Um how do we do the 5 billion thing? And we're like we'd have to create another platform. It's like okay well there's the technology part of it that's hard but doable. Um, the hard part is getting the streamers and getting the network effect to go. Like, how do you break the network effect of something like Twitch? And what you realize is that a very small number of streamers drive a huge amount of the viewership. Um, so in theory, you could get those streamers together and you could say, "Hey, we're coming over here." And so I actually went and pitched uh my investor. Now, I I should I shouldn't say pitch because it wasn't I wasn't fully committed. I wasn't sure that this is a swing worth taking, but I was like, I think what we would need to do, wouldn't it be neat if we did this? I was like, we need to throw some sort of event where we get a hundred of the we get all of the top hundred streamers in a room together. And basically, we need to make them an offer they can't refuse, we need to make we need to basically overpay the top hundred. And you know the thing is with the top hundred, even if they're making $5 million a year and you're offering them 3x that, 4x that, whatever it is, okay, you'd need $500 million to do this and they need to say yes, which is hard. But if you had $500 million, you could create a platform that's going to be worth $5 billion. Like, it's not that much more complicated. Like, once you have the streamers, you've got the hard part. You could build all the other stuff. You could build the chat. You could build the streaming technology. You could build the the the bits. You could build the subscription feature. You could build all the other stuff you would need to build, but you'd have to get the main fe creators to come over and you'd have to have the sentiment be this is where you need to be, not Twitch. Really, that's the really really hard part. And um so we were like, I don't know, that's kind of a crazy idea. We didn't end up doing it. When we got acquired, EMTT takes me out to drinks uh the night we the deal closes and we go meet this bar in the mission and we're talking and I was like, "Yeah, like you know, it's kind of like you can put your cards on the table now. The deal's done." And I was like, "Yeah, you know, actually, we were talking about something. I said, you know, one of the things that I thought about doing was I realized like, you know, we did the math. We realized these streamers mattered the most. If we paid them this much, I think we could have got them, you know, 70% of them maybe to come over. And like that could have caused like some waves. And he's like, "Yeah, actually, we've thought about that." So, what we had done was we uh we made it so that none of their all their contracts with us um unlike YouTube. So, like on Twitch, they actually have like multi-year agreements with Twitch. And he goes, "We just made it so that they don't expire at the same time." So we always aligned it where for the top streamers, they're all ending at different times so that nobody would ever feel safety in numbers to move to another platform as a giant group because they could never get their contracts to align. That's why EMTT is EMTT. Yeah. Actually, I think in reality that actually wasn't the case. And in in truth, the streamers just could have like moved over and there's nothing Twitch could have done about it. Like the contract wasn't you have to stream here. The contract was you only get this deal if you stream here. Meaning like you get this ratio, this uh maybe the split or this minimum guarantee, whatever, right? But like the reality was if Twitch went and started suing streamers, that would have been horrible for their own business. They would never do it. Uh which is why multiple streamers did take money from Mixer and Kick and others and they left and Twitch didn't do anything about it. So like the reality was a a more high agency version of me. You could have actually t tried it and it would have been probably would have been more worthwhile my time than what we did with the tool because the tool never had the upside. Uh this is a great story. Uh I want to know like the update. I want to know what happened and how did you know how much money he made? Uh I told you my guy on beehive he basically went to their their his Rene's LLC or whatever, you know, the equivalent of an LLC is on company's house and you can see that $280 million hit the bank in a certain year. They had to report that. And so he kind of did all the math and he also had their cap table like their waterfall. So it's actually kind of nerdy and interesting in that that the way they structured the deal was basically with investors they the founders who were doing the rollup were basically entitled to somewhere between 22 to 28% of all proceeds of the rollup. All right. So that was like their profit participation at the end. So whatever we sell this for, we get between 22 to 28%. Investors are going to get the rest. Wait, that's that's insane. That's different than equity. Uh no it's like equity but it's basically like you know you have equity but then you have let's say preferred equity right or you have like liquidation preferences you you can have rules you can have strings attached to equity so for example I did not know that what they did you did cuz in venture this happens all the time right when a company raised money they rated preferred shares preferred shares mean they get their money back first so even if I own 25% I don't necessarily get 25% I might get zero I guess I just assumed if this is a PE firm the rules are different and like it was like for example it was like tied to the carry or something like that So what they did was um it was based on the the multiple of the invested capital the mo right so it's like uh if it was under 3x return so they they raised 400 million if it was going to be an under 3x return they were going to get like only 9% of the proceeds or something like that like a lower percent but they hit 10 10x right so they hit the highest trunch which was basically they got their 10% of sweat equity plus 11% of profit participation so they got like 22% or something did they use any of their own money to start this I think Renee was an investor But I don't know how much. Yeah, this guy's great. That's a good story. I have a life update for you and I I wanted to share because I think it's I think it's fun, but I also think that there's a lot of people who can learn from the situation that I'm in because I think they're in similar situations. So, the life update is my partner Joe and I, we are now the CEOs of my company, Hampton. And the life update is basically I'm going like pretty much all in on it. And I wanted to explain a quote that I read that made me want to do this. So we like or at least I like Palmer Lucky. Do you like Palmer Lucky? Yeah, sure. Why not? Palmer Lucky. We had him on the pod like 3 years ago or two years ago and I have been just fascinated with his way of thinking and he had this interview come out. I linked to it on the bottom of our document. Uh it was with Tablet Magazine and I think he came out with this in 22 maybe. uh and I want to read it to you. So Palmer Lucky is the CEO of Andre. It's a 13 or 20 billion dollar company, something like that. Also created Oculus. So he said, "At some point in business and in life and in rose romance, you have to commit to a path. A lot of my peers in the tech industry do not share this philosophy. They're always pursuing everything with optionality. Oh, I need to be able to raise money from anybody. I need to be able to sell my business in any way. I need to have liquidity in any way. I need to make sure that I'm not closing myself off to future romantic partners. I need to make sure that I've got my options open. I need to make sure that I'm not going to buy a house and lock myself in or having children. I don't know. I'm not ready. I don't want to commit to that path. In keeping their options open, they they ensure that they're going to jump from option to option. And if they don't commit to a path, they're going to fail at it. You have to commit to make it work. And I think marriage is the same way. You just have to commit to it. you have to say this is the path that I'm on for better or worse and I'm going to double down. And I thought that is a great quote that really stuck with me when I read this and I realized that with my business Hampton I had hired a CEO for it and so I wasn't able to like really from day one right I think that's the important thing uh day month eight so I got it to a million in revenue he scaled it to eight figures in revenue and then I am now taking over and so um but because of that I wasn't able to like, you know, put my influence on it. You have to like respect your CEO. You have to respect the manager in charge. And I hated that. I was not a fan of that. And I think that on this podcast, we talk a lot about that. And it sounds cool. And I'm sure it's great for a lot of people, but it wasn't great for me. And the reason I wanted to bring this up on the pod was because a lot of people you see doing this, they called it like a hold company, a holding company or whatever where they're like doing lots of different stuff because we we glamorize it because if it works, I'm sure it's great if that is your main thing. And I was starting to think, oh, that would be great. I would like to do that. I realized I don't want to do that. I just want to do one thing. And this quote like really inspired me that that's like really what I care about. Now, let me ask you a couple questions. You weren't doing a hold company holding company though, right? you were just doing Hampton already. So why the switch where you go from being founder chairman type person to I want to be the CEO or actually co-CEO not even be the CEO. Why that? I realized that I wanted to have full control cuz I wanted this to be a legacy creating company. I wanted to just put my texture on it. But also what I realized I hate remote work. I hate it more than anything. And I wanted to create an office where I live and an office culture because those are some of the greatest memories that I have. You and I used to work across the street from each other at the corner of Bush and Montgomery, right? Was it Bush and Montgomery? Yeah. I loved that intersection. Just walking out and seeing the action and seeing my employees upstairs and be able to just like go for lunch and just like like shooting the [ __ ] during breaks. I loved it. And I just felt that this was a really good way to make all of my selfish wants come to reality. Right. Yeah, that's great. You know, I think that a lot of people are probably feeling this right now because everybody went remote during COVID and now we're what, two, three years into that that full remote decision. And at first, you have the honeymoon period of remote. Ah, look at this. I don't have to commute. I don't have to even get dressed. I don't got to wear pants. I just got to top up. Here we go. Um, you know, oh, this is great. I can see my kids. And then you're like, God, I can't get away from my kids. I haven't left the house in weeks, you know, or whatever, right? Like you you start to see some of the consequences of the negative side of of those decisions. And I think the biggest one for you and me, at least I felt this is I I miss just being creative and serendipitous with my team. So it's like a have a team, right? And b be able to just whiteboard, sticky note, go for a walk, go for lunch. Like I brought uh Diego out here. I said Diego was living on the other side of the country. He's living on the east coast in Baltimore. How long has it been now? Diego's been out here for a couple months, 2 or 3 months, something like that. How has your life changed? For the better, dude. Way better. First of all, I get to kind of still do basically what I do, but now I just have a buddy to do all of it with, right? So, it's like I kept the same schedule where it's like uh in the morning he comes over. The first two hours of my day are like my creative block, right? Where it's just I'm uh I don't do anything else. I just write or I podcast or I, you know, read. I I only do something on the creative side. It's like a creative gym session. It's like going to the gym but for creativity. All right. So, we do that. Well, we do that together now. It's great. And then my trainer comes over. We work out together. He's he's working out with my trainer now. So, it's great. You know, we do we do a hard workout. Then we go grab tacos. And while we're grabbing tacos, you guys are like a prison gang, man. That sounds exactly like a prison gang. You We just need some enemies, dude. Problem is only just like old retired people around us. But if they, you know, go start a beef. Actually, I do have some neighborly beef. I could I could actually just double down on that now that I think about it. Yeah. Get blown into your yard. I'm sorry. I don't control the wind. Um, so but then we would go and what I told him, I go, "Notice this, dude. Of our best ideas, how many of them have come while we were at this taco shop?" Cuz there's something in the creative process to like the bounce, as they used to call it, the pickup artist game that in in in the book The Game, they talk about this technique called the bounce. It's like you're at the club or bar, you meet someone. If you really want to like accelerate your connection with that person, don't just stay there for another hour with them, just be like, "Hey, let's go grab a bite to eat. I know a great place." And if you leave, if you do the same the same hour with that person, but in two different places, connection goes up. Well, there's something like that with creativity where we're working on a problem here, we end up getting, you know, like slightly stuck or we come up with what we think is a solution, but in our gut, we're like, "That doesn't seem great. Uh, let's take a break. Let's go for a walk." So, we walk or bike to a taco place. at the taco place, it's always that's where the idea comes once we've taken our mind off it, once we've changed the the environment. And I was like, dude, notice how many how often that happens. If we were just remote, none of that would have happened cuz I would have gotten off the Zoom with you and then I would have gone to take a break. You would have gone to take a break. I wouldn't be like, "Hey, let's just leave our phones on." Like it would have just been like a little bit weird to do that and we would not have had, you know, that those next ideas. And if you're in a creative line of work, those ideas are gold. those ideas is what you're in it for, right? Right. Like unless you're in a like factory type of work where it's all about productivity. Um, you know, for us, creativity is the pro is productivity. It is the new productivity. And so, we need to set up a situation that lets us be more creative, which being in person was was pretty massive for that. Yeah. It's funny. We're both craving the same stuff. And I think that a lot of people are. Um, and I Yeah. Uh, and so like I went and looked at apartments this weekend and um I uh we have our I think my lease starts May 1. Uh, and so I'm going all in on this uh this in real life stuff. Like I needed to move or you're going to like split. I don't know yet. I'm still working out logistics. I went and looked at this apartment building. Do have you ever been to like I don't know if this is happening in San Francisco. So the new thing in New York is that there's these apartment buildings and it took me a long time to realize what they are, but I I've nailed it. They're cruise ships. And so basically what they are is they're really cheap. I mean, they're super expensive, but the build quality is like kind of crap, like all like basic builder quality uh apartment units, but then the actual lobby has a bowling alley. Oh, like the amenities are amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Like a rock climbing gym and it's they're like all like in the basement. And then it has like the best gym you've ever seen in the world and then it has like a playroom, a golf simulator. It's basically built to be sort of like a mall where like it's built for like uh the 35year-old 32kid all all underage type of like families. And so I went and looked at like an apartment like that and I was like sitting in that apartment building and I'm like I don't know if I can go to bed here at night in these like tight ass walls like with hearing like honking in the city. And so I haven't decided if I can like put up with that and I'd rather commute but potentially I would move to the city. I like here's what I did. I sat down and I was like what's my dream day? Well, my dream day is I get up at 7:00, I go and work out, and then I get coffee with like Austin Reef, who lives next to my in-laws, or I would get coffee at my in-laws, and then I would go to work at 9:30, and then my wife would like show up at the office to do some work, and then we're both home at 5:00 to have dinner. And that's like, and then maybe at like 7:00 or 8 after the kids go to bed, I would go for a walk outside. I'm like, that's the perfect day. All right, how can I create that? And so, I'm still working backwards on how how could how could I create that? The problem is is I forgot about going to bed at night and how I need a huge ceiling cuz I get claustrophobic and that's going to cost $60,000 a month because New York City is like the craziest place in the world when it comes to renting an apartment. And so I'm still trying to figure out, you know, some of those logistical details on how on earth like I could pull off this. It was like super relatable with like walking and doing whatever until you're like, "But I need 16t ceilings to sleep." No, I just like at your house like you're like a lot of apartment ceilings are 8 feet tall and it like I don't know you feel like claustrophobic. Dude, the rent in New York City is outlandish. So, when we were younger, uh do you remember like the idea of when we were 25? I think I spent like $800 a month. A $10,000 a month apartment nowadays in New York City, it's not nice. It's like a [ __ ] two-bedroom. Uh it's crazy how expensive uh Manhattan is. And so, I got to like figure out all the logistics. But that's my spiel. I'm going all in and I'm going to go all in on in real life. I need it. My soul is aching. How much were you working on Hampton anyways? Hours a week. 40 hours a week. Like it was like a What's going to change your CEO now? Well, I can't like com like before it was like, well, how can I convince this person that my idea is the right way or how do I respect the boundaries? Uh, you know, like it I was a very respectful boss. I felt like and it was like but now it's like I don't I'm not really going to be respectful. I'm just going to say like this is what I want to make. Uh I need you guys to help me make this uh type of energy versus before I think I was a little bit more hands off and I was thinking a lot. Now I'm actually operating. Yeah. What just funny like I I feel like uh I was just reflecting like you know you I think Andrew has a good gift to this. I do this too which is like we tell these great stories. You're like, you know, I was reading this article about Palmer Lucky and he said this beautiful quote and you have this quote and you're like, I decided I too need to commit and choose a path. But it's like, and it's a great way to frame a story like this. It's like the truth. I think I'm going to speak for you for a second, but I think the truth in a lot of these situations is you're just like, it's irritating to be out of like to not have your hands on and not be in control. It's like I just like to be in control, do things my way, but like wow, that's a less fun story to say. It's like, you know what? I just really feel like we all chase optionality and it's we you're better off to commit and really just make that truth and it's like I think it's the truth but I don't think that's why you're the CEO now. No, usually usually discovery read this Palmer Lucky quote. No, usually discovery for me and I bet it's for you and for many other people is you feel a certain way and you're like this freaking sucks and someone and then someone puts words on it and you're like oh that's like normal to feel or this person said this. I guess what I'm saying is you weren't choosing multiple options. You just weren't in control. The quote that Palmer look should have said is like if you're the founder, put your [ __ ] DNA in the company and just go like be hands- on, be a micromanager, go in there, do it. I was going easy. I was in like the dad phase. So like it was like uh like I wanted to be available at like noon. Now I'm now I'm more so like look, I can be there in the morning and in the evening. And I think that's I'm still being a good dad. Before it was like uh I have to have x amount of hours of facetime. Now I'm out of the honeymoon phase of being a dad and I'm like look I could like be with you for breakfast and be with you for dinner and I think I could still be a good father. And so that was partially it partially it. Gotcha. Yeah. Uh I was talking to somebody and uh recently and they were like you know I just want to like I'm working I'm working hard on this. They're like chasing some project some deal and I was like why are you doing this? they're so like you've done so many deals. You're you're post economic. You you've made so much money. Why you go so hard at this? And they were like, I just really want my kids to see what they're, you know, their dad working. And I was like, I don't I I don't even think he was lying. I think he genuinely believes that. But I'm like, dude, you're doing this deal because you like doing deals. That's all you've done. You You've done deals for 30 years. You're amazing at doing deals. It's a rush to do a great deal. It's fun to win. It's fun to dunk the basketball and you're trying to dunk. And you don't have to be like, I just want my kids to see a hardworking dad. It's like, "Dude, you're sitting on your laptop sending email." It's like, "It's not like they see your their dad, you know, sweating it out in the mind, dude." Yeah. So, I was like, but people tell themselves all kinds of stories and I just find it hilarious cuz of course I do the same thing. But when you see it in other people, it's much more easy to spot like, "Oh, you've told yourself a story. That's cool." Like, that makes it's fine. Whatever Whatever gets you to do the things you want to do is fine. Would you want your children to work with you? Is that even in your wants? I would I would think that would be really fun or cool to do. I worked with my dad for about a year and it was actually a lot of fun. Much more fun. Like my working with my dad was more fun than just like hanging out with my dad and not working. You know what I mean? Like it was actually like a better dynamic. It was a cooler dynamic. I learned more that way and I saw him differently and he acted differently in work mode versus he did in home mode. So it was kind of cool. So I think it would be really fun but it's not something I'm like trying to gear up. You know I I think I've told you this before like my new sort of dad ideal is uh Ben's dad. So Ben's dad, Andy, he he he did a very simple thing that's going to sound like it's going to sound like nothing, but I personally think it was quite profound, which is the way I initially was trying to be a dad and how other people are dads is you have things that you're into. I love basketball. And I keep trying to buy little basketballs and like put them near my son. I buy the hoop and I like take him to a class. I like really try to get him into basketball cuz like, oh man, I really just want him to like love the things that I love. And then we could share that. We could bond over that. Whereas his dad was like he's like what's that type of blood that's like it's the universal donor like O negative or something like that. He's O negative. So he's like he's got one son who's into standup comedy. So he's like great I'm now into standup comedy. Yesterday I knew nothing. Didn't care. Today everything I do is eat, sleep, and breathe standup comedy. Bought books, watch videos, goes to shows by himself. Starts practicing himself. Starts giving his son feedback on every single thing that he's doing in a helpful, supportive way, making connections. whatever whatever he could do. He's like, "I'll meet you where you're at." And um Ben loves the Phoenix Suns. Guess what? Andy now watches every Phoenix Suns game, is a hardcore fan, is always talking to him about the Suns cuz he's like, "I'll meet you where you're at. If that's what you're into, I will get so into it that we can bond over that." And I just thought that was like a really selfless kind of amazing thing he did. And I just hadn't seen a lot of dads do that. I think my instinct and many dads instinct is just to try to get them to like the [ __ ] we like. And then they don't. And then we're like, "All right." like I support you, but like at an arms length. And I just thought it was much cooler to go all in on what your kids are into. So, I hope and I'll expose my kids to like business and like I'll be totally open to them working with me, but I really want to do the Andy thing, which is if they're into whatever musicals, then do me. You know what I mean? That's awesome. That that almost makes me emotional hearing about Ben's dad. What a what a great dude. He really is. Do you want to end there or do you want to keep going? I have I have one quick one. This is actually kind of cool. This guy Josh on Twitter. So Joshua Oundu uh tweeted this out. Cool find. So he tweeted out about this company called Shotsi. Have you ever heard of Shotsi? It's an app. No. Yeah. Didn't we talk about Shotsi? No. So Shottsi is an app for tracking your ompic injections. Oh, that is funny. And it just crossed a million in ARR. And all it does is it basically is a it's a shot tracker. So, you know, it's I guess I I don't know, maybe you can tell me like I guess it's somewhat cumbersome to keep track of maybe I don't know if it's when you did it or how much your dosages a reminder it's time for your next shot. Um, by the way, how about that little jab of uh I don't know, maybe you could tell me like how do people use this? You talked about you took it. I know I'm joking. Uh, with Ompic you have to increase the dosage a lot. So let's say you start with like 5 ml after two weeks you have to go to seven and then you have to go to like 10 and it's not like incremental. So you So when you hear this idea were you like yeah that was a pain point or for you was it like nah I don't really I didn't take it enough to be a pain point but it's very clear it's just sort of like imagine taking vitamins and like you have to add a pill every two to three to four months and it's like it just it is easier to track if you want to follow it by the book. I'm more of a like eyeball and see how I feel type of guy. Look in the mirror. Yeah. Like, do we want to party today or not? That's like, you know, that's kind of they call it vibe coding. I was a vibos epic guy. It was just how do I feel that day? Yeah. So, the the woman who made this, I think her name's Aza. She uh she was an engineer at the Athletic, like a software engineer at the at the media company, The Athletic. And I guess on the side, she just built this like for her own painoint. And then I think it took off in like the Reddit communities. And just off of Reddit and then some Tik Toks about it, it's gotten downloaded like 100,000 times. It's got this paid subscription, crossed a million in ARR. Um, what niches and riches, man. Like this is uh riches and niches. This is like just such a simple just problem solution app, right? That that somebody realized, okay, if if Ompic is the next big thing, right? If these GLP1s are the next big thing, I don't know how many people take them. I think it's like 40 million people or some like really big number of people who now all are on some schedule and realizing that you could build an app just for that population is a uh a smart idea. Have you seen like the Oscars and the Grammys and things like that? Like everyone looks great. Everyone just losing weight quickly. Is is it is uh are they illegal in sports? I don't think so. No. Oh, I mean it's kind of a kind of like a it definitely is. you lose like muscle mass, right? So, I don't think athletes would really care too much about this. You cannot lo you I'm not a scientist, but you obviously you can if you eat enough protein and you lift weights, I think you can maintain it basically just makes you not eat. So, if you can say like, "Yeah, but I'm going to eat uh and I'm going to hit my protein and I'm going to lift weights even though I don't want to eat today." Yeah, you could you could keep protein. It's just you don't want to eat. You're full. Let me see. Let me ask you a random question. Um, I was watching this video today about somebody was speculating uh that LeBron uh LeBron does like whatever. I saw the Lance Armstrong thing about it. So Lance Armstrong was talking about it. Chill son has talked about it. Chill's like, "Yeah, we have the same drug guy. I know I know what he's taking." I'm not going to say, but I know what he's taking. But Chill's also like a professional troll, so you don't know when he's being facicious or also was a drug cheat. Yeah. but also did use uh you know performance anti drugs when he competed and he was basically like he's on EPO and like you know you would if you if you wanted to do what he's doing if you wanted to be doing tomahawk dunks at age 40 in the NBA like you know playing 30 minutes a game and averaging 27 points or whatever like you would do this and uh and I I I actually just was thinking about this in like the world of business um is there peeds at business and like how would you feel about uh people doing Have you ever taken Adderall or Rolin? I've never taken it, but I know I have several friends that do it. Uh to too focused, to be more productive. I don't do any I don't do any drugs, but 10 years ago before I got sober, I for some reason a doctor gave me a rolin prescription. I have no idea why. I I don't remember how what what happened, but I got it. And I took it for about 4 days. And on the fifth day, I had like a mental breakdown. It made me too speedy. I was like I made me anxious. I'm like, I'm going crazy. This is horrible. And I was like, I'm never taking this crap again. But those four days, I was on fire. Uh I was like laser focused and it I felt on top of the world. And so obviously a lot of people take this and I would not feel bad if my competitor took it. Is that what you're asking? I just I don't know like in sports it's definitely seen as I think for most people when they see would hear about an athlete doping or cheating it'd be literally like you're cheating and it's a tainted record, right? But I think I think those drugs should be legal in sports a little bit. Do you think that? Okay. So So you would you think in in business you I guess there's two questions. Do you think a lot of people are taking this type of stuff? I remember Sam Bank had the like the patch. I think it was like huge amount of people taking it. Dude, I think there was a joke on Reddit. There was a guy who was like, "I'm naming my daughter Viveance because I love this drug so much." Uh, yeah. I think there's a Yeah, I think everyone I think if you're under the age of 30, I would assume that you're taking it. Oh, wow. That's cra That's You think it's that popular? Yeah. I think that I am now a very wholesome, straightedge person. And I think you have always been that way. So, I think perhaps we don't I'm just naive, dude. I didn't even like Nobody Nobody offered me any. I didn't I didn't get any. It's not like I'm like morally superior. I just didn't even No, I'm not I'm not saying that it's morally superior to be this way. I just think that you and I have never Well, uh since I've known you, I have never partied and you have never partied or at least been part of like the drug or alcohol scene really. And I do think most people uh it's like getting weed, you know, like oh like I can't sleep and the doctor's like, "Gotcha. I understand." Do you know what I mean? Like waking like Yeah, that's how I think it is. The closest thing I have to that is like calling my dog a service animal so I can like you know take her into some place. Dude, I So when we were younger, our parents would like my parents gave me rolin because like every boy who couldn't sit still in fourth grade, they were like, "Oh, you you you have an illness, son, and we need to keep you from standing up from the chair and like you know you you you have to take this pill." And I remember taking the pill in fourth grade and after like a few months I'm like I didn't have like the vocabulary to explain to my mother but I was like this is making me sad like something was going on and so she was like oh this is crazy. What are we doing? But I remember taking it. It changes you. And I do think that when I took it as an adult it felt like I was on EPO and I was having to do the tour to France. Like it felt I'm like oh I understand how this is like a an a peed. Did you see how Chimath wants to come up, which I don't really respect a lot of what he says, but did you see how he said he wanted to have the uh peed free poker? Oh, yeah. Yeah. He was saying like a no ad roll poker tournament basically. Yeah. Yeah. Uh that's that's sort of intriguing. That's Dude, I must just be sleeping on this. Like I I didn't realize this was as I I have a couple of friends who I know they were they told me like, "Oh yeah, I'm going to stop doing that." I was like, "Oh, you've been doing that? What is that? Why? For what?" like, you know, it didn't even really occur to me. I guess this I, as you guys are saying this, I'm realizing that, oh, I've probably just been foolish about that. Yeah, it wouldn't surprise me. Okay, so like what do you call the listeners of this pod? The Yepy class, like the white collar class or whatever. I would bet that 30% of the people between the ages of 22 and 35 who are in this white collar or Yepy or Henry class are on uh ADHD medications. That's my prediction. 30%. It's a lot, right? If you're on that attie in the comments, let us know. We're going to pull the YouTube comments right now. Natty or Addie? I have friends that would buy in the Silk Road. Can you even buy it online? I guess you don't even need to buy it online anymore. You just go to your doctor. But there probably like like aderal toothpaste at this point. And if not, great idea. Yeah, that's brush in a rush. Let's go. 10 out of 10. 10 out of 10. You nailed that one. Um All right. That's it. That's a pop. [Music]

all right a sentence that has never been said before B2B Enterprise HR software space is the most riveting the most compelling espion story you'll ever hear I feel like this episode's going to have to start with the Netflix like d because this is a netlix original level [Music] drama so all right we got to do this story Parker Conrad who is the CEO of a company called ripling they do like payroll as well as other kind of back office stuff for for startups tweeted came out two days ago and said Rippling sued deal today our lawsuit alleges that deal cultivated a spy at ripling and orchestrated a long-running trade secret theft the Spy searched deal in our system 20 23 times a day on average letting him spy on Deal's own customers who were considering switching to Rippling and then he post screenshots of the law did you read this yes and we should preface this saying I think you have friends at deal I'm an investor in deal so I invested in Deal many years ago it's one of the best investments I really like Alex I don't know him super well like we're not like buddy buddy but like Alex the founder of deal I think is awesome and uh I use deal I think deal is a great product and so that's kind of my my bias and context coming in is I like deal and I invested in deal and when I talk everything here it's allegedly and it's also this is just what the the lawsuit says and also it's just comedy for me like I don't I I don't know about any of this and I am just like everybody else on Twitter this is for entertainment for me so uh please don't take this too seriously what's the Baseline story okay so basically the story is ripling notices he he's saying we noticed somebody was looking up deal a lot in our systems so then this is where it gets good he's like so we created a Honeypot the best the what the the the story behind this is basic like I don't I wouldn't even be smart enough to come up with the idea of this this is amazing so the way it worked was I think I read that it was ripling founder and their legal team and maybe one other executive were in a room one night saying to themselves dude deal is spying on us what is going on how do we catch them and they said you don't how did they know they were spying like is it really that they just noticed in the logs this guy was searching deal a lot that sounds so crazy yeah there's always there you know no matter how thin a pancake there's always two sides that's what my dad always tells me so I don't know we but we only that's a good right yeah we only know this side so this side is that they had a suspicion and then they're sitting there one night and they go I got it let's make a screenshot or let's actually make a fake slack channel that no one at the company knows about and we're going to call it deal defectors meaning all of Deal's ex employees who now work at Rippling they're talking trash about deal and they're spilling the beans turns out that was a channel that no one at the at the Rippling was a part of but they emailed the deal team and they go this exists and you would love to see it and then the next day after sending the letter they noticed someone tried to log in to this deal Defector slack Channel and that seems strange since the only people who know about this are deals three people on their executive team and Rings three person executive team and it wasn't us Rippling therefore it had to be one of the deal Executives who knew about this Espionage and spying situation and had access to the back end of Ring's login is that right I think that's right so that's allegedly what happens so they go to the local authorities cuz I think this is happening in Ireland by the way like he's working at the Ireland off the Dublin office and they go to local authorities they get like whatever the the ability to kind of like subpoena his phone so so I guess what happened is person comes in says hey you've been served you need to hand over your phone right now and he says oh it's upstairs in my bag like all right let's go get it so they go up they look in the bag just a laptop in there no phone and they're like um okay where's the phone he's like I got to go to the bathroom so they goes to the bathroom locks himself in the bathroom real quick and then the story goes um the person heard him doing something quote doing something on his phone and he's shout knocking on the door basically shouting at him like Hey if you if you delete anything on that phone you're in violation of the law The Story Goes that the Spy goes that's a risk I have to take he said that that's a risk I'm willing to take he said that that's what that's what they wrote at this thing so and they hear a flush they hear a flush and then the guy flees the premises they don't get the phone and then ripling orders somebody to go check the plumbing of the building to see if he flushed a phone couldn't find a phone in there uh no phone and so that's that's where the story stands today and then that's why they came out publicly and tried to like you know win this in the in the court of public opinion instead can I give three little bits of T advice to anyone listening um if you're ever going to get in trouble one don't say [ __ ] do not say that's a risk I'm to take don't say anything just say uh yeah I don't want to talk or give me a lawyer the second thing don't write down anything that you'd be afraid for uh to be found and discovered and three do not delete messages when you think you're in trouble that's against the law dude I don't know if I don't know if any of this is true uh there's a whole bunch of back and forth so here's the here's a bit of the other side of the story so uh I think someone from deal came out and here's what a deal spokesperson said weeks after ripling is accused of violating sanctions law in Russia and seing falsehoods about deal ripling is trying to shift the narrative with these sensationalized claims we deny all legal wrongdoing and look forward to asserting our counter claims all right I too look forward to them asserting their counter claims you know what's funny is I lived in San Francisco and I was a so the guy who started Rippling I was a customer his name is Parker Conrad Parker previously started zenitz and back in 13 or 14 or 15 that era I think zenitz was the fastest growing company ever I think it grew to like 100 million in Revenue something insane and Parker from I remember he got fired by the board because zenitz was like a payroll and benefits company which means you need to be pretty uptight and I think that he was accused of being a little Loosey Goosey like it was like people were uh if I remember correctly the Articles were like people at the parties were like having sex in the hallways or something insane like that and like I don't think that was the well maybe that was happening but I don't think that was the issue that got him no that was but but that was like a canary in the it was like dude this guy like he does it like not everyone has their health benefits license something some license like that that you need to S benefit I guess in order to like be a broker a license broker you you had to have it like all every state that you were operating in there's a bunch of compliance things and what he what had happened was either some people didn't have it or uh there was another thing which was he had created a macro like a piece of software that would just take the tests for you yeah so you like speed through this and get your license like way faster to keep up with the growth and like kind of like you didn't actually do it yourself and I think that's when he got in a lot of trouble and he's got again in this case you know like basically he got shamed he got kicked out of the company David saaks took over David saaks who was his coo and big investor I think saaks had put in like 10 or 20 million dollars of his own money into the company and then came in a COO because it was like the next big hot startup and then this came out and then saaks basically threw Conrad under the bus but they used like the these guys are partying they're banging in the hallways they just made it look like the whole thing was a mess whatever and then um and and and so took over and he he got basically the shaft and then Rippling was sort of his revenge company but uh yeah this guy finds himself with some drama I guess Parker likes a party Parker Parker's put the PA at party I mean he like he likes to get down and now I'm hearing about I didn't know about this Russia stuff so Parker live lives life on the edge and you know he's kind of the bad boy the HR sass industry what can what you know what can he say he needs to go Jensen leather jacket is pure snake skin Oh the bad boy of HR sass is here I I like Parker Parker parties man like he just he gets down he he's always finds himself in a sticky situation sign me up uh Parker should come on to to MFM and we should go hang out uh but this guy likes a party you know all right so all right a lot of uninformed speculation here I feel like we're going to get hit with a with a LW in here soon got be careful all right was he going to say that he does a party like is that slander Parker's ring doorbell has shown him to be home 4 8 p.m. every night um yeah does Parker does the man in the polo of jeans not like to get down we we deny these allegations all right let's take a quick break because we got something for you you know we pinned a survey to one of our videos and we asked what's the biggest challenge you have right now in your business and the number one thing that you guys said was getting your first 100 customers that was the most popular response and it's of course that's the challenge cuz if you can't get to 100 customers you're definitely not going to get to a th000 so what the team at HubSpot did was they went through all the old episodes and they heard the stories where I talked about how I got customers for my first business how Sam did it for his first business and some of the guests that came on and talked about what they did how they scrapped and clawed and got those initial 100 customers to get the ball rolling and then they put those together in a report it's a PDF it's totally free and you can get it and it'll give you some inspiration some ideas around how you might be able to go get your first 100 customers check it out it's in the description below all right so okay whatever so there's the deal Rippling thing there's a bunch of funny tweets about this um it's just good comedy I have actually a different angle here I don't know if you have anything else you want to say on this but I have a different angle which was got me thinking what are some other great examples of corporate Espionage in history and I have some for you Sam oh okay cool I I like that all right so so check this out I went down a little rabbit hole and I tried to find you know examples of great corporate corporate Espionage um cases that have happened in the past I want to start with the British East India Company okay are you prepared for this so um basically back in the day we're talking about like the 1800s the British East India Company basically was a trade it was a tra a Trading Company between the UK and India okay and they did two notable things one which is unrelated to corporate Espionage did you know they had their own corporate Army well I know that they were like the the the Ballers of of the earth they like started in like 1600s and like uh basically like helped shape global trade so they were so prolific that like other parts of Europe like basically they were attacked on their trade routes and there was like a lot of security concerns so they formed their own corporate military which is pretty badass and I think you know if I'm perplexity or something like that if I'm like the third or fourth tier AI company right now might just spin up a corporate military just to put some shine on me and what I'm doing make it seem like I got some Trade Secrets that I need to protect like just armed guards going through S it'd be amazing yeah I think that every company needs like a fake enemy or a fake uh emergency to prepare for I think it's good for them it's like when I used to be in college and um we would go out and you know I'd be at the bar and just a lot of strikeouts going on you know Pretty Low batting average pretty low slugging percentage just taking a lot of else U what what was your called the pro chop it [Laughter] what was like gold out okay here we go ready uh Sam just turn around I'll be the girl I'm now you're just going to feel my body coming hang out this wait hold on what what what is this oh you didn't want to grind oh [ __ ] no okay my bad totally thought you wanted to grind that was it the the mistake grind with the immediate apology stick that was if it if it was the Dance Floor all right if we're not on the dance floor if we're at the bar ready yeah so I'm just turned around I'm looking over here I'm just hanging out hey yeah do they do they do drinks here just a question just an innocent question that was it mine used to be uh Hey Sala bet how many oceans are there five or seven oh wow that's great uh this was I'm talking about pre-reading the book the game once I read the book the game then it was uh hey you got to you guys got to settle an argument here and I just literally ripped the line from the book where it's like my roommate's girlfriend is making him throw away all the pictures of his ex-girlfriend uh in his apartment is that crazy or is she we think she's crazy is that crazy and they're like no you got to get rid of that and it's like oh do you want to be my girlfriend no okay never mind do you know what the worst line is is when I would steal all of the lines from the game and then one out of 10 times a woman would rep and say yeah I read the game too you douche and it was just like you go home so sad that was the worst I would have thought that worked we have so much in common we love the same books I didn't have that turn [ __ ] into gold type of persona back then you know I was there's a reason I was single for like not just all four years of college but even two years after college like it was it was a long it was a long drought I felt like the British e India Company just Mar through the drought that's not exactly a drought cuz the drought implies that that's not normal well yeah exactly I guess it's just a desert yes what are what are some other ones wait by the way have you ever done this with the company what corporate Espionage you think I'm cool enough to do that like my uh my extent of it was like having a friend at Facebook and them like telling me like what my competitors are doing uh I've been there done that a few times yeah yeah no I I've never done anything this cool I don't think um but you know okay I got to tell you this British East India Company story all right so back in the day China had like a monopoly on tea production and this was a big problem tea was super popular China made all the tea and um nobody could figure out how to make the tea nobody had the like the seeds nobody had any of the stuff you needed to like try to break that so they were all trading with China to get tea but they didn't have anything to trade back with China so there was these huge trade imbalances and so basically Britain I think was trading like opium into to China as the only thing that could get into China and China didn't like that and it created what was called the first Opium War and so there's literally a war broke out because of this trade imbalance with the te and so what happens is the British decide to to do something about this and so let me tell you this uh story real quick so the East India Company the British East India Company hired this guy named Robert Fortune he's a Scottish botanist and adventurer and they paid him they were like you are going to infiltrate China and you were going to steal the tea industry secrets of China and by the way Google a picture of this guy because I don't know how he pulled this off he looks like a Scottish man but he disguised himself as a Chinese Merchant and went underground he was wearing Chinese clothing Chinese hairstyle he traveled deep into China's tea region which is actually off limits to foreigners and he was able to get access in and he studied tea production step by step everything for planting harvesting drying packaging all of it he didn't just observe he was able to collect thousands of tea plants seeds this guy guy was supposed to be Chinese this guy was supposed to be Chinese I don't know how he did it but look like me yeah exactly he's you with sideburns like if just sick chops so wow he not only that then he started recruiting like a like turning other people so he started recruiting Chinese tea Growers hiring them and persuading them to leave China secretly and relocate to India and basically he pulled it off he goes and he steals the Trade Secrets he hires the tea Growers he smuggles them out of the country he brings the seeds the tools the knowledge the Trade Secrets he gets to India and they start growing tea and soon after that India surpassed China in terms of its tea production broke the Chinese Monopoly on tea and prevented future Wars actually de-escalated the conflict because now there wasn't this huge trade imbalance an opium problem that's insane that this guy pulled this off how long was he in China for uh I think this was like a multi-year thing how uh exciting that's a life worth that's a life worth living let me give you some other ones all right so now let me give you a more modern example Oracle versus Microsoft have you heard this story no all right so two giants two successful companies uh Microsoft if you remember in the '90s was doing antitrust cases and Bill Gates there's videos of this on YouTube he's like in deposition and they just were getting hauled in front of um the antitrust committees and they had to defend themselves so he was being accused of a monopoly monopolistic behaviors and this really was a problem for Microsoft it slowed them down there's I think it's called like the Lost decade where basically like for a long period of time Microsoft couldn't acquire companies they couldn't like if something got hot they couldn't release a competitor and kind of use their distribution to win cuz they had just gone through this like you know antitrust problem they had to lay low they had to lay low exactly and so Microsoft uh while it's in this uh this this situation Oracle hires all these private investigators to go and dig up dirt on Microsoft during this period of time and it gets found out but what they were doing was pretty smart instead of digging up dirt on microsof they were going to all these other companies that were supposed to be independent like they were kind of coming out and providing like testimonials or testimony uh in support of Microsoft and it was like oh this independent Council like the uh the independent the independent Institute the national taxpayers Union they're coming out in support of Microsoft here and Larry Ellison from Oracle is like nah no way and so Oracle hires these private investors to go dumpster diving and so they're digging through the trash of these of these independent organizations finding links where they got paid by Microsoft and they get caught they get caught doing this but they're also caught that Microsoft funded these organizations and so they go to Larry Ellison he's like look I had nothing to do with this I wasn't made aware of it till the end um and I agree this was a bit unsavory but he goes uh he goes corporate Espionage this is a public service we're doing our civic duty here we are taking hidden information about how Microsoft is funding these supposed independent orgs and we are making it public we we are doing we're doing God's work out here and just calling it public service and is doing his civic duty I thought was incredible spin uh the other day an Elon Musk interview in an Elon Musk interview someone asked him I think it was like Ted Cruz was like who do you you know you're a lot of people think you're smart who do you consider smart and the first person he said was Larry ellson you said that yeah he goes he goes Larry ellson he goes I think Larry ellson is one of the smarter people I work with he said uh remember from Forest Gump where he says uh stupid is as stupid does Elon goes smart is as smart does uh so he he took the inverse of that line which I thought pretty funny he go smart is is is smart does and I think Ellison might be the smartest person I know uh and so it's pretty funny that I didn't up until Larry kind of got a little bit more front-facing with some of these things I didn't I regarded him as like a just a guy who he kind of just started early and became the best I didn't realize how Sharky not necessarily in a bad way that he actually was though yeah how Elite he is um wow that's amazing Elon I think took some of his spin remember when he like he impregnated that woman who works with him and was just like underpopulation is the biggest crisis we face and like turned it into I'm saving the planet yeah and I was like whoo player player with no r at the end man that is that is incredible like can you imagine having the balls to just to just come out and not just defend it not deny it but to claim that you're doing good uh story Inc at High School when you're s hanging out with your buddies smoking weed late at night and you're just like riffing and saying the dumb [ __ ] you're going to do in the next morning When You're Sober like we're going to dude we're changing now we're going to get up and we're going to like we're going to start working out first thing in the morning that's like a thing that Elon would say it's crazy is like hey like don't you think it's kind of inappropriate you know she works with you she's an executive of your company maybe there's an imbalance of power here like are you concerned about this at all and he's like I'm concerned about underpopulation like wow holy [ __ ] Nick Cannon just like writing notes out there all right here's some other ones um Coke vers Pepsi did Nick Cannon just catch a stray bullet on that one yeah he's like the icon for too many kids dude dude say a so not ni Canon so uh 2006 coke first Pepsi another you know deal Rippling Microsoft Oracle Coke Pepsi these are all just like the legendary rival rivalries so an EA at Coke who is disgruntled this woman Joya Williams decides you know what screw it she leaves her post as a as a ea and she steals basically some Trade Secrets she takes a new a can of their new product that's unreleased and she writes a letter to Pepsi and she says I have the formula for Coke do you want the secret formula and I have a new unreleased product she sends a letter and she says I'll give you the formula for a price guess what her price was 100 Grand a million I don't know $1.5 million and what year 2006 all right so about $3 million today Pepsi being the good guy that it is says you know what not doing it they tell Coke they say Hey you have this woman she's trying to sell your formula we don't want it t let's me you and the FBI let's take this woman down and what they do is they set up a sting operation and so she uh comes out and she's ready to sell the formula they do a test payment for $4,000 to show that they're legit they record her saying what she has and that she's doing this trade and then they lock her up they arrest her and she goes to prison for 8 years wow isn't that crazy wow that's a lot maybe like a to yeah maybe like maybe a few months dude Pepsi you guys suck maybe promote her I don't know eight years in prison seems like it was a lot for that so yeah she she got made an example out of that's crazy this was like a recent story 2006 so it looks like her boyfriend was like uh also in on it like they like this was like a this was like a legit scheme yeah that sucks I like when I hear Joya I think of like an old woman who's like oh Coke you didn't give me a raise I'm going to get back you know what I mean like I think that there was more to it um all right that's crazy what do you think about Pepsi turning down the secret formula and the trade secrets and deciding to take her down because what are you going to do with that Pepsi's like what am I supposed make my T like Coke sugar yeah like yeah like like I don't know what you expect me to do with that with that cuz like the secret or the the whole thing with Coke is that like only like a few people have access to it I don't who the [ __ ] knows D that there's no way that's true by the way let me give you a couple other quick ones Uber and weo do you remember this one you probably remember this uh yeah the the main character of wayo stole a bunch of stuff from Google and Uber was going to use it and now Uber got Su yeah so exactly so basically uh Anthony leowski was this guy who worked at weo and Travis colanic recruits him to Uber wants him to set up the autonomous driving stuff at Uber he comes from he was at wayo which is the autonomous driving thing inside of Google he apparently downloaded 14,000 confidential files on the way out maybe a bit much maybe a little too many to what files and could have got away with a little less they uh they they have the the info he ends up getting fired from Uber Uber has to settle Uber settles for 34% of uber that Google owned which is about $250 million of stock back in 2018 which I think is closer to a billion dollars now of of uber stock and he had to go to prison for 18 months um but then Trump pardoned him Trump pardoned him uh early and so he got out why he didn't want him to serve all 18 months I guess well I understand that's why a part it exists hey's a big football fan I don't want him to miss the Super Bowl it's only once a year let's get him out so where is he now uh that's a good question like I wonder is he like uh damage Goods or is surely not like some some VC was like dude I don't care that you're like Stewart You're Now cooler he's the CEO of paen mobile has been for three years okay I don't know what that is okay these are great stories I'm I'm in on it do you want to hear something that's related to security and also I think is almost equally exciting yeah wait wait before we finish I just have one more little tidbit the US this is actually baked into the DNA of the United States I don't know you know Espionage corporate Espionage and so America's founding father and first US Treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton decided that basically realized that the uh Europe was ahead of the US and they actually decided to in encourage intellectual piracy doesn't all crime sound better would you just give it like a like a longer like more letters make it make it sound better and so what he said was he advocated to reward those who would bring improvements and secrets of extraordinary value into the United States which made which was instrumental in making the US a safe haven for industrial spies and they did this guy Samuel SL Slater my boy I love Samuel Slater one of the greatest stories of all time what's what's his story so he brought British textile technology to the US what does that mean is he likea they claim well sort of actually they claim he was like had a photographic memory this is like the story that you're told as a kid like in history class which is that he had a photographic memory but basically he was from England and he memorized and partially wrote down how factories in England worked he came to America and he helped reinvent American factories which spurred the industrial re Revolution which arguably made America what it is are we pro- Espionage I think I might be um so by the way this guy's nickname top five nickname do you know Samuel Slater's nickname no Slater the traitor yes that's what they called him in the UK yes but he was like welcomed with open arms here we loved him so yes Samuel Slater is sort of an American hero that's crazy at the age of 21 so he literally prison break it he photographically memorized uh all these Trade Secrets and then came to America and gave them to us and spurred the Industrial Revolution and made America great again well made America great for the first time yeah for the first time [ __ ] the the inaugural make America make America great for once yeah yeah those hats are out of style that's actually pretty funny yeah he made America great um I have another story so last year we the there's two parts of the story last year we talked about this company whiz whiz is a cyber security company to most of our listeners we mostly talk about small business stuff these guys are not that they're Enterprise cyber security company but it has two amazing components so one part of the story that you talked about and by the way these guys whiz remember when we did Sarah list they were on SAS list so right we we we kind of we didn't exactly nail it because it was a yeah a little pat on the back I don't know if the mic picking that one up because they were already like kicking ass and I don't know what the multiple was on when we named them but it was at least double but there's two amazing stories about this the first is how fast they grew I want to like show you how fast they grew but before we talk about how fast they grew we got to talk about how they started and you talked about this uh wait you bu the lead they're getting bought for $32 billion that's about they got they got bought for $32 billion sorry so this company um whiz is getting bought for $32 billion the story of how they started is amazing the story of how fast they grew also amazing uh it just happened the other day but listen to this so you I think are the one who brought this up were you the one who talked about the this guy Gilly yes so Gilly is a Israeli um cyber security veteran so he's exited a few companies in the cyber security space uh and he was also part of this Elite group of cyber security Specialists uh in the Israeli military called 8200 I believe it's called and he invented capture he invented like a certain type of firewall he invented a lot of [ __ ] he's an OG the like the OG's OG in in cyber security and so he has this thing I believe it's called cyber starts yes you can call it an incubator or a VC firm but here's how it works so he teams up with a lot of young exmilitary 8 uh 8200 I think that's 82000 is the name of the uh part of the military where it's the cyber security specialist so you leave that uh after you finish your compulsory service and you go to Gilly you go Gilly sign me up I want to start a company and so what Gilly has done is he has this fund and in the fund is uh dozens or even hundreds I believe of uh cyber security officers large companies not just Israeli companies but American companies and what they do these cyber security officers yes they say here's the here's the problems I need solved Gilly go so go have your young Founders create products to solve these problems and I will be your first customer and Gilly goes to these Founders and goes guys I'm going to invest in your company here's the idea to get you started I guarantee you 2 million Revenue in the first year and that's amazing because these companies will sell or uh get they they can raise their next run of funding at 20 times 2 million in Revenue so with 22 million in Revenue the first year they can raise money at $40 million valuation that's a no-brainer now what's pretty controversial is these cesos these Chief Information officers at these companies are what's a ceso a chief chief information and security officer information they own pieces of gillies's fund and anytime one of these startups does well and succeeds they get they get paid out and so it's this very insular group of a lot of Israeli guys so they have that Bond over that they had the bond over being Jewish and they had the bond that they probably all came from a very similar part of the Israeli Army so there's this like Bond after Bond after Bond and they're like yeah look we'll help you we'll get you off the ground and then we're going to get the money just it just flows around nicely and so that's what he did with these guys uh whiz and isn't that a crazy setup it's amazing so I'm going to read you this the numbers from the from his cyber Stars fund are phenomenal this was it's about 6 seven years old now it only has 22 companies but the 22 comp's combined value was 35 billion at the time now whiz just sold for 32 billion itself so it says five of the 22 are unicorns so that's a extremely high hit rate so you know a normal VC fund I think between 1 and 3% of the companies will become unicorns YC which is you know the best in accelerator in the world ever I think their their num is between six and 10% and so this guy's like double YC right uh so five of the 22 are unicorns um four of them sold in the last 12 months uh for a total of 1.5 billion and then it says in all three of his funds he shows an irr so his his internal rate of return of more than 100% which is obviously fantastic um not a single company in the portfolio has closed to date and he B he basically beats every VC Fund in terms of his performance his first fund he turned $54 million into1 billion that was his stake yeah crazy right you describe the model well so basically he's got this network of cesos and they're called the the cyber cyber cyberstars like ceso group and they basically all talk they say what problems they have but they also get pitched Solutions and it's like kind of the handpicked solution they all start using it they all have a share in the in the fund so if those companies take off they win it's this kind of like I mean there's definitely a conflict of interest with this let's be clear um but it's wow what a powerful Network and what a way what a powerful way to use a network you know like uh James Courier came on the podcast uh I just did an interview with him I don't think it's out yet but um he's got this whole thing his fund is called Network effects and his he has his blog post called your life on network uh your your life on network effects or your life is a network effect and it's basically like everything you do from the college you choose you're not just choosing a school you're picking aor networ to join like I joined the Duke Alumni network when I pick Duke right um when you move to San Francisco you're picking a network of people to join uh when you pick a company you're picking a network of people to of people to join and those are going to be the co-workers and future opportunities that that open up for you and so once you realize that your life is dictated by networks you the church the religion you're in that's a network the language you speak that's a network uh the country you live in that's a network and so similarly here this is like such a powerful example of this guy having this Network dating back to the Israeli kind of like security intelligence groups to the network of you know Fortune 500 cesos how valuable that is that Network turned out to be worth tens of billions of dollars and it's pretty amazing he he's so precise about this so look at the First Youtube link that I posted in our MDB duck so basically there's this video that has 400 or 00 views less than a, it has 528 views do you see that 528 view video in this video he breaks down where he says he goes I've done this 35 times I have a 9 to 18mon Journey that I use to achieve product Market fit before building any cyber security company and he goes through the key phases which is basically like exploring different pain points and how to find them uh you spend 7 months developing the right solution that mere moral can use and then here are the questions that you need to ask prospects here's how you find prospects this great what a great find only 500 views on this guy who's giv out like you know like a billion dollar Playbook and he goes he talks about how he's going to you want to accelerate the timeline and what the bench marks is he gives this whole Playbook that he uses and he goes I've I've done this 35 times and we've turned this into billions of dollars it's it's incredible now here we are with whiz so whiz was founded by a guy named uh what is his first name um Assaf is it Assaf or uh his last name's uh rap aore um but he basically had a company that he had previously sold for something like $350 million and he did it when he was like a kid still so when you think what someone do does that well why on Earth are you going to join this thing well he did join this thing and he left Microsoft and he even explains he's like he sold this company to Microsoft and he left and he's like I'm afraid to leave Microsoft I'm not sure what to do so he joins this thing and listen to the timeline that he that whis went through so whiz was found in when you say he joined this thing he joined what Gillies cyberarts sorry oh he joined cyberarts okay he joined cyber starts uh Gillies thing and he uh starts the company in uh January of 2020 and they go through the and because he was already successful and he was part of this ghilly crew right out the bat they raised $21 million in funding and they were able to hire a team of 10 to 20 people by December of that first year they raised aund million so fast forward one year to uh March so we're still in Winter of 2021 that's one year after founding they are only at 40 employees but they are at roughly $100 million of AR is that crazy that's break neck speed right like this is by the way there's a lot of we do this but there's a lot of people who are like dude Venture money don't don't raise too much money you know growth growth growth it's it's a problem you know you got a bootstrap you got a uh you know you know people there's different ways to win this is a great example of like no raise a bunch of money out the gate uh Blitz scale this thing and keep raising money and just go for the huge prize and and I'm and I have like a takeaway on that but two years after the starting the company we are now in Winter of 20121 they raised $250 million at a $6 billion valuation this is a handful of months after they've already reached 100 million in Revenue with 40 people 18 months in now we're in the year 2022 this is the second year of business uh they are at uh I believe yeah second year of business they're at 100 employees and by the end uh uh by the end of that year they're at 400 employees now we're going to fast forward each year here south say grew their revenue after 100 million Revenue by year three they're at 200 million in Revenue by year four they're at 500 million in revenue and by uh that same year they're they sell for $32 billion is that insane how on Earth can you imagine going Z to 5 years in and you're creating between 500 and a billion in in Revenue with only like five or 600 employees I was I was watching a clip of um their cro talking and he was like we were growing so fast that the only reliable Benchmark we could use for how much to grow our headcount on our sales team was just uh he's like they were like did you use um you know like Piper line leads kind of like how did you did you do market analysis Market studies he goes we just looked at how full the calendars were and it's basically like for every product line in every category we just looked at how like the the calendar density of all of our sales reps and in areas where the calendar density was high we knew that area is working hire more people just hire more people based on the density and we measured our calender density of sales reps to for booked calls for people looking for demos and um that's how knew that that that was the only reliable leading indicator they could figure out for for growth and if you look at their glass door review the CEO has like people Rave about them and like you could say well I don't know is glass door even accurate not sure dude you're the only dude who looks at glass door you're the they have one web visitor a month and it's you man I'm telling you you can get so much Insight so if you go to glass door you sort by negative and you look at the ne negative reviews and then you look at the positive reviews and the truth is in the middle and I'm telling you you can learn so much information about what people are complaining about did you were you ever on glass door with any of your companies like was on glass door yeah and I didn't look because the only people that left reviews were the people I fired correct and do you think that they had an accurate view of like the company well it's an accurate view of the people who disliked me like so but but there's like there's like so like what I don't even want to read it but what what's it say does I'm trying to go I don't know if we have one anymore because we haven't been in business for like independent for years they could have shut it down but like it was probably like the management is good but the CEO like moves too fast and like is not communicating well which is like probably true too handsome too too ripped moves too fast well like I would like make decisions like I'm like intimidatingly smart I would like make decisions quickly and I would say this is what we're doing now and I just wouldn't like communicate with my managers I would just say this is it I just can't believe you like reading the the reviews of whiny employees of other companies I just like what what do you really get out of it like it reveals so much truth like it could it could say like um that thing you said is true about like every company you know like yeah but CEO likes to move fast it could be like let's say there's this new startup and um it says like you know uh the market like like uh we were we were going to do like a betterup uh you know what a betterup is is like a coaching platform for before Hampton we were thinking about getting into that and I read the reviews a betterup and the reviews were like uh business boomed during covid but now we can't get anyone to sign up for online coaching so that's like an interesting like macro insight into the market of coaching like it boomed during Co good I like that and and so you'll see that on like four different coaching platforms Glass Door reviews or like uh you know our valuation if you see this in like five different ones is way too high I have no idea how we're ever going to grow in this that's not something that you want to see on four different glass doors of companies in the same industry so you get like insights like that or it could be like uh CEOs amazing at press don't believe everything you see and if you see a bunch of those and I think to myself H I've been like basing a lot of my insights off of uh public articles I don't know if I should actually do that you know what I mean yeah I just I I personally wouldn't do like you know I personally wouldn't trust it because I think you're going to get a lot of basically false negatives um in this that would spook you so for example did you ever work did you ever work at a company that had blind I didn't work at a company when that existed I no used probably had one you you probably just didn't didn't join it but like um blind is basically a private social network so let's say you work at a big company there's an app called Blind you log in you have to use your I think you have to show that you have a work email there so like only people who work at the company can see it and can post there and it still exists but it's all Anonymous yeah it still exists and it's all Anonymous and it's basically just like a back channel for people to [ __ ] and moan and complain and then the upside would be that they you know there's kind of like a whistleblower type of thing where you can you could call out hard truths that you're not going to call out but the reality is that it was all just complaints um and the problem was it was misguided complaints so so like for example at twitch it's like I was on the exec team so I knew I knew all the numbers of the company I knew what was going on I knew the strategy I knew who was smart I knew who wasn't cuz I'm sitting with these people every day and then you read a blind a review on blind or like a post on blind from someone who's like a you know just like a mid level employee um you know some engineering manager somewhere they would be often be like oh we're you know there's no way we're going to hit our numbers I'm like dude we're hitting our numbers what are you talking about I could see that I could see the numbers you don't have access to the numbers so you're just like you know just talking out your ass basically but and and the loudest most sort of extreme voices would get the get the most play right they would get the most attention and so it's the same way like when Dropbox Launches on Hacker News and the top comment is like no one's ever going to use this and he can give you an highly intell breakdown of why nobody's ever going to use Dropbox and the Dropbox becomes like so big right so I think like a lot of these me Message Board Anonymous Message Board type things are too biased towards negativity from people who don't have real information and um are too prone to false negatives to be trusted so like for every example you could find where you get signal you're going to find counter signal which means to me I can't use this cuz I can't differentiate signal and counter signal properly only only hindsight you know no if I think if you read enough of them I think you can start it like for example if you're trying to understand like a macro Trend or uh industry analysis I think you can see Trends in the classro reviews and I think that it could help paint a picture but not be you it's not a fact it's just like a is this like is this does this jive with other sources that I'm learning about so that's why I'm on board with it by the way agree and to disagree like I think you're right I think you're right I don't think you're wrong um I think there's some problems with it but there's some some utility you're the only guy I know who uses it which I find like funny well like like I wanted to learn about the CEO and I'm like what makes a CEO so great and I read an article about him and it was like don't mistake this guy's gentleness for ruthlessness it said don't mistake assaf's gentleness for someone who is willing to play by the rules yeah and I was like that's like an interesting title so this guy's like must be like a really nice guy but he's ruthless and um he's kind of a killer that's like an interesting trait like is there like is there is there like anything I can learn from his personality and I went and read uh his glass reviews and he had glowing reviews as a CEO where people are like nice guy but total hard ass and I just thought like that is a that that mix those mixes of those two traits when you mix like be you could be polite and like hardcore I respect that I like that is this a person I want to learn for learn from that was kind of like my insight from looking at the glass reviews and also uh reading interviews things like that right right and so I just thought it was fascinating but we had Mark lauia the Pod Mark started uh diapers.com which he grew like during like the doom boom and he sold for hundreds of millions of dollars then he did the same with jet.com sold that for billions of dollars now he's got a new thing have you seen this new thing it's called Uh I think wonder wonder yeah uh and he had this thing when he came on the Pod by the way when he came on the Pod he we could tell that he didn't have a laptop and we were like are you calling from your iPhone and he was like yeah I don't I don't use laptops and we were like is that like a billionaire thing and he was like he was awesome by the way I love that guy's energy like he he was super positive super energetic super optimistic he great charismatic he was fun he was a fun I would love to have him on we got to get him back on well on the Pod we asked him how he how he did it and he had one phrase that has always stuck with me uh because it was almost like saying I'll explain why it stuck with me but it was called Vision capital and people he goes those are the three things I care about he goes I find a really big idea and a big opportunity I raise a ton of money and then I go hire the best people and I pay them all of that money that I raise and I sort of get out of the way and let them do the work and I have a bootstrap company you have only done bootstrap mostly done bootstrap companies it's really hard to do that because you don't have a lot of money to pay people so you're doing the work so it feels like a grind and this company whiz is sort of a good example of the founders they raised they found amazing opportunity they raised shitloads of money and this is a perfect example how it's done when you have a really big idea and you have a really big opportunity and you have a ton of money and I think it's as hard as a bootstrapped startup do you know what I mean like it's they're of equal challenging and stressfulness equal I don't know this scaling at break neck speed seems a lot more challenging to me I think if you had a small bootstrap startup that was growing quickly you would feel a similar amount of stress but there is no that's true but there is no chance that you would have a $32 billion exit in 5 years one of the funny things about life is that if you decide to start a business you're going to spend let's just call it 10 hours a day maybe 12 early on just obsessed your mind is just obsessed with this company 10 hours a day 12 hours a day every single day it doesn't matter if that's a taco truck it doesn't matter if it's whiz selling for 32 billion it's still going to take 10 to 12 hours a day of your time and mind share it's still going to stress you out pretty much equally if you are doing a thing that's you know uh 1 million in ARR and you're trying to pay the bills and you're trying to pay yourself and you're trying to grow and you're trying to do all those things well guess what these guys are also trying to pay the bills trying to grow trying to do all that stuff so you're right like the stress levels are more based on you as a person than the than the company that you're doing um and the time is equal whether whether you have you know doesn't matter how many zeros are at the end of the sides of the business this was probably one of the most important lessons my dad taught me he was like my first my first business was in the restaurant industry and my dad worked in oil and gas his whole life he worked for BP and so he was like yeah the energy industry is just like the restaurant industry you're going to spend the same 10 hours a day except in this one there's three extra zeros on the end of every project and so would you rather spend that same time on a small project or a bigger project like that's that's what you're deciding between here um and I was like which is sort of hard to hear right like you're like I'm dedicating my life to this thing you're dedicating your life to this thing but your prize is so much bigger I didn't think it was hard to hear I was like oh that's the truth okay cool thank you like okay what do I do and then I pretty much immediately switched and went and did a biotech thing with him in Australia like you know I was like I was pretty ready to hear the truth um I think that most people you're right don't like to hear the truth I like to hear the truth because I realize that basically the truth while short-term painful is actually long-term less painful and I think most people don't like the short term pain they're willing to have long-term pain have you been following these guys like getting acquired did was there anything that uh you liked about the story or that stuck out to you well remember when we first brought this up we first brought this up because whiz was rumored to be selling for 23 billion and then it and then something happened where it was like no that's just a rumor or Google couldn't do it because of antitrust or for some reason the deal wasn't going to happen and if you remember Assaf came out and he tweeted this like kind of like badass memo where it was like first they leak the deal like first deal information got leaked they in rumors to about an acquisition for 23 billion then he releases this thing and he's like we're not looking to get acquired let me be I think he said like let me cut to the chase our next Milestones are a billion in ARR and an IPO and everyone was like yeah that's it that guy's a killer and most of us were like most of most of us on the sideline were like oh nice negotiating like pretty sure it's going to sell for I don't know 25 30 billion in the next in the next 12 months and that's exactly what happened it's sold for 30 billion at 32 billion in the next 12 months it like came exactly true what a lot of people noticed which was like but what was the first offer the first offer was like 20 or 18 23 so we got 10 billion dollar 10 extra billion dollars and I don't even know that the 23 billion was on the table maybe the 23 billion was what he wanted at the time and they continued to grow and you this is all part of the negotiation right it's not um this didn't I I don't think this leaked because uh somebody really just wanted the world to know you know this is part of a part of a public negotiation it's a price setting it's an anchoring it's getting the second bid to up their bid there's there's a whole bunch of stuff happening there and when a CEO's like we want to be independent and it's like yeah you do but if the price is right you know we'll see we'll see what happens and almost always once the Price Is Right they they do it I love hearing about this story I'm very excited the uh the time that we worked on this podcast this guy has built and sold a $32 billion [Laughter] company well when you put it like that yeah but does he have 650,000 subscribers on YouTube probably not and now he will try to I bet you this guy's going to get into podcasting that was the funniest uh tweet I saw the other day goes even Kings and billionaires want to be podcasters and I was like it's true dude like you see you know whether it's billionaires on the Allin podcast or BR you know Bill Gurley in his podcast you have his podcast Elon is tweeting and like crazy and trying to be trying to get his word out there you see Gavin Nome starting the new the his new podcast they want they all want what we got Sam they all want what we got and we'll sell it to them for 32 billion it's always been this way you know you look at uh like who has bought Time Magazine and with uh Washington Post and Bezos you know king or once you've once you're rich you always want to be king and to be king oftentimes is to own a media company for some for some reason it's been that way for hundreds of years yeah yeah it's basically just like there's three buckets if you're rich but but lack status you're going to chase status if you're high status but no money you're going to chase money and if you have Rich and Status you're going to chase power and those are the three uh you will fill those up like some uh I have a friend who's who knows Elon and he was telling me he's like Elon gets all this criticism right now for for backing Trump and Doge and all this stuff and the thing people say is like um you know he's doing this to make like he's doing this to like give Tesla or whatever an unfair advant he's doing this to enrich himself and he's like are you an idiot he's like he's not doing this to enrich himself he wants status like like not that oh he's doing this altruistically but he wants status that's of course what people want when they when they're when they have the money they want the status and when they have the status they want the power like those are the three like things that draw people to do crazy stuff yeah he wants something but it's not money yeah he's got I think at this point when you have that much money more money is probably boring his father did a good thing on DJ Vlad where he was talking about how he was like Elon I knew after he sold zip 2 that he wouldn't stop until he was number one the richest person in the world he's like I knew that yeah he goes I uh he was I knew that was that's what he wanted to do and he would never stop until he was number one I could tell he was like that since he was a kid wait so elon's Dad did an interview with Vlad TV yeah didn't we talk about this um yeah dude what else was in this this is incredible so Vlad TV part of black YouTube one of my favorite niches of YouTube uh he had uh what's elon's dad's name I don't know em or something like that ah I forget his name he had his dad on on uh the other day and DJ Vlad is weird he never just releases the whole episode Errol musk arrol he like releases like clips and he's been releasing Clips over the past month of this interview and he talks about what Elon was like as a kid and how like are the rumors true that you are rich and it sounds like this guy and Elon are exactly the same where he made some money and then he's like we're going to spend it all buying this farm and turned this Farm into a thing and it went broke and he's like well I'm going to come with some other people to give me money we're going to start this new thing and that worked and he went rich and bus like constantly and he was like I loaned Elon money to Z zip 2 and that turned into 30 million doar and I knew when he made that money he was never going to stop until he was number one and he just tells these crazy stories uh along the way D we need to do a whole reacts video was the interview good it's pretty good it's shocking that like if my father said any of this [ __ ] publicly it's weird dude it it makes it's very like they talk exactly the same the way their their all the comments are like his laugh is a DNA test in itself or they they're timestamping and it says I swear this is Elon the face mimics it the way he laughs the way he rolls his eyes I can see Elon here this is this is this laugh is a paternity test like the spacing in words you know how Elon talks slow he has like a very like unique structure uh how he talks it's exactly the same and his dad is insane by the way like there's like some crazy story about how he is now married to his stepdaughter like he does some wacky ass [ __ ] he's married to his stepdaughter something weird like that yeah he has a kid with his stepdaughter yeah and there's a and there's like uh just when he's talking you see I understand why the children who you raised why they're insane and why they're Ultra like in order to be ultra successful you have to have some type of like weird like Daddy issue and I see him and I'm like oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I get why you have a daddy issue CU you're insane like he reveals stuff like he'll be like yeah Elon like was crying to me when he was like 23 and I thought how weak like he like like will tell a story where he's like disrespecting his son in front of everyone and I'm like oh you're an [ __ ] that's why your son behaves this way sometimes it's like a very interesting interview and it was has been totally under talked about yeah this is crazy this is a two and a half hour interview oh did he release the whole thing finally when did that get released normally mono he normally does like Clips like he releases a two and a half hour interview released a month ago um how many views does it have 17 71,000 that's it yeah just just to put that into uh into perspective here DJ Vlad most popular interview um is with let's see who's he got here uh boozy boozy has 6 six and a half million views cardi B 5.7 million I mean Boo's a good a good listen it's a great interview baby 5 million so we're going to have to like watch the whole thing but there's like crazy good insight into all this and um it like my takeaway from all this is like it's not worth being successful if you and your father are behaved this way to one another um like it's very strange to see like you don't have to be a psychologist to like watch this and be like uh I I understand why this family screwed up yeah messed up family okay wow that's amazing all right corporate corporate espionage stories you got what you wanted every remember everything on this podcast is allegedly and this is a comedy podcast thank you very much uh don't come after us all right that's it that's a pod [Music]

all right today we're talking about Trends so I have a list that I've been keeping I want to bring it to you today and Riff on those with you because a lot of success in business just comes from surfing the right [Music] ways I think Founders like to believe that it's our own genius that's causing our success and when it's failure then it's market conditions and actually often it's the opposite it's the market conditions that can create success or really amplify your success and I've learned the hard way that the most important thing is finding the right wave to Surf have you ever been on the inside of a product that has taken off like that I I haven't uh but like I've had friends who they'd be texting me as it was happening but have you ever uh seen that yeah a couple of them um there's one that we did recently that I invested in my friend and they're doing a I can't say I don't want to say that thing cuz the trend is like still going it's still hot right now but it's a health it's a health supplement and so like you know in the health world there's just like every few years there's a new diet Trend there's a new like um you know few years ago a big thing was like leaky gut it's was like oh my God Le gut health leaky gut I got to do something about that and so there's these things that just come in these waves of awareness and um so we backed one of those and it just is crazy growth I mean 0 to 30 million in one year that's like just wild and profitably like it was just a like crazy growth we have another um company that we started that I haven't announced yet maybe I'll do that soon um but we have another one in that space that's kind of like same thing a zero you know in one year just doing millions in recurring Revenue profitably it's just like wow and it's not because we did something so much better it's not because we worked harder it's not because we were smarter we didn't have some genius strategy we just picked something that was like had Market pull inherently the market wanted this and all you had to do was show up you know it's you're selling cold waters on a hot day that's that's really what what I want to do so in any case here's a bunch of Trends I think I have three or four trends that I think are going to be really big I think if you watch this episode two years from now uh a lot of this will be proven right and then I have some bonus ones for you all right you ready yeah let's do it all right Trend number one short drama apps so what what are these if you remember a few years ago there's this company called quibby that was started by Jeffrey kenberg who created DreamWorks I think Meg Whitman the former CEO of HP well who she the I don't know who she is but she's somebody big deal in Silicon Valley eBay and and HP so quibby raised $1.75 billion in funding pre-launch pre-launch pre-launch to build this out and they were like look the future is short form you see what's happening with Tik Tok this is early days of Tik Tok you see what's happening with Tik Tok well guess what that's what the next Netflix is going to look like it's going to look like Tik Tok content and they take their 1.5 1.75 billion of funding they hire a crack team in in in Silicon Valley fancy offices they got the executives dude they came to our office to pitch you and I to like they wanted Shan and Sam or some or like MFM to be like a Content series and I was like guys we're laptops all day like this isn't interesting they were like uh we need you guys for business scripted and we were like what what does that mean they're like there's a it's a category we're like we're in that like okay never mind so they they you know they wanted content they needed content on the platform anyways quibby launches fails and under a year so 1.75 billion all this Talent all the resources all the brand name the guy creative Dream works in an under a year it folds didn't work and they were mocked and I thought that was kind of nonsense I thought it was a great like that's you take swings just in the arena doing stuff yeah I mean like it was like it was like uh you know they tried something you know who am I to mock them for that people don't like when people with pedigree and resources go after something they like when you're the underdog so the consensus opinion since then has just been quibby equals failure that whole category failure well quietly in the meantime a handful of apps have basically run where kbby crawled and they are doing pretty much exactly the same thing but to tremendous success I don't know if you've seen any of these apps can I tell you about some of these tell me all right so they all started in China they're Chinese companies but they're big in the United States um so for example here's I'm just going to tell you the revenue of the top four apps revenue of the top four apps 150 million that's number four 160 million that's number three 275 million annual and the top one 350 $1 million okay that's insane isn't that insane okay how do these work so I I downloaded a couple of these I watched them now what they did that was very very smart was they realize the American Consumer is pretty much an idiot and what Jeffrey katberg did wrong was he tried to give people what they should want rather than what they do want and what they should want was wellmade um you know these these series that were really cool premium hey we're not going to do that short form just rubbish we're going to do Netflix original level content but just made for your phone 10 to 15 minute episodes and you'll pay for it because otherwise how are we going to fund these things that are like millions of dollars artsy [ __ ] so these guys came out I'll I'll give you an example of one of them so one of them's called Drama box the other one's called real short and um I was just going to show you the the first one on this can you read the title of that yeah it's called pregnant with my brother brother's baby and I didn't just show him uh you know cornhub I this is this is a real thing right so these are all it's kind of trashy soap opera style stuff now what they did differently was the key changes from quibby was free instead of paid so you you quibby was a subscription you had to pay for this is free but you pay to unlock more episodes so you get hooked on one of these little dramas and then you sort of buy coins to unlock the next episodes as you get once you get hooked so they lowered the friction the next thing was they did kind of trashy TV they did you know Hallmark and mor poic have a baby that's the type of content that this is like I watched one um honestly wasn't bad to be H not going to lie like it's bad but it's not like like I watch four episodes I probably only need to watch one for for my research and the episodes are only 90 seconds long so it's not that big of a commitment all right my friends so a lot of of you guys who listen to the show you listen because you want to start a company but you're not sure what idea to choose or you may not even have an idea and you like our podcast my first million because we've done a lot of the work for you on researching all these business ideas well my friends we've made life a lot easier for you because HubSpot they just put together an entire list of all the resources that you can use to find a market opportunity to validate for your next business idea so if you're looking for a market size calculator or tools to identify market trends or a huge list of ideas to get started so if you're interested there's a link below click it and you could have access to the whole thing it's completely free now back to the show whenever I think of these uh I think of in on Wedding Crashers where there's Jamaican guy he's like the Butler and they're like trying to like bother him he's like hey I'm watching my stories man like it's his time to watch his soap operas and like you can't interrupt you can't interrupt anyone when they're watching their stories cuz the soap opers are so good and you know that we talked about this uh we talked about this in 2019 or 2020 right what do you mean we talked about it what what did we say then so uh we talked about it in a few ways the first was there is this massive trend of these this was when YouTube was uh obviously it was not up and coming it was already up but in 19 and 18 there was these guys making these somewhat tacky dramas and they were doing something very different on YouTube they were making like 30 minute fictional videos on YouTube and it was like Tacky in the sense of it was like a soap opera clearly appealing to Middle America women so it was like a little like cringey but very addicting do you remember these guys that they would get like 8 million followers or they were making Facebook uh videos where it was like huge dramas or it was like the kid who got bullied on the bus and how he grew up to become president do you remember these like 20 minut videos been some there's been some YouTube series like this and I get by the way I get get sucked down this like rabbit hole like often where like I'm on Facebook and it's like a kid getting bullied and like it's like very clear message market research yeah yeah like it it's hard to turn away and then also I told you the story about when I was helping Ramone he his original idea for a business was to do erotic fiction audible stories and we we ran a test and on like 50 bucks of ad I think romance it was short form romance romance is very different right it was erotic it was like no it was like sex it was like exp it was like it was for women tasteful so tasteful though they were in love it was not it was uh romantic sex yeah and basically what we did was we uh he had a friend who loved writing these stories he wrote one of these stories and then he had a Fiverr voice actor read it and then we ran an ad uh and we called captivating CLA I think uh I forget what what we called it but we called it short but romantic and we spent like 50 bucks running ads and we got like a $100 in recurring revenue on a crappy WordPress site and like anyway my point being is like all signs have pointed to yeah this makes sense and so like for example this one that I watch is called AIS crash lands on her husband and um I think I lied I'm on episode 6 actually so what happens is the story starts and it's this girl she's so excited this guy is going to propose to her she thinks he thinks she's a door Dasher but actually she's a billionaire ays but she hid that from him because she doesn't want him to want her for the money and she's so happy that he's going to propose to her and uh blah blah blah but then um his mother-in-law is like she's not good enough for you how about this other girl and then she's like you don't even know who I am and then she reveals it and I'm like oh Cliffhanger like got to got to see more so what they're doing is 60 to 100 seconds you free to watch you pay for more and these things are are growing like crazy and so they you know H I guess half of China's internet users are watching these what they call Mini dramas and guess what I think that a lot of Americans are going to do this too I think a lot of Americans are going to watch mini dramas and these will continue to grow I'd be very interested to see if some if an American company can come out and do this um and do it maybe better than than because today the top four I think they're all Chinese companies and I don't think that's going to last I I or maybe it will last like Tik Tok but I think there's an opportunity for somebody to do this also not just in the states so for example my mom for years when she comes over to my house it's wonderful uh we hang out we have fun we eat together we talk together she plays with the grandkids like it's all great but then there's this moment at 9:30 at night where I just hear the most annoying sounds on TV and it's these special effects coming from what she likes to call her Pakistani dramas and it's basically soap operas from Pakistan son that she likes to watch and she's Indian but she's like they make the juicier stuff they make the better ones and I'm like where did you find these and how many episodes are there she's watched like the series will have 650 episodes and she'll like finish multiple of these series and it's not just her all her sisters love this and they're just watching these on YouTube today and they're like you know 15 20 minute episodes and so um I looked up some of these and like if you go look at their YouTube channels the top 10 uh of these will have like 4 billion views I remember when people were talking about uh YouTubers and I just remember being like this is long time ago but I was like I only watch a YouTube video when somebody sends me a link of like a funny clip from Saturday Night Live or a basketball highlight like I don't just go to YouTube and browse to see what's on I thought that was a like a wild weird behavior that we people were doing and sure enough now I do that every single day you know I do it every day every single day like I think man thing by the way I think it's a it's a young person thing and then people our age it's only men but did you think you would do that when you first saw that people do that cuz like no I I like the same thing of watching video games I don't even play video games but sometimes I watch people play I had a Twitter account for years before I ever tweeted a single word I was like H why would I ever just tweet I'm not going to try to do that like I'll just consume and so like some of these behaviors actually take a lot of time to to kind of propagate and and it's it's sort of like in the tech World they say like you know what the Nerds are doing on the weekends we'll all do in 10 years I think there's a a version of that in culture which is like what the what the degenerates are doing today right like what the daytime TV Watchers are doing today we're all going to do I remember hearing about musically and being like Oh people are doing like lip sync lip sync videos on their phone like that's stupid and then sure enough you know Tik Tock buys musically becomes huge sure enough you're now making videos for your lipstick e and you haven't shared it here but we all know you do it what uh what's another one all right next Trend that I want to do is one that you probably know a lot about it's a fitness Trend Trend number two is rucking which is first of all just an amazing word rucking and secondly I just keep seeing this and I've seen it four or five times from four or five of the right people and it instantly resonates when you hear it which tells me that this is just going to spread more and more so what is rucking Sam you want to describe it you put a heavy bag on your body and you go for a walk it turns the the hot girl walk into a uh a workout so you know how you go for walks in the morning except now you do it with a 20 lb pack on you you either wear a backpack or like a I like the ones that are like the weighted vest it's like a bulletproof vest looking thing like yeah so that's the downside of all this by the way I do like particularly when my daughter when she was born and it's like you know how when you want to get steps in when the kid goes to sleep cuz they're sleeping all the time I that's when I really got into it I would put first of all I screwed up I would put a 40b vest on cuz I thought that was like well more is better and then your back is like killing so I'm like all right no 20 lb is is more than plenty uh and then you uh just walk but if you put your heart rate I would put my heart rate monitor on an hour walk it would be 120 beats per minute which is like a pretty like hardcore walk and it didn't feel that bad so it basically supercharges a walk so you get more Fitness out of a Leisure activity yeah exactly there's these charts you can see like I'll put this up on the on YouTube it's basically calories burned so in the same amount of time just walking but wearing the rucking vest you will burn about like 200 more calories so um which is enough to put you like in a if if you did nothing else different you now you might go from you know Surplus to a deficit or or break even to a it's not significantly harder it's not significantly harder right and so I think this is going to be a big Trend it's sort of like pickle ball where pickle ball was the much more access ible version of tennis I think that rucking is one of the most accessible versions of Fitness cuz my like my parents in their 60s will go for walks and I think that over time if you realize that hey if I wear this 15b vest I'm getting much more of a benefit without having to then without having to like go learn a new thing or do a new thing um or add in an extra workout I think that's going to be really popular like I want to buy one of these and then I looked at some of the brands that are taking advantage of this trend right because you see you see people talk about this you see huberman and others talking about how rucking is really good how it's there's like this thing low intensity steady state cardio which is known to be like really good for fat loss and it's basically just like walking at a moderate pace for a long like 40 minutes or 45 minutes for like a longer period of time and how that's actually better for weight loss than um than like you know traditional high-intensity cardio and so then you go look at these brands have you seen this brand goruck do you know about these guys no let me look at goruck the issue that I've had with a lot of these packs is like I would do my walk sometimes at night and it would it looks like I'm wearing a bulletproof vest and like the issue or the benefit cuz it's like the main reason I'm trying to get one dude they like like people would see me and like and I there one walk in particular I was walking at night and people kind of stared at me funny and then Neville saw me out in a walk he goes dude you look like you're about to go like on a shooting you look like you have like a bulletproof vest on I was like man everyone's been staring at me I because because it it just looks very intimidating true you do have Vibes yeah I had the luck and so I had to I actually went and bought a different one that looked less like bulletproof Vesti and so this company go Ruck it looks like they make backpack they're basically backpacks right they do it as the back I think the backpack is their hero skew but they have they have the vest too um I was I probably wouldn't have even realized they're looking at me for the wrong reason I would have thought they all think I look so cool um and that's why they're staring at me like dude if I could wear like a Superman cape get away with it I would like why would I not want to feel like a superhero or like a Navy SEAL so this this brand was started by I think an ex he's an ex-military guy I don't know if he's a Marine or what he was and he was like yeah like this is like a big deal in the in in the Marines and so he created this brand called go Ruck and he started partnering with these kind of fitness and toughness influencers and he a toughness influencer that's a good one toughness influencer David gogins what is he you're right tough influencer that's a good one ja what's Jo ja's a toughness influencer did you just make this up or is that the category on the spot off the Dome off the that's great a tough a a toughness influencer okay cool and so this so and as you can see like that that's a trend and so they uh they take off I guess they're doing like over 50 million a year in Revenue now no way really so they're doing really well um and they turned it into a whole Lifestyle brand I mean they they announced it they were like 46 million last year so you know they're they're going to be higher than this year so they um they also do shoes and shorts and like shirts like it's a whole like Lifestyle brand now and I think this is really smart and I think a lot of people do this now where's the opportunity I think the opportunity is go look at the prices on their website like how how expensive is their like rock bag 450 bucks correct $420 for uh just one that I'm seeing here my friends it's time to undercut I think if I was going to enter this space I would be trying to go be the the lowest cost good enough solution which is never a sexy pitch right the sexy pitches were the highest quality most premium most unique made in America that's their pitch right $450 backpack that's great and there will be somebody in that category but guess who makes more money the good enough at the at the more accessible price point almost always makes more money like when we were hanging out with Mr Beast and he's like talking about chocolate and he's like yeah Hershey's versus whatever and all of the people there were basically like rich people who either don't even grocery shop for themselves anymore or like only eat Whole Foods and we were like we like Hugh chocolate it's like I like their cashew butter you know like $7 chocolate bar and he's like yeah yeah their their chocolate's great but Americans can't buy $7 chocolate bars like he's like we sell at Walmart and look look where Hugh is at Walmart and it was like like so off to the side in this like one tiny little footprint area because again it's not the like mainstream price point so I would be trying to build the uh the sort of like Walmart Ruck brand and I know that's not really sexy but it would work very well do you remember Echelon so when pelaton was really popular me and I I don't think you went but for some reason I was there with Moyes at the C uh CES the electronic show and there was this booth for this Fitness like bike called Echelon and it was 100 % identical to pelaton there was only one difference is that it was half the price and it was called Echelon and I think they got sued by pelaton but they still exist and everything that pelaton has Echelon has it's just literally half the price but the same it's the same logo it's the same everything do have you did have you ever seen Echelon yeah CU they're at Costco they're they are the hero Fitness product at Costco and which is again the same thing like the Costco price point and what they did they just like oh pelaton great okay we got the trend we even got the brand we got the shape of the bike we got the whole arsenal awesome and they literally like took a like a knife and just scraped off the letters off the bike and were like here's a new sticker Echelon it's even like a chat gbt name like it was uh I think they even got sued looks like they changed their logo they were literally the exact same red it was everything was the same uh and I remember like going to the CES booth and I'm like wait is this are you guys like a sub brand a pelaton what's going on here uh and sure we're not familiar with that brand uh we we we have no comment and no familiarity with that brand completely coincidental all right I want to do the next one the the the next one that you have is pretty cool um the did you see the tweet that I have there for your next one that's a that's a good uh a good way to kick it off okay do it all right so you have plastic free everything so you're on board with plastic free is that what you guys are doing at your house I'm I'm not hardcore about plastic free like we still have plastic stuff and whatever I I mean I can't say I can't with a straight face be like okay we're eliminating all plastic from our life and then I'm like giving my kids craft mac and cheese sometimes so like you know I'm like Common Sense test fails do you have uh do you go out of your way to buy cotton clothing or natural clothing yeah I try to I try to I try to you I try to buy the highest quality stuff for myself because I know I can like with my kids that's that's the the monkey wrench right like I can't get my kids to eat certain things yet um and so you know that's where we we fall apart a little bit so the trend that you care about you had plastic free everything and I had saved a tweet by this guy named Miles Snider it happened uh March 2nd so only 10 days ago from when we're recording this and he said Lulu Lemon and viori really sced the whole generation which by the way scoped that's a new word have you noticed that word trending dude is trending like crazy scop is it scop is it uh agency scop I don't know what else is trending but those those two are on my radar someone tweeted out that they sced me and I didn't understand what it meant and so I still don't entirely understand but I was like is that like an insult towards me yeah uh so he said um lul lemon ofori really s up a whole generation $70 shorts made from plastic of petroleum that smell disgusting every time you work out in them and they destroy your fertility meanwhile cotton shorts are cheaper comfier and better on every metric and so you had listed here plastic free everything I think that the obvious thing that's going on right now is plastic free or Teflon free pans which is uh in the same ballpark but PL uh like for example at my house we only have glass Tupperware and so nothing more up than any sentence that starts with at my house in my house the next the end of that has to be uppy and literally you just spit on on somebody every time you anytime any somebody uses that phrase not particularly I'm just saying at my estate my at the par estate at par Manor it's glass only how dare you for the record I have Diet Mountain Dew in the refrigerator right now uh so I think like a good way with saying this tobacco in your lip presently and you're worried about microplastics yeah you have a hole in your gum yeah so I think I get away with it sometimes but no we don't do plastic stuff uh plastic like anything that goes in the microwave it's not plastic but now our new thing is it's like uh my daughter has this thing she calls her baby I what do they call it lovey lovees or whatever you know like the I don't even know what they are but uh we're doing all cotton those which by the way they're like way less comfortable uh I understand why like uh do you use a plastic pacifier in her mouth no we don't give her we we she quit taking the pass pacifier at 3 months uh but and we even have uh glass bottles uh but it's like a bunch of like glass stuff and we're not crazy like we use the Teflon pan for like scrambled eggs that's like the only thing that we can't get away with for nonstick but uh it mostly is not plastic and and we are taking it to closeth so uh a company that I like U I have no affiliation with them I just think they're cool is rker clothing have you seen them they're uh yeah I just I actually just ordered some of their stuff cuz I want to try it out it just arrived I'm going to I love it it's great give an honest review uh I think they're cool but like it's really actually hard finding all cotton workout gear um and so I'm on board with the plastic free Trend by the way I'm also so prepared for somebody to be like oh my God cotton haven't you heard and then be like cotton is a lie like cotton is huge lie it's like when Joe gabia told us that recycling was a lie have you heard this part this bit I've been saying this for years recycling is 100% [ __ ] it should be Reduce Reuse get rid of the recycle and you're saying it because what it all gets thrown away in the trash like it recy but there's even more to it that he told us about I I want to get him on to do his recycling rant cuz's got like a great recycling rant but I believe that one of the core things is recycling is a scop you ready recycling is a scop which was that they the pla the companies that make all the Plastic Products were like under some heat they're like oh [ __ ] this is like really bad and they're like what do we do what do we do what do we do what do we do we blame the consumer and they were like blame the consumer This brilliant how do we do that and they were like what if we made it their job to deal with the plastic and they're like how would we do that like we convince them that they it's the obligation is on them to recycle these products and so they they funded the like recycle movement knowing that it's like most of it's not getting recycled anyways it doesn't really work dude the blue bins are [ __ ] they're [ __ ] yeah they're totally [ __ ] it's like coton Cotton's next I just I Can Feel It Coming they could you know what I often would do with the blue bins and it would like freak out people I remember people at my office the hippies at like the uh like typical like granola people at my company would like complain to me but I'm like just throw the trash in the recycle bin it doesn't matter it's all going to the same place and they would like flip out to like it would like it I could tell they we like we're losing sleep over this because they base their personality on this blue bin has always been my like it's okay to consume this and throw it away but it all goes to the trash and instead we should just reduce the the stuff we consume or we should reuse what we can right the blue bin I can't stand the blue bin so Joe and I are are are the same on this one so I'm on boarded with plastic everything so plastic free everything I think this is going to extend into clothes I think it's going to extend into um like home wear pans everything like cups that you use I think it's going to extend into baby products all baby products I think are going to there's going to be a a the way that honest came out with Jessica Alba and was like these juices are full of sugar so they're like honest juice and I think that and they have you know they have wipes and they have diapers and they're like oh yeah you know you need to use these these products I think there's going to be a plasticfree um Big Brand that gets built in the baby space well you know what that used to be right I grew up using this because my parents were a little hippy it was cloth diapers that you threw into a hamper and then you had to wash them it was disgusting for that reason I'm out it was it was honestly filthy but my mother my wife tried to propose that by the way she was like I think we should cloth diaper it is the look of disgust I gave her I I mean I was I was just like listen you can cheat on me you can abuse me you can do whatever you want you will not bring cloth diapering into my lifestyle there's usually what my parents used to do and we were poor and so they would they said it was cheaper but they had a service that would come and pick it up once a week but it's still just like the idea of using cloth that other kids have [ __ ] in it's that's it's filthy like we're animals wait wait so the cloth diapers are not even just your cloth it's a mixed pool of cloth it was like a washing full it was like a wash and fold service except the stuff clothing had poop in it and so it was basically you throw it into this bin and they come and pick it up and then they bring you new cloth diapers that are clean and you're just like reusing them yeah it's like it is it's disgusting but uh that's what that's how it used to be now that I'm saying this by the way this is kind of an interesting uh you know we had um Jake on or Z whatever the the young guy the other day who talked about how he thinks of ideas through Zack same [Laughter] thing kid we had uh what was his Zach was his name um we had Zach on and he was talking about how um when you ask him how he comes with ideas and he's like I just think about what would be awesome in an ad and a cloth diaper is like revolting but it is clickable and it is interesting uh so I actually am on board with cloth diapers now I just talk to myself into it okay sounds good I also think by the way for plastic for everything that this got be a supplement that people are going to try to sell that's going to like remove the plastic from your balls and your blood bloodstream I think people are going to get on the you know every category is going to going to try to to take this angle and I think that it's um it's sort of like protein how protein you know became a thing it's like great eat more meat and then they're like or take this powder or you want protein chips how about protein cookies how about protein brownies how about protein everything protein waffles protein pancakes and so protein just made its way into everything on the protein wave I think going water yesterday it was amazing protein water it was basically water with like uh it was a scoop that looked like lemonade mix and it was high protein and it sounded filthy and disgusting and it was delicious that's how I drink my protein shakes it's just scoid water did it tastes just like CU that tastes nasty there's something cool where you think creamy and protein that for some reason that's okay but fruity and Protein that's just unacceptable do you know what I mean like so this was fruity or this was it was fruity it was lemonade but he said unacceptable but you liked it yeah I loved it but I I had to like get over that barrier right is that was that really hard for you you like like a motivational like talk to like figure out how to yeah like David gogin like definitely had to Hype me up how bad do you want it we fight for these all right so next one ready there's another Health Trend um that I think is going to be big have you ever heard of anybody who's doing nervous system work our most popular retreat at Hampton is called nervous system reset and people go to the woods and we have a facilitator who guides these things it's very uh this is totally a niche thing and it was really smart of you to call this out so go ahead okay great so you're you're already on this this was I just my spidey sense is tingling I'm hearing a little things it's the new leaky gut it's the new leaky gut cuz who you know who doesn't want your nervous system to be reset or to be calmed down right it's like this thing that's so Central to literally it's your central nervous system it's so Central to you um you have your Vegas nerve and like all this stuff so I first got hooked on this because my trainer was telling me about this he was talking about like when you out and when you eat it's not just about what you do it's about the state that you're in that you're your nervous system is in when you do it I'm like what do you mean he goes well you have these two um modes or modalities for your nervous system parasympathetic and sympathetic you're familiar with this yeah I know what those I've heard those words before okay I can't teach a class on this but I've i i i vely here's my bro science okay my bro science for this which is probably half wrong but basically you have two two core modes that you could be in one is your figh ORF flight um your figh ORF flight response so this is where adrenaline cortisol you have these hormones that get released and they're they're not just bad right people say cortisol is the stress hormone well stress stress is good in certain scenarios adrenaline is good in certain scenarios you don't want to be in that all the time that's the problem but you need it when you need it if there's a lion chasing you you you want to be in fight ORF flight mode right um the problem is there's no lion chasing us it's just slack and email and you know scrolling on on Instagram and feeling like you're not good enough and like looking at your body in the mirror and feeling like you're too fat and you then when you eat you're stress eating or you're you're working too hard then you're stress eating or you're not sleeping things like that so if you're operating in that sympathetic system which is that fight ORF flight um your body is secreting certain hormones but then also uh your body shuts down other functions so like let's say you stress eat one of the problems with you stress heat is not only do you overeat or you make poor choices but your body literally digests less poorly uh digest more poorly during that when you're in that system right because if you're in fight or flight the body's going to take its resources and say guys we're not digesting food right now that's not what's important we got to be doing these other things the lion is chasing us and so uh then you have the parasympathetic uh system which when you're in it's more rested more relaxed your body could do things like digest it can recover it can do other things and so literally being able to shift your mood or your state from one to the other is really important how do you do that some people get that from exercise some people get it from the sauna from the cold plunge some people get it from breath work some people get it from meditation there's a bunch of different ways and all of these are a means to an end which is to calm your nervous system down and a lot of good things happen both healthwise but also decision-making creativity you're much you operate differently when you're in different states okay cool um we've not so that's the that's the theory that's where I first got on my radar and I believed it and I I started paying attention to it well you've been about uh breath work for like four years now or five years now yeah and the breath to me is like cuz I'm always like I'm not trying to supplement or like I'm very skeptical of the flashy hard things so I always look for advice that nobody could sell me really no you're not you love that you love no no like in the health in the health space let's say yes right like I like why did I talk about ring cuz I'm like oh it's walking with a little extra weight cool that kind of resonates with me it's it's that's that makes sense cold plunging I never really was able to get into because I was like I just think this is like this extreme thing that's like seems like it's for show I does I don't know it didn't really resonate with me in the same way uh breath work did cuz it's like oh yeah I could tell that literally just controlling my breath for a couple of minutes I will feel much differently at the at the end of it and it also make sense to me to like work on my breathing system because I'm going to do that I don't know 50,000 times a day and I went to a breath work class in San Francisco and I like it made me kind of high it was awesome yeah yeah well that's like the Wim Hoff stuff you can you could literally hyper falate yourself and you'll you'll get high you'll pass out you could do a lot of things yeah it was great that goes more into the category of the extreme but okay fair enough so our buddy Jack Smith had come on remember that thing he told us about on the podcast where he's like I went in this room with 50,000 screens of different colors and like he's like basically they flash things I sit in a lawn chair and I paid these guys 10 like thousands of dollars and it healed me and I was like we were both just like okay so we were both like what dude there's one down there like he came to my visited me in my house I live in a tiny suburb in Connecticut there's one I'm not joking 200 yards from my house and we went and we went to it how was it it was I forgot to bring this up it was insane so basically to everyone listening it's this is like 90% of people are going to be like that's you're crazy and 10% of the people are going to like be into this it's very like Fringe [ __ ] you go to a room and you're surrounded by literally 20 TV screens and it looks like it's playing white like snow you know like uh like when you're white noise yeah like where your TV wasn't working and so and then the room is about the size of let's say it looks like a like a mini bunk room it was like uh 50 ft long 20t wide just a plain room with reclining chairs in it I go and I sit in the chair and I just like fall asleep that's all I do and so I go home you supposed to fall asleep you're just supposed to do whatever you want you're supposed to relax are you supposed to close your eyes you close your eyes and relax you're supposed to close your and just relax and I fall asleep and part of me was like did I just do like a Ron Swanson thing where they're like where I'm just standing there meditating and he's like this is so stupid I just stand here and I'm thoughtless like like yeah that's a point I was like is that like is that what I'm complaining about is like I just fell asleep and I actually did achieve it I wasn't sure what happened but I go to Jack and I say you know I did kind of like how they had vibrating chairs there like the vibrating massage chairs they had were amazing and he goes dude they those chairs weren't plugged in they were not vibrating they were not the chairs didn't vibrate and I was like no like I vibrated the whole time and it made me relax and I I felt so calm and it goes brother I talked to the owner I saw the whole thing here's a photo it was not a plugged in chair there was no electricity in this chair it did not vibrate and I swore that it was vibrating me the whole time so something happened so that's my story with this with this with this place and how is it to be a Scientologist it was you know it felt crazy like it it did the and and I was so turned off because the guy who uh the guy who owned the place explained how like his wife had cancer and he went into debt to start this place and this cured the cancer and I sort of felt like these people took advantage of you man like you know you didn't use modern medicine you're so like delusional I feel sad for you which is silly for me to judge but that was my judgment and yet I left think like my thinking my body was vibrating and so maybe there was something there that's all I'm saying yeah so I'm kind of f ated by this and um it does feel like something that like someone would like a YouTuber would make up to make like a cool YouTube video or not like a prank video it also feels like like like the hatch and lost like the Dharma Initiative created this thing so you know there's definitely a part of me that's like oh my God this is [ __ ] however I do believe that nervous system work makes sense and who am I to say that that's not one of the methods that would uh you know reset rewire calm change the frequency I don't know I don't know all that stuff but people are really into grounding you've seen grounding go in the grass is insane to me my college friends used to be into this so they they they would after playing sports all all the basketball players would do it they would take their socks off and they would go and they would stand in the grass because they said they use the word ions something about negative ions or negative electrons were going from the Earth to their body and that was going to heal them it was it's the same thing to me as like do you remember Brett Favre promoting like copper the copper Bal the balance band it's and I don't know man I don't know about any I absolutely don't know about these and I'm not I I have no I don't know the science I don't know if this work what I'm saying is I think there's market demand I think this is a trend I think there's pull I think this is an area where when you talk about it it has that leaky gut type of thing where people say you know what I think I have that problem I think I want that improved and whether it's through this room with SC whether it's through grounding whether it's through breath work I don't know what it is but there that's a trend and I I I see it it's a wave and I think a lot of people are going to go surf that wave you should go check out one of the what's the screen thing called it's called the electromagnetic therapy or something like that maybe uh and let me know if you have a similar experience I'm a hater on it but I'm telling you I left my body felt different all right let's do something that's not a health hack real quick I have another one for you religion AI social network which one um dumon let's do biohacking and plants um which I don't have a lot here I'm just going to say it out loud but there's a moment in time right now so this is what is this trend number three four uh we did five this is five okay five Trend number five so Trend number five is biohacking plants so there's a moment in time right here where I think biohacking has never been as popular at as as it is now thanks to Brian Johnson thanks to uh OIC thanks to people real peptides people realizing like oh I can just kind of take this stab this do this eat this drink this whatever and I'm going to improve my own health so biohacking is a thing um and AI has changed the game of science because AI is now doing kind of remarkable things I don't know if you've paid attention to Alpha fold or some of the stuff that's coming out of Google where it's basically like Alpha fold is basically a AI um breakthrough where AI was able to predict how proteins fold which is really important for a couple of reasons but I think that the simple explanation is like um the shape of proteins really matters it matters how other things can connect to it it matters how it can connect to other things how the building blocks can link and it was something that we we didn't as humans know how to do we didn't know how to sh we knew what was what it was made up of but we didn't know how it would fold we didn't know the shape of the protein and Alpha was like beat all beat all the the like won the competition of of modeling protein folding and so let's assume this is only going to get better and and the implication of this is what we can make new drugs yeah exactly Therapeutics drugs um you know so you have all these different like these different Technologies crisper you have um you know protein folding stuff that's going on you have in general an interest biohacking but the problem is biohacking in humans is really hard and when you biohack in humans you have to worry about all all kinds of health concerns you have to worry about like getting approvals for things it's going to be a long hard Road and so in the same way that I think the longevity startups that are focused on dogs are going to do well because who doesn't want their dog like to live longer I think that's like a a problem everybody has the background of that is that we had Kevin rose on and he was trying to create or he invested in a longevity drug company and their model their their their phase one was using it on dogs because that's an easy easier way to get into it he's way to go to market um and and to test your your products I think the even easier version of this is plants and um I know that like David freeberg is doing this for a hollow which is basically like it's basically biohacking but for different crops so how do we make a strawberry that does has certain properties maybe it's resistant to certain bugs or maybe it can be riper maybe it can be bigger maybe it can be juicier maybe it can grow in different different weather conditions and therefore can there therefore certain places can now grow their own crops and don't have to import right so it's like all these like implications if you could biohack plants uh cuz plants are food and so how do you do biohacking in plants and plants for a long time like a lot of the like the breakthroughs and people's understanding of genetics was because of plant experiments like you breed true crops with each other and oh this is how we figured out like you know the little punet square about about how genetics can can uh uh how genetic combinations work and combinatorial effects of of CR crossbreeding and so I think that there's going to be some really successful startups that take Ai and the concept of biohacking and then use plants as their focus as their target market rather than humans what's uh David freeberg thing it's called AOL and and uh so it's accelerating Evolution to unlock Nature's potential that sounds like a great Mission um and and so he Bas they're basically creating new seeds or new style plants yeah um I don't know you know they haven't been super like they're not they're not in stealth but they're not like it's not like super obvious exactly what they're doing but like they have this thing like boosted breeding so it's basically like how do you get more yield on uh on your crops right or they'll have like value added traits which is like how do you take a crop but then add you know a a trait that you want right gain a function but not for viruses but for for your for your strawberries for your almonds for your potatoes for your corn for core crops and so this is going to become technology that they're either going to be able to like vertically do themselves or they're going to sell this to farms and be like and that's kind of what he did with his other thing you know climate or whatever this is so much better than working on Creator economy software like when you're telling me about this I I'm a I'm a dumb dumb I I I will never be able to start anything in this space but like part of me is like if I had a friend that started something like this I would quit everything I'm doing to go work there because this is such an easy mission to get behind you know like this is so much more important than creating a new link tree and so much more exciting and so I love this I think this is really a really interesting thing to call out yeah so that's a trend I'm watching I'll give you another one AI social network so what does this mean uh every decade or so a new Social Network comes out so you know you had uh Facebook which was 2004 and then roughly 2012 you had this next generation of social networks and those were Snapchat Instagram and they were taking off um and so what did what and what did they do differently they took advantage of the new tech so the new tech was your phone the phone that had a camera the phone that had a GPS the phone that um uh was with you at all times and so it unlocked a new social use case and I think that the new soci use case that's coming out is um is AI so what is what what is AI going to be able to do here I don't know exactly what this going to look like but I would bet with very high probability this is a bit of a safe bet I guess but um I would bet very high probability that the next breakout social app is going to be based on AI arguably it already happened arguably that Tik Tok is the breakout uh it was the first breakout AI app right in the same what do you mean you mean that I'm following AI people as opposed to real people there's a few ways that could take it so the most obvious one was Tik Tok which was basically everybody thinks Tik tok's big innovation was short form video but actually short form video was around before that vine musically others what Tik Tok did was Tik Tok was like hey how about how about this how about the AI just tells you what to follow instead of you so every social network up until that point was de based on was based on the user creating a graph so going on following people or friending people and that follow or friending people this was Facebook Twitter Youtube all of them that you would choose content that's interesting to you and then you would keep coming to the back to the app because you have content that's interesting for you and that worked to an extent and then Tik Tok came out was like let's never let the user say what's interesting let's see if the AI can figure out what's interesting at a higher rate like almost like we were talking about this crops thing like what if you got higher yield of interestingness if you used AI for the feed instead of the human choosing what to follow and so um and that's what it did and Tik Tok is super addictive and Tik Tok has a higher usage rate than every other social platform because the AI is serving you the content instead of you picking yourself so that was like the first breakthrough but it's under the hood you don't see it it's the algorithm okay cool um and now by the way everybody copied it and Instagram and others everybody's moved to this for you feed the the that was the the real innovation of Tik Tok is the for you page um okay so what's coming next so now I'm thinking that the next breakthrough is probably going to be that up up till now all social networks were based on content that humans make and now I think it's going to be based on content that AI makes in some way that sounds a little farfetched like why would I want to follow an AI influencer well let's let's first start with one example Lil Michaela we've talked about her years ago when when they started this Lil Michaela is an Instagram influencer that is just AI generated it's a girl that's like she's an AI uh image basically and they put her she's an instagrammer and she posts photos do you know how much money Lil Michaela makes last week talked about it it was like interesting but not wild it was like 800 Grand a year I think I think we started talking about her in 20 or so I I don't have this confirmed but I heard it's over $10 million now that's that saying okay so I like Michaela yeah you and a few million other people like all right so that's one but here's a more interesting version of this because I think people have heard the AI but I'll pit you a different style of AI social product it's actually in the music space so I think there's an opportunity to create create the AI version of Spotify what I mean by this is I started listening to like a non-rival non-trivial amount of AI music so like in my pie chart of my market share of Music uh used to be 100% just like artists right that I I know so like Spotify or wherever right let's just say that's where I started and now I started adding in a little bit of AI generated music you go to sunno sooo has a lot of music there but also there's these YouTube channels like there's this one called Golden Age hip hop which I don't think is AI I think he might use AI in the making of it but Golden Age Hip Hop's great great YouTube channel what he does is he makes these mashups right like if you go to I listen to it too and then like Mac Miller Loi or like main character playlist for sure I'm I I'm getting recommended all of these and at first I was like this is weird and lately I'm attracted to them even more and like going to it's like what I listen to all day when I work uh this is my new workout track so Golden Age hip-hop is uh if you look at the channel so it's got 800 thou 730,000 subscribers every thumbnail is AI generated yes all of the concepts are like things that don't even make sense it's like wait so this is uh it'll be like somebody from the like 80s and then like somebody from the 2000s collabing on a song or like all the top top songs are like you know if I just sort by popular so this one has 11 million views Snoop Dog Ice Cube DMX or Snoop Dog Eminem Dr Dre uh 50 Cent exhibit and and Ice Cube all on one track you're like what that that never happened uh and that that song has 8 million plays and what I think what the person is doing is I think they're just like a mashup artists more like girl talk where they they're just sampling from different songs and and overlaying them well together yes but I think this is a little bit of a sign to come I wouldn't be surprised if they're using AI to do this or if they're just going to take a a a voice uh artist voice and just use AI to make a song from it like I think you tweeted something out didn't you tweet out that like the number one song right now was an AI song uh it was um The Beatles won a Grammy this year and it didn't get talked a lot a lot about but basically they had lyrics from when John Lennon was alive and they used uh machine learning and in Ai and they finished the song and it won a Grammy and it's a great song like that's crazy it's crazy nobody nobody's even you're the only person I know who talked about that I saw it and I was reading about this and I was like this is a huge deal why isn't anyone discussing this I felt like it was a totally undercovered story uh and the song's great it's it's not that nobody's talking about but you're right under like less underreported uh story so here's what I think's going to happen I think you're going to have a a service that's sort of like a Pandora or a Spotify where you're going to prompt it or you're going to tell it what songs you like and it's just going to start generating AI music on the Fly and what's going to happen is it's going to generate music that's in the genres you like it's going to figure out it's going to basically train on the songs that exist and it's going to create net new songs and I think the last piece of what's going to happen there is in the same way that today you have what's called like Vibe coders you know you know what vibe coding is I'm still trying to figure this out I just this this got on my this got on my radar uh on Monday this is how new I am to Vibe coding all right so there's there's a couple of startups like because of Peter levels is how know about it okay so there's a couple of startups like cursor which is like absolutely blown up I think it's become like A2 or three billion dollar company or 10 billion dollar company in a very short period of time cursor is basically like a coding terminal but you can but AI is built in right and so you can code but you can basically like just tell the AI it'll write the code for you and they can tell it to debug it for you you can tell it to build for you repet is doing the same thing you go to rep.com now and it just says what would you like me to build and you just tell rep like hey I'd like an app that does blah blah blah blah blah and then it's just it starts spitting out code on the screen just scrolling like huge amounts of code and then you'll see it thinking it's like hm I the initial screen's not loading properly let me see what's wrong ah I found it and then it just like continues on it's like kind of amazing to watch and I've built a bunch of little repl apps that way um and so this is like you know basically what's happening now is that people are going to be able to make software without knowing how to write code I think what's going to happen next is I'm going to be able to make music without knowing how to make music without knowing how to play instruments or sing so what's going to happen is I'm going to be I'm just going to be able to prompt the music or tell it what I want or tell it how to tweak the songs and then I'm going to make it and then by the way you're ready for me to just go full-blown full-blown you know idiot here I'm goingon to say three letters that you're not going to like okay nfts they're coming in here so here's here's the business model here's where this actually pairs up and this is not so crazy well listen listen to this so do you remember when uh you used to say they you used to celebrate like ding ding ding we found a use case is this is this we did now we found a use case exactly so ladies and gentlemen what is an nft nft is basically any kind of digital collectible digital art digital property uh that's unique it's a way to say that this is unique and I own this I made this and if you bought it now you own this and and it shows who made it and the royalties are attached to it this kind of actually kind of a cool thing if I make art in Photoshop which I think both of us would agree is Art right of course I think being able to say that I made this and nobody can say that they made it that's important being able to sell my art also important and if you sell it me being able to capture a royalty of subsequent sales also cool so I think we all agree that's actually pretty cool as obnoxious as nfts became to be now what's going to happen in the music case is I'm going to be generating music with AI and I'm going to be able to Mint that song so I'm going to be able to say that song I helped create that by prompting it I'm going to create it all of the artists whose music was used I think they're going to get paral ownership of that and now I'm going to be able to upload that track as a musician but in the same way that like you know a lot of musicians today they're using like uh autotune and like you know just like basically digital program they're not they're not sitting there with a guitar strumming right they're they're in a piece of software making the computer strum the guitar and they just type in the notes A B C D and then the the you know they'll type in the chord and the guitar just plays it it's kind of like to a pure musician they're like that's not music that's you're just cheating I think that's what's going to happen next I think with AI and so I think the next version of Pandora or Spotify so the be next big social product that's around music is going to be about creating music using AI being able to Mint it as a curator saying oh this is cool I like this I'll pay to create this and to own this and then I'll share that with other people and then I will get like the way this Golden Age hip hop guy is getting 10 million streams on his songs I think somebody who's a non-m musician would be to get that did I just go crazy or what just happened no I I think that's very smart I think you're I think you're doing a good job of looking ahead and I agree with the future that you're painting I think that I'm shocked I'm shocked so far that music has been as uh not with AI it's been and I guess this makes sense because the guys making AI are also into this other stuff uh but uh like ai's been like coding and like just a variety of other tools and I'm shocked that it hasn't impacted art and particularly music as much as as little as it has um and I think the the future of painting mix a lot of sense I think that if you were to play me like an AI post Malone song and a real post Malone song I don't think anyone would know the difference which is unbelievable we're already there right we're already there we're already there and also if you were if I were to go to a concert like I would be into going to a concert of a fake person like do you remember the gorillas mhm I loved the gorillas I listen to the G what's their story I've only heard their songs but never been to a concert the guy who created the gorillas as a genius so the gorillas for those listening who are below the age of 30 the gorillas was a band it was created by do you remember blur remember the band blur so it uh like a kind of a punk Rocky uh guy but he created the gorillas as like a weird like hobby like a side project where he wrote and this was in the 90s he wrote songs and then he had a music and he sang it he was the musician he played all the instruments and then he had a music video where it was cartoons and it was animations and and so for years uh and this was before the internet was popular so we couldn't like Google who was behind it it was like rumors and like it was like you know you never you didn't actually know you know in that in that age how it was you didn't totally know you're like I heard it was this guy I heard it was this guy I don't know who it is and the gorillas was the band that he made it was a fake band it was all cartoons they went so far as to being on talk shows and so they would like at the time the tech wasn't great but they would do Holograms so they appeared on David Letterman and shows like that and then eventually they would do concerts they would play at first it was simple in janky it was basically just a movie theater uh and then eventually they figured out how to hologram it and then now he'll go out and perform now we all know who the guy is and he'll actually go and perform and it's like amazing but he did all of this before all this technology was a thing and I loved the gorillas I don't I don't I loved them before I knew who the person was I just thought like I knew like the characters and I like actually liked them and I got to know the personalities it was very strange but because I was into that when when I was a kid and even as an adult I like it I can now see how it doesn't seem crazy that I'm going to like the AI stuff totally totally I mean dude I was so into like WWF growing up right it's like it's like you get into these things that sound on the surface silly stupid illogical why would you care it's all fake right it's fake wrestling and then guys are like you know paying thousands of dollars to sit front row and scream their hard out to like watch it right it's like these things seem on the surface if you just described it to somebody it would seem like it wouldn't work but does and that's the I think the point I'm trying to make with this episode is that these are all trends that today Sound small sound weird but I think in the future are going to be bigger and knowing that is good for two reasons either a you're the type of person who just likes to be in the know you like to know things before you maybe like to try products early on before they become cool um I I I like to do that that that's that's one reason do you want to know these and the other reason is jumping on Trends early is the way to make a lot of money right there there is riches in these niches if you actually like go go pursue them and or you're just going to be the guy that always waits for something to be proven out and then you're going to feel like you're too late every time right so like that's those are your options as an entrepreneur and so I think being early to Trends is um trends that are going to last or be big is is a great way to get rich all right so the ones we mentioned uh number one short drama apps so mini dramas these these apps that basically are like Netflix but the episodes are 90 seconds long they're taking off four apps that are doing over 100 million a year in Revenue today they're all Chinese apps I think there's an opportunity for somebody to make this uh both like made in America but also for really any of your geography like make the biggest one of these in Brazil make the biggest one of these in India these are going to be very very big the next one Fitness Trends so rucking we had which is walking with weighted vest go Ruck doing over 50 million a year in Revenue shirtless ripped guys are going to just tear you up in the comments saying Sean we've been here of course say congratulations on being early um plastic free everything so I think just microplastics being something that people the the next thing people are going to be afraid of and then figuring out how to sell solutions to that fear nervous system work we talked about so the parasympathetic nervous system people who who create solutions that that are marketed towards calming or tuning or resetting your nervous system a reboot for your nervous system uh we talked about biohacking for PL so uh AI plus biohacking but using plants as a go to market because it's a lot safer you can kill plants and nobody cares um and ultimately there's a huge Market of improving crops and the food that we all eat uh and then the last one that we talked about is the AI social network so every decade or so there's a new big hit social product Facebook then Instagram Snapchat now Tik Tok where it's time we are due for a new one and the twist will be that the content is somehow generated with AI I I pitched a music one but there's probably many other variations of that that was very educational good job you you uh you came with the goods you carried us on this one and I think you did a wonderful job so thank you thank you let us know in the comments which Trend you like in the YouTube comments and I'll be replying to uh to all of them all right that's it that's the pod [Music]

My First Million is a HubSpot Original Podcast // Brought to you by HubSpot Media // Production by Arie Desormeaux // Editing by Ezra Bakker Trupiano

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
by the way it's it's it's noon on a Monday where are you right now I actually skipped class to do this podcast let's go sorry Miss bicker staff the boys are [Music] calling okay this kid right here on the screen is making $20 million as a high schooler the high schooler that is making $20 million a year in Revenue that is absurd Zach welcome to the show man uh I think this is actually the make everybody else feel bad when you find out that like a 17 18y old kid is make a $20 million in high school I think a lot of people's initial reaction is wow and another group is like oh man what how much of that uh per year is profit Zach it's more than 30% all right so it's very good balling um we're going to tell the story figure out how it's going Sam do we need to address your uh your letterman jacket are you just in the high school mood what's going on look I found out that Zach was coming on and I wanted to look the part you know like what's it what's that movie Sean it's it like uh Never Been Kissed where they pretended that they're in high school yeah or uh 21 Jump Street yeah that's us that look this is actually the second group of high schoolers that we spoke with over the last two weeks I'm Jonah Hill all right Zach dude uh welcome to the show you've you've listened to the podcast before I understand yeah last two years you would you say we maybe inspired you slash we the sole cause of your success yeah I'd say this is the sole reason for any of it all right so let's explain what uh start with what your app does because it's like what app is making $2 million for a high schooler so let's explain what is your app yes and when did you start it let's start with that so Cal is the app and it lets you take a picture of any meal and get back the calories proteins fats and carbs to track it so think any other calorie tracking app but then heavy AI features involved does it work really well that sounds like a really hard thing like you know uh you were literally 12 years old or maybe 8 years old when Silicon Valley the TV show came out and that was like the the joke was like is this a hot dog or not now the app says a lot more uh you know does that work really well or is it like mostly right so the scanning is about 90% accurate on average which is really good when you look at the data for FDA nutrition labels they can be up to 20% inaccurate so it's actually really good there but we only recommend that you use it well if you're training for Mr Olympia let's say we don't recommend you use our AI calorie tracker you could use the food database weigh your on a scale well and the and the scale stuff like I you know I'm I'm a weirdo I've actually used my fitness pal for probably 5 years almost every day now and what a lot of people don't realize is when they eyeball their calories they're probably always off by like 30 or 40% have you ever tried tracking your food Sean yeah actually I think I came on this podcast a while back and I said this exact problem I was like my fitness pal it's so slow and annoying to type in every single thing and estimate the weight of it so okay I'm eating this how many grams of it I don't really know I didn't weigh it out and then you get this calorie thing but also they have like five entries for whatever for for chicken breast even has you don't know which oneck and I I remember even saying I think on this podcast like I wish somebody just had it where you could just take a picture and computer vision would just know and I can't wait for that to happen and it sounds like it's kind of happened so you started this how long ago 10 months ago 10 months okay so 10 months ago you started this as a 17-year-old and can you just give us a sense of the the growth so in in 10 months you started obviously with zero first month roughly where were you at so the first month was a little bit slow to pick up we probably ended having done $30,000 in Revenue the second month and that's when we were testing the waters do people actually want a calorie tracking app the hypothesis was that yeah it would make people's lives easier but we are almost hitting this interesting intersection between people are very hardcore with tracking their calories weighing their food on a scale needing the Precision decimal point accuracy and then on the other end of people that don't track their calories at all so our hypothesis was that there was a middle ground and that's where we threw the capital to test and it worked so then the next month which was June we did our first six figures in a month so okay amazing yeah I mean you're say does he talk like every 16-year-old you you that's you sounded like this right Sean he sounds more mature than us so you you you're saying we is there a uh is there a Wii who's the is it a royal Wii like that's just kind of me and then did you start this with somebody yes I have three co-founders so to give you a breakdown one is also in high school he's our CTO Henry langmack a killer engineer child technology officer yes go keep Blake Anderson who I think you guys actually did an episode about one of his apps UMX so he had founded previously two other apps that had gotten a few million downloads so we partnered up how' you guys meet each other because you're not in the same High School how'd you find these other young Builders yeah so Henry and I met at a coding Camp when we were both 10 years old he lived in Long Island initially but then he moved to New Jersey so we stayed in touch Blake I actually found on Twitter gotcha so you guys get together and who has the idea for the app so it was a mix of Blake and myself I was tracking my calories two years before starting C ey on my fitness pal or at least trying to I was really skinny growing up and I wanted to put on weight put on muscle honestly to impress girls in my high school and it was super tedious so I just gave up but I knew there had to be a better solution the coder and me the engineer and me knew that there must be an easier way and the following 2 years all of these AI models started being released and so after jumping into the app space and talking to Blake who had a very similar path of these AI apps we came to this idea and having a $20 million a year business is a lot cooler I bet than having muscles when when it comes to impressing girls yeah which one works better honestly I thought that once I always had this Vision as a kid that I just need to be successful and all the girls will be on top of me all the time but nothing really changed it's just dudes like us yeah exactly you honestly dude having big muscles it's also just only dudes and buing you so like we're actually still not sure what gets the women to like you we're still trying to figure that out all right so a lot of people watch and listen to the show because they want to hear us just tell them exactly what to do when it comes to starting or growing a business and really a lot of people who are listening they have a full-time job and they want to start something on the side a side hustle now a lot of people message Sean and I and they say all right I want to start something on the side is this a good idea is that a good idea and again what they're really just saying is just give me the ideas well my friends you're in luck so my old company the hustle they put together a h hundred different side hustle ideas and they have appropriately called it the side hustle idea database it's a list of 100 pretty good ideas frankly I went through them they're awesome and it gives you how to start them how to grow them things like that gives you little bit of inspiration so check it out it's called the side hustle idea database it's in the description below you'll see the link click it check it out let me know in the comments what you think can we pull up you posted a video back when you were how old was he in this video that was three years ago I think three years ago so you're like what 14 15 years old the video is titled how I'm going to make $1 million in high school pull this up because I want to get your reaction to this it starts by the way it just with like great video it's an amazing video how many views does this video have I can't see from like 8,000 okay 7,000 views three years ago you posted this you only have a thousand subscribers on YouTube uh I say only I mean I just mean like this video is criminally underrated at the time that's 20 subscribers when I posted this so you could play you could play this uh I don't know if the audio will come through I'm going to make $1 million before graduating high school and this YouTube channel is going to document the whole process here comes the best part the mic the alignment of the text and then watch the microwave what is $1 million it's enough cash to give you a luxury lifestyle it makes life more enjoyable and stressfree it's every kid's dream wow director's cut making $1 million can be broken down for example if you're trying to make it in a year it's just $80,000 a month or $20,000 a week for $3,000 a day all I would need to do is sell $30 $100 items every single day seems easy I'm really making it more simple than it seems but whatever I love this video I love this video on so many levels it's insane I love that you're shooting your shot you're calling your shot I should say right this is Babe Ruth pointing at center field uh so I love that you called your shot I love that you were just having fun with it like you obviously weren't like super polished or like uh you know going back and editing this to try to make it fancy and I love that your your mindset you were like I want to do this and then you sort of broke it down into smaller more digestible chunks right because you can't just make the million dollars in a second you're like I need to make you know $20,000 in a week I need to make $3,000 in a day to do that I got to sell $300 items that seems achievable what was uh can you just tell us what what why did you decide to make that video well from such a young age and I'm not entirely sure where I could pinpoint this but I've always wanted to make massive impact on the world and usually that is parallel with having a lot of monetary success and so my goal was always make a million dollars while in high school part of that was because I was really stressed out about school my parents were super strict about my grades and social studies was the one class I hated I hated that I had to memorize flash cards and I vividly remember one night where I was sitting there trying to memorize these flashcards about explorers that came to the Americas and I was so frustrated I broke down the problem and realized that I'm studying to get a good grade but why why do I want a good grade it's to get into a good college so that I could get a good job and make money and then live a happy life so if I could skip all of those steps it would remove the stress that I'm feeling right now if I can make money right now so I wouldn't need to worry about a job I wouldn't need to stressed and then I set out the goal to do so you're you're not wrong it's the intelligent man's procrastination it's like ah should I study these 15 flashcards or make a million dollars I think I'll make a million dollars instead are your parents entrepreneurs or are they just uh normal the house was nice that's a nice house so my parents have both been lawyers for their career but then recently two years ago my dad left his job at a company to start a financial consulting firm and I always worry people are going to think oh because he started a business that's where all of this came from but I was entrepreneurial and doing things long before he actually left his company to start his do do you like give him tips sometimes I don't you should offer to Angel invest in his company and be his mentor all right so you um Sam any thoughts on that video before we move on from the video it's it's the best you know Sean we brought this up um maybe 6 months ago uh on the on a podcast I don't know if you remember that and it was still like is this kid like is this a joke like does he actually have it and you know how like real is this and we brought that up saying this is amazing if it turns out to be true and it is true times 20 uh it's like absolutely amazing that you've been able to a lot I think at that time it was like a like million dooll ARR app yeah so I think you were probably at something like $80,000 a month yeah now how much revenue are you doing well last month we just did our first $2 million a month wow a24 million pace and what will the the your first 12 months of full business what will the revenue be full business the revenue would have exceeded $10 million from launching in May to coming this Mon and uh is it entirely bootstrapped have you had any outside financing all bootstrapped wow and how many employees I'm just going to like I I'm going to I need to ask a bunch of questions so I understand all the info uh how many employees totally right now we have 15 employees fulltime wow okay that's wow that's a lot so what um how did you get it to work okay so you make an app you're a coder you started coding when you were seven years old or something like that so I believe that you could make an app and it seems like uh let's just do a quick summary on making the app so how did you build this like thing are you basically taking a bunch of AI tools and then sort of uh not saying like you're just like a rapper but like custom uh making custom building them for this use case of tracking calories in an app can you just quickly describe making the app and how long that took you totally so a lot of people do look down on apps like Cal they'll summarize them as just an AI rapper and think that we aren't providing any value and it's true that we started as an AI rapper and I think that that's something all apps should do just like in Ecom it's very common to start as a drop shipper and drop ship a product and then once you find success actually manufacture it yourself store it yourself create your own brand out of that so it's just the proof of concept is the Drop Shipping for us the proof of concept was using chat gbt and other AI tools kind of as a rapper app frankly but then after finding initial success which so the first app the first version very very Bare Bones very very basic we you were able to take a picture of your food it would tell you the calories it would have the daily breakdown that was it one feature and then after we saw that people liked it we started adding more features we had how many people did you have using it to determine that they like it we had so is important to know we've grown all through influencer marketing which is how we've achieved our rapid growth and so after working with two influencers having them post on their stories talking about the app that's when we had the initial feedback and saw that people actually so let's go step by step you make the app app exists who are the first 10 people that say it family and friends is that where you started with or family and friends although we just disregarded anything from them because I always think it's biased okay send it to them they're kind of they say oh it's great you're like all right cool but we don't really know NE next what' you do what' you do next so next we started contacting influencers Fitness influencers on Instagram and Tik Tok did my DM get lost in the mail why did I is this it is this in my other inbox what's going on yeah we'll need to get you on it but we reached out and most people just don't respond it took me over two weeks to get my first response from an influenc give us a sense of the pitch what's the what's the DM say so basically you always want to start at least from what we've tested We've ran a lot of ab tests on this paid promo putting that first the question mark and then jumping into our app let you track calories just by taking a picture of your food we think it would fit your audience and would love to work for you with you if you're interested let us know and we can h on a quick call and so this works really well because it optimizes for that preview message the influencer will see in their inbox they only see the first line or two the PID promo is what sticks out and which influencer uh took what was your who who was it and where' you where'd you get the money right so you're saying paid promo but your kids are you like hey Dad can we get five grand to like seed money to to try this like where' the money come from to start sure so before building Cal I actually built an unblocked Gaming website my freshman year of high school school this website let students play games in class while their teacher was teaching bypassing the website blocking protocols and I grew that to five million users through Tik Tok it was generating money by putting ads on the site and then I sold it so that's where most of the money came in that we put into this by the way Sam that that's now the third or fourth person that's comeing out this podcast who has that same origin story of I was in school they blocked games on our school I'm guessing you guys had like Chromebooks or something like some Compu you know very very oddly Sean it was Val my friend Val who came on and said his his his was doing that now well they went to the same high school oh really s bulky was said that that was his origin story too was he he wanted to find a way to play games while at school and then because of that learned all these different parts of coding and technology in order to make that happen and that was the first taste of money um just ma same thing with gaming servers at school so you had this you figured out all right we have these School laptops people want to play games they're blocked how'd you get around the block and uh and what was this thing called the website was called totally science. and that's how it got categorized as educational that was the main thing but we also had all of these features on the website for example if you pressed the Tia key on the keyboard it would redirect to Google Classroom so if the teacher was coming you could quickly hide it oh nice nice that's crazy hey how can you play this is science not only this is totally science this is only science all right so you you do that that that company uh you sell you were making how much and you sold that for how much it made $60,000 for two years and then I sold it for $100,000 when I was 16 so this is like the first sign you know to have a kid to have your son from your parents perspective do 60 Grand in Revenue in profit you know something like that when they're 14 that's like asking you know like are you a drug dealer what's going on how are you doing this did that take convincing on your end to let them know what you were doing was totally legal like at at any point your parents are lawyers were they like are you breaking any laws man are you are you sure you're uh on top of all this I definitely got questioned about breaking laws by my dad a bunch of times he actually made me put up terms of service that said in all caps you cannot use this while in school this is only for breaks or at home and my mom was always shocked every time I actually got a payout from Google I think maybe it was that it didn't sound like a real business unblocked games website how could that make money but I actually had money coming into my bank account that was under her name because I was too young to open one and she was shocked every time did you do anything cool with it the money well not really honestly I put all of it into CI when we launched it and cool thing the only thing actually that I've spent the money I've made on and this was recent was my 18th birthday party I flew my friends out to Miami for a weekend trip from high school that's awesome all right sweet so you uh you put the money in Cal you got the money you reach out to the influencers you said two influencers start posting and what are they posting is there some science to we just had you know rob the bank on talking about Tik Tok as a distribution strategy about what makes great Tik Tok Hooks and videos and how that game is being played do you know Rob and and I guess how how have you guys played that game of short form content to grow your apps so totally science and CI were a little different for totally science I was the one making the videos myself I was recording my screening class saying hey if you want to play unblock games go to this website and then I would put a little thing a caption that says comment what game to add next and that would gather a ton of comments making the video go viral for CI I'm not the one making videos no one on the team is it's all influencers so we still use the knowledge from well what I learned from totally science to help these influencers make videos and make them go viral to give ideas but for the most part we just pay the influencer that fits our Niche and then they're the professionals they know what goes viral as long as we can predict the RO Y which we have a ton of factors and variables we look at then we let them run with it you pay them on CPM or how do you pay them so CPM would be a blessing and that's the dream for everyone if you could do that because then you guarantee profitability but these influencers they need to be paid usually in advance otherwise they won't do it they'll have another brand that's willing to work with them so you have to predict before they make any video how many views they're going to get yet you have to look at their previous videos but then you also have to keep in mind not all views are worth the same you have to analyze the comment section and see how strong their Community is and based on that weigh how much you're actually going to pay them that's wild so you um is this thing pretty sticky and and where do you want to take this so great you you you go viral you get people to download I'm assuming they hit some pay wall in the app that says keep track of all your calories blah blah blah is it kind of one of these churn and Burn games where it's pretty profitable for the first couple months and then you you lose people or is it a sticky product so it's sticky for the power users they definitely stay around and I mean apps like my fitness pal they're doing over $100 million a year so I know we could get there you uh look at the reviews Sean so he has 65,000 reviews and it's a 4.8 out of five so this isn't like an Arbitrage like or like a get-rich quick thing like people really love the product yeah what's the churn on these uh subscriptions we actually don't know because it hasn't been a year and more than 95% of our subscriptions are annual gotcha okay but they're still using it presumably so that you know if they're using it they'll they'll stick with it wow this is amazing and so you want to take this to be kind of my fitness pal or you're like hey if somebody offered us you know a buttload of cash like I guess what's your mindset because I'm so curious because if I was 18 years old I don't know what the hell I'd be thinking like I have no I even now I'm 36 years old I still don't really know what the hell I'd be thinking in this position what what's the mindset of an 18-year-old cuz you got many hits in you you know this may not be the only one the same way that you kind of did this a similar thing in totally science versus this but this just had a much bigger Market much more Market potential um you know you might be able to do even more things or is this something you want to do for a decade yeah and does it feel like you're still breaking the law like if you if anyone well like if I don't mean that stop breaking the law what are you talking about no what I mean is like when you go Z to $20 million in Revenue in8 months there's some type of like gness of like I can't believe like this is my life I can't believe that this is allowed I don't know there's something there's some type of like Matrix breaking idea where you're like questioning you're like how is this possible do you still have that mentality or are you like of course this is possible and this is just step one I definitely have the mentality of it feels surreal I mean it feels nuts I'm 18 years old and I'm making the company's going to generate over $24 million this year that's crazy the fact that I'm on your podcast my first million saying that it's nuts and a year ago I wouldn't believe it so I view this as a stepping stone I want to build a company that touches the lives of billions of people something as ubiquitous as the iPhone and I think CI if we shifted the idea where maybe it's nutrition tracking in general and we could link the photos of what you're eating to your health that could be something that touches the lives of billions and that could be something I could spend a decade on but I probably don't want to instead I would want this to be something that sets me financially free where I don't need to think about money where I'm not incentivized by generating revenue and so I can start another company that is purely motivated by impa and scale of impact something that I'm passionate about and can spend a couple decades on Sam I saw a post today from his partner Blake he posted something on on on Twitter today and he said I guess he's working on something called 10x and it sounds like it's an app for for learning like oh you can learn anything you can learn AI skills you can learn a language you can learn whatever sounds like it's a a learning tool which is more in the direction of kind of good for the world good for Humanity impact style uh thing that he's building and so it sounds like he's kind of look you he started with like umax which was literally like probably the most superficial thing it's like how does my face look and what what can I do to make my face look better then it's C ey and now he's going into like you know a learning tool it sounds like you might want to do the same was there something that triggered that in you like did you watch like a movie or did you have like a conversation with a mentor when you were 12 years old like what made you want to even what made you think differently than the average high schooler who's hyperfocused on just their grades and and you know just making friends or whatever whatever is just in their little pond it's funny you say movie The Social Network totally had a big impact on me however I did also feel this way before that so that Amplified it that showed me it's possible through specifically software which made me super motivated to learn coding even faster but I have I'm not sure the initial Seed where it was planted what do you think the app is worth right now right now now I think the app calculating its or taking its growth into account is close to $100 million in valuation which means you are presumably worth in the ballpark of $30 million I think liquid and on paper is really different oh I know but like but you're you're totally right but like 17 18 years old worth tens of millions of dollars I think is like a fair ballpark would you agree I would agree yeah that's amazing man congratulations I I I'm really I'm really inspired by you and I would say there's like a a handful of people I've discovered that are kind of like you who are super young that are basically AI first so you're all the tools You're Building you build with AI because why would you not you like code them with AI the app uses AI the users get an AI type of experience and um you figured out a growth Channel that I think a bunch of old guys like us kind of suck at cuz you have what I call the bear on a bicycle phenomenon so my friend Chris Williamson said this to me he goes you basically want to stack two skills that usually don't go together and it creates something remarkable so you know you see a bear wow that's a bear okay but I've seen Bears you see your you see a bicycle okay that's a bicycle but you see a bear on a bicycle holy [ __ ] never seen that before that's amazing and for you that's basically like you know how to code but a lot of kids know how to code and it's this other piece that you also had which was the knowledge of and you even said it in your video video editing and just making fun videos um this kind of the Tik Tok knowledge and you combined how to make Tik toks that will get views with how to make apps that work and that is your be on a bicycle thing and so I'm pretty inspired because there's actually like a group of people who are just like you and I would say right now is like a very golden window for that group of people to go build things like and you know hopefully people listening to hopefully there's you know we trigger another 20 to 100 people just like you who hear this story and are like you're their social network right they're going to hear this and they're going to start doing it and that set of skills I think is very very valuable for this moment in time I totally agree and that's honestly why I'm super motivated to go on podcasts like these I was super motivated by others before me that I've watched on podcasts and so this is almost a full circle moment for me to come on here yeah that's interesting Sam would you be going on podcast because like you know while you're here I'm like oh this is great content I'm excited but then there's like the fatherly part of me that's like shut up dude just shut up why are you on the podcast you shouldn't be saying any of this stuff cuz you have such a good thing going and uh you could always tell the story a little later you don't need to invite you know the other uh Zach yagari of the world who are you know they can code they can make Tik toks they got cool haircuts like you and they're just going to do the same thing right so like why go on and and and spill your secrets um you know why do that so I've heard this before that usually you know what it takes or people usually know what it takes to be successful but then they are looking for an easier way they're looking for something that is not as burden some not as hard doesn't require as much sacrifice and I've been coding since I was seven I made now that's 11 years of coding I've started totally science and before that I was tutoring kids in coding lessons for almost a decade of my life I was in the entrepreneur game and so I think that yes I can share all of this information publicly but it's only a select few who will actually work towards it and put in the amount of hours required to achieve the result where I want to help those people I think helping those people achieve the same success especially if they were in a situation like mine where they maybe weren't entirely sure where to go but they knew there was a world out there where they could have massive impact at such a young age even balancing school on the side and so I completely support those people you have um a trait that uh like sha and I's good buddy Jack Smith is like the perfect embodiment of this trait um but a lot of entrepreneurs which is your logical which like a lot of times will be awkward on like day-to-day level like for example my friend Jack is like he's so he'll he he does things so differently from everyone because his way is actually better but we've all done it in such a way for 100 plus years that we're like well I don't know we just do it this way and so like for example he didn't name his daughter uh the first year because he was like I get to I have to get to know her before I can name her and I was like yeah that makes total sense it's just like strange to think about you have that type of energy you know you said well I'm worrying about grade so I can get a good job or get into a good college to get a good job and make good money what if I just make money now like that's like very that that way of thinking is is amazing and it's really fun to be around people like you and so I want to hear your perspective on a few things this fresh thinking on a few things the first is you have 15 employees do you have any employees who are in their 30s or 40s and what's it like having to go from being just you and your buddies in a room messing around to at 15 people you're actually running a real company so yes we do have employees that are in their 40s and it's difficult to be honest with you it's hard at times to to make them call you sir yeah I do not make them call me sir but it is difficult especially when I have to fire someone that has kids and it C I do have impostor syndrome at times which is something I try to not let hold me back ever so even if I think a certain way I don't I still act how I know I should I'm reading this great book right now called the Great CEO within I also keep it on my desk as a reminder and it helps me lead I try to be an inspiring leader that that helps people that doesn't lead by telling people what to do and just do it now I try to inspire them to want to do work do your does your staff uh gen are you guys a well organized company you think or is it a [ __ ] show I think that we are pretty well organized and that's mainly credited to our coo and the third co-founder I didn't mention Jake Castillo he's really good at organization so one of the things we talked about was like you know why come and talk about this and part of you was like well I want to inspire other people but we don't want to inspire just a bunch of copycats and so we asked do we like hey what are some other ideas that if you weren't doing this you think somebody could go do right now so how can the next you how can the next high schooler get to where you're at $20 million a year in Revenue as a 17 18 year old so what ideas do you have for us sure so obviously you know you could teach a man to fish or you could give a man a fish teaching is better so I have a few Frameworks which I think will help even more but I also will give some ideas okay go for so how I usually look at these AI problems or not AI problems but creating something new in general is that AI has enabled people to basically build on top of and innovate on any tool or company that exists right now so the calendar was innovated on and now there are AI calendar tools like motion which help you organize and structure your day a lot easier your assistant there are note taking tools where people have always taken notes by hand people have also recorded lectures but now there are AI platforms like turbo learn AI where you can record your lecture and then the AI will generate notes for you calorie tracking there have always been calorie trackers but now with AI you can just take a picture of your food and it will tell you the calories so I try to look at everything that doesn't already use Ai and think can AI make this more efficient make this a better better process and my perspective on coming up with new ideas is generally that I want to find something looking at it from marketing first principles is how I always think so almost going backwards and I look for an aha moment that I could capture within some sort of experience and then wrap a whole app around that so for Cal aha moment is take a picture of your food get the calories and that's great for marketing material they come on they do that but then there's a whole app around that that gets them to stay there's another app on the app store right now called Fitness Ai and their ads recently have been around their AI body scanner where you just take a picture of your body and then it will tell you your body fat percentage and a ton of other use information on your composition so that's what draws people in it's that AI tool which is the aha moment and then there's a whole fitness app around that you stay to track your workouts on that app so that's the framework I generally like to use and so what what do you think is H so you're saying work backwards from the the magic moment where AI does a magic trick and you're like holy [ __ ] that's cool and then build a sticky you know for you guys just take a picture get the calories and then you have the tracking and the charts and the other stuff that's going to keep them maybe the coaching tips or whatever that's going to keep them around in the long term cool got it and you're the other thing you're saying is take any app that's popular that we've already been doing that and to say what's the AI version of this is that the is that the brainstorming session you would do is basically like all right Evernote what's the AI ver version of Evernote or um yes you know our buddy in our buddy um in San Francisco me and in Sam's ca he had this company called study soup and study soup was literally for college kids they would have paid note takers who would take great notes in a lecture and then you had you basically the Slackers and you had the kids that were were on top of things kids on top of things were the supply side of the marketplace they would give their notes and the Slackers would buy their notes and so oh cool I I don't have to take notes in this class because I'm getting them done for me and you're saying you you're basically saying that turone has become an AI version of study soup right where it's like someone records it and now you have uh you have you have well well taken AI notes for your for that class yeah exactly so what are some examp yeah so here's an idea I've actually seen something like this or recently on Twitter I saw something blow maybe it was a couple months ago not so recent where someone put a bunch of their journal entries into chat gbt and then asked what are some insights you could give me to make my life better you and I both do that yeah well that's great so I think there is the possibility and I think this would be a great idea to build a journal app and these Journal apps already exist so so take an existing one put your and this is the spin so you could make it voice notes you can make it typing whatever doesn't matter but the key feature the aha moment AI feature you implement is that periodically you will have these insights generated from the AI on how you can improve your life like hey on Monday and Tuesday you hung out with Sally and you had a bad day maybe Sally is the cause of your bad days gotcha okay I like that uh so AI Journal uh I feel like with uh the kind of younger generation I feel like therapy is a lot more normalized therapy's cool basically whereas in my my generation and my parent my parents generation was like therapy equals you're broken you're you have a problem and it was like you know more taboo the whole s the whole idea of Sopranos was a guy who goes to therapy and now his friends are going to murder him because he's so soft yeah exactly and now I feel like with the younger generation it's almost like uh a cool thing to do I don't maybe I'm speaking out my ass here you tell me if I'm wrong uh but it's way more normalized it's not not a taboo thing and in fact probably being anti- therapy would be a little bit low status now at this point um and I feel like what the problem with therapy of course is that um it's a a little bit of a loaded word and B you know who's paying $100 a session for this stu stuff when you could have the AI therapist in your pocket whether they're using your journal entries as the starting point the magic moment or or not uh what do you think of that space you think think there's something interesting there I think AI therapists are something that a lot of people have spoken about and I haven't seen anyone do it great there are definitely apps already where you could talk to people chat Bots but I think they're all missing the feeling that you are actually being heard that the feeling you would get talking to a real therapist so maybe it's the verbal aspect that's missing and something like chat gbt's voice mode integrating that can now actually make it a better session than just typing but that is a good idea that uses the AI spin for sure gotcha and what what are some other ideas you have you have two more it looked like you wrote on here yeah so the first one is some kind of system or pipeline to convert an Android app or an IOS app to the other and this is something that would greatly help startups when we started C we built it on Swift and that's because Swift usually you could make a much smoother user experience on iPhones using something like react native which can build to both IOS and Android it's more difficult because it's not actually using the native components to make something that feels super polished on an iPhone after building it we had all of this demand for an Android app and it was problematic we had to take away from development time on the IOS app to build out the Android app and we had to release it a few months after it was it costed us thousands of dollars tens of thousands of dollars and every time you build a feature you have to build it twice you have to build it on one and then on the other yes every single time so it's annoying I think with all these AI tools there is definitely the possibility to build something that lets you upload the codebase to one native project and then it will convert it to the other now right now I think AI can probably do 90% of the work but there will need to be a tiny bit of human intervention so maybe this would be best done as an agency that's very AI powered at the moment but very soon it's going to be something where an AI agent can do it all for you yeah that's a really good idea we used to use something uh I I had an app like years ago a roommates app uh roommate finding app and we what was it called where we use something that turned a web app into an iPhone app I mean there's been a lot of tools like that and they were horrible like it was like it was really bad but they were huge companies yeah yeah yeah because this is a problem right like you you have to maintain two different two different two every feature you have to build twice every every platform has its own bugs and you basically have to hire double the number of people cuz the Android guy focused on Android the iOS guy focused on iOS and so now you have more headcount and so you always want this thing that's like but but you need but still you're you're right like having it be native actually results in a better user experience more stickiness more Revenue Etc so if you try to do the web app thing and you just put a web app and you try to wrap it it doesn't work as well as doing a native app and so you're right that basically AI coding is getting so good that you could do 70 80 90% of the code transfer just through Ai and then maybe you you have you you do it as an agency or you have one person who's who's doing that last kind of The Last Mile to get it to work work well um that's cool what about this remotely configurable onboarding flows this sounds like to use a framework you know it's a paper cut you have right so one of some of the best places to find startup ideas is you're you're trying to do a startup and in the process of trying to do it you run into something that's like God I wish somebody had just built this and maybe you build it in house or you just keep dealing with the pain and that that's a very good source for startup ideas yes I have heard that a piece of advice to work at a startup to come up with new ideas and it's 100% true so while working on Cal and then a few other apps before CI while I was learning how the whole consumer app space works every app you have to build out the onboarding flow every popular app on the app store has one It generally will ask the questions that are either required to set up your account or simply to Prime you for what's coming to to explain something that's going on in the app or to ask you questions that set your mind in the right direction to maybe help you convert when they actually hit you hit you with a pay wall and there is no good solution right now to build these everyone has to do it custom in their own code base but someone could really easily make a system where anyone can swap out the questions remotely do ab tests on these which another problem here is that anytime you want to test out something new within your onboarding flow or within your app in general you have to submit an update to the app store which could take a few days so building out a system where you can build out the whole onboarding survey questions and then also change what the screens are see how that affects conversion rate see how that affects completion rate drop off rate remotely would be huge are you uh the type of person that even though you have a full-time gig you are experimenting on new ideas that are unrelated to CI so for the last few months I kind of was we were orienting ourselves as an app Studio very briefly and the idea behind that was that our real sauce was in our marketing not in our app development and so we could build a bunch of these other AI apps spin them up apply the same marketing and blow them up really fast but at the scale CI is and the rate it's growing we realized pretty quickly that it made more sense to stay full-time on CI because the same time it would take to build another app and scale it to six figures Revenue we could have added an additional seven figures in Revenue to CI just because everything boosts each other increasing retention will increase LTV and as we increase retention we could increase a funnel so one plus one can equal three instead of two I think that is totally the right move is there anything Zach you know Sean and I are parents and there's a lot of people who listen to this who who are parents is there anything that you you you seem traditionally obviously you're traditionally successful but you also seem like uh you're very thoughtful I think spoken thoughtful like you seem like you'd be a good son regardless of uh regardless of if you who cares about this app you know like you you you you you're you have your [ __ ] together at a very young age emotionally what do you think that your parents did that set you up to have this success or do you think that and this sounds like a douchy thing to say were you just born you know interested into this stuff at a young age you know like there's a lot of like self-directed people I have four siblings I am the second oldest and from a young age I I was very wired to want freedom and I think it be I think it comes from my siblings if I wanted to buy something my parents would have to buy something for all my siblings so they wouldn't do it I would have to find the way to pay for it myself that's what made me start teaching coding lessons at such a young age to earn money and related to that I actually have a story that when I was 10 years old I wanted to cook scrambled eggs by myself I don't know what it was but I really wanted Independence and freedom so the independence to just cook myself breakfast at 10:00 could have burned the house down so my mom didn't let me and I got so mad about this that she didn't trust me to cook eggs on my own because she was taking care of my other siblings getting them ready for school that I actually ran away from my house and I ran probably 15 minutes from my house to a local soccer field and the police were called I actually got picked up by them and brought back home I was going to come home eventually but you know I did run away and it's really been the freedom that has been the driving force behind everything the Yearning For Freedom well but you have that now somewhat I still feel confined Honestly by being in high school I haven't dropped out and I want to go to college just for the social life not obviously to get a job so I feel I I always feel almost trapped in situations where the outcome is determinant on what someone else decides for me not something that I can control for myself and someone has to accept me into the college if I let my grades drop in high school then they could resend me even if I get into the school and I hate that but right now for the next year at least I think I have to make that sacrifice and then when I'm in college I want to make a good group of friends then drop out be free You're Gonna Go what's your GPA right now my GPA is a 4.0 and I do want to go did you get the yeah yeah so I took the ACT and I got a 34 okay that's I think right yeah it's like a that's two points away from per that's like a 90 that's a 99 percentile 98 percentile okay so you're you're you haven't like neglected school you got a 4.0 and you AC doing this with school I'm working hard in school I'm not by the way it's it's it's noon on a Monday where where where are you right now I actually skipped class to do this podcast let's go sorry Miss bicker staff the boys are calling are you at school right now or are you home no I left school I'm home right now and you told your parents it's because there's this podcast that I want to go on and it's going to be good for business yeah yeah how many other people do you know that are like you like is there a community of like a hundred of you guys who are like high schoolers who actually build [ __ ] and want to do cool things there's not that many high schoolers but there are people who are slightly older 1920 I probably look at how he's already got the Mastermind hand pose he already has divisionary hand hand position naturally dude straight out the box I have a handful of people that I'm friends with but not many definitely not you guys have a club can you have a name you like the grubs yeah yeah it's the cool kids club that's it it's you guys are pretty cool uh so it's a good always wanted to be in yeah I've always wanted to be one of the I've always wanted to be part of that uh if you need another member let me know um have you considered just like moving to palto and like hanging out like you know in the movie uh The Social Network Shan Parker gets to act like a college kid without go to college or are you dead set on going the uh going that route well over the summer when things started taking off in June for CI Henry and I decided let's go all in we moved to San Francisco for the whole month of July we lived in a hacker house we worked out of a co-working office with people years older than us so we lived the San Francisco startup life it was very productive but at the same time pretty lonely although we could talk to some people yeah we made friends we would get lunch with people first of all San Francisco is not the most fun city but also just the fact that people were years older than us always made it difficult to relate to that yeah that makes sense we had a I have a friend that uh like he got accepted into some program where he went to college at the age of 14 or 15 and he was telling me he was like man like I wanted to like date girls and like you know do that normal [ __ ] and it was weird I started fooling around with one girl and I eventually had to break it with her that I was fill her in that I'm like I'm I'm 16 uh and so like I imagine like it's weird being in these situations where you're like in these you're just as mature as you're more mature than a lot of 21y olds or a lot of like grown adults but you're in this situation where I do understand why you feel trapped you're in these weird spots at such a young age that like you literally couldn't go and do some of the stuff in San Francisco that everyone else is doing because of your age but it's pretty amazing like I hope you enjoy like the time like I mean I think being 18 and experiencing what you're doing it's like this is like you know one out of a billion this is like a really special thing how much are you paying yourself so we haven't paid ourselves anything we are reinvesting it all and that's not to say that we won't we are we do have profit every month it is a difficult situation with the app store because we get paid out two months after we earn the money so our growth is so quick that the revenue we generated two months ago we have to put it all in the marketing to keep growing faster and faster I think in a months we may start having a surplus where we can't spend it on growth even if we wanted to yeah that's great um dude this is awesome man congratulations and uh I'm excited to see what happens who who are like who do you admire who are you who are you learning from and looking up to like who's who's inspiring you are you just like oh Elon and Jeff Bezos that's what I that's what I care about or are there other people that you're more interested in uh personally like you said you used to listen to podcast as inspiration who are some of those people that you like to listen to totally so I love your guys's podcast it's I'm more inspired by people who are dead than people who are alive and maybe that's because I feel like there's they're not my competition anymore or they are but they're not progressing anymore so I see exactly where they ended up but psycho love it yeah I get it you sick [ __ ] makes sense they're not my competition anymore I've already finished them yeah people like think kill us Sam think he just threatened us lowy okay so you like learning from dead people what does that mean books what what how you learn from dead people I like audio books but I don't actually like reading physical books I also like learning about them from podcasts which dead people oh so like Founders you like the David CRA podcast Founders it's one of my favorites I do listen to that there's one I've listened to to recently how to take over the world which boy Ben let's go so let me ask you a question what what's a thing that people your age are doing that seems weird to us but it's totally normal so like what's a phenomenon that you're like yeah kids love doing this they spend all this time doing this or they spend their money on this or this is a new trend that seems to be weird to others but we get it it's it's normal for us yeah is by the way is wearing uh Ralph Lauren Ralph Lauren polo sweaters is that a new trend that young people I think you've influenced Sam yeah it's a great sweater yeah sorry go ahead with uh what cool young people are doing so there's something really interesting a really interesting phenomenon I've seen recently and it's not a new software it's not a new social media platform what it is is these little things you put on the back of your phone it's called an octob buddy octob buddy and it has suction cups on it so you could stick your phone to a wall you could prop it up on your table and watch videos is the purpose I don't think people actually I've never seen someone actually use the suction cups how they're designed to but it's a trend among all girls in my high school I've over the last few months I've Just Seen more and more people have it now everyone does and it's it's fascinating something it's like a TV mount you mount your you can mount your phone to any any surface basically and what it's not used how it's supposed to be isn't that what it's supposed to be well I think it's more of something where now girls look at it like the color of their nails or having long nails on where girls get different colors and oh it access stylistic accessory status thing than actually function keep going tell me what young people like like whenever I meet a young guy I'm like tell me everything well that's the main thing that you wouldn't typically notice are your friends drinking yes definitely it's big you like the party do you do you guys like to smoke weed I'm someone who doesn't do any drugs I'm pretty against them and I don't drink either but it's I mean everyone around me is so drinking is common very common very very common you also mentioned this uh this like turbo learn thing that sounds pretty awesome what else is like uh what other uh who else is like you out there who's who's basically scaling up to millions in Revenue just off of this kind of like AI Tik Tock type of model so there are a bunch of consumer apps that are coming out or have come out and honestly I think a lot of it is attributed to Blake and I speaking publicly about this showing that it's really possible in the app space so new apps like quitter which is an app designed to help men quit porn with all of these little social or like by having streaks essentially to gamify the whole experience so that's a new one that just came out you inspired these guys I'm friends with the founder and he was inspired to get into the app Space by seeing c i really take off he was with me in the early days that's cool it's got 5,000 5,000 reviews on on iPhone that's pretty good yeah so they're on track to make over a million dollars this year I think consumer apps right now are like the new Drop Shipping you know uh Sean had said this once where he was like you know Sean was like I'm a content creator you know he's got newsletters and Twitter and podcasts but these Tik Tok guys it's as if you know I am really good at riding horses but Along Comes Henry Ford and it just it's just the cars are no comparison you know I can't there's no way my horse and I are going to outrun uh even the the crappiest car this is one of those moments that I'm having right now talking to you uh so like for a long time Sean and I are friends will do Drop Shipping you know when we were 25 that was the thing is like create Like A Drop Shipping site and people still do things like that seeing what you're doing with tech and influencers is so much better than like you even look Mr you even make Mr Beast look old you know what I mean like chocolate like what that's crazy make you know what I mean but but dude people used to look at me and Sam when we were like so we met when we were I was probably 24 25 years old we were the prodigies and it was like that's very generous but what I mean is like it'd be like if there was something on the On The Fringe or the edge about either growth hacking or a clever way to make money usually it was us who knew it and people would ask us about it like I remember having like the Atlantic the publisher come to my office and they're like newsletters and I'm like yeah like it's a thing that's old news now these guys are so much better and we are that person now I'm going to go to his office and be like just tell me everything it's something that always happens it's going to happen to me too I know that every year I age I am becoming exponentially less impressive and there's someone that's going to come and be the next big thing the growth hacker that is in the front of everything I think it's just about building momentum and I'm pretty obsessed with this idea of making sure that everything I work on will 10x the previous thing so that I'm always moving forward towards a bigger goal you actually mention Mr Beast he's actually someone who greatly inspires me I love the podcast that you guys had with him by the way I've heard this now a couple times from people who are like 18 and they're like fearful that when they're 22 suddenly their accomplishments are no longer cool and I just want to say I get it makes total sense it's also total nonsense and what I mean by that is not only is it still super impressive but the real game is when you stop trying to impress people and so what actually happens is you graduate out of the I need to impress people phase and the person who's 17 18 there're still getting that high of of being the impressive person oh everybody's kind of patting on the back and actually the the the the only way to win the game is not to continuously be the youngest best looking richest person because you'll never win that game of comparison the only real way to win the game is to realize like oh I just need to be doing the things that are fun for me and like the the act of doing them is rewarding and not look for the rewards of impressing people which is obviously easier said than done but that's the real thing to focus on and not like this feel of I'm I'm running on quicksand you know because it's I'm getting older oh no or like uh I have to 10x my growth even though I'm already at you know 24 million AR it's like sure that's all fine I don't I'm not against growth but um somebody said this to us actually they said this while we were hanging out with Mr Beast they go be very careful because growth for growth sake is the ideology of a cancer cell and um so you know growth for growth sake is not not not where it's at and there's there's more to the game than that and he's like I'll leave you with that to kind of figure out what what what is the answer I'm not going to sort of try to tell you what I think is right but I'll point that out because I think for me when I was young and I know for a lot of ambitious people it just seems like grow grow grow grow grow it's the only thing and it comes from a little bit of a uh I don't know like a little bit of a place of anxiety I think right yes and I've had this a similar thought to this where I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing I thought okay once I find my success and let's say I'm quote unquote financially Free Will I even want to start something new or will I not care anymore and just want to find happiness elsewhere maybe I have one of the tenants of Happiness which is I'm financially taken care of but then I want to prioritize relationships and happiness and other aspects so you're always going to be making stuff I I I'll predict the future maybe maybe you'll take the foot off the gas and want relationships and a family and all that stuff you are going to be creating stuff for a very very long time well that is why I'm going to college it's almost to take my foot off the gas a little bit build relationships and then I want to drop out after a semester or two I mean I think that's really smart because you have your whole life to make money but you really only have this four years to make lifelong friends uh from college so actually the the scarce thing is the f is the friendships and that college experience because that there's a window of time that expires and so do that because you still have 50 years to make money um after that what school do you want to go to if I got in then Stanford is likely the top surely we have listeners this is going to reach a lot of people surely there are some some people I know you're listening yagari y a d h yeah you can find him on Twitter DM him uh actually that's that's what they should do a real if I'm if I'm at a right now I'm dming this kid an acceptance letter that's how a college needs to hustle I'm tired of these colle someone's going to be like sup you're just going to get a DM from uh the Su who who's your favorite uh who are your most inspirational follows on Twitter uh I want to I want to basically I find you so fascinated I want to be inspired by the people your yeah yeah yeah I want your info diet who uh who do you inspired by and try to make it people who you think I won't know okay who do I follow I actually don't usually use Twitter for people I'm inspired by that's interesting what what's your like main social network what what do you use when you're bored what do you open up it is Twitter it is Twitter that is my main social network when I'm looking to be inspired there are definitely a few people David Goggins for example he just pumps me up so I have people like him that you know inspired by his mindset completely I used to actually be in this phase where I was addicted to motivational content I curated my Tik Tok for you page I only liked motivational videos and anytime I lost motivation I would just scroll for five minutes then get back into it so definitely those kinds of people but it's mainly those like Mr Beast Elon Musk I follow both of those on Twitter my own co-founder Blake Anderson who's a few years ahead of me in life and knowledge too so definitely learn a lot from him Cliff whitesman he's a recent friend of mine I think one of you know him yeah yeah we know Cliff yeah so he's super inspiring to myself as well that's dope uh okay amazing Sam anything else is there that's don't ask me Zach is there anything else that you want to inspire me by like you're you're you're amazing like uh anything else that you want to tell us yeah did we miss anything I appreciate that I mean it's always hard going on these podcasts like it's it's a whole full circle moment and also it feels almost bad speaking about all this I try to stay humble but then at the same time I know you have to speak your way into the world if I wasn't posting anything publicly I've had a lot of debate over the personal brand then I wouldn't have so many opportunities that I have had I uh Sean my one of my best buddies Val uh I think Zach asked him out to lunch or something the other day uh like the other day and like was this asking him for advice on maybe coming on this podcast but also business advice because Val's uh a great guy and really successful and uh I thought it was funny because actually you remind me of Val a lot Zack but it was funny apparently Val's kids were like were you hanging out with our friend Zach uh like at lunch the other day and he was like yeah but it was like a very you know oddly a business context uh but anyway Val called me and was like this guy Zach is one of the most impressive people I've ever met and Val is a very hard person to impress he's pretty lowkey and so well one of the funny things is like you have this Paradox because you you want to keep your asset your asset is you're young and ignorance is bliss you don't know how hard some things are you don't know what's possible you don't have a ceiling on anything because you don't know any better right and that ignorance is a is a real tool that navity The Beginner's mind and so you want to keep that and on the other side you have this giant problem which is that there's always kind of like this um I forgot what they call it but there's this three three known thing right it's like there's the things you know you know there's the things you know you don't know but then the the real one that matters is the things you don't know that you don't know and and so talking to whatever smarter people people who have played the game for 15 20 years they will help you surface that last one and that that last area of things you don't you don't currently even know that you don't know that's the thing you should be worried about but how do you worry about it you don't even know you don't know where to look um but it's by talking to other smart people that that gets revealed to you and so you have this Paradox where you want to keep what you got as your big asset your naive your beginner's mind your your your your useful ignorance but at the same time um talk to some well-meaning people who are a little bit wiser to try to get figure out like you know um little little a little bit of a a push in One Direction or the other they'll kind of nudge you and that little nudge can totally change your trajectory right cuz like I mean just imagine hitting a golf ball and even just changing by 2 mm the angle that you hit that ball it ends up in a totally different spot so you want to find those people who are your your 2mm people the people that would just give you that slight angle adjustment in order to make it happen I don't know how you do that exactly the keep both of those but that's what I would do if I was you I try to find a way to keep both I totally agree I have heard that that it's much easier to learn from from someone 10 steps ahead of you then 100 steps ahead of you 100 steps so much is missing but 10 you can piece together they can lift you up this the extra steps and help you get from zero to 10 yeah and one other thing you're got to figure out is that um all successful people do not have equally valuable advice so you will meet a lot of people who are successful or sound interesting um but their advice is not great and you the hard part is figureing out how to parse it and dis like dissociate it slightly from the result because their result might be totally dependent on the context Lu there's a whole bunch of different variables uh that will lead to that or maybe just their understanding of your situation and so trying to figure out how to parse advice is like an underrated skill and and make sure that the people you take advice from that they're actually happy and they're people and they're they're people you admire or happy for themselves and they're happy for you you know yeah like you'd want their life it's a very good point all right well on that point let's call it a let's call it a day I think you got to go back to cool now yeah lunch is over hey thank you Zach uh you're the man uh anytime you want to come on please let us know congrats dude thank you for adding me and I'm gonna I'm gonna use the app so I'm gonna download your app right now start track yeah thank you and uh that's it that's the [Music] pod for

screw Nick Huber talking about RV parks and storage units we're going to be talking about flea markets that's what I think is going to [Music] happen I want to talk to you about a topic and I think this is a topic it it's my passion this topic but it's also I'm going to bring it up because I think it's a a trend and that's what we're about and b i it's sort of a prediction I I I think I have a prediction here and it's going to be like be interesting in the next five and 10 years okay sweaters denim tobacco yeah you're in the ballpark media yeah we're in we're in the zip code we're definitely industry we we're in the we're in the zip code so years ago uh this doesn't matter to you because you're not from the South but if you're above the age of 30 a lot of people here probably remember this TV show American Pickers do did you ever even watch that show never watched it okay two guys who go and buy junk they tell the story uh of the junk and then we from storage containers so that's a different show that's a different show but again same ballpark but basically they would drive around the South they would knock on old people's homes and say can I come and look in your barn and they would find old cool stuff tell the story of it clean it up just a little bit bring it back to the store where I worked and we would resell it that's basically it that was that's all it is uh but we would have lines out the door because at the time this show we were it was like David Letterman was number one and then like American Pickers was number two in terms of the the most watch shows on TV there'd be days where we would sell I'm not exaggerating $100,000 in American Pickers T-shirts because all these guys would come in and want to buy anything that was American Pickers related how much revenue do you think that store did overall I would imagine uh $10 million one location one location big store or just like a normal shop it was so small that we had a script to let people to people would come in and be so disappointed at how small it was cuz they would think it was like this big like cuz the cameras made it look huge like sounds familiar to my life I I do had a [Laughter] script uh so it it was like a tidy store but we killed it but I experienced something that but the thing was is that it was all like Hillbillies it was like redneck hillbillies from like Alabama for some reason the picking culture it's all like Hillbillies in like rural Alabama like how you said for some reason I think yeah I don't know like cuz they like old [ __ ] or they like the ReUse stuff I don't know is part of the culture but this this weekend I experienced something that has totally changed my worldview on this topic so there's this thing called alargo Marketplace and I went to it the other day so the story is basically it's these four guys and they're they look like they're 24 years old and they started organizing this flea market in New York City and they host it at this place called new house which is like the hipper version of Wei work so it's this like weird combination of like urban New York stuff but like flea markets which are historically like old people and Southern like Heritage like it's it's not like a New York cool kid thing it is now though all right can I just describe what I'm seeing describe what what you see and who you see every photo looks like it's taken with the Polaroid even though we have like 4K cameras I mean the style is collected there's a DJ it looks like is this a party in a Goodwill shop is that what's happening dude it's a high-end vintage flea market and it was packed and I'm 35 I was the oldest person there there's a lot of weird stuff going on and when you and they're all wearing it's all like 24-year-old single guys wearing suits and ties I went there with my daughter and it was just me and her I was I felt like I was the oldest person there no one had children you took your daughter to this we were just like hanging out for the day and I like I was like let's go to the [ __ ] flea market and it was like Adam Sandler and Big Daddy yeah dude we more we wore matching sweaters we were we we were the hit we we made the uh the Instagram of these guys but they built this flea market and it was packed it was like like it was like I was like regretting bringing her because I was like dude this is way too packed and I can't even get around so we didn't even stay for that long but it kind of got me thinking about flea markets because I think that like have you noticed that by the way that like Millennial hipsters have just disappeared they're just gone they're no longer a thing anymore Hiers I'm just like where' they go uh do you have a theory these are the new hipsters PE young people who wear uh like Nice Clothing like this and are into vintage this is the new version who doing this there's like a branding genius look at these posters just like this is just so well done like how do you turn this just shows you can make anything anything can be done anyway you can make a sandwich Gourmet you can make a sandwich terrible you can make a flea market cool and you can make a cool thing feel like a flea market like this is all this is so well executed as far as The Branding goes it's unbelievable like this thing the Instagram looks like a magazine is it unbelievable all right my friends so a lot of you guys who listen to the show you listen because you want to start a company but you're not sure what idea to choose or you may not even have an idea and you like our podcast my first million because we've done a lot of the work for you on researching all these business ideas well my friends we've made life a lot easier for you because HubSpot they just put together an entire list of all the resources that you can use to find a market opportunity to validate for your next business idea so if you're looking for a market size calculator or tools to identify market trends or a huge list of ideas to get started so if you're interested there's a link below click it and you could have access to the whole thing it's completely free now back to the show but here's the thing this is why I'm bringing this up it isn't just these guys so go to the Instagram it's uh if you're listening it's called Al Fargo's Marketplace and look at the photos of of the whoever you see that's a stylish young man click their Pro and their tag click their profile tons of them tons and tons of them have 100 200 300,000 followers and it's these like young 23y old guys showing off their outfits and the engagement on these Instagram handles it's insane so go to uh the handle is Denny 623 dude what a big day for Denny he had no idea this was going to happen for him so look at Denny all right Denny wow cowboy hat flare just he's wearing Chris Saka shirt uh but the rest is is fantastic all right 112,000 followers he's a digital Creator a men's were blogger content creator since' 08 oh my God he's been in the game he's a creative director is this a what what flag is this Philippines what is that I think it's Puerto Rican but I bought this sweater from Denny Denny was a vendor at Al Fargos bought that sweater from I bought it from him cuz I want to be part of this trend and so my point here is amongst young people this is a huge hit and if you click around in these guys' Instagram you know there's this joke about whatever the Silicon Valley nerds are doing in 5 or 10 years is going to be mainstream this is the New York cool kid thing this is like walking around Soho and seeing what what people are wearing this is it and is happening right now and I have two ways I think this is going to be a big business okay so wait wait is your take that flea Mar if I understand you correctly you went to this cool flea market you you well I can't even call it a flea market you went to a party in York no it was a flea market okay it was mostly a party happened to have some Goods it was a flea market with the DJ you took your daughter it's hilarious you're saying flea markets are a bigger deal than most people realize especially People Like Us who live on a computer and then you're are you saying there's an opportunity here are you saying somebody's going to build the crumble cookie of flea markets what's going to happen I think I think two things are going to happen I think that there's a massive like PE opportunity here I think flea markets could potentially be the new RV park and you could purchase them at a real estate valuation I also think that there's a huge amount of male well female as well but male like fashion influencers and that's like a hot Trend and I've spoke to like 10 or 20 of them and they're all [ __ ] broke all of them are like I wish I could just pay my rent with this right right I think this business is a beautiful business and the these Al Fargo Marketplace guys are a really good example of how it's done well and think that they're probably not Savvy uh when it comes to business they're more like artists and that there's something really interesting here and so so you're saying this Rose bow flea market 20,000 V visitors to uh 25 200 vendors per month all right so basically based on that uh 20,000 visitors paying 12 bucks to enter the vendors paying 150 bucks to be there they're making 600 Grand per flea market which happens what once a month once a month but there you're forgetting like so many other things like uh table rental chair rentals things like that so about 7 to8 million in Revenue you see on this from this one flea market basically I think it's even more and I also think the other point that I'm going to make is that it's pretty like it's obviously very old so there's this one called Brimfield Antique Show so do me a favor and go to their website so Brimfield uh is a is a flea market that gets a million people a year coming to this Festival which is huge right that's we're talking like Coachella Coachella size stuff scroll to the very bottom so if you want to contact someone you go to the go to the very bottom and look at where tell me what it says about jod oh jod jmj Y2 aol.com just send her a note if you want to learn this is an event with 1 million customers it if if you want to learn more about it email jod aol.com that's what it says at the very bottom go to Jody's LinkedIn I looked at I I looked her up on LinkedIn can can you click Jody's LinkedIn Jody's her name is jod Young she is the owner of this of this business with 1 million customers jod looks lovely jod looks like a nice woman jod doesn't exactly look like what I think is going to be a younger generation of people who are interested in this topic so you're saying the owner the owner of this business these types of businesses going to look different in 10 years and I would say that they're probably not the most choose your words wisely answer listening the they are probably not the most uptight operators uh that's what I would say they're probably very passionate about this and sometimes when you're when when passion leads maybe you're leaving you know dollars on the table that's what I'm saying and I believe that in the next couple years screw the r screw Nick Huber talking about RV parks and storage units we're going to be talking about flea markets that's what I think is going to happen all right bold prediction I really like by the way this is a this is a s par special Round of Applause for the S par special um cool find on the trend cool find on the underrated business flea markets how big they are wow they're kind of stunning in terms of like the visitors that they get I like how you wrote at the bottom and AI ain't gonna [ __ ] with this yeah this is part of the thesis um this is a good like private Equity rollup thesis by you good job by you yeah and it's thank you thank you for that uh condescending patronizing good job for you you like that for me no good job by you that's a real compliment amongst young people dude they buy a huge amount of vintage clothing something like I said I saw some crazy stat where it was something like 80% of gen zers regularly shop uh for secondhand clothing and so you have companies like deop have you heard of deop Sean yeah it's like a secondhand Mark Marketplace secondhand app d D they have 80 million users and then there's Poshmark and then there's Grail and then there's like 10 other ones these young people are buying vintage and secondhand clothing at like alarming rates not alarming but you know what I mean like surprisingly High rates and uh have you ever seen like Thrift huls on Tik Tok have you seen that I've seen uh a lot of things on Tik Tok I've seen a lot of things that's one of them I've definitely it's a it's a huge thing if you like type in Thrift Halls on Tik Tok I follow so many of these people on Instagram it's like a really common thing and so my whole point here being young people are buying this [ __ ] up man they're buying this these secondhand clothing this secondhand clothing like crazy I'm just looking up Goodwill's numbers so Goodwill's revenues last 10 years starts at 4.8 billion 5.7 5.9 6.1 6.3 7 7 billion uh pandemic goes back down to 5.5 uh then it goes 7.5 billion 8.2 billion and 9 billion projected for this year or for for the last year and if you go to a what's it is it called Goodwill finds so Goodwill finds.com they have their own uh like Online Marketplace where they auction off like a handful of the like nicer things uh that Goodwill collects and people love it I've bought a couple things from there I think Ari said she buys stuff from there um it's going I want to make sure I get this down for the record what are you saying is the like someone could do or someone should do so there's uh so what I'm saying is that flea markets are a Recession Proof business in a highly fragmented industry and they last for many many decades and they're hard to disrupt once they work well and also that young people are buying uh vintage clothing and are into flea markets more than other generations and then what I'm saying is I think that there is a rollup opportunity or what I would do is I would work with some of these broke like passionate fashion influencers and I think uh I could create if I if that was my thing a really awesome flea market business can I give you one other random idea so I used to live in Indonesia and Indonesia they do this thing that I've never really seen here but I really liked it so you know in a mall when you go into a food court so in America you go to a mall there's a food court and the exper what's the experience you basically like the business model is you walk in there's nobody there to like serve you um you just go and you pick do I want a slice from sabaro do I want a sandwich do I want some fried chicken what do I want you go you buy your one thing and you go sit down right that did I capture it accurately yeah and it's like and there's a guy handing samples I'm going to try all the samples and we're going to sit in kind of a nasty chair and just like eat this crap so in Indonesia the malls in general are a lot better but the one thing that they do for their food cord is a little bit different when you walk in they give you like a wristband almost like it's a Coachella or something like that and this wristband is basically your way to buy anything you want and the the the way they design the flow it's almost like an Ikea you walk around and every booth has like cool stuff and they're and they're like it's not super lowquality food it's still obviously faster um right but it is everything's like branded kind of well the food like the people who are working there like you can tell it's like more a little more upscale and you pick and you basically start you start with this tray and you just keep adding different little plates from the different vendors onto your one tray right so you have an empty tray and you're going to grab a small bowl or plate from all the different boots that you want to try something from and at each one you just tap your wristband so that the system knows what all you're Pi you've picked up but it doesn't feel like you're spending money it feels like you're like opening a door you're just having here's my key give me my thing this is amazing you sit down you eat and at the end when you leave you put your tray down and you scan your badge and they tell you the damage and you pay for it on the way upw that's awesome I've always thought that American food court should steal this model you spend way more and it's just a more fun experience um like paying at the end once you've already like you know had the little like you know amusement park of food type of thing is pretty cool I wonder if somebody could do a similar thing with Thrift or flea markets and so the thing I'm imagining here is like remember like Spartan Race or tough mutter how they turned this like thing that seemed like work and kind of hard into something that was fun a bit of an instr opportunity and almost they turned like a an individual R like a when you race you're by yourself you're into like a group fun activity exactly so a social fun event that you're planning it's basically a party I think you could do the same thing with the flea market so I think what you could do is you could basically arrange it uh whether it's a a race or it's a it's a one long path and if you do The Wristband thing or you basically soon as you join you get 10 tickets you get 20 tickets 30 tickets whatever it is and you get to and now you just have you have to spend right so instead of the Goodwill problem which is you go and you're like should I get this should I not blah blah like up front you just make a commit I'm going to find 10 things here and then it's about just finding the most fun 10 things you could find at the event and you go and you collect it you fill up your card you could always get more tickets as you go and then by the end you walk out and you've got this new outfit so like you literally would have a photo at the start and a photo at the end because you put it on and you basically do like a makeover um on a you know Saturday afternoon with your friends and you all end up with this like fun photo at the end of you guys dressed up that's fantastic is that not a great experience it's uh it's a fantastic experience and and also just for some reason scanning things with my wrist is for some reason like more fun than pulling out my credit card do you remember that um didn't you invest in a company that was creating software so like Patagonia could sell secondhand coats or something I didn't in I didn't end up getting to invest in it I really wanted to it's called I think Northface uses it cuz I almost doing well that I almost bought North Face coat and they call it like reworked where you like mail in your old coat and you get some type of credit and then they like repair it but it kind of looks funky and cool and like guys like me could buy it yeah I think the way they call it the term for this like movement is recommerce so you have e-commerce but then you have recommerce which is when you sell that secondhand thing again the the website was called treat the company was called treat t r t I think they're doing well by the way they've got a bunch of like big Brands so what what they were doing was they're saying hey uh they would go to a brand like us they'd say hey a lot of people are already reselling your items in on these other platforms and Facebook groups and wherever and they they actually sell sometimes out of markup or sometimes you know they just they you know it's a it's a slight discount but they're they're used Goods why don't you just make a central place on your website for people to buy you know already loved items and so what you would do is they customers could just upload a thing and you'd basically create your own little Marketplace on your website they power it with the software and when somebody and then they don't have to wait for a buyer so they could just put it on the thing and get basically store credit for it um when somebody buys it and so you could you're giving store credit which is going to get them to come back and the other person's getting the item which they were going to got byy anyways off platform makes a lot of sense yeah I almost bought something the other day from with someone using their software but they didn't have my size um so that's my big pitch on flea markets I think I think oh and by the way there are one or two PE guys in the space doing this I think there's like United flea markets.com or something like that but I think you're going to see more so this is my prediction and also my opportunity Spiel okay I like that you made a prediction because the next thing I'm going to tell you about is a giant I told you so but nobody likes hearing I told you so um in fact there's a great tweet that went viral over last week this guy Matt lasy tweeted this out he goes my wife just taught me the professional way to say I told you so I saw that so funny you say this was identified early on as a likely outcome yeah I'm going to be using this a lot so let me just say that me and Sam identified this early as a likely outcome and what I'm talking about is True Crime podcasts okay so this doesn't sound like the sexiest thing but I do you know what the most popular podcast in the in the in America is Joe Rogan would say correct do you know what the second most popular is I would have guessed like call or Daddy okay great also would have thought it's some famous personality podcast like the opposite of Joe like Joe R good for women yeah exactly um it's actually crime junkie a podcast that was started by a 36-year-old podcaster and here's the headline this 36-year old podcaster is making $45 million a year of profit $45 million a year it's insane and where is she based that's the crazy part indana so let me tell you the story here so this woman Ashley flowers she's working at a normal day job and she grew up loving like Agatha Christie stories you know like sort of these mystery crime stories growing up in fact so much so that she joined maybe volunteered at this place called Crimestoppers a like local Crim stopping um you know Organization for in her town and it was supposed to you know just help people report crimes um to one central place now to promote the organization she volunteers and says hey what if I create a weekly radio show called Murder Monday and she does it and she really izes like hey people kind of like this like they like murder Monday this is working and she's just doing this again for fun volunteering on the side of her day job and then she hears the serial podcast it comes out and it serial becomes this phenomenon and she listens to it and she says oh that's cool what if I do murder Monday type of like my radio show that I'm just doing for my local or but what if I did it as a podcast and she jumps in this is back in 2017 she records she you know comes home from her day job records her first episode uploads it and Off to the Races now here we are later she's got 65 employees her business just raised $40 million from churnin uh has valued the company at $250 million and it has a reported or a rumored $45 million of ibida uh per year which honestly sounds a little high um something off sound that the valuation off or exactly it's only 5x EAS I I don't think that's and why would you raise money if you're making $45 million a year in profit and the valuation is likely more true than the the rumored profit number but whatever let's say I think I think I think 20 million would be a very um real number at the at the low end here insane she herself does two she hosts two podcasts herself she's the producer of the shows she sells the ads she closes the deal she's touring all around the country all around the world uh she was working 15 hours a day now down to 10 hours a day she's got a little three-year-old daughter she has racked up 500 million plus downloads in the Last 5 Years just insane volume that's ridiculous we uh do you listen to True Crime I listen to a bit of crime so okay here's the I Told You So part of this if you go to the MFM Vault MFM vault.com which is a place where you can go find old episodes and you could search so I just went on to MFM Vault and I just searched True Crime because I know we've been talking about this guess when the first time we talked about this is just like guess the year I don't know uh a year and a half ago so that would be like 2023 23 no 2020 5 years ago and it was an episode where Armstrong popped by the office and hopped into the podcast while we were recording and you and Lance Armstrong are talking about your favorite type of podcast and you both love True Crime and you guys are geeking out about True Crime Sam and Lance Armstrong the greatest cyclist of all time like Michael Jordan Michael Fels tiger owns a bike and Lance Armstrong the greatest biker of all time talking about how we look same same yeah like what do you like to get scared by it like that's the conversation exactly and we started talking about True Crime then we talked about it again in 2023 we talked about um parcast you had brought up that this guy had created this uh True Crime podcast Network 16 shows and he sold it to Spotify for like $100 million 50 million in cash 50 million in the earnout what was his name Mac something something and um then we talked about then again we talked about it a few years ago we talked about law and crime which was this Media company that was dedicated to true crime stories as well as like just reporting on actual court cases that were going on and it was also acquired for more than $100 million and all along the way we've been talking about how the like True Crime is this thing where there's this underrated appetite more than you would think for this we had Mr Ballin come on Mr Ballin comes on and he talks about how his content is all about telling strange dark mysterious stories people just love this [ __ ] and we've been talking about it and every year that we've been talking about it it sounds like it's too late and every year we talking about it another nine fig company has essentially started or grown during that period of time and so even now now that this is still like you know super established I still think there's a ton of opportunity here and I want to brainstorm this a little bit with you I uh I'm totally on board with this I am a huge fan my my new one is the law and crime Network on YouTube and whenever like the diddler comes about or there's like a new crime like P did's like Lube stuff I was watching that like like what's his what's the Luigi Luigi manani like this is like a gift from God for the for the for the True Crime people like I've been obsessed with all of this stuff like learning about freak off parties learning about you know like deny what does the Luigi say like when the like LeBron James enters the draft this is like oh we got a new hot Prospect we got Luigi yeah like oh easier oh my God we're going have content for years dude I listen to this stuff on my runs and I and I I'm all about it so what do you want to brain you listen to it on your runs like you're just running away from the problem like what what are you doing I think my my hypothesis so basically with the True Crime stuff it's basically me and 100 million women it's like 80 it's like 80% women I think who are into this uh and I think that women listen to this from the perspective of how would I how would I get away like how would I get out of the situation and men listen to it from the perspective of like how would I get away with this that's like the perspective I think that each of the genders listens to these things yeah exactly it's like American King pan yeah my hero my hero did this yeah so um by the way already opportunity so you know when you run I think most running apps or running like um music playlists they try to have a certain beats per minute to keep up keep like Pace you during a run right they try to be Up Tempo yeah true crime 150 beats per minute dud already Innovation white space you know what I'm saying for zone two workouts I only listen to solved murders by parcast oh I got to go do a a a 60-minute run turn on solve murders that's 60 Minutes of like we're going to get through two 30-minute episodes and I'm going to learn about some crazy they're kind of slow right so like what if somebody created a higher energy all right so here's my brainstormer can I give you some pitches on uh my my brainstorm this was my 5-minute brainstorm before the podcast up what would I do because it's one thing to say there's an opportunity there great podcast already how H how I would do it but Sam do we settle for great I know about you great doesn't get me out of bed in the morning I mean Great's pretty good to be honestly be a huge compliment be greatly flattered yeah like I'd rest on those Laurels but all right here's the brainstorm so um Whit space in the True Crime space right now uh first okay the obvious one this is not that fun of a one but YouTube so um most of these that started they were just Audio Only podcasts like serial they were inspired by serial they were podcast and most people thought podcasts were all audio YouTube came out recently and announced that a billion people a month watch podcast content on YouTube so if you're a podcaster and you're not doing YouTube where you at and if you're listening to this podcast and you're not subscribed to us on YouTube where are you at that's how I have to say go find My First on YouTube all right but so the first thing is go all in as a YouTube first podcast even crime junkie she started off heavily in audio then started doing video just as kind of an add-on if you go watch their video it's like uh you know started off really Scrappy and now it looks a little bit better there she's not and then when she raised this money she's investing in like a full video Studio to do this like for real but the format is actually pretty great have you ever listened to her podcast it's basically she sits on a couch with her friend but unlike most podcasts where it's two equal hosts or something that're going back and forth It's her explaining to one friend what's going on with the crime and her friend is like active listening she's like sitting there asking questions nodding her mostly just nodding her head and be like o and then like ask the clarifying question when The Listener would have one so smart by the way that little thing is so smart because most content gets better the more you narrow it to an audience of one if you're writing write to one person if you're doing a podcast like this podcast works well because we kind of do that too where instead of saying all right listeners we'd like to tell you about some great businesses it's like dude Sam have you seen this you're like no what I'm like check this out and it's that vibe that actually like works well in the podcast that's a little bit of the secret sauce all right I gave you three of Colonel Sanders NES is there that's last week last what episode it was leveraged just broke your brain what happened it was leveraged to the tits now it's I just gave you three of the Colonel's nine spices that's fantastic gave you gave you a quarter Colonel there I I I was gonna say something and you uh that was great um moved your brain all right my bad um oh I was gonna say uh with this podcast like I did not know that you were going to bring this up and you didn't know I was going to bring the other thing up so that's like a little bit uh that's how it works we surprise each other and intentionally right we could say let's share notes let's do research let's be prepared that makes for a work podcast we surprise each other cuz the show is you need a reaction I want to tell you something I want you to react I want you to riff for real and then I want you to surprise me and that makes it fun for us to do so she does the same thing she basically tells the story to her friend her friend says they're active listening um she started off just taking existing shows and now has like a team of 10 journalists that do original reporting she now has another show called The Deck where she works with local cops and they give her in like access to evidence and they try to Sol actually solve cold cases awesome is that insane the Great she is basically the Mr Beast of True Crime like when you see how she just took a very simple idea and took it very seriously and she scaled it up it's like yeah why not why not have our own journalist why not scour the country for stories why not partner with the cops why not build a studio why not have a 100 employees why not turn this into a full-on production company she just kept going with the very simple idea right Mr be is like what if I gave away $1,000 what if I gave away 5 10 1001 million $10 million what if you stood in a tiny Circle what if you stood a big circle what if you didn't have to stand in the circle what if you had just lay down like he just keeps going with these like ideas and takes a very simple idea but takes it more seriously than anybody else so I feel like she's done that she's coming to Radio City uh in New York in May should I go I would totally go to one of her Live Events yeah you should go um why not she has like a huge tour she has a huge tour you're gonna become a very big fan of her let me I found something that when I found it I go oh Sam's going to love this and I'm like the mama bird and you're the baby bird and I'm about to puke in your mouth with something you're going to love Peter churnin when he met her here's what here's the quote he said about her because he invested 40 he he met her at part of a TV show pitch and then was like just like wow this woman is really impressive and told his guy go find a way to invest and he like flies to Indiana and like like hounded her for this investment so here's what Peter Chan said he said I find her uniquely impressive that's a good one and it's good right he's been around everyone I find her uniquely impressive what a what a subtle but like powerful compliment from a guy who's met so many interesting people and I think her and Pat McAfee are both in Indianapolis that's like they're they're like in a form like the Indianapolis uh podcasting like Mafia two dots make a line so um check this out okay so here's the other white space here ready black True Crime not a lot of black podcasters doing True Crime there's a couple are you a follower of black YouTube or black Twitter I am a I'm a card carrying member of Black Culture so yeah I'm a part of like is DJ Vlad the greatest YouTuber of all time one of the greatest journalists of our time of our era yeah getting the Wayne brothers to like dish on like what it's like or like Club sh with Cat Williams getting dude how about Club Shay getting like a 100 m I think that was I think before Trump on Rogan or maybe even including I think Club Shay and Cat Williams is the number one most downloaded YouTube video or YouTube interview of the year yeah yeah yeah exact it's insane it's really by the way how funny the funniest thing that theovon clip where he's talking about how he has a cat Williams statue just play that put that on the YouTube just play the clip so good you see a lot of this Cat Williams stuff man yeah yeah yeah that's been crazy I got a statue of him at home really yeah I got a Christmas that it's like a Christmas Cat Williams that I have in my home there it is I don't even think that was Cat Williams that was just a baby but that was a black [ __ ] uh what do you call this [ __ ] uh uh Cat Williams that's what you call it that's a black Nutcracker yeah telling me that ain't aing cat William bro it's not Cat Williams I'm taking that [ __ ] somehow some way that's racist that's not Cat Williams that ain't racist bro black Nutcracker bro I'm supporting the culture how many people got a [ __ ] Black Cat Williams in the house for Christmas Cat Williams zoom in on his face a little bit bro now that you say it I kind of see it it's so good it's so good uh are there not more of these like these like uh True Crime shows geared towards that audience um there's only a couple and the very first one was called like affirmative crime or something I was like n that's a bad name this is not right right like this has happened in comedy podcast like comedy podcast started with a lot of like white comedian in LA but now there's like so many really funny you know just two guys hanging out two black comedians hanging out type of podcast spor podcast Etc like I think podcasting started off pretty homogeneously white and True Crime even just the way it comes across is a little bit like um Midwestern NPR right like serial kind of was in that lineage I think she used to work for NPR right something like that and so it just feels very produced and almost um like New York elitist exactly exactly and it needs to be more you know Country Grammar it needs like somebody who listen to a lot of Nelly growing up they all like a lot of those guys have like that Ira Glass like a today's episode yeah on This American Life yeah yeah you know what I mean that Cadence is so good that's a cool one well by the way world's worst impression to be good at Ira Glass this is the only time that was ever going to land for you um all right next one is comedy times True Crime True Crime so I think a lot of the True Crime podcasts are very serious they're heavy they're trying to be mysterious creepy makes total sense you get why I would do it that way I think there's an opening for somebody to do True Crime but just with a comedy angle and um you know not to not to tutor own horn here but like we did this a little bit in the business space we you know a lot of the business podcasts a lot of the interviews a lot of the podcasts were it was just an IQ contest everybody just wanted to be the bigger know- it- all than the other it was very dry informational and um you know me and you this is kind of how we talk when we hang out and we just didn't filter ourselves that way and it's not that we're like compared to comedians we're not funny but compared to most VCS we're pretty funny and that like has and so the bar is low also in True Crime there's nobody funny in True Crime so if you're even moderately funny you're the funniest True Crime podcast let me as a so so out my ass are they actually 2 on no well you're you're not you're not off but you're actually right and I'm going to give you one piece of evidence that you're right so we are called MFM I have gotten like hate mail from women who are like you're not MFM the real MFM is my favorite murder yeah we're not even the most F we'll never be the most famous MFM podcast yeah it's my have you heard of my favorite Mur murder have people like said like you're not really I've seen this I've never listened to it though is it humorous it looks like it so go to the website the headline is a true crime comedy podcast okay and listen it's hugely popular got it it's hugely popular but I actually have a bone to pick dude they're talking about like Ted Bundy killing people and they're like isn't he hot like they're talking about you know what I mean it's kind of weird like they're talking about wanting to like get with Ted Bundy so basically like you know what do so coffee shop with Wi-Fi you're like hey go to Starbuck quick but you're you're right look it's like uh you know had you developed the theory of relativity and never even heard of Albert Einstein I would still say you're a genius a few other uh possibilities here True Romance so uh I think there's an opportunity to do a true crime style genre but spinoff into Ro combine two very popular genres True Crime and romance you've we've talked a lot of the past about like how the most read books and the most voracious readers are reading Danielle Steel 50 Shades of Gray style romance uh novels and I think somebody could do True Romance as a podcast genre one of my favorite uh True Crime podcast they have a series called killer couples and it's all about love birds who go out to commit murder and maybe you should have done this brain CU I don't really Listen to True Crime I listened to two seasons of cereal and like fell asleep to a few True Crime podcast cial is like the JV team now compared to uh you know what's going on now all right I'm on board with killer couples what else you I mean I feel a little bit discouraged but I'll just finish out because quitting is the only thing more embarrassing than what's happening wait hold on speaking of True Crime I do think that there is this weird like when I we did this one like bit with the hustle about romance novels and there was like these crazy weird genres of like first of all romance novels are like a massive hit and then but there's like women who want to like a romance novel about a military guy but there's like take it a step further there was like women who want to have sex with werewolves like you know the what was the what was that Rob that movie that [ __ ] called what was that thing the Robert Patterson the the Twilight Twilight like there was some weird like undertones of like beastiality with all that stuff right uh but so I think that there's always a niche for uh yeah but you know my the bone I have to pick with this what nobody likes Harry dudes as a Harry dude out here where where's that where's the appeal wolves but not guys yeah you need to get you need to get re rebranded excited when I heard that werewolves were a thing for women and just did not translate whatsoever look gray hair guys have rebranded to the silver foxes uh you know we got to do something for the hairy backs I heard somebody say this the other day they were like oh yeah I had this like salt and pepper thing going on they're like yeah it's a lot of salt though that's the problem just salt um okay so last thing games do they make games so there's that one uh board game do you remember what it's called it's kind of a mystery like board game subscription series cat catch a murder catch a killer hunter killer hunter killer I think killer when we talked about it I think it was doing 30 million a year in Revenue yeah tens of millions a year in Revenue I think that this woman instead of touring she should be creating um uh board games she should be creating a game that's in Target in Walmart on the shelf and it's a true crime uh card game or board game that people can basically solve these cases um together Co like cooperatively or it's some kind of like um you know like Mafia where like one person's the game master and the other people are trying to figure it out I think a game take a game mechanic like that but apply these True Crime things and use your brand as crime junkies I think somebody should be partnering with True Crime broadcast to build those out hunt a killer I think it's called um my whole perspective on games got completely changed we hung out with the guy um Elon at um he's coming on the podcast by the way we're doing it um what was it called killing kittens or something exploding kittens exploding kittens a board or it's a card game but board game I guess and I don't know what we'll wait to see if he's going to reveal anything but shockingly large like numbers are bananas he's also like yeah of the top five most popular games in the world we make number one two four and five yeah like damn it was amazing uh how successful it is and I was like I should start a game company uh he he felt like a he felt like a 12 like he had the excitement of like a 12-year-old like he was so into like games and making people smile via these games that I was like 100% this fact that was my takeway I was like oh my God I wish I was doing this this is so cool I could do this yes and then I saw how truly joyful he was about making the games not not being successful at it but the doing part and I was like oh that's different than me I don't have that I just want the I want have done it he yeah you want the result he like was showing us this game and it was like half done and he had a pen that he had written in like different points on the cards like the he was making the game as he was going and he was like wouldn't this be cool let's like let's change the game to this like he was doing it in real time and we were playing the game it' be like you know playing poker and he's like actually we should come up with like an ace an ace means this yeah he was like rapid prototyping on us did you see what he pulled out of his pocket while we were playing that game by the way just total side note unrelated but it was so fu what was it he's trying to read a card and he can't read it he needs his glasses and so he whipped out a pair of glasses but the glasses had no sticks it was like a monocle R for two glasses and he just rested it on the bridge of his nose and started reading it and I completely couldn't pay attention to the rest of the game cuz I was just constantly trying to figure out is it going to fall off his nose and how what are the physics of this how does this work I think they're called readers he had readers on or something like that and is that a thing is that a known thing like modern monal it's like you it's like at Walgreens you see him like next to the aisle uh next to the checkout you know what I mean it's like the SP they don't have sticks sometimes yeah arms is that what they I've been sleeping on this TR uh I am do I'm amazed that this woman is potentially doing $45 million a year I don't know if I believe it cuz that is so shocking but we should see if if anyone's listening can get us in touch with her I would like to talk that uh talk to her for the Pod that would be fun um yeah Ashley flowers very very impressive uh how old is she 36 she's young wow that's crazy's my age dude that's crazy I could be her she could be me we could trade isn't that crazy that like you know it's it's now we're like yeah that's obvious uh but seven years ago to be like I'm going to start a crime podcast and that's going to make me a billionaire that's pretty wild think cuz she potentially might be a billionaire if after another you know 5 or 10 years because of this that's absolutely wild and we called it so we're right and we deserve all the credit oh no we didn't call it it was identified early on by us as a likely outcome all right uh do we I have a bunch more but I think we're we're it's time to wrap so maybe we call it I think we should call it before we go did you see fire Festival 2 he didn't listen to Our advice so Billy came on our podcast right after he got out of jail prison prison yeah and he um I love that word that's like you know other people get like authors when they have their book tours we get like the post prison we got Shelly we got Billy we get them we get them first right out of prison and you told him you what did you tell him you gave him some advice he basically was like explaining all of these ideas for his the business that he like he owes money so he has to like earn he has to earn money not just a little bit of money he owes a lot he owes like 27 or $30 million a lot and he was like I'm G to start this Festival uh we're going to do like this other festival and we were just like you know maybe you maybe don't maybe you should maybe you should maybe I think you shouldn't do that I think that like maybe you can there's a lot of things you can do because you're famous but you know a firefest 2 maybe you should do that and he's doing exactly that so he's doing fire Festival 2 is that what we said to him on the Pod did we say else we we told him you're crazy and he was like he just saw the potential he was like what if we did it right this time um so article came out today it says says uh fire Festival 2 is off to a a rough start again days after the tickets go on sale which is uh allegedly taking place on Isa muares an island off the coast of Mexico the local tourism board claims they have no knowledge of this event the director of the uh tourism board says we have never had any contact with any person or company about this for us this is an event that does not exist and then if you go to the uh location that they list for where it's going to take place um so I don't know if you have Google Maps handy but if you open up uh 21 degrees 12 degrees 30 32 yeah you do all that just here's where here's where the vent is taking place take a look at this there you go in the ocean 2 the location in the middle of the ocean where there's no land also uh the most expensive tickets are $25,000 like he you know how We've joked about uh entrepreneurs who have just taken what has worked and they just like say like all right uh you sold all this candy bars just do the same thing now but for uh a rees's peanut butter cup style product right he did that so must have exported uh the the code for that old website and he just put a number two on it and now he's doing firefest 2 uh it's the same thing what did that woman what did that guy's wife say uh instead of I told you so it was uh this had a bunch of predictable outcomes what did she what's the what's the line this was identified early on as a likely outcome yeah you called it this was uh this is insane I I don't even know how he's allowed to leave the country um yeah it's not good but hey listen I'm an optimist there's a chance there's always a chance uh here's some other great quotes from this article by the way we tried Billy uh took to Instagram to address the concerns here's what he said Fire 2 is real we have incredible Partners leading the festivals they're in charge of all Logistics production operations there's no way they would ever take on a fake Festival right no he didn't say the right part and then the next thing he says is the the the tourism board responded the organizers did not even B to approach the authorities uh it's very strange because anyone who organizes events knows if you're going to hold an event let alone a massive event you need the municipal authorization I think they thought they could just announce it see if it got traction and then ask for permits halfway down the path it's a bit naive McFarland responds we have accommodations is that really what he said that's what he said before also there's you can you can buy tickets on his website uh for up to $20,000 but like there there's a great way to accept his accept your money as a as a user but like they don't list any bands it's a show right yeah yeah so so that's the other part here at this point no Talent has been announced for the festival however McFarland responds we have talent artists athletes and other performers are on board so did I ever tell you about the time my dad uh I went on a trip with my dad and I learned the power of just being absolutely delusional the negotiation uh it wasn't even not even a full negotiation it was I mean it wasn't a negotiating situation we were at the airport and my dad is cheap and so he doesn't want to pay to check Luggage in oh yeah so he just like bought the he got this bag that's too big to check in and stuffed it and then they were like you want to check bags he's like yep just that one like the free one and then the lady this like poor little lady from Singapore Airlines behind the desk was like um sir like uh you'll need to check that one too and he goes no no I'm carrying that on and she goes uh sir it's too big and my dad responds no actually it's too small not even not even no it's it's not it's not too big it's okay it'll fit he says it's too small which makes absolutely no sense to anyone in any situation there's no such thing as it being too small and by the way she just kept saying I think it's over the limit and he goes no it's too small I checked it's too small and it worked she let him on the plane and we got it on the plane at the plane they're like sir it's not going to fit he's like you need to check it up front here cuz it's free to check when you're up there and he got it for free and he just kept doing this on the trip we were uh trying to get into this like he's like oh let's go to the Four Seasons they have this like the the New Year's Festival like they're doing this big celebration there and we're like driving up it's like all these signs like you must be a me you must be a resident to attend I'm like Dad says uh we have to be staying here we're we're definitely not staying at the Four Seasons so like we can't do this we should turn around he's like no no no it's going to be fine it's going to be fine it's going to be fine and we're like what there's a guy at the front like the gate he's checking everybody like what room give me your ID all this stuff and um so like my dad just goes up and he just pulls up and he goes so what do you need to see some ID or something and the guy just goes no it's good you're fine go ahead we got in and I was like wow some guy tweeted this out he goes dulu is the culu and I've been saying that for the last two days my kids they know I'm just dulu is the culu if you got problem I got a Salu for you dulu is the Salu who said that who twe tweet this like long thoughtful thing and this guy just responded with that dulu is the Lulu and I was like this is amazing that should be the new small boy stuff I don't have any tattoos but I did it's up there it's a contender my kids names and that dude that seems like a cute thing like a jenzy woman would say on a True Crime pod that just like we stole MFM uh you know we're going to steal that one too thank you that is now ours yeah sorry I wish I could remember who said it I don't I don't know your name this is a good podcast because I'm exhausted from laughing that's how I know I had a really good time i' love to do it again sometime all right uh great show see you all out there have a good night that's it that's the pod [Music]

my students I'll ask them how much money they expect to be making by the time they're 35 and about 90% of them expect to be in the top 1% which is $750,000 a year in America and then I'll say what's most important to you in your life and moving forward a lot of the time they say balance and I'm like so you expect to be in the top 1% by the time you're 35 but you also believe you're going to have balance in your life I've never seen that you can have it all you just can't have it all at once you may sacrifice you may say I want to live a nice kind of balanced life I'm going to move to a suburb of St Louis coach Little League work 40 hours a week be a good citizen find a good partner nothing wrong with that but the majority of the people I know the young people think they're going to be in the top 1% and also have balance in their life and I just think it's ridiculous the only way to get there is if you have one thing and that's rich parents otherwise expect to go all in on your career or scale back your expectations around your economics and your influence because it's a competitive market and one of the things people can control is how hard they work

not going to lie haven't heard a word since you said leverage to the tits and I've just been waiting for us to talk about that take a quick quick break it was like uh you know today I'm going to wear a turtleneck and I might try to say leverage to the tits [Music] like Sam it's just me and you no guest this is nice it's like a date night for us the are out of the house well let's debrief I have done a few things do you want to go like back and forth of the interesting people that we hung out with I have got like two or three how many do you have uh yeah I got three or four but I have a theme with mine I don't know if yours would fit this but the theme with mine is all people who are contrarians in some way and what I mean by that is not like contrarian like um you know this like an annoying kind of contrarian not that like like if you call yourself a contrarian it's like you're not contrarian right correct exactly they wouldn't say this about themselves I would say it about them which is what makes it kosher the way I would say it is they're all independent thinkers meaning when I hear the stories of what they're doing I don't even want to ask about the thing it's like how did you even think of doing that thing you know what I mean it's like how all right before you tell me all the details how did you even get into that situation why were you even looking there why were you even deciding to do that okay I can I can I can uh fit within that framework okay yeah I'll go first so I hosted this dinner in San Francisco and and um invited maybe I don't know 15 20 people to this thing you did yeah yeah exactly I know your boys growing up friends and hosting things so in the city you drove to the city and did I drove to the city yes this is true true facts um and so we go there and there's a guy there who um I'm friends with Co his name is Justin Justin cck and Justin is a tremendous investor he was an investor early on in like GrubHub Snapchat Stitch fix like boom like just a bunch of companies that have done really well so let me tell you the story so I I was talking to him about um some of his big win Investments so I'll tell you a quick one so there was a GrubHub one I was like how'd you get into GrubHub he's like oh GrubHub was a it was a funny story like they were doing well but nobody knew them and I don't think they had raised much money yet and I tried to get a i cold emailed them I cold cold called them I called the office couldn't get a hold of them so he's like so I just flew to Chicago I just hung out in the lobby till I bumped into the guys and I was like hey guys I'm just really a believer in this thing sorry to you but I just really believe in this thing ends up doing that deal okay classic meet cute so I was like how' the Snapchat one happen and he told this great story he goes I met Evan and he's like I will just never forget meeting Evan he's like I walked out of that meeting being like this guy he's one of them he's like one of the people that's going to build this like legendary company at the time I think he was still a student at Stanford student in college and I go was Snapchat taking off was it like a rocket ship he goes no no it was like really small he's like it had maybe like 100 150,000 users wasn't growing fast and everybody on the outside viewed it as this like this silly little thing it was like this toy it's like oh is it just used it's disappearing photos must be for inappropriate pictures or it's just a stupid College thing and he's like uh so I was like so how did you invest and he tells the story so he's like you know first I met Evan I heard him out and he he shared the story that he's like Snapchat people think it's about photos and when they hear photos they think about Facebook and Instagram it's like permanent public photos that are for your memories he's like but actually we use photos for communication it's like uh back and forth and so Justin goes hm so it's like messaging he's like yeah it's messaging he goes okay and so he goes home and he does some research he goes I think everybody's been comparing this to Instagram and Facebook and because of that the metrics don't look as good but if you compare this to iMessage I wonder what this looks like or WhatsApp so he he hustles and he gets in touch with somebody at and he's like hey I just have a good question for you if somebody sends an iMessage how many what percentage of them send an iMessage every day for the next seven days and they run the query for him yeah like if you use iMessage you can use it every day that's just how you use messaging apps he ask somebody at whatsapp same question he ask some and then he gets in touch with somebody from Instagram and he's like hey for Instagram if you post a photo what are the odds you post a photo you know the next seven days they're like well super low right he's like okay what about even just using the app they're like it's just reasonable healthy number and he goes back to Snapchat he asks him the number and Evan like he's like I don't know let me look it up he looks it up he's got the iMessage number and he's like this is communication and he's like and nobody you know nobody else was really that that eager to invest and he was like I got to go all in on this thing and uh sure enough he did and you hang hung out with him and he told you that story at dinner yeah that's a great story was this like a career changing deal yeah man that's badass all right friends so a lot of you guys who listen to the show you listen

caught my attention he goes the ocean is the ocean is the next space ocean is the next space what he talking about he goes well you know how recently all these you know there's a bunch of investment now in space Tech so SpaceX obviously first but then after that there have been uh more and more companies that have been get funded VA and others that are all about rockets and satellites and getting getting to space mining asteroids mining minerals whatever it is and he goes the ocean is the next space like the ocean is this other vast mostly unexplored mostly Untouched by Tech space and he's building an ocean tech company and he told me about four or five other ocean tech companies and it was a finger to the lips you got to come on the podcast and tell talk about them there don't don't don't waste this at a dinner okay that's actually a a really interesting concept because right now space is hot robots so hot right now having a moment is Oceans the new it girl I'm looking for it bro I'm looking for it I'm like what's going to be hot is it years is she like the hot girl who just has like glasses on for some reason she's still the nerd and then someone's going to like take her glasses off and be like makeover dud you the romcom where all you had to do is take your hair out of the ponytail and take off the glasses yeah you're now beautiful is that the o is that the ocean right yeah who is that that's cie no she shows up at Pro who's the new girl it's not a new girl imagine the giving their pitch to their LPS or to their investors like you know likeing off the glasses yeah it's just like and gentlemen have you seen she's all that yeah how about de think I hate about you then my friend let us intr you introduce you to our new ocean startup you get it exactly I thought that was great because he's just thinking a lot and living in a space that I it's like you know sort of right under your nose but you never really think about that's pretty cool um all right you want me to tell you uh about someone I hung out with yeah give me one all right so we had this guy on the MoneyWise podcast like a month or something ago and he's like in his 60s his name is Steve hton he's a billionaire he uh I had a great time talking to him on the podcast and like on the podcast he was talking about like you know making money and and and all that traditional career [ __ ] but he's a billionaire from what by the way um yeah so he is worth He says it on the podcast he's worth something like $2 billion he made his initial money uh doing door to-door sales selling something and I I forget what he sold but he made like 100 Grand and with that 100 Grand the Savings and Loan crisis hit do you know what that was in the 80s I I don't completely understand it but basically a bunch of cheap land became available he got leveraged to the tits and bought all this property and that made 3 million the 3 million he then bought some storage units that turned into like nine and then using that nine he bought a bunch of they say oil and gas I don't know like these Dallas guys like say oil and gas but basically it means you buy uh lease rights meaning you like not going to lie haven't heard a word since you said leverage to the tits and I've just been waiting for us to talk about that quick quick break quick H spot ad break real quick while we discussed that kind of liked it well done yeah I'm trying on to much or was it okay I'm trying it on just it's it was like uh you know today I'm going to wear a turtleneck and I might try to say leverage to the tits like now it's like getting a new haircut you knowning affirmations yeah this is my I can pull this off leverage to the tits is my version of having bangs you know what I mean all right so makes a bunch of money oil and glass and land got it okay so you didn't just talk to him on the podcast then you went and you did an absolutely normal human thing to do after the podcast you invited yourself to his family reunion or something well a after the pot I was like can I come over like can I come and just like hang out with you uh and he was like yes absolutely you can and so basically he lives in uh Dallas he has this huge mansion uh on I know that because I look the way I look a lot of people think that I know about like skiing um but I don't but he was like I have a ski in ski out house which I didn't even know what that meant I've never skied in my life and I had to like figure all this out but we went to Utah at his huge mansion it was a ski in ski out thing which if you do ski that's like a fancy thing or whatever and I learned a few things the first thing that I learned I had no idea but his three daughters are famous so his or sorry his wife and two daughters are famous so his wife is uh Jen hton she's got a Instagram called Turtle Creek Lane I think she has 1.5 million subscribers and basically are followers and basically what she does is she decorates their home in like the most crazy over the toop way like so for example for Christmas like it looks like a Christmas dollhous but that's like her real house and so she got famous doing um doing that via Instagram and then brought in the other two daughters to do you know their stick which I actually don't know what their stick is but I know that a million people follow them because when I was around them I was like they're just living and people just like love watching them were they just like snapping content constantly or what no that's funny they weren't I mean they did a bit but it wasn't any different than anyone else who has like a thousand followers you know or like uh it was not obnoxious and uh they actually had mentioned that they worked with you on company you invested in and they were like his company that he invested in they did a great job of hooking us up so you they they knew you uh yeah one of them uh yeah for sure but and I didn't know maybe from their I think they do a good job in their person the daughter's like personal content it doesn't look like I'm the daughter of a billionaire type of thing right it's like super relatable it's fun it's you know it's it's easy to follow easy to like so I didn't know that they were like these famous people the second thing I didn't really know I didn't know they were Mormon but they weren't just Mormon he was like King Mormon like he's on the board of BYU and so I I think I learned this the first morning when Sarah and I get up at 7:00 a.m. to go hang out and everyone we're sitting around the kitchen and we're just kind of like patiently waiting for them to get the coffee ready and you're just vaping rud in the kitchen I'm just like sitting in this kitchen and we're like do you guys do coffee what's up with that they had to tell me that they don't drink coffee and they were like but we went and bought coffee beans to accommodate you we have this coffee machine we even went and bought a coffee machine we don't know how to use it but it's like over here and like they had to like and like I don't even know if they bought the right beans like they literally had never gone through this experience which is like imagine like not knowing like do you get the beans do you get the grounds you know like how does what device you need to ground the beans like is this the right machine or is this like a a a there's five different types of machines they didn't know and they went to to accommodate us which was hilarious um but what I learned with the with the Instagram stuff is dude Middle America moms who's they're following so much more profitable profitable than like comedy like doing comedy bits for like Millennials or uh gen Z you know what I mean they made they kill it and they would like post like these gummies that they got or this candy or this other widget that someone had sent them and they were like showing me how many of the products that they sell and it was the craziest thing I've ever seen like it was like why the people listening to this podcast they're like I want to do things for the creater economy no just do it for Lisa in Oklahoma Mom Mother eon that's who you want to sell to oh my God it was it was crazy they were like super Mormon and I um I'm I'm not into religion I don't like religion in particular uh particularly but I learned a lot and the one thing that I learned was they like explicitly stated their values so like you know when you're with your family and you'll make jokes with your sister like yeah you know uh uh like you'll you'll you'll bring her down you'll be like hey you said you're a diet why are you eating that or like you just like you just like mess with her like just there was not one bring them down joke and I was like and I asked him about that I'm like you guys haven't made fun of each other once and they were like well like you know we're taught in this religion that you got to treat like you know you got to be Christlike and like he doesn't make fun of people so we don't make fun of people and they had like all these like I would ask them a variety of different questions why don't you do this why don't you do that and they all had like very explicit answers it wasn't ever like ah it just feels good or I don't know we just kind of do it was all like well mapped out and I I thought that was really cool to be like super intentional about living when I asked them I was like why don't you guys drink coffee and they're like well we're taught not to like you know try not to be addicted to things or or try not to like overly rely on stuff and I was like all right that's a good reason and so it was crazy to learn all that stuff but here's let me tell you this last thing that I learned from this family it was like a 15,000 foot house and I learned that you you know you've heard me talk on this pod and and I think you feel the same way about like owning stuff in a big house is kind of like it's like oh that's a lot of work I don't want to do that dude it's such a life hack for like being around your family like it's the greatest thing ever and like I've noticed this amongst this family but also a bunch of other really wealthy families that if you can like acquire a home that's big enough for your grandkids and everyone's super comfortable to stay there they will want to stay there more and thus you will spend more time with your family and like they didn't we didn't have a private Chef we didn't do anything the almost the entire weekend was us just sitting around a kitchen table and we like Cooked our own meals and just hung out and it was like the way to live and was it awkward being at their like family reunion or what was dude they were so they were like come on in and like they even more Awkward they're so nice also God nice I I just think these guys are nice all the time and I asked them I was like why are you so nice and I was like why do you guys have so much fun like they had like activities like we went like they're like let's go in the PO coal plunge and then get in the hot tub and then we're going to go do like they had like activities planned that they all did as a family I was like what are you guys doing and they were like we just want fun to be the center of everything we do and this is amazing this is like the opposite of like you know when you're a bad kid in school and they take you to like jail and they want to like shock value like show you what your life could look like if you just keep going down this path yeah I just got like huged really hard this is like the opposite you're like hey you want to see what a really healthy family Dynamic looks like I'm going take you there for a weekend immersion it was the healthiest family dyn I have never seen anything like this and then they have a subreddit there's a subreddit dedicated to making fun of them and it's have you ever seen this so no first of all do you know why there's so many Mormon influencers basically Mormons are explicitly told you should Journal you know journaling is a good way to reflect on life and it slows you down that led to Mormon mommy bloggers which they're like inherently kind of interesting because they're uh really into like uh I think Mormons are told they need to prepare for the end of the world [ __ ] awesome content right like talking about like your your packing system for like all your nuts and stuff like that's really good content parlay that into Instagram and that is one of the reasons why there are so many freaking Mormon influencers and I didn't know that but um uh they have and so because of that they have a whole subreddit it's called like Turtle Creek Lane snark or something like that and every time that they would post something people make fun of them for the silliest stuff like one time we were like in the house and like one of the kids was eating a piece of cheese and like for some reason a 2-year-old shouldn't have cheese I don't know why but that was a post that someone made fun of them or there was one time where Sarah my wife made it in the background of of the photos and they're like who's this person as if she was like a new cast member and they like were Googling her and like listing out her name it was crazy and I asked them I was like does this stuff bother you and they just it totally like like they were like no like why like what they care about us is their business it doesn't bother us at all and so this family had the most positive outlook on life and it it did wear off on me to be honest if like you know I'm not about to go and like become a Mormon or anything but I want to hang out with him a whole lot more right this is Wild by the way didn't he get in like a helicopter accident like the next week or something the week after yeah he uh he his he on the podcast on Monday wise he talked about how much he loves flying helicopters uh I don't know all the details but like 3 days afterwards they were flying a helicopter I think he was he's flying at himself he in this particular he does but in this particular case he was the passenger and they got in a wreck and it was not good and he survived he's going to be fine but it was a it was a bad it was a bad wreck uh and like if you go to their Instagram you'll see like all 10 of their family members like surrounding him at the hospital and so yeah he's going to have a um a lot of issues to deal with but like this was like the kindest sweetest family I've ever been out been around do you know Raleigh Williams MH he came too and uh it was like me and Raleigh Williams and then the hton family and Raleigh Williams uh his kid was amazing she's 10 years old and I was she was the most articulate little girl I've ever talked to I was like how how'd you learn how to talk this good and it was like I you know for the church they teach us how to do like a homy that's what we call in the Catholic church I don't know what the Mormons call it we talk in front of like 500 people at church and she was like in in doing that I learned that I need to like and like told me like all like the principles to like speaking confidently and I was like you're the greatest person I was like I'm Navy my next daughter Navy because of because of you uh but this freaking family was awesome it was so it felt honestly like I was in a reality TV show but there's no drama there was Zero drama it was like the happiest thing I've ever seen and the husbands by the way are the managers of uh so the husbands are the managers of the two daughters they were like one guy was like yeah I used to work at Amazon uh I helped create I think Alexa or something like that but then when I saw the potential for like this influencer stuff I quit right away and now we make and they told me how much money and it was just an astronomical amount of money uh it was crazy so that was my weekend with uh a billionaire Mormon family and it was awesome all right where can we go from here uh might feel like a let down after that um let's see all right I'm just going to give you three numbers to pick from I have three people on this list give me you want number one number two or number three number one or maybe I could rapid fire these and then you could tell me which one you want to talk about okay uh hung out with my friend James Courier he's we did a podcast together it's going to come out soon he has this one bit that I just really liked so he he's all about his fund is called nfx as in network effects he's all about Network effects like nobody on Earth knows more about Network effects than this guy and he has this great blog post and this thing that we talked about which is called like your life on network effects I hadn't really thought of it this way but he the contrarian thing he said was he was talking about uh leaving San Francisco we had we had a bunch of friends who we used to hang out with that have moved out of San Francisco during covid because they were like oh everything's online now so we'll just leave and then it'll be like good for taxes and he goes he's like look everybody you know personal choices do whatever is like but if you wanted to be here and you left because of taxes and because you thought it's the same it's same same on Zoom he's like that's idiotic you know you could he's like you're going to save 133% on your taxes and you're going to lose 13x you're going to make 13x less money uh on that same on that same money saving decision moving for taxes when someone tells me they do that I think they're stupid I think that's a really that's a foolish thing to do do you agree or disagree there's a lot of people that do that I think it's foolish sorry they're not stupid I think that decision is foolish or rather I don't agree with it that decision and actually several other decisions they make are probably also but don't you agree like the the point of of like succeeding is to do what you want not to have to live to Puerto move to Puerto Rico if you want to live to P Puerto Rico then great do it but if taxes is the number one reason I think that that is uh your your your what's that phrase you can't see the forest and the trees or something something like that I mean I I kind of agree as why I'm still here but um but yeah so I thought that was interesting and he when he talks about your life on Network effect he his idea is basically every if you could take all your decisions you make and instead of thinking of them as things you did or decisions you made or um just like events in your life if you looked at it as you either joined a network or you left a network you either added into a network or you you subtracted out of a network so for example where you choose to go to college it's not just a college it's not just an education you're picking a network to join I joined the Duke Alumni network and that that Alumni network is going to have certain benefits down the road it's also going to lead me to maybe certain careers that that Network tends to go towards which is like Wall Street finance things like that um you know where where you live obviously is a huge one so like what city you live if you join the Hollywood Network you're going to be joining a certain lifestyle certain career opportunities Etc and when you leave you are opting out of that Network or you're getting yourself away from the white hot center of the network even just skills you pick like let's say you want to learn um you learn marketing well you're actually joining a network of other people who know marketing and that's who you're going to hang out out with those are the opportunities you're going to get and that's where where that's the the sort of the next decisions are going to be heavy heavily influenced by the um the network decisions that you're make the initial Network decisions that you're making and why what like did that make you reflect on a decision that you've made or thinking that you did the right thing or the wrong thing or how will you implement this CU that like makes me I don't regret I don't regret I moved mostly because of f or only because of family but I do wish I was is it OWN Network right you like opted into your own per like you know your own family you know Network or whatever you know you opted into you opted to like be more dense there and have more connectivity there which is going to be great for your family raising and all that but you opted out of the tech network of San Francisco let's say which by the way if I could live anywhere like if family weren't a thing it would want it would be either be an SF or uh a suburb like a 20 minutes away but I would live there in a heartbeat and did what what did it make you feel like Well he kind of points out he's like you know there's some things that you don't choose like where you're born right things like that but then there's after that it's a lot of what you start to choose um to do and even little things like you know language is a network so you know if you're in China right now like choosing to join the English network is actually like a a really powerful decision you can make that's going to like completely change the trajectory of your of your life being able to do that if you start to look at things English is not just a language it's a network it's a network of people who all can communicate with each other using certain syllables and words and vowels and phrases right um money is a network right so joining the Bitcoin Network early on turned out to be a really profitable decision because you picked hey we're a bunch of people who all believe that this thing is going to be valuable Network right so it just made me more aware of that it made me you know why did I host that dinner in San Francisco partly because James was like you one of the big mistakes I made earlier in my career was I got successful and I kind of siloed myself I kind of just want wanted to do my own thing on the edge of the network he's like it was great for creativity cuz I was just in my bunker just doing my thing but it was terrible because he's like you know I turned down that lunch meeting with uh Travis when he was starting Uber and I uh you know I was too egotistical to take that job at Facebook early on when Mark was trying to recruit me because I just thought like I'm going to I'm going to be off in my own land creating my own little castle over here and he's like again fun for creativity and for learning but a little bit foolish to the how extreme I was with with that like uh and so you know for me for example I'm I moved 45 minutes out of San Francisco that reduced a lot of the serendipitous meetings that I could have in the net in in the network of people that I like to be around interesting ambitious people would you move closer then well I don't I don't think I'll move closer because like the family networks's out here and it's just better like the school that we're in and all that stuff is better out here but I'm like yeah I could definitely like drive to SF twice a month and have like you know host a dinner do a couple of live podcasts with people there that'll be great and like that's not not that much of an effort but just to stay just to keep one almost like a in the diagram right one line connected to the white hot center of the network yeah and I mean you live near BART right I do but Bart Bart's a Bart's a network I don't want to be a part of you're opting out of that one yeah I'm op out of that one um all right I have another person so uh basically I don't speak at conferences unless my wife wants to come with me if Neville wants to join and do it with me and if Nick Gray will attend those those three things have to happen you know I need my Entourage all three or one of the three all three all three have to happen all three have to happen that's your like I only green Skittles that's your writer that's my writer is Sarah's got a be the reason I I I don't I don't like traveling but I like to travel if it's for a conference because I love going somewhere and the first two days are conferences the next few days are fun because you meet someone at the event who's going to tell you cool [ __ ] to do and also I just like doing stuff with my friends uh and so I went and spoke at this thing called the newsletter conference which which was pretty wild because like 15 of my ex employees were speakers and are all like many of them are millionaires or making a whole lot of money doing newsletter stuff and that like made me feel proud but I met James altucher you know who James aler is yeah he's been on the podcast he's uh what is his like he's an author what's his like title in life I think James might be the craziest person that I've met in the last six months so if you Google James alterer you're going to see that he's like the thing that sticks out is his hair he's got this like crazy haircut and in real life he sort of looks like a rock star like he kind of like like he's not trying but he looks so different that he looks super cool and awesome and so James is the type of guy who well he's got the story I don't know his full background but he he's like created a startup made a bunch of money blew it all on stocks or bad Investments did another startup made a bunch of money lost it all and now I think he's on like Mountain 3 and and he's got he has a thing called Choose Yourself Financial it started out just as a newsletter where he would just write about his interesting opinions and things like that he sold a portion or all of it to Agora Agora is a large uh newsletter business that makes something like one or2 billion a year in Revenue I don't like their company I think that um they they have like 15 or 20 it's basically it started in the ' 80s as one newsletter now they have like 20 and they acquire other people's newsletters and I think they do a lot of nefarious stuff so I'm not trying to promote those guys but not they're not all bad and he sold to them and now he's their highest or one of their highest earning newsletters and his newsletter Cho your self Financial did 130 million in Revenue last year and it's like crazy the numbers are crazy very profitable and he said all this on stage everything I'm saying is public um and so I hung out with him and his uh his wife and we had a great time and he said one thing to me he said it like in passing and I was like the record SK he was like yeah you know like I love door Dash because you know like I don't leave my house for like 3 or 6 weeks at a time and if I need a pen they just bring me a pen if I and I was like what did you just say that you don't leave your house for like three to six weeks at a time and he told me he's like yeah like sometimes I just get so into something that I literally will not step foot outside for like four weeks at a time and so he but he but he said like five other things like that where he just was so fascinating and it was Pro that you know how like I I think it was in the Peter teal what's his book called 0 to one 0 to one he said there's like a graph where it's like a bar chart or something like that where it's like extreme success means that you're likely going to have extreme personality traits and those extreme personality traits like come off as weird or undesirable in many settings you know you could be like Elon which means you're going to be kind of mean sometimes you going to be like Albert Einstein which means you're like forgetful all the time and like we're two different socks or whatever like he like has these examples James is that guy he very much has the like brilliant but forgetful and quirky scientist vibe to him and it was just wild seeing him just have normal conversations because his opinion and the way he looked at things was 100% fresh and different from how I looked at the most like normal things for example when he said he didn't leave his house I was like that's horrible he's like he was shocked that I was criticizing him and which is pretty funny because uh you know he should live his life and be happy and that made him happy and it was it was like or in the green room he was playing chess the whole time with Steph Smith who was also there I was like you guys know each other and and they're like well we've never actually met but we played chess like constantly together online and he meets a lot of his friends playing chess online and there was just so many little tidbits about this guy that made him so fascinating to me um and by the way if you saw if you know a Gora you know they're famous for these like long form sales pages and like incredibly aggressive advertising do you remember in like 2020 or 2019 James's face was everywhere yeah he was like I hate that I hated it I hated it I hate our landing pages I hate how long they are I hate how they look too aggressive and it was like I tried to write differently and like make my own landing pages none of them could ever convert nearly as good as like the crazi [ __ ] that they would write so did he make a ton of money off that Agora thing yeah yeah all right or uh maybe the yes and also I I think the answer is is and is still and is still okay gotcha um all right I like that one James uh I have another one that's less weird but more um side questy so sheal Sheil manat who came on the podcast uh recently you can see his episode the numbers crushed yeah he did he did he did really well we uh so he was at the dinner too and she'll tells these stories and you're just kind of like if you just listen to the stories You' be like wow this guy's fascinating you would never know his day job because sheal is an epic side quester so his day job is he's a VC he invests in fintech companies that's his job and there's a lot of that the weird thing is that if you listen to him he's he's like oh yeah I um I'm taking like like courses or like whatever I'm getting certified to be a travel agent now so I can access all these travel discounts and he's been doing that he's like yeah I actually looked at buying the ambassadorship position uh for like being an ambassador of a country because it has these perks he's like basically like your friend who's like really good with credit card points but for everything including credit card points by the way I think on the podcast he gave us like a pretty good credit card uh Point tip but he just has like all these epic side quests he's gone down um over and over again he's like yeah I got married in the metaverse and like Taco Bell sponsored it oh and hey guess what else I did you know I started this auction company to go and buy and sell like the domain endings likeapp and photography like that was his business it's like these aren't even normal even his businesses aren't normal businesses they're just weird side quest that made money I think his side is thisle his is that it yeah thisle was another one he's like oh yeah like um so the story he told on the thing was he was like I was interested in this like food delivery space it got really hot sprig Etc I was ordering from all of them but I just thought there's no way this thing's making money so then as a side quest I signed up and became a driver for a month and I drove around and it was it was amazing I met all these people and I learned the model and I realized this thing's never going to make money and he's he was right spr went out of business so did all the others that were doing it and he's like but we could do this other thing Thistle and I got my friend to do it and now thistle is like I forgot what he what did he say on the podcast like absurd number I think it was like 100 million plus 100 million plus in revenue and I was like wow thisy is just always on side quest so for example he was talking about he's like um he's like oh yeah uh Mr Beast posted this video about like I I'm on this abandoned uh island or whatever like this this abandoned Island I'm the only one here and there's nothing here blah blah blah and the CH was like hold on I've been to that island but without the video like and he's like no wait that's not abandoned there's like a there's a bar like 3 minutes away from where he is and there's this Motel so he tweeted about this and then Jimmy calls him it's like hey man like what are you talking about like that is an abandoned Island he's like no it's not it's 3 minutes away from a bar like he's like no technically it's abandoned if you look at XYZ and I was like this guy just constantly gets himself into situations Jimmy called him because Jimmy like felt his integrity was under attack yeah and he was like did you give Jimmy my number I was like no I didn't even I didn't even know this happened and and shield didn't back down he was like no it's not it's not an abandoned island or he's like where you were he's like look at it 3 minutes away there's a place there's a pub he's like it's not abandoned and I think technically maybe there was something where it's like the the like the Border or like I don't I don't know what this I didn't get into the details I obviously I don't give a [ __ ] uh but I just thought it was amazing that there's people that just do things for their own amusement and I'll bring this home with a little Tik Tok I saw and it was the Tik Tok was there like this Tik Tok had gone viral and I'm glad it went viral because it means that other people are similarly really attracted to people who just do do [ __ ] for their own amusement and really for no other reason so the the Tik Tok that went viral was like shout out to my boy Willie for um spending all of our bachelor party weekend trying to learn this dance and I guess there's like some dance and there's like this he's like this awkward looking white guy and there's like two black friends trying to show him how to do this dance and it's just like everywhere they went during the B party he's just practicing this dance just to like see if he can learn it in a weekend and like he starts off really bad and by the end he's actually like pretty good at the end of the weekend and then they cut to the to the wedding and he's doing the same dance just for fun on the on his own on the side of the dance floor like not part of a performance just like just doing his thing over there and um I I respect that I think I respect that more than I respect like someone's achievements in life uh I kind of respect people that that value their own Amusement as the highest order bit and I think she is an example of that like the [ __ ] he does he's not doing it because there's some outcome he's seeking he's just amused by it and therefore like follows it and he ends up in these situations that in the end become really good stories but I don't think that's why he's doing it I think you know we've done close to 700 of these episodes she would be in my top 10 of people who I admire most um I think that sheal did you like people I don't even know if we mentioned this this one do you know that she's in a Justin Bieber music video of course he is why wouldn't he be in just Just Bieber music how did that happen like I was watching from the the outside so I think the way it happened was during covid sheal created an online version of Bachelor like The Bachelor oh yeah yeah yeah I watched this it was great and what were what was it exactly it was was this during Co Bachelor on Zoom I think it was called the zoom Bachelor or something like that it she The Bachelor and there was a bunch of women that would pop up and then he would like eliminate he' give out roses and eliminate them and he fix someone in the end they went on a date or something and somehow I could be confusing all the stories but some somehow this it it like it was a hit it was awesome and then he then there was a video of him where he's turned around like this and it looks like he's making out with someone like this in the video yeah so he I think he was I'm watching this all from outside I think he posted that video and then he turns around and he smiles and he looks so happy and that clip made it into a Justin Bieber music video and if you go and watch the music video his clip she's clip is the best clip oh I have it I have it it's there what what what was it called like love yourself was it love yourself and he's like it looks like he's making out with someone but play play that clip and like watch that oh my God this is so funny he turns around he's got a huge mustache for some reason and he's just cheesing do you know another crazy thing about him by the way I you know the podcast startup on gimlet media I think he created that yeah yeah I I yeah I think he did him or he he had his hands in it maybe we'll say that did yeah uh he just has had he's had so many weird things happen to him let me let me tell you another one another person who I think is is doing their own thing so my buddy furkon who you know he's also been on the podcast uh so Furon and I tried to we were co-founders we tried to start a bunch of companies together for like you know six or seven years I know Furon super well one of the things about Furon is that he is um he's just a grinder and it doesn't matter how like successful or wealthy he's gotten I mean his his last company app Loven is like a hundred billion dollar company and it's like absurd and um he was why is it taking off so much by the way like app L for years it was sort of a joke because when you would drive in San Francisco they had Billboards uh where they were trying to recruit engineers and the name app Loven came out right or we still Associated it with micklen and it was like is this is this a is this a real company you know what I mean and now it's one of the most valuable companies in the world yeah exactly so he um he's been so so Fon has been early into into a bunch of like Tech things right he's he's basically like a hacker's hacker so he was really into to crypto before crypto was cool like I remember literally being at the office and he was like not paying attention because he was buying into the ethereum Ico at like you know 17 cents or something like that and I was like ethereum like literally like dorkiest [ __ ] name never GNA work uh so I didn't buy because your boy's a genius and that's why I'm a podcaster now and he's a billionaire and so is faran a billionaire now or I don't know I don't know if he is or is it but something he started a100 billion dollar company I don't know he's he's not like he's not like three zip codes away maybe he's two I don't know he's getting close so he got into crypto early on and then when web 3 happened remember when web 3 happened and everybody was like like piling into web 3 and fron was building a company in that space literally his companies called third web and he was just really into the actual like technology behind it he's like oh I think I can make these tools easier to use for Developers and blah blah blah BL blah dude one time he like did a talk on remember the raspberry raspberry piie yeah yeah and like he he like one time spent like 45 minutes explaining to me all about it and he knew everything about it yeah yeah he knows everything about everything so he's um and the second thing he got really into was VR so he bought me an Oculus just cuz he was like I don't want to tell you about this and like hope that you go try it out here here's the new Oculus headset go home and put this on like okay uh that that's that's a that's the type of friend you need and so I go home and I I put it on I'm blown away and I'm like wow this thing's getting really good and then I think he bought me like another one when it got better and then I started buying them and I'm like I'm paying attention to VR but you know I'm like every other lemming out there it's like I pay attention when [ __ ] gets hot and Furon the reason why Furon is so great is because he doesn't pay attention when things get hot he's like in the hardcore nerd bucket where he's like I pay attention because it's interesting to me I don't care if it's popular or not I don't care if it's hot or not I don't care if it's if it's if it's here or not I want to be on this train the whole time and so he was telling me uh about his so he's got this lab called effing and he was telling me first first about third web how it was growing and how it had real revenues now I was like oh wow that's great then he's tell me about VR and like Sam like how many people do you know that are interested in VR right now like everybody who is interested in Tech is interested in AI where's your Oculus sitting right now dude where's the biggest pile of dust in my room I think it's back there it's yes it's gone same my um I mean like I did I did what everyone did they got it this is awesome this is going to change the world it's going to change everything uh I don't know where the charger is it's in my drawer somewhere yeah let's go back to scrolling on my phone yeah and um he didn't do that he's like he would tell me like we would hang out and he's like I'm working in VR today once a week I go co-work in VR I'm like what and um so guess what his interest in VR there's not it's not popular right now in fact um they went to a VR conference and this VR conference was like you know crickets basically and he sends is VR the new ocean it's the old ocean that's the problem doesn't have the new tag and so our buddy hubar who works with him goes there and he wears a t-shirt all black that just says I invest in VR huge on the front he's like dude it was like being the only girl at like a like a prom or something like that there was like everybody was interested in him because he's he's like the only guy left investing in VR and he's like dude it's actually kind of working he goes you know if if you look at the top 15 apps like the top 15 apps in all of the the Oculus store these three guys over here own three of the top 15 he's like they're printing money right now like this thing is amazing um yeah it's not like it's not the hot thing right now but like I don't know if you can make $10 million as like a small team building these apps and you're the front line of this and you're the only people who are like specializing this technology like good things are going to happen so it just kind of reminded me of like you know know all the money is made either and being sort of right on time but timing is super hard and so the same way that Warren Buffett was like don't try to time the market focus on your time in Market Fon is doing the like uh the tech the engineering version of time in Market where once he's interested in something and he believes in it he doesn't sort of he doesn't let his interest go in and out based off of like you know popular sentiment or VCS or or exits or anything like that it's just based on is the tech getting better or not and I think that's just such a strong thing that's going to you know help them be super super successful to like all the young people listening who are like looking for a thing to do I feel like that story is maybe a life-altering that that this is a very good premise and I'm I'm on board with that with this premise I do think VR like it's actually and it's not this isn't a secret Mark Zuckerberg who has a really good ratio of getting things right has like said like this is the thing and also do you know who also loves R she she posts videos of his or not it's not VR but the The Meta the what's it called the Ray bands rayb bands yeah he loves those rayb bands and it's very clear how there's like you know that's all in the same ballpark of of VR and how this can all work that was what I was going to bring up next so I love those two I have them I bought some for my sister just like for her birthday recently and um I think that that it's a great product it's it actually like do you have them by the way no I'll go buy them right now what do they do like what's the point the first the very first easy thing is they're basically airpods so people don't really realize this at worst case scenario you just bought a pair of airpods that you're probably not going to lose so the audio from the like the glasses the the the part that goes behind your ear it's not in your ear but you can hear like music podcast whatever super easily um so the audio is the the airpod type of feature is great and then the camera right like hands your camera if you have a kid like for kids this thing is incredible because I wear them to like my daughter's like soccer games or whatever and to like you know the moment passes so quickly with kids and if you're fumbling get out of your pocket unlock face ID no no type in my password get the camera app open it's it's over by then right um and you're now looking through your phone at life versus your glasses that's where you're already looking it's on your head it's on a swivel all you do literally if something's going on or something's interesting you just tap the thing and it starts recording um and the video looks great by the way it's it's really really good so for if you're traveling if you're out and about if you've got kids if you're at a sports thing if you're at a concert this thing is amazing and so awesome to me these are these are the future I think meta knows this they're like investing in it very heavily I think it's interesting because it's kind of uncontested right now like maybe Apple will get in the game maybe if they still have like the the juice to do it Snapchat seems to have fallen out um the famous like I forgot what the thing was called Magic leap those guys died or dying and the Humane pin died right like all that stuff is is kind of dead and I think Facebook has this sort of uncontested right now and um the thing I was going to say though is I remember when I was in San Francisco this company called Leap Motion got bought do you remember Leap Motion yes uh did they did it become a video game or like a part of a video game they got bought by Facebook and what they were doing was they were they were like it was like this thing you wore on your wrist and then you could just move your hands and do like hand gestures to control a computer essentially they never really found product Market fit cuz guess what a lot not a lot of people want to sit in front of their desktop and like hand gesture like the minority report like replacing the mouse and keyboard wasn't like super sick I guess yeah but it's pretty sweet if you have some physical disability which I mean there's a lot of like amazing applications I would imagine uh maybe but you still got to use your hand your arm right so it's like you know same thing as I guess a mouse really but the the the team that was working on it was like Cutting Edge at this kind of like gesture control and guess what like being the best team in the world at gesture control or another example of this was they got bought for I think a 100 million plus another company that got bought for 100 million plus uh that never hit product Market fit was the company that was working on um face masks so before remember when snapjack came out with those face filters it was super hot like the dog face filter Emoji no it was um it was called masquerade was the name of the company and so masquerade I think it was like a European company it was just small company and again got bought for like $100 million plus and then Facebook bought another company that was doing a very similar thing or maybe I'm mixing up who who bought masquerade um but I guess my point is being being at the Leading Edge of just a tech you get two shots to win if you make the Breakthrough app that actually does get product Market fit then you get to win in the billions if you're just the most hardcore Tech Team at building like good functionality and like like working on these new platforms your team is your team of 10 really strong Engineers if you could actually build a strong team your floor becomes like a $50 to100 million company I don't think most people realize this I think most people think starting a compan is really risky yes but there are less risky versions of this and right now if you were working on the meta Ray bands platform which like today there's no there's no app store for it there's nothing but guess what there's going to be right like that form factor is for sure going to exist and there's for sure going to be apps that are built on it um and so if I was a pretty hardcore Tech Team or if I worked at one of these big companies like let's say I was at Facebook or I was at snap snap spectacles and I was on that team the smartest thing you could do is spin out with your five smartest friends and be like hey guys the floor of this company is a $50 to $100 million company and the ceiling is like a billion dollar company or two billion or whatever it is and all we're going to do is we're just going to live at The Cutting Edge of this and we just have to survive five years we have we need time in market like we just have to survive five five years in order to like be there and we're going to just work out all the Kinks about the spatial recognition about getting gesture control correct about all these little Tech problems that you need to do to make things great cuz either you're going to do it and crack the app or they were going to buy you because you've solved a bunch of gnarly problems there was um I'm reading this book called digital gold it's about the have you you know that it's a that book it's about uh Bitcoin and the founding in like the early community and things like that I don't think I've read that one it's great there's not actually that many books written about like the early characters which is why I wanted to read it because we had Nick Belton on and we did uh American Kingpin about Silk Road I was like this is these stories are are are really fun and uh now like I know of a lot of the early characters of Bitcoin and like them talking about going to their first conference and on the first conference there was like 50 people there and it was like a shitty restaurant and and just like all these like stories of like yeah like this checks all the boxes of like early like crowd of just nerds who are regarded as Freaks and no one takes them seriously and then one like legitimate financier is like okay there's something here and then another one and then another one and then like there's a controversy but they overcome it and then like it's just like it fits all the stereotypes of of these types of stories and what you're describing is like that same thing it's like a group of weirdos uh you know what did we say about um I had some guy pitch me a company that I thought was really stupid and now it's huge it was like uh uh this product is dumb oh my God people are using this they're dumb oh my God everyone's using this I'm dumb you know what I mean and like it's like that's like how you go through that's like the process of some of these things and uh like when you're talking about these metag glasses you're talking about VR you're talking about oceans I'm like oh my God there's like a story here a story there like it's the same pattern over and over again and it's a really fun pattern speaking of crypto I have three crypto things for you real quick number one James on the podcast tells this story about uh because he wrote this blog post a long time ago he tells I he tells a story about how um his friend thought he was Satoshi and the reason why is because how flattering I know by the way like so what's up with my friend like who me not even a long shot you think I'm Satoshi no I could never what an honor though um but the thing that he was saying was uh he wrote this blog post that I it's on his blog still it's called one currency to rule them all and it was about one world Curren about creating a digital world currency and he tells the story on the podcast about why he why he was interested in that how he's interested and what what happened so he was like him um I forgot who it was it was it was him it was Philip Rosedale who started Second Life which Why by the way like still to this you know basically Second Life to this day is probably the best execution of a metaverse like they had like millions and millions of players they lived their lives in there they formed relationships and marriages they had like they have their own currency in there like is is it its own thing still I don't know if second life has officially like died I don't know if it's still going I'm not sure but like at the time they had lynen bucks or whatever Linden dollars and it was like a whole thing so him and Philip rosale were like interested in this and then it was a there's a famous VC I'm forgetting the name now but he tells a story about a famous VC and they used to meet once a week and they would talk about like okay how are we going to build this world currency and they were like here's what it needs to do and like all the things that Bitcoin eventually did they're like they're like it needs to have um it needs to have this it needs to have this and what they did was they went to the lobby conference which if you know is like this 100 to 150 person conference and they you break a last year of the lobby conference it was awesome it was all internet ogs it was so cool so they were at one guess and their their little breakout conversation was about this they're like hey I think there's some there's a need for this and he bought the domain blue.com bl.com he was going to launch it it was going to be called blue and like you know the dollar is green and this currency was going to be blue and they had the whole thing sort of like planned out I guess they um but they were like they couldn't figure out how do we if this ever becomes a thing like the Target on our back is going to be too crazy like we can't do this and the problem was they were like we've already talked about it at Lobby and he's like once we realized this this thing would need an Immaculate Conception that it would need to be totally Anonymous or snonymous like uh start and nobody could know who did it um they're like we blew it we said it at the lobby conference there's 14 other people now who have heard us be interested in this and when the white paper came out years later uh Philip called him and was like dude I can't believe you you cut me out no way he's like have you seen Bitcoin he's like yeah he's like that's you right he's like no it's not me he's like I thought it was you if any if it was either of the two of us it' be you you're way more technical he's like no it's not me who the hell is this how cool is that that is awesome that is one of the great greatest stories I've heard they um it's weird that multiple groups of people start working on the same thing independently at the same time isn't it and they had the same conclusion that it had to be an anonymous Creator yeah exactly and you know what the other crazy thing you saw this Jack dorsy like is Jack dorsy that was the stupidest thing man like there was some compelling evidence but then what they did was they completely like spoiled the broth by putting in there Jack Loves wearing Japanese clothing like as like examples of why he is Satoshi do you know what I mean it was ridic spoil it I didn't think that was that bad what's wrong with that there was like multiple pieces of compelling supposed to be compelling evidence that says like Jack wore a who is Satoshi t-shirt to the to the Olympics like it was just like ridiculous stuff no I I thought it was uh I thought I thought it was was ridiculous you didn't think it was ridiculous uh first I did cuz I was like Jack dorsy no way uh you know then there's this deck right did you read the deck there's this actual like full slide deck about it there was a bunch of good points there was a bunch point there a bunch of good points about it what I things I didn't know I did not know that Jack was like in those early Cipher Punk communities back when he was like 15 years old or something like that you know what I mean like he was actually in that like whoever started this thing was likely in that really small community of about I don't know, 1500 people that were on those early mailing lists well he was and he and he was I didn't know that so that was kind of new information okay interesting um other things that I didn't know so there was like um there was like a lot of the timing things with when he was starting Twitter and when he was like basically the timing of when Satoshi was active and then when Twitter took off and then when he stop when he left Twitter and he was like I'm excited about new things and then all tweet he like tweeted like some someone needs to create this thing or that thing and it was like right when the Satoshi was creating that thing like there was all these like weird coincidence in Timeline exactly but then there was other stuff where he was like look at the code here that sounds like Jack's favorite restaurant in San Francisco or Jack said he wants to be by the US Mint for his office which Twitter was therefore I just thought it was huge reaches there are huge reaches and I don't think it's true uh but I thought wow this is a lot of stuff about Jack dorsy that I didn't really realize and like you know for example um you know one of the I think the the biggest reaches of the thing where they would look at like strings of the transaction IDs or whatever and it'd be like see this says um d2m dude in tment Plaza that was his address like all right I don't think D just cuz d2m showed up in the middle of a a string doesn't mean that uh that he's saying you know one dude SF one DSF that's him you know it's like those are the ones where it's like okay I don't think that that stuff is uh that stuff is true it's like trying to like figure out if Tupac's still alive like did you hear what that he said Su shot me like he said it in the song you know what I mean but I would definitely go read this deck the deck was very entertaining and it was presented in a very like serious way and I just appreciate the seriousness that which somebody took uh took this uh this research um by the way that two man Plaza that's where we were for the dinner and so I was like and it was the same day that dropped I was like hey this is maybe I'm the cre maybe maybe you're Satoshi that should be the takeaway that was my takeaway I I've got one more thing for you um go to chisos decom is it chisos is it Spanish chos boots you see the boots incredible craftsmanship I see cowboy boots yeah so uh I own a pair of these boots I have no stake in this company nothing I just think it's cool I uh and the the founder is part of like uh I recently became friends with them but he's part of my friend group in Austin he was like friends with Nick and I met him once or twice through nick uh his name's will Roman and this company uh you bought $1,000 pair of cowboy boots I think 500500 or $600 pair um a year like a while ago and um this company he owns the whole thing and he was explaining to me at like we were hanging out and I was like dude this is a good story can I talk about it so he gave me permission but the company does like low seven figures in revenue and the way it started was he worked in te like at a normal tech company quits his job moves to Mexico to learn cuz Mexico is where a lot of like great Boots are Made like spends years there like learning the craftsmanship like apprenticing yeah apprenticing he's like I want to learn how Boots are Made and I want to make bespoke boots that was his dream was to make bespoke boots he's a Texas guy he's like he kind of looks like a cowboy and he quits his Tech job moves learns how to make boots creates this company called chisos and he was telling me the other day he didn't he didn't he didn't say this but I got this read on him that he's a little burnt out he was like the company's like growing 10 to 15% a year I own the whole thing and he was explaining his vision he was like there's Tas which are like kind of cheap but they sell hundreds of millions of dollars for the boots it's a startup and then there's like bespoke boot makers who are just Mom and Pop stores he's like I want to be a little bit closer I want to be closer to bespoke than than toova I don't want to be uh NE I don't want to be cheap like I need the highest quality and I refuse to sacrifice that quality but I want to I want to build this into a huge company and I was like do you spend on marketing do you do this and he's like no we don't do anything I just make the greatest boots and I Google the boot name chiso boots and like Reddit and all these other companies or all these other like forums are talking about this is the best boot on Earth and I see all this and it starts formulating in my brain I'm like this is it my friend you have it like the hard part is done like surely there's some type of like nerds out there that could help make this company big but I thought I'd bring this to you because I criticized the D Toc World a bit when well I have that criticism often uh about the this world and how there's 's not enough emphasis on product creation and story and things like this and it's mostly just Arbitrage and I came across this and I was like that's an example of something that I think I don't know anything about this world but I think could be blown up and be made made pretty huge yeah this is really cool by the way great branding by this guy so like go to their website it's very clean and like this like saw in half video like what I like about this is a I love that story of moving to Mexico to like apprentice and actually like learn the craft and I just kind of want that to be like a TV show but the second thing is um sometimes the people who are really good at making the product can't show it there's a little story so Ben's brother bought into a restaurant or like helped co-found a restaurant um where they live in in Phoenix so we go there for lunch and we're there and it's his brother and it's and I was like so why'd you do this he's like well the chef is amazing he's he's like you know recognized as like one of the best chefs so he he's this great chef he's like I just really believe in this guy's product and I thought we could turn it into a business he's like the problem is when you partner with these artists sometimes they don't a know anything about how to like convey that or show that and B they just won't compromise like price or quality or whatever this uncompromising it's like bro like we need to um like we need to make this like we're so expensive compared to everybody else like that's but nobody really uh he's like we're so expensive and that's hurting our business and I was talking to him and he's like he's like for example he holds up these tortillas he's like you know these tortillas like these tortillas cost this much I forgot what it was like whatever let's call it this pretend two two bucks it's $2 a tortilla most people get their tortillas it's like 20 cents and I was like well why and he's like because he demands that every morning we get fresh tortillas that are trucked in from Mexico and I was like wow that's awesome why don't you tell anybody that and he's like what I'm like yeah you should like tell people the we truck our tortillas in fresh from Mexico every morning I gladly pay $2 if I knew that your problem isn't that the chef is not willing to compromise and cut cost your problem is that you're not marketing this in a way that actually tells the story of why I should why this food tastes better than anyone else and why this is fresher why this is more authentic why this is better why this is higher priced and um so that became like a little like one of our our core things in my my little team me Ben Diego we talk about this all the time we go uh we call it the tortilla principle it's like uh we when we look at business businesses that we're either going to buy or own businesses it's like where are we Trucking in tortillas fresh from Mexico and are we doing a good job of telling that story and almost always the answer is no like the things you do in your business that are like the Blood Sweat and Tears to do something great you take for granted because they just seem like table Stakes for you and you're not even telling the world about why you do that or what you do there why you're different than anybody else why you've gone the extra mile there yeah Joe shman one of my favorite copywriters he was like I I used to sell so many of these particular watches I forget which company it was cast IO maybe uh and they were like we and he was like we make this out of this aluminum or they the Casio was explaining to Joe Suman the copywriter how they make their watch because he was like tell me everything so I learn and he was like y we we use the space the space grade aluminum to make this watch and he was like wait so this aluminum is strong enough for spaceships he's like yeah but like every watch company ever uses the exact same stuff he's like so and and then they were like we and then this courtz movement is special for this reason but again every company uses that he's like Space Age aluminum precise quartz movement like that and that became like the that is what sold a lot of Casio Casio watches Casio the makers it's called the knowledge complex when you know too much about it that you think that that's not interesting and Joe sugerman an outsider copywriter was like no this is so interesting and that's what someone needs to do with if Google will Roman that's the founder but dude look at his website you you started your story with this guy worked in Tech had an everyday job wasn't for quit his job moved to Mexico for 3 years to learn the art of boot making guess what not on his website I know three years of life three years of marketing collateral that he's not using right like that's a thousand days of his life that he's not putting on the website like even if you even if you click down the more tab right it's like more our story you go toor it's like true small business how am will I'm a hardworking guy passionate about craftsmanship guess what everybody says that guess what everybody hasn't done moved to Mexico for three years and apprenticed in this boot Factory I was like I was like will do you use Reddit he goes uh I don't really know how to work it I go let me show you something if you Google what's the most if Google comfortable cowboy boot Reddit the top post someone asked that and chisos the Top Line it says this is the most comfortable boot I've ever worn and there's 117 comments agreeing with that top post and he was like oh that's awesome he like saw that I was like are you insane man this is it you have it also this guy doesn't have a Tik Tok is that right I don't think so does he not know that like every Niche nostalgic profession is now like the coolest kid on Tik Tok like if you plant like beets or something like that if you have a beet Farm dude there's like Victorian porn where it's like people like wearing like you know like old doll dresses like you know what I mean like there's like the weirder the better and the more physical real world the better go look at Epic gardening right like if he wants to do this like go go teach people about this go show them the process show them how the factory looks like show them cutting a boot in half like stuff like that I think would be would be just fire on on Tik Tok and I I only brought it up because I the story was amazing I also want to go on record as like this might be like another like of our like uh feather in the Caps where we called it moment because I do love their boots it's so good and I love meeting people who 80% of the work is done this other part A lot of people can help you and and get it done um and and definely not that 80% of the work is done cuz like actually 80% of the work is the marketing and like operations but it's they did the one hard thing that others aren't will really willing to do yeah that's what I mean like it's like a great product like the product is good uh did this in my sushi restaurant so the the restaurant that we started we started as an online a virtual restaurant right before door Dash and Uber Eats but we like created a website we would drive people to the website and you would order sushi and like we would make it in a commissary kitchen and we' deliver it to you in like under 20 minutes and so we had our menu and we go and we meet with uh Dan arieli do you know who that is the author yeah he wrote this book called predictably irrational so he's a behavioral Economist and he just happened he was a teacher at Duke we were Duke students so we get in with him and like normally companies pay him whatever six figure seven figure contracts to like consult with them he's willing to meet with us because we're just like three you know dumb asses that were like in at like at school and we go Dan we want to like drive more sales you're the guy what should we do show me your menu we look we show him the menu and he goes oh okay you want to you want to make more money um you you want more people to buy from you raise your prices go what he goes uh we go but like you know we thought we could make it more accessible more affordable that was the whole pitch we won the business plan competition by telling people we're going to make sushi more accessible more affordable and he goes yeah but when somebody looks at this they just see cheap sushi um so guess what people don't want which is the worst Sushi cheap sushi the worst type of su exactly so he's like that's not what you want he goes and so we and by the because we were the reason I bring this up we were an online restaurant so we could literally AB test now we didn't have the tooling we weren't like smart enough to even know what an AB test was I didn't even know the phrase but we would literally switch it by day so we would do day one we would show menu a day two we would show menu B and then we would look at the number at the end of the day be like how do we do and um so we raised prices and not only did Revenue go up but conversion rate went up so we we actually converted more customers and more money per customer like oh [ __ ] okay Dan what else can we do he goes um Sushi and the wine industry I forgot the name he had for it but he goes they create their own language around their products and we go but that's why it's so inaccessible I don't understand what any of that stuff means he goes exactly and if you do know what it means you feel smart and you feel like an Insider and we were like what and he goes so we tested three three models of language so we had what we had before which was what we thought the accessible version right uh the Philadelphia roll salmon and cream cheese wrapped up tastes great right that was like literally like how we used to write and then we had the next one which was language he's like so same Joe Sugarman principle he's like um do you freeze your salmon and we're like no awesome fresh never Frozen Atlantic hand you hand caught salmon or something like that right same roll same salmon more words boom conversion right up we're like oh god it works this is true and then we we just kept doing the same thing with the whole menu and it showed me two things one man restaurants should really AB test their menus and I don't think they do a good enough job of this and B uh you can like the same thing can be sold just with uh with better words with better marketing and like dramatically change your business it's not like just something you slap on at the end and that's that's good enough it's like no you will get this like multiplier on on on success based on how well you do this one thing it's not just like a 10% Improvement it was like a 2X 3 type of improvements you could get by stacking these on top of each other what was your cute way of explaining cream cheese um I don't know I think we might have just not even not even mentioned it just put it at the end you know like and and a smooth you know the other stuff yeah whatever yeah I remember like and the funny thing was with salmon it was like we were so excited about fresh never frozen salmon it was like our calling card not like those other guys they just frozen frozen salmon um and we used to go even further we we don't even have a freezer in our restaurant that's how fresh this is and then we like met uh the chef and he was like you need to freeze of salmon it kills the bacteria we like oh [ __ ] sorry whoops well and also flash frozen salmon to kill all of all of the bugs and like all like have you ever seen the documentaries when they when the Japanese catch the salmon that they're going to use they drop it into the boat that has it like it's a freezer like they freeze them like you know like spot so like I I remember like learning of that I'm like oh [ __ ] everything I've been told to is a lie um all right that's it that was a good pod what do you think yeah I mean this was a good uh it's a good catch up it's fun to fun to hang out fun to talk and I feel like I don't know if other people feel this way but just debriefing interesting people we met and the way their mind works or the little schemes they got into is kind of my favorite thing well I stole it from you where I actually started writing like write notes um right after I meet someone even if you don't refer back to it it's pretty good it's good um all right that's it that's a pod [Music]

I'm glad you guys invited me here because you're slummed down with like the Ecom millionaires again this is like a make a wish type of episode for us you [Music] know there's really two things that I need to talk to you about there's two reasons you're here number one I cannot believe that you sell hundreds of millions of dollars of this stupid little wallet this is unbelievable to me it's been blowing my mind ever since I found that out and now you're here finally to give us some answers and two um I think you're very opinionated when it comes to Ecom you don't hold back you don't pull punches and so we like that we like spicy guests and I think you're you're going to be able to have both of those things for us I think you you should smack Sean right now for con stupid little wallet did you hear that stupid little wallet I'm just trying to get him fired up I told you he gets he gets fiery he gets feisty so I wanted to you know stir the PT a little bit you you better play nice I'll dox your your e-commerce brand true he know he's got he's got some uh he knows too much he's got some comprom on dude I've been a uh I've been a ridge wallet owner since 2016 or 17 you know Ridge uh sponsored the hustle well dude thank you for the support and you guys were super early for newsletter sponsorships like we probably run like a pretty big sponsorship like ecosystem now we sponsor like a ton of newsletters like you know YouTubers obviously you guys were like one of the first people selling that ad space so yeah and you know what I learned about your guys's industry well just any marketer who's Savvy is people like you and Sean you guys know how to find early interesting stuff and you take all of the risks and you and you just you understand the Arbitrage like the underpriced opportunity and so we had a lot of smart people who would buy these ads with us and I'm like I can't believe they're doing this this is so unproven and then I realized that that's like the theme of a smart marketer which is throw dollars at a variety of things and then exhaust it once everyone else comes and finds it yeah it's at Arbitrage right like everything's attenion so if I'm giving Facebook at this point $15 per thousand views and if I can get a better price off of newsletters or influencer or YouTube like it's all just an attention economy and it's so funny to watch that like pendulum swing back linear TV like the TV your parents probably watch is so cheap to run ads on because nobody's buying it so like you know I'll probably spend what's like the CPM of linear TV a dollar like oh wow it's like cuz there's all these channels right there's been like you know thousands of channels that have come out that like have 800 people who watch them so like you just buy like big blocks of random ad space that are just very male male targeted um and like yeah literally like a dollar to reach a thousand people do you know what our best performing ad channel is our marketing channel for my brand postcards but you would not believe it postcards it's not super scalable like you can't just like spend to Infinity on it but you know you put a dollar in you'll get eight or $ n dollar out of Revenue it's amazing uh that's great you use post-pilot post-pilot yeah nice so okay so Sean we should start at the start so what's cool about y'all story is you sell a a simple product it wasn't like some some Mark Zuckerberg you know Innovation or anything like that and you've scaled it up you built it Brick by Brick but you said you started in the Ser in like a s of sort of a sweaty Services business you didn't start the company and you didn't start off in the product game so can we just do your story for a little bit and then I want to brainstorm other D Toc ideas with you afterwards but first let's do let's do your story sure um yeah you got that right uh the show is my first million so I made my first million dollars off of an ad agency so you know Facebook ads came out in 2012 that was like when it was probably like an open Beta anybody could join and I learned how to do Facebook ads I worked at an agency with my CMO Conor and the agency sucked like you know it was 200 200 people working there probably 500 clients no you were an employee yeah yeah I was just an employee and then I was like oh I should do this I could do a better job of this the Ad Agency I worked at the average client was around for four months so imagine that sales cycle like it takes 60 days to onboard them they're they get 30 days worth of work and they're like this sucks and then 30 days to offboard the average client was four months right and I'm like imagine if I just did this but I kept them for a year I'm like I'll make so much money right so I start an ad agency I have 10 clients um so you're saying this like it's simple So you you're working at a Ad Agency how old are you roughly at this time I was 22 you're 22 years old you're not like a marketing expert yet right you're like you know you're learning on the job I would assume yeah yeah but like it was it's kind of like Tik Tok shop is today like nobody's an expert right like it's it's a brand new thing that came out like I was we're probably two and a half years in the Facebook ads people still thought Instagram followers were the most important metric and they're like wanting to run campaigns to get followers right right so and was your agency super bullish on Facebook as a Channel or it was kind of like this new thing that you know you got really interested in because it was new but was the whole agency like hey this is going to be a really big deal yeah it was like a cookie cutter D Toc agency like in the Heyday this is probably like 2015 right so Facebook was Facebook and email was the services we were providing like there was no other services maybe there was one guy doing Google ads right but it was really all in on Facebook as like this brand new channel and if I could go back in time I would have been even deeper into Facebook like the biggest challenge with Ridge uh that mean we're skipping up a couple years in the future but like we try to diversify too fast like I was doing newsletter sponsorships and like they worked I should have put all of my dollars into Facebook back then up until like 2020 um I would have just been better off putting as much money that as possible but and ridge was one of your clients were they an early client yeah so I had 10 so I'm at an agency it sucks I think I can do a better job me and my CMO uh Connor we end up starting an agency together we take 10 clients with us um eight of them you have never heard of okay like they've just you know gone extinct uh one of them was Ridge and then one of them was actually mudwater which has actually gone on to crush it like we did their Google ads or at some point like in 2016 or whatever but yeah so we end up taking Ridge over fatherson best friend they start this business they get to like $5 million a year in sales and they are you know like the dad was a special ed teacher like you know Daniel was going to go to go be an accountant and this thing just kind of caught fire and he really didn't want to be an accountant so like their expectations for the brand when they got to $5 million a year they're like this is the best thing that's ever happened right and me and Conor are being hella young and I'm like I think we can get to $15 million a year I think we can get this thing to $30 million a year I remember telling Connor I'm like I think we can do $100 million a year selling this wallet and he looks me down in the face and he's like there is no [ __ ] way in hell we're going to do that right this was like 2017 but they didn't really want to run it all that much anymore right like they didn't want to manage people so I'm like cool we'll do everything else so my agency kind of gets built around Running Ridge wallet uh we do their customer service we do their product importation we do all of their marketing we their web dev uh and then I'm charging them like $200,000 a month like all of the money is coming from Rich wallet they end up being like 60% of all Agency billables for my for my tiny agency and at a certain point they're like hey we should just merge right um so me and Conor take an equity stake everyone in my agency just goes inhouse to Ridge I end up selling off the agency to one of the people who was running it and that was probably 2018 and since then Bridge has gone from you know $30 million a year to over2 200 that's amazing look if you're planning your marketing for the next year I've got you covered HubSpot just dropped their state of marketing report every year the team surveys and interviews over 1,200 marketers from around the world they compile everyone's insight and turn it into one big report you can directly steal the strategy from big companies like a16z assana and apply them to your own business so if you want it check check it out in the link below in the description now back to the show what I what I love about that story is that it sounds like when you were running the agency like almost like nobody would in a business school would recommend hey you're running this marketing agency and then for one client you're going to start doing customer service you know Logistics support all all these other things it sounds like wrong to do that it's like how One customer is going to make up 60% of your billables from a business school perspective that would be like a bad move but dares said something once on the podcast he goes with my first business ju he goes I I got I got mixed up later he goes just because I was ignorant doesn't mean I was wrong meaning I didn't know the right way to do it but my instincts actually were leading me in the right direction it just wasn't you know I didn't have like some sophisticated game plan and maybe it wasn't typical but it was my instincts were correct and it sounds like your instincts were correct that you should just keep leaning into the ridge thing even though it was like maybe not what a normal a normal marketing agency ever would have done most CL suck like if you guys have ever done client work like most clients fight with you they don't pay you like they're always trying to fire you right and rides a business was ran by really cool guys who didn't want to take any like reins away from us they were very happy with the $5 million year business and they're like we could always go back to shipping the orders ourselves right like I mean the guys are like you know Buddhists like raised raised Buddhist their whole lives I think that's part of it but they were very much like hey this is a good thing these guys are growing this business let's give them more responsibility and you know you can't really exit agency businesses for all that much right one reason why we went all in on Ridge and did the merger is like an agency is probably worth Maybe One X client contracts and like maybe at the peak it was twox client contracts right so like if your client's you know if you have a guaranteed million dollars in Revenue you might be able to sell it for a million or two where Ridge at the time were like fucking1 billion year business right here we're going to grow this thing the [ __ ] Moon uh so it just made sense to put all our chips in that basket what was the metric that you saw that gave you the aha moment where you were like all right they're doing 5 million now but this could be 30 this could be 100 was there one or two metrics or was it just a guess what what was that research process like it just it just seemed like they could always put another dollar into Facebook and it could work right like the limiting factor wasn't like marketing or awareness it was like the operations of the business right we ended up like we had a year where we did have any wallets cuz we couldn't keep them in stock so like we went from 15 million to18 million one year and that was just because we couldn't make enough of the [ __ ] product and I'm like you know so often demand is the thing that stops these Brands like you can only get to so big of an Tam and that wasn't the case here uh you know we we did like a wearable and it was so hard to get people to buy the wearable like the CAC on Facebook was $400 back then okay it was like so [ __ ] hard to get people to buy these wearables where the wallet it was like a $6 C like we could just put up a new ad and they were just static images and they were just selling so that was the metric man that's like an interesting um process because a lot of people myself included will say focus focus focus get it right make it great it's going to take a decade plus but your story is more so like I tried this I tried this I tried this none of it worked this thing was clearly the winner I should go all in on this is that what your recommendation is well my recommendation as a person trying to make it is you should make the best best decision at the time so whatever the facts are when the facts change make a different decision right uh strong beliefs held held Loosely so like I'm like I'm at an agency I could have just like did that grind and be like I'm going to be a VP at this agency when I'm 26 I'll make like 200 Grand a year but I was like no these people suck I think the best decision for me is to just do what they're doing better right and then from the agency to Ridge I'm like run an agency business I'm like running an agency sucks the ridge thing seems to be going better so should just do that instead I should find a way to to to en crunch myself inside of this business and then at Ridge it was just like I mean for so long we did not launch any other products for eight years it was just selling more of the wallet because that's what was working as soon as it started to get a little hard then we pivoted everything else which is funny because I would have thought early on I would have the paralysis of analysis would have been like well there's not that many wallet like you're like if you told me $200 million a year in Revenue I would say well you've you've sold every man in America a wallet like there are no more wallet buyers you know what I mean that's like what of my uneducated self-limiting belief a little bit would have been on that if you said2 200 million a year and like well there are no wall there are no no more people who need a wallet dude it's a weirdly big Tam like the reason why like we in you know in retrospect I can tell you all the reasons why Ridge wallet worked it's a 10 billion dollar a year Tam Okay and like most of that is luxury Brands lvmh sells like $4 billion a year in men's wallets like curing they own Gucci they sell a ton of men's wallets but then tapestry which owns coach coach does a billion dollar a year in men's sales so that's men's accessories no men are buying those products they're all gifts that are given to them and nobody's ever excited about getting those products so the reason why like I I'm very public that I think Rich can get to a billion dollars in revenue is because tapestry has a men's business doing a billion dollars a year in Revenue with nobody loyal or passionate about that so I'm just going to make whatever they make uh in all of our cool colors and our cool materials and you know I think it's been so sexy to be talking about tech and AI these past 10 years right or you know tech for 10 years AI for 10 months but I was at like the all-in summit and I'm looking at those guys and like the products they're talking about exist inside their phones right like they exist inside some server somewhere but they're all wearing [ __ ] cool suits and watches and leather belts and I'm like okay I'll just sell them all that [ __ ] right like I'm just going to sell like all the like the most practical thing ever because also smart people don't enter the space right the reason why ridgewall was able to be so successful is because we're the only people running Facebook ads for wallets like then there's been a bunch of other like people who've started up and like and have tried they've all end up going out of business because it's really difficult to get right right like there is no repeat business you can't like believe that the LTV will come save you later it's very much like can you tactically acquire customers profitably every single day hey uh Hey Brown Sean White Sean's got that immigrant energy that I love he's got you know what I mean like he's got the what do you call it the Korean restaurant own I call I call it the a Korean a Korean convenience store owner energy you know it's just like there's not like too too much think overthinking it it was like well you guys are all wearing this I'll just sell that you know like yeah and I think you'll keep wearing this so you know M has these great quotes where he's like his his main thing is like instead of trying to be brilliant just avoid stupidity or he'll be like you know the best thing in the world is stupid competition and we just have not much and stupid competition it sounds like that's part of what in retrospect made Ridge work was you you were like hey look we took the simple idea and um there's not a lot of other really smart you know DDC marketers that were doing this and so we were able to to make hey yeah totally man I mean and and to this day the best DC marketers are working on stuff like you know ag1 right like they're selling supplements and it's because it's a better business like undoubtedly if there's an LTB tied to your business like it's going to be better it's going to be more valuable it's going to trade at a higher multiple but the other thing is like the best marketers have have more or less left the industry right like in 2021 running an Ecom brand was incredibly cool it has gotten less cool every single year so there's less people doing it there's less voices there's less people talking about it it's because it's [ __ ] hard okay okay I un jokingly call it like the the blue collar work it's like you know everyone wants to be shipping cool AIA products or everybody wants to be shipping you know something that isn't physical boxes to people's doors of products you actually have to like make everyone wants to build you know the services of whatever so anyway yeah over the past four years it's gotten really uncool to do what I do do do do you guys on 200 million in Revenue are you able to make a good cash flow and profit or you know I know so many friends who have these companies and their numbers are huge but they cash is always an issue are you able to manage this well and or at that scale do you still struggle I think the reason why you guys asked me to be here is to talk about the fact that you can in fact make a profit running e-commerce Brands so uh ridg has never raised any money we have no debt so every dollar in this business every dollar in my balance sheet his profit that has been reinvested uh I've been able to make millions of dollars a year for the past couple of years running this business so yeah it can definitely be done man like I I I bought a house in La directly because of selling Wallets on the internet give us a sense of the timeline so you said kind of like I don't know it was 2016 is right when you when you guys merged or you took over the brand but can you just give us kind of like a year one five 5 million when you when you started working with them then it went to 10 then it went to 22 then you know give us a timeline yeah and I'm [ __ ] horrible at timelines so I'll give it my best it's it's basically been it's like a 50% keger since I started working with the business so I think they did a Kickstarter in 2013 the first year they do like a million of Revenue in 2015 they probably do two or three when I meet them 2016 they do like five million bucks so I think it went from five to 10 to 15 to 18 and that's like the hardest year of the business when it went from 15 to 18 that was like we had no inventory with this massive [ __ ] tax bill that sucked that was probably 2018 or 19 when that happened 2020 we do $50 million so I might I that must have been 2018 it must have been 30 so 18 to 30 to 50 and then we then 50 this the covid year so we went from 50 to 100 and then it's been like yeah I mean last year was a I'll just say a multi hundred million doll year so let me let me let me let me recap that for the listener so you started in 15 I didn't hear what you said but in 2016 5 million and then each year after that was 5 million 10 15 18 30 50 100 with last year being multi 100 that's incredible growth yeah yeah something like that uh so it's been super fun man um you know and Sam you brought up have I sold every wallet in America that was like one of your concerns right uh so like I said it's a massive Tam right and I always say like we're a great uncle gift like like you guys are going to go to Christmas or you guys are going to go to [ __ ] a birthday or whatever and you have to buy some guy in your life a present and you don't know his size right the ridge wallet's a perfect price point you can get one on sale today for like 76 bucks and it is sizeless and like every guy in your life you'd be like hey look it has your favorite sports team on it or it has carbon fiber or whatever else right so it's a perfect Uncle gift and most of our products are probably sold as gifts right some woman in their life buying it for some guy in their life and the wallet are about half of Revenue right now the other half of Revenue is all the other stuff we've launched so the biggest unlock we've ever had was in 2022 we started selling men's wedding bands and once again this is a category where people thought I was so [ __ ] dumb to sell men's wedding bands they're like it it's a commodity good like who the hell is buying this the first year we do eight figures it is the highest margin fastest growing part of my company is selling men's wedding bands on the internet so let's let's talk about this cuz in this group chat that you you have which is like a bunch of bunch of DDC Brands I don't I don't know what the cut off is I think I'm like below whatever the cut off was supposed to be but you let me in which was nice of you you're the uh like the Charisma higher yeah exactly I'm the personality higher so so I um you you talked about like going into new categories and like the wedding band was obviously a smash success you've said the wearable thing maybe wasn't as big of a success and you had this kind of interesting way of looking at it cuz I just thought Ridge wallets that kind of like the the sort of carbon fiber metal wallet company and you were talking about like Mont Blanc and you were talking about these other almost like luxury accessory Brands and that was the vision you had for the company when did that vision kick in um so like when did you reframe what the company is because I think entrepreneurs we hear stories where somebody already has the vision and they already have the right frame and it sounds beautiful and big and and really appealing um but at the beginning they don't always have that you know Mark Zuckerberg there's a video of him on a couch somewhere and somebody's like are you going to expand past colle he's like no that wouldn't be cool and now he's like got satellites above India giving people internet so they can use Facebook like you know your vision expands as you grow um when did your the vision kind of change or when did you reframe it and secondly how do you think about going into new categories yeah well I'm a very paranoid person so like in 2018 I'm like this is going to end we have to [ __ ] find some other [ __ ] to sell so we got into backpacks and phone cases all this stuff pretty early in 2018 um and we the first year we did $4 million in backpack sales or maybe it was three million it was like a big chunk of Revenue and we canceled that program because I was too stupid to know that was like actually a good amount of backpacks I was like I'm like the wall is doing $20 million how come we can't do $20 million in backpacks in retrospect we've sent relaunched backpacks so I was just too stupid right so we were always looking for new products to sell mostly because I was worried that I was going to sell every wallet to every man in America but as you learn more about the industry like the very common thing is very large hold is holding lots of accessory Brands like lvmh is just an accessory brand like everything inside their portfolio just sells accessories mostly to women but there are occasionally popups of like very strong men's accessory Brands M Block is owned by richmont they own cardier like V is the strongest men's accessory brand and they do $500 million a year you think it's going to be pens pens are like 18% of Revenue it's mostly just like small leather goods right and it's across the world people buy each other gifts like wallets backpacks and belts and everything else um so it's there's a Playbook here it's like you have to find a group of customers who like you you have to continue to make product that they like and sell it into them and I am more ruthless with product expansion than I think a lot of brands are and I think more people should just try they're really worried about hurting brand and I'm like your customers never [ __ ] think about you like you're lucky if somebody is mad to launch something like you know I always go to uh like bck is one of my favorite Brands like they make lighter and they make pens and they make razors right and we buy all of those products independently and they're best in I didn't even think of the I didn't even think of three yeah but you saying that I'm like oh it's same yeah yeah and they're the best in class in all three of those if you want a disposable razor or a cheap pen or a lighter they that's the only one they they own those markets um and it's just because the guy had a plastic factory and he's like he's it's it's a French company and they're actually they got into tattoo removal now right right like they're making like they just bought a bunch of tattoo companies cuz they're like yeah whatever takes plastic we're just going to do those things right and it doesn't violate anything in your brain because you just like that's just the way it's always been so I think it's more elastic than like than a lot of people want to admit and Brand's die of being too rigid by that like all birds should have got into [ __ ] bedding and like all these different type of things but they didn't so now they're just a [ __ ] dead shoe company right like you should just be so ruthless with that product expansion you're very charismatic guy you you're you have a lot of uh interesting parts of your personality that I enjoy what attributes would you say are most responsible for the rigid success you think uh one it's a very trust forward organization it's a very transparent organization when I say trust forward six of us own it you know three of them are fatherson best friend like literally would die for each other and then me and my CMO Conor I I lived with him for [ __ ] five years like the guy we I was talking last night there was a time when we were running the agency where we did not have $1,000 like we would have to take he his dad gave him a car and it was like a 1997 Honda Civic that smelled and like paint was peeling Windows didn't work we would take it to meetings we would have to park it behind building so people didn't see us get out of this [ __ ] junky car and you know tying it to that it's like not being not being scared to go back to zero right like I'm from like a very poor bad area where kids died of Fentanyl overdosis and like I lived in a Flop House with like [ __ ] like it was like 14 guys living in uh bunk beds when I moved to LA and so I'm like dude not scared to go back there so just more more willing to take risk things are never that bad also being willing to eat [ __ ] I'm like bro if I have to [ __ ] be a waiter we'll figure it out right um yeah so I yeah that that fortitude like not being like so egoo tied to whatever the [ __ ] you're doing if I if I have to pack boxes I'm going to pack boxes right what are the ways people get uh Ecom wrong so we've you talked about all birds right it was a a product that was hot and now the stock is you know dead there's you know a bunch of other kind of famous examples of that and then there's companies like yours which is keep scaling profitably you know never took a dollar of debt never took a dollar of investment and made it work um what are the kind of give us like your your version of the dos and don'ts and I maybe just start with the don'ts like the dumb [ __ ] that people do the bad decisions that people make or the the common trap you see people fall into cuz I'm sure you know your that's your network as Ecom so you see the full spectrum people who totally flop people who grind away for years and get nothing out of it and people who Excel and succeed yeah so you can't you can't outmuscle a tamam so like understand what you're selling and how big the market actually is I see amazing operators waste time with horrible opportunities right like like the Tam is what the Tam is and if you're like the number one [ __ ] garlic PR preller like that's kind of a meme in the community like dude I'm like you're executing ruthlessly to be the number one gar garlic press seller that is worse than being the 12th best creatine gummy right because that market is exponentially growing there's LTB tied to it like so many people just waste energy and time on these horrible [ __ ] product categories so you can't you can't beat a tam you're not better than the trend so bone broth there was companies that exploded got to $80 million in r venue it was like dude which're this is the new way people are going to consume calories bone broth that is now at a 30-year low because that's not the cool thing anymore right people same with keto stuff yeah exactly so there's a guy from uh IQ bar his name's will he's incredibly smart he talks about his uh Trend surface area so it's like look people talk with their luck surface area he's like I make products to have as much Trend surface area as possible so if keto's Hot I'll be keto if gluten-free is hot I'll be gluten-free if it's sugar that's cool non sugar like whatever I'll I'll make those products to just hit whatever the trend is and I'll just change my packaging so I'm always top of trend and you're not better than the trend right so that's the point I'm trying to make is you can write it up but as soon as it crashes you'll crash with it and then my my third one the most controversial one is that LTV isn't real like lifetime value only works if you're alive so most brands die waiting for LTV right and what you mean by that is you got to be profitable early on on that customer you acquired if you acquire the customer for $200 and you only made you know $20 and you're saying oh the I the LTV it'll all pay off that's kind of what you're talking about right versus the way you guys do it is you're trying to be profitable either first purchase or are you guys profitable first purchase or is it like you know a month or two later where are you guys at dude I have to be profitable in the first purchase you think people are coming back to buy a second wallet in a month it's like I'm like dude the the LTV from wallet customers is like maybe in 90 days I get 10% so like it's very much I have to be I have to turn not not not a contribution margin like actual true paying for all my fixed costs every time I sell a wallet to somebody can we play a game called the change my opinion and this is for both of you guys I have a bone to pick with your industry I I think Sean's heard me with this Spiel before what what frustrates me sometimes uh not exactly you guys but I'm going to use you as an example but people who they all they worry about is like the CAC and the LTV and the The Tam of these industries or and they don't spend any time actually thinking is this product awesome is this the best you know like is this truly solving a problem and um it bothers me sometimes that it's more of an Arbitrage not exactly thinking about can I create a widget that makes a customer's life better and is of high quality I wish that more people in this industry sort of talked about that a bit more do you think that's a fair criticism or where am I wrong on this dud know I mean I think it's a fair criticism my industry's been washed out though so like the people you're talking about probably have all laughed it's there's so few people left in Ecom like like Sean brought up like the group chat maybe two people respond every single day and one of them's meab like it's it's like we're we're at like a a multi a multi-year low of interest in the industry so like yeah all those people have left the people who are still here in shipping dude I bring up hexclad you guys want to talk about like amazing um yeah so like I'm very close you tweet about them all the time and like they inspired me because you said they like worked for three years finding the perfect pan okay so when I met Danny it was 2020 they they didn't have a website he says they did but like you couldn't check out on the [ __ ] website okay they they were [ __ ] selling pans at trade shows and like county fairs cooking up eggs themselves right in Costco Road Show so not even in Costco they had to pay to show up at Costco and [ __ ] cook up these eggs and they from 2020 they'll do I mean it's doc at this point over a half a billion dollars a year like they they got to hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars and annual turnover with 100 million plus in profit Danny will [ __ ] shoot me for saying all this stuff but like I think it's all pretty pretty rare public you know Gordon Gordon joined the brand they have Fox as an investor now pre all that they were doing nine figures in e a year okay didn't Gordon Ramsey like write a huge check he didn't just like sort of join the brand he like invested a a pretty sizable amount or was he part of a round or was it him personally investing in it that's all public there's like there's like a thing he came in with Fox on some on something and like you know because fo it's like a three-way deal fox wants to give him money to make shows and he wants to get more equity in hexclad so it's like a big three-way deal gotcha gotcha dude I have like 12 hexclad pants in my are they awesome Sean they're great you know I don't know if they're the best pans cuz I don't tried 100 pans but they're way better than the pans I had before and to the point where I bought a second set of them because I was like these are great I I'm happy with these pants yeah and they put years into that product development like they actually SP like they care about their customers what it comes down to is respecting your customers if you're just like that's why I don't like info products like if you respect your customers if you're just like trying to ARB them or like you know we have a customer name uh so our customer is everyday Dad we call him Ed and I'm like almost every meeting I'm like are we respecting Ed are we delivering value to Ed right everyone has an ed in their life think about like your guys' brothers or your dads he's just like a guy he likes widgets and like he loves fishing and like he loves NFL like that's [ __ ] Ed and I'm like look Ed has Ed has paid for everything in my entire life we need to take care of ED we want to make make sure Ed gets like the best coolest [ __ ] possible that we give him Great Value and great deals and that's what he clad did and like we talk about like I think this industry it's a bad rap because so many people have entered it and so few people have left with any amount of money or like the people who did leave with money like it was like a greater fool Theory they were just tricking somebody to give them money and then they bailed out but then there's companies like hexclad where they'll be a 50-year brand they'll be a generational brand and they're [ __ ] crushing it so it's possible they're buying Super Bowl ads like I mean this is you know a they were bootstrapped up until like two years ago like a bootstrap brand getting that done it's [ __ ] amazing yeah I think Sam what you said is true that marketing skill is the core competency for most of the winners in this space most there's a there's a couple who just really nailed product or Community right and then they just they they built slowly Brick by Brick over over the over a decade but for the most part the people you'll hear about and the people you'll meet they're great because they are great at doing Facebook ads and Google ads or now Tik Tok uh content and so that's true but at the same time you're like oh I hate that it's this CA to LTV thing well it's like guess what when you sit down with your team you're like how do we raise LTV right like there's some natural gravity like Sean saying like you buy a wallet every seven years you're not really going to change that but like for my product you do buy it more way more often you know in the first six months we double our double the amount that they they paid us on the first order right so it's really it's a it's uh it's it's a movable number right we can actually affect that and then you're like all right well how do we increase LTV it's like yeah you could spam them with emails you could spam them with text messages but guess what the better way to do it is to make an amazing product that they're going to want to buy again and like lower the return rate how do you lower the return rate to get more profit right it's like make a better quality product and so I think that when you that for anybody who's actually going to try to win you will have to make an amazing product otherwise you won't be able to do the the ad Arbitrage you're trying to do because um how else could you increase the LTV if everyone hates your product or it's not doing anything for them and so you know I think the the people who stick around and actually win in the long run are the ones who who do what you yeah I think those are good answers to the to the question I think that um like you know when I see someone making like a boost your testosterone like thing or I'm like dude I don't know if any of this works or if they're just really good at making a label that's appealing and so I like start to lose confidence in the industry as a whole abely what actually and that's actually I'm actually curious if you guys have any of these like DTC Brands where you're like this product is amazing and so it's actually really good to hear that hexclad is one of them uh do you guys have any other favorites well going back to the supplement side um a lot of it is like I mean a lot of this work is being done like the the co-manufacturers right like there's co-packers that actually do all the formulation so a lot of times people are just showing up and buying stuff off the shelf so so if you're getting any sort of supplement like it's probably the same suppl white labeled 100 times and that's just like the way the industry works so you know I would put hard Goods in a special category and like we talk about d2c Brands I mean all of my favorite fashion brands are small and independently owned right like does that count like this is Buck Mason these pants are James purse right like I just got a suit from Billy Reed like these are all small independently owned companies right that are that are running they have Shopify websites ises that count of D to see right it's it's very much like there's there's a a black box of bad rap products and I think a lot of it is supplements that come from comand right or anything to do in the health and wellness space like that is like typically where there's a bunch of [ __ ] but if you buy a ridge wallet you're you're going to get what is on the package you know what I mean like right or one of our phone cases or whatever it's like a [ __ ] phone case man like it's pretty good what um who who else is crushing it so what are some DDC brands that we wouldn't know or we wouldn't really realize how how well they're doing um just because we're not in the space we're not paying attention yeah the other reason you guys called me here to talk about the wubbles okay the wubbles is [ __ ] crushing it uh the wubbles okay so what are what are the wubbles so yeah we are we are three young adult men we're not the core customer right it is a uh crocheting product so it is like you make little characters and they have licensing and like there's little education it's like basically like either it's you know young people doing it to have less screen time or it's you're doing with your kids so they have less screen time and that yeah dude when I met them they might be they might have been doing $10 million a year like they in two years they've gone from 10 to probably $150 million in Revenue like no no Capital raised they are still and I really I like them and I respect them they will not [ __ ] launch subscription boxes they're like yeah we we don't think it's that important I'm like Jesus [ __ ] Christ like if I could shoot these people I would because they won't do subscription it's like the perfect product like it is just educational it's fun it's connecting with your family like it's this movement against screen time which is like a big Trend that they can take advantage of there's every month they could have new characters they could just show up in your door you do them there's a little Community aspect it's the single best brand and execution that I've ever seen like this will be a billion doll exit because they're so [ __ ] good at it they've never raised any goddamn money just like it's two people just putting it together in North Carolina how did they even think of this like how did this get on the were they big crocheters what what is the origin story of this yeah so I think it's it's a husband and wife team I think she was just crocheting and she's like yeah I would love to have little guides and there was like an Etsy community of people like selling crochet guides and she's like she would buy them and then she'd be like okay I'm going to make my own and then she would would you know release them and then it's like oh maybe I should just sell the my my little crochet kits and Bam [ __ ] explodes dude so like if you're listening to this and you're thinking like okay I want I'm I'm not washed out I want to try e-commerce I highly recommend getting into Services first okay like you should learn how to make money on the internet via services and if the show's called my first million you you'll make your first million dollars delivering good value to people like me or like wubbles whoever else then find a trend that's very fast emerging right like I think no screen time I think creatine those are the two biggest ones for the next two or three years like if you could do a no screen time Crea te crochet kit something [ __ ] you'll figure it out right dude I've uh spent so much money on Legos lately for that no screen time uh Trend what are other no screen time I like um I feel like the microplastics is another another Trend right like and air quality yeah dude yeah so like just glass everything glass bottles glass containers what just like imagine if you could just buy a backpack and they're like we guarantee there's no plastic in it [ __ ] awesome just wrap it in paper ship to people that's another TR of think is going to be fast emerging um yeah no screen time just more physical tactical toys right like bringing back the fidget spinner but as like a focus tool right like I think there's a bunch of [ __ ] you could do in there um but anyway those are fast emerging Trends right now protein was a trend that's basically probably dead right preprotein was collagen there's always these just like pockets of success you'll find and that's the beauty of the space it's like you know what it is right now in that space um what's the what's the early boob milk uh what's that called colostrum oh my God I'm getting so many ads for colostrum yeah you know the other one will be like I think raw honey I it had like a small moment I'm sure it's going to come back right there's like a bunch of New Zealand honey companies so yeah the there's all of these like and if you if you were a Founder where would you kind of look for these do are you are you a proponent of look in your own life what are you doing or what is your wife doing that seems unusual but actually there's a passionate Community are you like I scour Etsy and Reddit is that where you would look how would you do this if you didn't know which Trend to start with right so you should look in your own life because you probably don't have the skills to actually go out there and like like you know or in I'm assuming you have no resources to actually pick a trend and double down and actually Del on those promises right so you should find something in your own life that you actually know and are passionate about if you're a more seasoned professional I think you can find those things right and really what it would be is I think reddit's dead I think etsy's dead like that's AI slop basically at this point the in ification of the internet has happened to those two websites uh I would look at literally what's happening inside of Iran like I would just move to LA and go to Iran every single day because they those are the best people at catching trends like they were antiac in [ __ ] 1997 right like that's like like they are very very early on those things um and if you're if you're not going to do that then it's like you just you have to follow the girlies on Tik Tok right like the the other one I bring up is Pilates like Pilates was a thing in 2000 it's having a massive Resurgence right now and like once again we're three young men how are we going to [ __ ] make a Pilates brand but Pilates for guys probably could be another Trend just needs a new name yeah totally well L plaus I think is what the actual name is uh or no lree something like that my R knows uh but yog yoga is a very much a downward Trend right and like this yoga was just a like a synonym for health and wellness and like you know non Just Jack dudes weight listing I think that's actually changing and it'll be something else like Pilates or or something else what are some other uh going up and going down give me like a a topic or a trend and tell me is this a buy or sell moment well look this is not a hot take this is not Scott Gallow [ __ ] but all all big box department stores like it's very very much like we just saw Joy's fabric go down we just saw Container Store go down we just saw Party City like that's going to accelerate like there's we are over commercial real estate there's too many big box stores like even Target is having a really [ __ ] hard time and my biggest wholesaler is Best Buy I crush it in Best Buy um but all of that [ __ ] is probably the the fud isn't real enough it should be even more real like Nordstroms Macy's like I think small independent uh brick and mortar shops really do work like if you're in La you go to Century City like but the I was walking around Bloomingdales and you know the like 10 years ago it was or even 20 years ago probably it was like the like the the number one place to buy women's fashion like women contemporary fashion it was the coolest thing ever I'm walking around they got blouses that are $800 and it's dead on a Saturday like nobody's [ __ ] shopping there at the at the best mall in La so I I think the fud isn't even you should we we should be even more scared that there's going to be more collapses and any any sort of commercial real estate that's like 10,000 sare feet plus that is like selling physical Goods um the other one is probably better for you candy like uh there's like VCS have really backed this like better for you artificial sugar like you go to a [ __ ] Target like there's all of these like weird artificial sugar Brands I think it's going to come out that that causes cancer on RFK is going to be pretty against it so anyway I'm probably not launching anything in there probably probably launching real sugar and that's a very hot tape that could add age really bad that like real sugar is going to make a massive Resurgence uh what do you think about like you know these uh like other people who do the same model you did services to products so for example I think the guys behind brez which is that uh I think it's a I don't know what it is like a mushroom drink or it's like an adaptogenic drink it's basically it's like it gives you a high but it's not alcohol it's like mushrooms we or something their website says brez is micro doed cannabis and mushrooms in a can a weed drink okay great so it's a weed drink those guys were agency people right I beg to be the first check in brez um there's screenshots where they said they were working on it I'm like let me be the first check because Aaron is incredibly smart he was the first person to figure out how to work with meta to have Controlled Substances be advertised so like he that's like his specialty like if you had a cannabis company you had to go through him uh in his agency called we are Lucid to actually do the Cannabis advertising on meta right he found a compliant way to do it um so he's incredibly smart Nick's an amazing operator ran a great agency that's the best model the other person is Zach uh from homestead he has a company called Hollow socks like I don't know how much time we have but to unpack the history of e-commerce e-commerce 1.0 selling random [ __ ] on the internet okay like whatever pets.com e-commerce 2.0 was Market places it was eBay versus Amazon versus everything else e-commerce 3.0 is what we consider DTC 1.0 which was like the first Brands coming online the all birds whatever else then you get DDC 2.0 which was the covid hotness the peak every Everything exploding right we are now in DDC 3.0 which is small serviced providers pivoting to brands with very lean teams and create gummies Hollow socks bre the three best examples create gummies has a team of eight people I think they'll do $40 million this year right Hollow socks is a team of five people they'll do $30 million this year selling socks mostly off of meta ads right and then brez they're public with their numbers follow Aaron on LinkedIn and I think they did $5 million last month in Revenue okay in beverage in a controlled substance that's [ __ ] insane like that company's worth $300 million today right and I think their team's incredibly small maybe maybe 20 people at this point so um yeah that is that is the best bull case for e-commerce right now service operators who've seen like the rise and fall of all these different brands have learned from them have spent their money to get good at ads right launching targeted hypers specific Brands and the three I named are the best Sean you should go go to drink bread.com do you see their website that's the prettiest website I've ever seen in my life yeah that's usually not a good thing the prettiest websites are not usually the ones that that work the best but I hear you and I am on board with that this is is one of the exceptions look at his but I you know I think what what happens is you see the front the front of the house is not always where the traffic is going so you know the front of the house is the it's kind of the hero it's the brand it's the aspirational but you run your ads and maybe you're running straight to a PDP or to a Tik Tok shop or to different things like that I think they're very heavy into Tik Tok right like that their model is the the Tik Tok blueprint which we just did an episode with with Rob from uh rob the bank about like the the Tik Tok blueprint that a bunch of the brands are using right now and I think brez is that where it's organic it's it's kind of the Tik Tok affiliate organic model where you're getting really cheap cpms because Tik Tok videos can just pop off and you know you're you're putting out thousands of pieces of content a month but uh and it's driving sales unlike the way you know I've been doing it or you've been doing it Sean which is like a lot of um you know Facebook Google ads you know you put a dollar in it's attributed exactly how much that that ad generated in revenue and you just sort of optimized from there the Tik Tok game is a little bit different it's a bit of a spray and prey game for the most part yeah so I just sent you guys this is from Aaron from brez they did 4.6 million in Revenue in month 21 January this is their Lincoln post so this is all public information that they share uh Tik Tok shop was 37 Grand Amazon Revenue was 342 uh I'm not going to read this for the audience maybe we'll just show it but um dude they're [ __ ] killing it BR is awesome well they post their p&l basically every month on uh not it's not actual p&l but like you know sort of a marketing p&l on uh on Twitter and Linkedin it's great list we could read this so total net revenue 4.5 million uh let's see that's in you said month 21 now yeah yeah dude like and literally then their ads they spent a million dollars on Facebook uh 400,000 on Google on uh Tik Tok ads they spent zero but I know that they must be spending on on the affiliate part of Tik Tok because I if I'm on Tik Tok I see bre stuff all the time and it's always an affiliate link uh you know swipe up and you can sort of buy it from there um App 11 472,000 it really seems like the one of the keys to this business like and this is not always the case but it's picking the right idea the right idea and the right angle it it it seems like there's no other way to explain how something can get to $4 million in monthly Revenue in 21 months yeah I mean and and the reason they able to be right is because they're both agency operators right like they the right people to launch a product like this and also it's so hard the reason why they're willingly sharing their p&l is they have nothing to hide and they they don't think you can beat them right and I think anybody listening to this can't beat them because are they shutting down their agency are they just going to keep trying to do both like why would you run your agency once this happens yeah I mean you end up just like you know selling it off or hiring operators I mean I mean nick uh Shackleford which was the partner in brez I mean he had you know an events business he had an agency business he had an email business I think you just you find Partners to take that over and you just put more time into this but I mean early on I was like willing to bet on these [ __ ] guys because they're the best Sam I want you to Google Nick Shackleford tattoo and um tell me if you want to compete with this guy oh my God his whole body is covered yeah from the neck down to his toe every inch of his body is covered in a tattoo he looks like a like looks like the guy from prison break dude yeah he looks like a Japanese murderer like you know how they do like the Yakuza they do like the whole that's insane including his dick I mean he actually got it done man he said it was so painful oh my God it looks horrible I mean it looks great but I don't want to do it looks painful yeah that's what I mean uh that's insane uh what do you think Ridge is worth right now oh man I mean the the the market for a brand like us is at an all-time low and like like well what's the alltime low number uh we'd probably a market clearing price is probably 300 million like I could probably clear that at the market with our growth and everything it's really hard to sell my business right now and like I'm not trying to sell my business right now right like I think we have like by the end of the decade we'll be doing like five or $600 million a year in annual revenue really driven by this big Tech rollout so like we're really big invest by already we're going to be in apple we're going to be in Verizon selling power Banks phone cases cables we already sell our wallets and lot of those places um so that's like the next evolution of the brand is just more product expansion but it's hard for me to sell my brand when solo stove is in a public company and I think they're worth maybe a hundred million on the public market right like there's they Peak a $2.1 billion doll and now they're probably the market cap today is 100 million um and they have like 400 plus million in Revenue they own Chubbies like uh it's very hard for my brand to go to market when if you squint we kind of look like them and they are they they just need to be taken private there's a lot of take private need to happen and interest rates are still too high to take a lot of stuff private so we're just waiting waiting for all that what would you want to sell if you weren't doing Ridge if you had to sell Ridge today what would you what other prod I mean you're not a guy who would stop what other product would you want to sell yeah my goal for Ridge eventually I'm not the long-term Shepherd of this brand like if it's going to go public or whatever or most likely get bought by one of the rollups like in our industry that's that's the exit path there's 10 strategics that end up buying Brands like ours um I would like to net $100 million and then I would like to start a portfolio of Brands and services basically like you know everyone wants to have their own little PE their own little family office type thing so I would launch a bunch of weird little e-commerce brands that I think are going to be Trend relevant and hire service providers to to run those businesses I love that you know what you want you know you've mapped this out of like what your ideal setup is I love that I love people who call their shot do you you talk about trends like but but you know bone bone broth hot then it's not keto hot then it's not and so like why go after a trend if it's going to ultimately you know do what trends do most Trends don't last forever so is that like building your sand castle you know uh building your Castle on quicksand or something like that like why why go after a trend when trends have this like shelf life are you trying to time an exit or are you trying to you're going to HP Trends what what's the plan if you're going to build on top of a trend yeah dude going back to whale from IQ bar Trend surface area like you create a product in a trend because that's the the best way to grow is in a growing Market you can be average in a growing market and grow very very fast right I was an average operator when Facebook ads were growing and that's why my business grew now I can be a good operator because I have to be right but when a market it's growing very fast you could just be average and then once once you get some sort of success it's it's pivoting so like if I was in the bone broth business I would have told them like hey we have to do [ __ ] protein focused bone broths or with bone bars like that I I'm that guy coming in here trying to like disrupt whatever [ __ ] business I'm in I'm like we need yeah if I was at bone broth I'd be like look that's fine we should do that we're going to do bone bars and we're going to get whatever some jacked guy talk about how they're great then I'd be in the bars business and it' be like we got to do bone supplements we got to be the only guys doing bone whatever marrow pills like that's the type of [ __ ] I'd be pitching to him so um that I love that that's your answer because it's like that's the attitude you have to have to win in that game my takeaway is man what a horrible game to play uh like you know I was just doing a podcast yesterday with a guy and he goes uh you don't want to be in the fresh produce business he's like um you know you know he's like you want to be YouTube not a YouTuber right just as a simple example he's like you take the best YouTuber and they're in the fresh produce business they have to keep running as fast as they can on that treadmill and the treadmill gets faster and faster every year and if they stop they fall behind and there's a thousand other people on that treadmill and so same thing like if you're on a trend and a trend you know almost by definition is going to sort of Peter out and then the new trends will emerge that just seems like a really hard way to win in business when there's other styles of businesses that don't have that problem I but but but SE I think you're both could be right I think the right answer though is to what whichever whichever path you take should fit your skill set and interest and you should commit to it and be that you know we had Moyes on uh Moyes Ali from native deodorant and we said like why don't you do something easier he goes cuz I'm a merchant this is what I do I think that stuff is silly dude no it's not silly I actually disagree I think committing to a path is significantly better than not and if Sean Frank is committing to this trend thing then he yeah it's exhausting for you because that's your interest to a better path that's that's that's not true what are you talking about how much better path could it be he's got a a a 10-year-old company that's doing $200 billion a year in Revenue that sounds like a good path yeah I I'm not saying what he's doing is bad I'm saying he's the he's an outlier winner and even he's like yeah there's a company that's like us that does 400 million a year it's probably and is worth a 100 million on the public markets right or you know we have to continually hop you know from one category to the next and he's in a better one it's more enduring but let's say you're on uh the bone type of type of thing where it's a wellness Trend and the wellness Trends or the diet Trends they change very very rapidly right it's like that's a hard game to play compared to like you know look at the other look at the U possible set of businesses you could go into that's that's definitely on the hard side dude like Ecom is definitely on the hard side and Ecom on top of a trend is is the hard version of the hard version oh dude look I I understand completely but the reason why I'm in it is because it's permissionless when I was 22 nobody would let me build [ __ ] Nvidia servers or whatever like you know a a more robust infrastructure business right like if I was going to provide I don't know [ __ ] routing cable services some random [ __ ] like that like maybe now you know I could I could get into that but e-commerce is permissionless and that's why I like it agencies are permissionless it's like the reason why we sold on Shopify is because nobody would give us a Nordstrom's poo right like there's there's a level of G lot of things SAS is permissionless communities are permissionless there's a lot of things that are permission newsletters are permission whatever there's a lot of things that are permissionless the agency one is actually more permissionless than Ecom because you know for Ecom you have to buy inventory right there's a there is a capital requirement the agency one is different right that's just I'm going to hustle my skills and I'll get cash flow then what you did was use that cash flow to then you know invest and continue to grow the brand right but for most people they they get I know a lot of people that got excited about Ecom and didn't realize like how scaling works with Ecom where yeah it's the it like it people squint and think it's SASS and it's not it's like it's like your big your problems get harder the bigger you get right like it's bigger POS it's more management it's everything else where you know if you're sass it's like you know if it's if it's if it's 10 zeros or a thousand zeros being processed through your thing who the [ __ ] cares um hey se you you've got more you're you're a great follow on Twitter because you're hilarious but you're this perfect combination of being hilarious but also I think you're right like because you've been there done that but has being as opinionated as you have been and willingness to call people out and this willingness to like say what you think has that ever held you back and do you regret doing that or do you think that like going all in on being a strong personality has benefited you I mean the only tangible negatives of being a public personality in the internet is is if and when you get sued because you will be sued sued right everyone gets sued and it's the cost of doing business they will read your tweets in depositions so just like that is the reality right I think a lot of people like don't want to like offend embarrassing or what like what did you mean by saying you want to shoot the Wobble Family dude no like I mean I was I got to pose why I told someone I was going to drop a nuclear bomb on them and they read that like I had to explain like I don't have access to nuclear weapon it sucked um but I mean you should you should be yourself and authentic and uh my Twitter has sold like $300,000 wor of wallets so definitely it's it's a net positive and and your podcast right so your personality and being public about what you guys how well you guys are doing with Ridge and being funny and opinionated led to you guys doing this Ecom podcast and the Ecom podcast pays you a bunch of money right like you guys are doing really really well off that so that's paid off in in a different way right you want to talk about that yeah yeah so I only have like four minutes I got to go to a call and do my real job uh maybe something you guys don't know anything about but yeah what are you talking about huh I take naps after this yeah so look uh the reason why I got public on the Internet is because in 2022 all of my friends moved across the whole world because of covid and I didn't hang out with anybody and it sucked for everybody 2021 2022 like I used to have a community of people who talk about e-commerce and then they've all moved so I was just by myself and I'm like let me just get on Twitter and start talking about e-commerce um and through that I made a bunch of great friends uh because it's a very lonely thing running a big business like you know my my best friends from high school um one of them goes to like crime scenes and cleans up like when somebody kills themselves or whatever and the other one does garage doors so like imagine trying to tell them being like yeah man like you know I spent $8 million on meta but I probably should have spent like they told me to show [ __ ] up so you you want to find friends who uh you know can can you know have some sort of Sympathy For What You're Building so got on Twitter found those people um they're all like you know Jason from hex Cloud's on there Mike Beckham from uh simple modern he does like 200 million dollar sell in [ __ ] water bottles Matt from P case we started a podcast yeah dude uh what's it called it's called operators so it's a it's a niche e-commerce podcast we have spin-offs we have marketing operators dude I think it'll build at least $2 million to sponsor but it might bu like $4 million to sponsors and it's just us talking about e-commerce probably one tenth the listenership I mean way less maybe one or 100 to listenership you guys get but because it's so Niche it's like way more of an actual like Community right and you know I think people want to be you guys because you guys are like an entertainment show right you guys are like a big show you know massive reach entertaining people but if you're listening to this and you're an expert of something do an incredibly Niche YouTube channel because like the the sponsor Integrations are just so much deeper like our sponsors fulfill the Erp right and like you guys don't know what that is but if you're an e-commerce Merchant you need an Erp and the annual contracts are $150,000 a year and we've probably sold a hundred of them right so it's like they'll give us $600,000 a year because we're the only marketing channel for them right um anyway yeah we do a podcast I think that's great advice all right we we'll let you go we know you got to go go sell wallets and rings and other other great things uh where should so give shout out your Twitter shout out your uh your url where do you want people to go okay go to ridge.com Sean and buy a wallet that's the best way to support me right now in this moment of time never stop selling guys um we appreciate you man thanks for doing this all right that's the [Music] pod for

one big report you can directly steal the strategy from big companies like a16z assana and apply them to your own business so if you want it check it out in the link below in the description not back to the show you gave me the teaser the three greatest lines in marketing what are they okay so the greatest line in marketing history if you Google or chat GPT it is going to say a line different than what I was going to tell you okay what would they say I'm going to tell you what they're going to say in a minute teaser teaser marketing is a lot about teasers uh because it is a very strong line and it's worthy of discussion but I'm going to start with my favorite headline of all time and that was written by a copywriter named Gary Halbert and the way it came about he was contracted by a woman named Tova Borgnine who was the wife of movie star Ernest Borgnine before our time but apparently if we went to our parents and grandparents and we said Ernest Borgnine they would be like oh yes he was a Brad Pit type of the time so his wife wanted to come out with a perfume and she asked Gary to figure it out for her so Gary doesn't know the first thing about perfume but he knows a ton about marketing at the the time he was a legendary copywriter had many many successes and so he's brainstorming on what to do as he's walking through the mall one day and he sees a kiosk where there's like these little oils and things like that did you ever walk by that kiosk of course there's always like a very smooth talker right there yeah yeah make your own perfume right and so he goes up and he's like hey what are these cre creat creations of perfume do you make them yourself or whatever and they say oh yes the essential oils are put together to make your own perfum and he says is there one of them that outsells the rest and they're like oh yes China musk China musk is the best seller by far he says why doesn't someone take China musk put it in a fancy bottle and call it XYZ perfume and they're like well that's a great idea no one's ever done that he says okay give me some China musk so he takes the China musk and he walks over to the jeweler that he knows and he says Mr Jeweler I would like you to put this in a fancy glass and gold bottle that is shaped like a tea puts it in the bottle and then he sits on it for like three months okay calls Tova borg9 and he goes Tova I have spent the last three months traveling the world in search of the finest perfume and I think finally after sampling literally thousands I've discovered it I want to bring it over to your house right now and have you smell it he brings it over she's just in awe of how great the China musk smells and she decides she wants to launch it and she wants to do the launch party at her friend candy spellings Boutique on Roto Drive candy is a wife of Aaron Spelling the the big producer and Gary says that is far too small we are going to rent out the entire bottom floor of the Century Plaza Hotel and she's himming and Hong she's like how are we going to fill that with people this and that and he you know trust me so she actually Strokes the check rents out the entire bottom floor of this entry Plaza Hotel and Gary takes it a full page ad in the LA Times and the headline is this wife of famous movie star swears under oath her new perfume does not contain an illegal sexual stimulant that was the headline in big letters and then the subhead said and she is so confident in this she's willing to prove it by giving away 10,000 sample bottles on this day at this time at the Century Plaza Hotel so they put it the ad and near you know will it work who knows and the phones at the senty Plaza Hotel just start ringing and ringing by people wanting to know about this event and this kept going and going and they realized it was going to be chaotic the fire department comes the day of and they like shut down the street they figure out this way to get all the cars in and thousands and thousands and thousands of people show up and crowd into the lobby of the Century Plaza hotel with this big review he has two uh inshape gentlemen with tuxedos get a briefcase handcuff it to their wrist and walk it in through the crowd bring it onto the stage opens it up and in there are the 12 sapphires representing all 12 ingredients in Tova perfume and Tova auctions off each Sapphire for charity brings in a few hundred th000 the next day the phone rang with unsolicited offers from you know Macy's Robinson's may all the department stores of the time Barney sex etc etc it was the best selling perfume in the world that year and went on for many many years I think now you'll find it like at CVS behind like you know photo counter or something like that but it's still I think exists wow yeah so look for the te over that's amazing so you love that headline if we break it down so it was wife of famous movie star yes social proof right there social proof not using her name yes some curiosity which famous movie movie star exactly so curiosity and social proof then it was swears under oath which is like Stakes drama right or how would you describe it is that what you would call it yes and then new perfume does not contain sex sexual stimulants which is like kind of a an inversion right it's like that implies this [ __ ] must be amazing okay so I need to come up with a name for this because my favorite part of the headline is the last part and it's like the secret marketing imbed or some [ __ ] like that you know it's like the hidden secret message that even the reader doesn't know they're receiving but when you read that you're like wait okay it doesn't contain an illegal sexual stimulant does it contain a legal one like what is in this [ __ ] thing you know and I always wanted to rip that headline and do it for like a new taco stand or something you know I think it's Universal that you could be like you know uh new restaurant owner swears on her oath his tacos do not contain an illegal stim know heing to away free tacos to prove that there's nothing weird in here they're just that good they're just that good actually that's that's that's a great ending to it too um and then it had actually the the sort of the offer or the call to action which was giving away so many samples at this time at this place exactly it's proof that this is going to work you know a a risk-free offer you're going to get this for free right and if you don't like it who cares you know so it's removing all the risk it's making it really easy to go get it have you ever done a a remix of that headline have you I haven't I I had a roommate who was going to open a taco stand she didn't know I'm doing it I I came up with a name too it was going to be in San Diego it's going to be called bur baros so like drunken donkeys I think it would kill it man if anyone out there if you're watching this you want to start a taco stand together you you got to have a good recipe but I'm in man I'll do all the marketing for your taco stand and you have to name it bur barage and I get free tacos for life that could be amazing um but no I haven't but you know ever since I heard about this which was very early in my marketing career I've been obsessed with like marketing INB beds at about the same time this this came out I think in the 90s or something like that before I was in marketing but about the same time I learned about this another marketing imbed hit the world and I think this is another of the greatest lines in marketing history and that is Sean I'm sure something you can personally relate to if you get an erection like lasting longer than 4 hours call a physician immediately so we' all heard it we've all heard it it's the end of every Viagra ad and if you're a guy that's having trouble getting it up you're thinking about this you're like [ __ ] this could actually could be a 4our erection I'll be happy with four minutes man you know and it's such a great line so you think that so I always heard that as at the end of any in uh you know Pharma commercial you may side effects may include na I kind of thought it was like that but actually you're right I don't think that was the mandated the mandated side effects I think that was an ined maybe I mean it could have been true also you it shows a way to Workshop things in a way that could be a positive like the naaga thing for something else it could be like you know if you're oh here I I literally got um uh stem cell treatments last week and the doctor after he shoots me up tells me hey you're going to have swelling tonight and extreme pain and that's great that means it's working I was like oh interesting change the meaning you know yeah and when it started swelling and I was [ __ ] Howling Man it was like the most pain I've ever been in actually I was literally howling I was like well at least it's [ __ ] working you know my knee's going to heal so uh yeah there is is a lot of value in being able to turn positives into negatives Joe Sugarman was a master of this too he used to sell a lot of devices do you know who Joe sugar I've heard the name but blue blocker sunglasses so we could talk about Joe Sugarman for for a hot minute because he is one of is that a real name by the way or is that kind of that's his real name and he's one of the greatest legends in marketing history everyone should read sugarm and study what he did but before he did blue blocker infomercial which was one of the biggest infomercials at the time he would do these devices and he had one of The Early Air Purifiers and back then the way the technology you think of an air purifier now what do you think of put the corner slick box in the corner of the room light yeah yeah this was in the '90s or something like that and it had to have this crazy weird wire coil on top of it to grab all the negative [ __ ] out of the air and it was very ugly and his ad attacked that head on he he said like you know the coil that removes the toxins and so instead of having this ugly ass thing in your house you're like oh that's that you see that Co pulling the toxins out of the you know I forget what his exact headline was on that but it was turning these negatives into okay so are we on number two or that was number two no that was number two okay oh actually okay so maybe there's going to be five four I don't know how many we said there was going to be okay a shout out to another one I just remembered that's really big when infomercials first aired the call to action was please call now operators are standing by do you remember yes I've heard theseal times yes there was a woman man I wish I could remember her name but it was a a female copywriter that that created this and it changed the entire world of infomercials and I think the entire world of selling and she changed that line to please call now if you get a busy signal please call again and if you think of the picture in your mind you know of operators just standing there waiting for the phone to run no one's buying this [ __ ] thing to call now you you probably get a busy signal please keep calling please keep trying you know the offer is going to stay around for this many minutes please keep trying to call it just gives a the uh image of the phones flying in the room and everyone's trying to place their orders and it's like high demand and you know gets you excited and you when you get through and you hear that person answer you're relieved you're like ah I got through right I'm going to get the special offer is a special offer still available yes it is still available it's like that feeling of relief so that was a big line I'll give a shout out to that one we did a a similar one where um for my company we let's say on a normal day let's say when we launch a product it would be awesome if let's say 800 people bought the thing like right when it launches like the kind of the first 10 minutes or so and so I'm like trying to think about how to drum up excitement or whatever and so part of the team you know first instinct is like do we discount no no we're not going to Discount that that that's going to have the opposite effect probably do we um free gift with purchase or some kind of limited time like bonus for like the first people through the door okay I think we're on the right track and we did a a similar thing where we were like I the founder sent a personal note it was like an unstyled email and it was basically apologies in advance we expect this to to go off you know to to sell so quickly I know that many of you are going to be upset and so as a you know as as a as a make good you know I give you my word that for the next one we're going to have more but for this one it's just going to be I know it's going to be chaos scarcity I'm already worried about it and and immediately we had our biggest day which we had never had like you know 800 would have been a great day and then all a sudden it was like 2,800 just by apologizing in advance cuz we embedded the instead of saying like come get it we were like we're so sorry it's you're probably not going to get it and that just that reversal really worked embedded marketing that's a book it's a book waiting to be written we've like we've like brainstormed three books now in the last 18 months that like somebody should write we want to write these all right yeah yeah it's happening yeah and actually you and I have been casually talking about writing a book yeah and maybe we need some people out there to pressure us to pressure us and motivate us we YouTube comments one day we should uh yeah we should do this so let us let us know below if you want to see this book all right okay number three number three four I can't remember which which one they're eating the dogs they're eating the cats they're eating the pets of the people who live there I have that song in my head now too they're eating the do doing please don't eat my dog okay this line was said to have lost Trump the debate and possibly the election and what happened over the following week in my opinion won him the debate and possibly the election because that line of the 20,000 immigrants that had been legally migrated to Springfield Illinois town of was Springfield Ohio yeah yeah Springfield Ohio town of 58,000 was torn apart by the fact Checkers torn apart by every news station in the world these 20,000 legal migrants in this town of 60,000 are not eating dogs they are not eating cats that is complete BS let me say it again these 20,000 migrants that were moved into this little town of 60,000 people that probably didn't vote to have them moved in probably didn't know they were coming in maybe some of them wanted them maybe some of them didn't they're not eating dogs they're not eating cats but what does it say to the entire world yes large amounts of immigration migration whether it's legal or uh illegal is happening in small towns and places like Springfield Ohio right I had never known this was happening and you know some people want that and some people don't and Trump's base and a lot of moderates don't want the small town that they live in or their parents live in or you know they grew up in to have such a huge change in population in demographics in you know the style of uh how businesses are run Etc and it spread that message worldwide that wow there really is a lot of immigration happening and yeah some people thought it was great and some people didn't but it got that message out because before that you hear about you know oh there's you know the number was always different right there's 8 million people that came in under Biden there's 20 million people that came in under Biden and there's a big number can you visualize 8 million people I can't yeah but I can visual 20,000 I've been to a football game there's 20,000 in the stadium and I can visualize 58,000 and I can put the simple math together that that's onethird you know of the population and that is a change and so it paints a picture did you read um Scott Adams when he was running the first time uh Scott Adams the creater of Dilbert he was one of the first people back in 2016 to when Trump first came out and if you remember he did the first spech I didn't follow he was like they're bringing their rapist they're bringing their their their Killers across the border and it was like wa whoo that was like I mean this first exposure to like it's like I saw this Tik Tok the other day of like an African tribe drinking a Fanta for the first time and they're like know they don't know how to get to it they're like biting the lid off and then they drink a Fanta and they're like oh my like what is this yes that was Trump that was the reaction Trump the first time and Scott Adams came out and he was like oh not only is this not a joke I think he's going to win and he goes uh I've been a trained basically like and he's like a hypnotist he's like I have looked at how you communicate with people not sort of overtly but like the sub the the subtext of what's being said and how effective that is at planting messages and he called them linguistic kill shots he goes Trump has these linguistic kill shots where he just labels something or he brings their attention to it in an extreme way so like with the eating the dogs or the cats it's like instead of arguing about the migration you're arguing now are the migrants eating dogs and cats which forced you to First accept the migrant point but if he never said that you have to debate the migrant point and so and he was talking about like uh when he Jeb Bush was the favorite at the time because it's the bush Dynasty the Father the brother now it's going to be Jeb and he just called him low energy Jeb and he labeled him that and then no matter what Jeb did if if Jeb was just being Jeb he is kind of low energy looking if he suddenly got vivacious Trump would be like good job Jeb you're you're make like you're doing it and he and so Jeb couldn't win he tied him up and neither path was like viable and he he just had to like remove this sticker off him and nobody in politics was doing that to each other right crooked Hillary he was just coming up with these linguistic kill shots where visual words every time you saw the person that's what you saw Yes and uh Scott called that out pretty early on and whether again whether it's natural that's just how he is or it's like strategic I have no idea but I think at this point it's pretty it's pretty clear that that is an effective way of communicating that he does yes yes he's a he's a showman like with the McDonald's thing right when he went to work at McDonald's a lot of people didn't know why he was going to work at McDonald's and then they found out oh Kamala has a questionable history it's in debate whether or not she worked at McDonald's you know and he did something else where he was interviewed at a conference and he said I think I Cala is black now I thought she was Indian everyone's like Trump's a racist blah blah blah and it's interesting because not when he says these things it kind of does make him look bad in a way it does in a way make him look like a schoolyard bully right but it's effective it's it's weird right yeah he he he he creates the frames that then you have to participate in and the garbage truck he did the same thing when Joe Biden called his supporters garbage he went and got in a garbage truck he's like I'm going to milk this moment and make sure that I dominate the news cycle that was the really interesting thing I realized in this election is you could feel in the news cycle who was winning and then you could track it on poly market so like the news cycle whoever had something positive their odds would go up on poly market and then Trump did the rally at MSG and he had uh Tony hinchcliff did the the disc in the Puerto Ricans and like the poly Market starts going down and like camalo is owning the new cycle and then Biden says the garbage thing and it goes back to Trump favor and the garbage truck and Trump's odds go up it was wild to see these two things tracking so let's do another one of the the greatest lines okay so now we can go to the chat GPT line and it really is and this is something that um everyone knows about but not a lot of people know where it came from so you'll know the line instantly when I say this but uh you know in the 1940s only about 10% of brides got a diamond engagement ring De Beers diamonds had an interesting run they were quite popular in the early 1900s as like a flex not as a wedding ring but you know in other jewelry or on like a lapel or you know necklace earrings things like that and then the depression happened H around the same time as diamond mining got really good so they had an over supply of diamonds and then they had people losing money and then we should talk about uh Joseph dine too the the greatest art dealer of all time because he um invented the American Art Market so people were spending money on Art and things like that you know and so taking more away from uh that luxury sector to go into another one and it was a a female copywriter Francis gty who was at an agency that deers hired and The Story Goes is like she was frustrated and she was like you know I don't know at her last last down to her last penny or something on one night she is working on this campaign and can't think of anything and then wakes up in the middle of the night with this line a diamond is forever and what is interesting is that was the tie in to engagement be before that the engagement ring would be like a a plain band a gold band you know sometimes it would be like like an offering like a cow or like uh land or things like that and engagement is temporary anyways like by definition an engagement is like a temporary period of time so diamonds are forever is like an exact contrast to that yes and it it's an imbed because it then shows that if someone doesn't present a diamond maybe they're not in it forever right right and what woman wants a half commitment right ladies out there do you want a half commitment from your man you know so uh and from what I remember reading about this they went to Hollywood and they basically were giving directors diamonds uh saying in the key moment in the climax moment where the man professes his love he's got to give her a diamond ring and they embedded it in Hollywood in movies by literally bribing the director you're and that's now influences culture guess how you do it the B romantic gesture is to literally get down on one knee and hand her a go you know a diamond ring that became he used kind of top down influence also to to do it right and then scarcity right because they limit the supply so all the core marketing things you know influence social social proof um that frame diamonds are forever scarcity they kind of used all of it yes and now there's this big debate going on between lab grown diamonds and mind diamonds have you heard of this it's fascinating because I think they're 10% 20% of the price or something like that probably basically 50 to 80% cheaper it's the exact same rock you could look at them under a micros in fact it could be argued it's more perfect it's a it's a more perfect thing and so you can get a big rock for this but then the smartest this the thing that I guess deers did was that they they so this is a big problem they're like okay if there's lab grown diamonds that don't have these social issues with mining Blood Diamond type of stuff yes and it's just as good if not better this is a problem and so what they did the genius of their business strategy was they got into the lab grown business and just flooded the market with cheap lab grown diamonds so they lowered the price intentionally like crappy ones good D good LA on diamonds but they just lowered the price so much more that then the consumer's mind it became a perception like oh wow like yeah if it was just like 20% less something like that actually be more competitive they made it so much cheaper that they like took away the uh value the perceived value The Prestige of the diamond doing that I didn't know that they were like involved in that that process pretty crazy you put me on to um an incredible marketer Gary Ben Sanga who I had never heard of and he has this uh little example little exercise that I love I want to share which is like I don't know if you remember this from from learning his stuff but he he gives this example of kids going fishing so it's like a lemonade stand type of example so it's like kids are going fishing uh or they go to the fishing area and they want to sell bait they want to sell worms so they go V1 is basically like basically worms for sale 99 Cents or whatever right and so they go there not much sales come back home luckily the neighbor is a copyright is like the the story neighbor is a copyright he says hey you know why don't we level this up and he goes you know first lesson of marketing you don't sell the product you sell the benefit so buy these worms catch more fish so they go back day two sell a little bit more with bu you know these worms will help you catch more fish now they have a benefit he goes okay they come back they're like hey what else you got how can we make even more and then they go to the next level where they were like he's like well why do they catch more fish and um I think it's Ogie who has this great quote that he was all about like the the reason why marketing and they go U you seem to be a big fan of this reason why marketing and he goes is there any other um like is there any other way to sell this besides that that's all you know it's crazy if if if it uh if you don't use that so then they the kids go out and they're like well why would I why do our worms catch more fish oh because these are local worms from the local soil and what you don't know is that fish prefer worms that are from their local soil the it's more attractive to them not these imported things that you find on the shelves we have the local ones start selling more right and then they go to the to the next level he just it just shows like layering on these like Master marketing techniques I love that example end with like like uh uh you know buy two cans of local worms get a free uh bobber or something ex it's like there's like an offer so he's like you know juice it with an offer and I think maybe I'm mixing up two of the stories but like he did a kind of a sensational headline too which was like local fisherman accused of cheating uh because he catches the most fish reveals Reveals His simple secret right and it's like oh why we got to know cuz there's a guy who catches way more fish than everybody else people accused him of like you know using Nets and other other methods no no no he's just fishing like the rest of us but he uses the local worms right gets to the to the best of it yeah I love Gary's persuasion formula he's got this very very simple thing and it sounds like when you first read it you're like okay I didn't I didn't get anything revolutionary then I go look at my ads I'm like okay I'm not doing any of these things and then you start doing them and your owaz starts up so he's got the five PS and so the first one is problem so what's the problem that the the person has and he he says no problem no sale like you can't sell someone something that they don't do have some Advil I'm not hurting what why would I want your Advil yes so problem then the next one is promise so what's the the promised benefit that this product is going to give you proof that it works then there's proposition which is your offer and then I call I call the last P product because he talks about the crackerjack secret and he talks about how in a box of Cracker Jacks they always had like a gift at the bottom and he's like I you know even if you give someone the Cracker Jacks and they're they're not hungry right now or whatever he's like I've never seen somebody just throw it away and not get the the little gift out of the bottom and he's like so you want to have the crackerjack secret in your in your ad basically that was his thing and then you can juice them up right so those are the P's and then he's got the U's and if you if you stack those together he literally has a formula where it's like urgent problem and that's 25 points unique promise that's another 25 points unquestionable proof another 25 userfriendly proposition that's the last 25 and then the Cracker Jack secret is the bonus 20 points if you stack that whole thing together you get to 120 love it amazing amazing so good um who are the other adman that you liked let's do that first so you uh you were telling me about an adman that I don't I've never heard of or a marketing marketing I actually study non-ad men now because I think I've gone through all the admin so we talked about Edward Bernay the last time I was on your show but the guy I've been really geeking out on is actually an art dealer okay Edward bernes was a PR guy Joseph dine is known as the greatest art dealer of all time Devine's run was around like 1880 or 90 uh I think he died in 1935 and he came from a family that had a shop that sold uh like porcelain goods and tapestries in in London England and they were pretty well established they sold to the queen and things like that you know so they were the go-to place but these tapestries in Ceramics would sell for like3 to $5,000 which I think in that day's money is maybe like six figures or you know something around there and he noticed as a teenager that fine artwork at certain times was selling for like $75,000 and so his uncle and father father who owned the shop brought him when he was 15 years old to New York with them to do some business and he sneaks out from them goes to Fifth Avenue and leases a little Warehouse with like an upstairs and a downstairs and he comes back and he's like Dad Uncle I got us a shop and actually I should preface this by saying I don't think 15 years old then was like 15 years old now I think 15 years old then is when you're going you're in the real world yeah yeah you're going to get your your sh I think was it George Washington LED his first uh Caravan of soldiers at like 18 or something and he'd been a surveyor and a scout since like 15 years old duven was a hustler from from an early age he books this thing in New York because he has this realization when he's there and that is that Americans for really the first time have tons of money this was when Rockefeller was coming up and JP Morgan and Industrial Revolution Europeans have tons of art Americans have tons of money Europeans have tons of art so in Europe you'd go to the Duke's house right and the Duke would have his family portraits up there's no photographers and so you'd have to have a painter catalog grandma or Grandma as a baby or whatever so it would be on the wall and it would be like Raphael paintting Grandma right because rafhael was the portrait guy at the time or whatever I don't know if it was specifically Rafael but people like that or Gainesboro or you know some of the people that are now the biggest artists of of human history were just you know flooding the the walls of the Duke's house and these Dukes like anyone else would go busto sometimes and they'd be looking for money so deine in his first big deal he went to this Duke and the Duke was kind of broke and he's like yeah I'll figure out how to get $3 million for your entire art collection and that at the time was like you know 300 million or something I don't know huge but he bought the Duke's entire artart collection and it was some of these Old Masters Rembrandts and things like that and he brings it to America and he starts Shilling it and his sales methods are just like unbelievable what was he doing how did he do it so I mean so some of these had some Prestige but like the first thing he does as he gets this painting uh I think it was was uh Gainesboro little blue boy it's been a year since I read the book sure but uh he acquires this and he makes this huge deal that this great institutional landmark of London is coming to the United States and when it comes he arranges to have all the reporters waiting on the deck you know there's no airplane so you take the the cruise liner over um all the reporters are waiting there it comes and and now it's on American soil and it's going to be presented at this amazing Spa you know and builds the gravitas around this this artwork and then he has a pool that he decides is going to be the buyer pool they don't know yet but he's talking to people like Henry Frick and Andrew melon and John Rockefeller about this thing coming and they'd be like you know oh is is this going to be for sale the crown jewel of London for sale are you are you kidding me no Absol absolutely not at any price but if you want to make an offer I could bring it to someone but it's not for sale so he'd bring this thing and then he sold it for like $225,000 which was record shattering at the moment you know it's in every newspaper in the world that this painting sold for this much money to this person and through a couple of these things he creates the American Art Market and he has all of these Industrial Revolution Titans right you know all the names right uh um literally you know Rockefeller melon Morgan uh Vanderbilt all these people become his clients and his sales methods are just like next level man like so there's a story of um I think it was uh a guy who made a fortune in California in the oil business and he comes to dein in New York and he wants to buy art and this guy is like a new money guy and he's not really in the New York click he brings him to the shop and he has the guy show up at at at the time he says and deine takes 90 minutes to show up Le waiting there for 90 minutes finally gets the guy and he's like okay come on upstairs with me and he walks them into this Corridor and there's the five paintings there that are stunning and he he walks them past and he's like I'm going to show you some of the things in the in the back the guy's like wait wait wait what about these P he's like sir those paintings are reserved for Mr melon come this way we need to get you something that will be more suitable for your collection tell me again what's in your collection oh I have not heard of any of those artists that's cute let me show you a a nice starter work he's like well what about the what about the pieces you know the like how much is Mr melon paying you making him feel small yeah how much is he paying you and you'd think that he would do this as a rof but he really didn't sell the guy the paintings for Mr Mel and he made him buy this starter piece and I was like I can work on one of those and then he'd call him a few months later and be like look you know uh I think I might be able to Wrangle one of those paintings loose from from Mr melon uh but the price is going to be outrageous and duan's saying was when you overpay for the Priceless you're getting it cheap that was his quote that he we're just kind of like a diamonds are forever exact and so he's got all these in that he does in just his everyday Behavior you know like putting people in tears and things like that and propagating the saying that overpaying for the Priceless is like the best financial move you can make you know and the things he does is just Next Level I mean on the cell side it's [ __ ] crazy he's so relentless he would go on uh cruise liners and back then the the boat from London to New York was the big thing and it was different levels or whatever and your deck chair is like your baller spot right and so he' go in there and he the way he met Andrew melon is he greas the the uh staffer to seat him next to Mr melon and then he gets there and he finds out that Mr melon is a recuse and doesn't like going outside and only stays in his room and he's so mad that he gased so much to get the deck chair but what he does is he starts kind of stalking the elevator and he times it to get in the elevator at the same time and melon gets in the elevator he's like how do you do sir elevator pitch what's the intent of your travels to London and and Mr melon's like oh I'm here in this business you know how about yourself and he's like no you know having a brunch in the Duke of Carnegie's uh home not sure what else you know but just drop something like that and then you know where where where else are you going to be on your travels and things like that and you're like oh you're the you're the person who founded this I forget what melon did steel or something something you know um would you like to join me for brunch at the Duke's house he's like oh sure I would love to meet because royalty was the thing you know and duine really did have these connections so he brings melon to brunch the Duke's house when you go to a Duke's house the Dukes have the art on all the walls and it's from all these Old Masters and you're like oh if I want to become a dynasty like these royal families that are dynastic families I need to do what they do and that means having these old Master paint pain ings on my wall so he sells melon so well that he becomes a top client of his and when you became a top client of duvin you're no longer allowed to use your own architect as a rule for him getting you the great pictures you have to use his architect to design your house to have optimal viewing to give these pictures justice otherwise I'm sorry Mr melon but this picture cannot be in your collection because it does not to be showcased in a side room or something like that and he would have Architects designed their apartments with like very little windows and huge wall space but way more wall space than they would ever need and then he ran into an issue um the people just didn't buy enough real estate to hold all the paintings and this wasn't like crypto artart where you can store it all in a wall you know you got to have walls to put it on and so he started convincing them to open museums the National Gallery in Washington is founded by Andrew melon at the urging of Joseph deine and he said the key to your immort it is building this gallery and having your work live on Beyond you in it and we're going to build it 30,000 square feet and so he does this melon builds the National Gallery and then Devine's able to sell him way more art you know stock up all those walls plus all of his houses and [ __ ] like that right uh melon passes on and then I think it was Henry Frick uh he's his next big client he's like you know Mr Frick if you really want to to achieve immortality you could add on to the National Gallery a bigger Wing than Mr melon made and stack it with your art and he did he [ __ ] did you know and bought all this art from dine I mean the guy was so ruthless another of my favorite dine tricks he would do is when he'd be at uh Andrew melon's house there was a couple other competing dealers you know you'd ride the horse and carriage over there right it's not like a car um he greased the staff to tell him if they find out that another art dealer is going to their house so he'd find out when the the competitor is going to Mr M's house and he would show up the same day and he'd be like just passing through the Hamptons you know happen to oh uh you know hello Mr pury fancy seeing you here I was just visiting my client and he would go and just sit there all day and you can't like reschedule the meeting cuz that person probably traveled several days to get there you know who's just Relentless man on that actually I know you have a lot of young kids in your audience and I did an experiment recently I was at a a mastermind where everyone paid 250 Grand to attend wow and I asked them I said you know I'm just curious about this room you guys are all established people how many of you in your youth had some sort of sales job that required you to be relentless like 200 phone calls a day or knocking on doors and almost all the room raised their hand I think it's something that really shapes them did you ever have a job like that I don't think I had that kind of I've noticed the same thing but like uh you know so we we've talked to people who are a lot of Mormons who go on missions like that's the best dude you got you spent two years in complete Solitude isolation not talking to your family selling Jesus to you know uh whoever right you're you're selling religion to people who didn't ask for it necessarily you're knocking on doors you're facing tons of rejection and day after day you you Carri it on like that is such a formative experience my uh my uncle had told me one thing about he used to sell textbooks door to door like text book textbooks uh companies I guess there was a couple of them in America that were really big that way and we recently just had another person on the like we've had several people on the podcast with this one same job which is like door to door sales whether it's textbooks or knives or whatever it was and yeah the hit rate on those is really high Brian Johnson who was going to be here at the event I was just watching his documentary same thing his first job was door Todo credit card processing sales I was tail marketer of credit card processing oh you were too amazing and so you he rejection rejection figured out figured out how to sell figured out how to carry on in the face of rejection got numb to rejection just started started to see it like my uncle told me he goes you know how I I I go how many did you actually sell you're selling text was like in a day knock on a 100 Doors how many do you actually sell you're walking through the hot Atlanta like neighborhoods sweating and he's like oh you know like one or two or three would be like an amazing day yeah and I that's I wasn't tell marketing too it's about 200 calls uh shitty day has won five sales is an amazing day right which is just like even if you hear those numbers go go actually do something hard where 97 times out of a 100 you just get slammed in the face and he goes the way I did it was very simple he goes I just did the math and I realized actually I know I have to knock on 100 doors to get the two sales so actually I I don't just count the revenue from the two yeses I just assigned a price to every no so he's like a no is worth 50 50 bucks for me every time I collect a no all right that was that was a 50 I wasn't just coming up with the zero I wasn't coming up empty every time he was a psychological trick that allowed me to like see the nose still as like progression cuz I'm just getting closer to that yes that you know the one out of 100 or two two out of 100 that are going to happen and uh so I've actually used that in fundraising for example where it's like all right I'm raising funds for a company it's when investors reject your company it's a very personal thing and what ends up happening is people don't raise money and then you ask them well how many calls did you make how many meetings have you had and they just have a funnel problem it's like you guys haven't had enough conversations cuz you're afraid of rejection or you're avoiding rejection or you tasted some rection and it scared you off yeah um but it's a numbers game and like the way to do it is put a dollar value even on nose I like that that method I was going to ask you one last thing which is what's the best way to get great at writing ads if I wanted to go from you know okay to good or good to great what do what do I do I do a lot of it I'm assuming practice is a big part of it but is there a better way to practice okay this is funny man you have to be studying ads so right now uh uh we're at a we're at event yeah an event we call it Hoop Group now Hoop Group a high level group and I meet this guy who's got a 13 million YouTube channel and I'm like what's your channel and I go to type it in there's like five people behind me and they type it in and they see the ad pop up and they're like come on Craig you don't subscribe to YouTube right you can't afford the 50 bucks or whatever you know and like are you [ __ ] kidding me an advertising guy is going to turn off the ads right I YouTube topics to get ads on purpose like I would watch the ads all day long if I could because I need to know what the lay of the land looks likeup who's a great marketer uh and has made probably personally made I don't know $200 million and his business all are just Facebook ads but like that's like his take home that he's probably made and he switched his um gender and age on Facebook so he's a 45-year old woman he and I was like why does it say I have a 40 why does it say you're a 45-year old woman and he was like so I can see the ads dum why would I want to see the ads of a 28-year-old dude or whatever you know like that was that would be terrible I'm I know who I need to sell to this is the golden customer and like I need to I need to have my I need Facebook to be showing me what they're what they're seeing abolutely I was like wow that's genius yeah and then I also hang out in a lot of biohacker circles so I find the things that people are doing at Burning Man and on Venice Beach and when they catch fire in these little circles you can tell they're like ready to go mainstream I like it you know and sometimes I get on the trend and sometimes I don't like uh mushrooms was one of them and you know that's a massive category now I think um you know our mushroom supplement with gundry MDS right sells okay but it's not like a category Creator like the mushroom coffee did really well really well right like the mud water type there's a few that that have done for stigmatic is on by a FR of mine it's a great brand I I take those products myself um yeah there's a few mushroom brands that are that are amazing yeah sometimes you you catch it and you can as I say like create the wave sometimes you're riding the existing wave and I think too many people start businesses trying to like Ride the White Water you know uh uh there's a supplement company I won't say the say the name but uh you know they launched with a epic celebrity and then the product looks like every other product out there and it's out of business now because they had this great celebrity who was certainly a scroll stopper as I like to say but they're offering a product that everyone else has too that they could just you know learn about from the celebrity and they go on Amazon and buy a cheaper one you know you got to get things that are are unique and that's why the probiotics was so great in 2014 I don't have a probiotic now that's you know doing big numbers like that because probiotics have become commoditized Craig amazing as always thank you for doing it impr follow Craig on Twitter Craig CL yeah this was the impromptu this is our conversation we just moved it over here with the microphone so thanks for doing I always love chatting with you all right let's get back to it all right see you [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
all right today we're trying something new we have three high school students 9th graders 10th graders 11th graders that all are running their own business while they're in school and not just like oh here's my idea these guys have real Revenue tens of thousands of dollars in profit that they're making as you I know 14 year olds it's crazy and so we invited them in we're doing office hours with them so they bring us their biggest problem and we try to help them solve it in like 10 minutes and whether you're a high school or college student or you're just running your own business I think there's going to be something in this for everybody because there's a beauty in these kids who they're like ah just don't know anything but they're crushing it yeah there's a lot of people who listen to this podcast that want to start something and they overthink it and there's a beauty to being ignorant and these kids are ignorant and because of that they create amazing stuff and I think that you should steal that [Music] attitude all right we're doing something fun today we have high school students who have existing businesses they're running businesses they're making a lot of Revenue they have making money and they're here for office hours and this is all part of our buddy Anan who's here with us he um he's running this new thing called the formidable fellows and I think Anan this is like a precursor you want to launch a school someday a new school for entrepreneurship and this is kind of your your MVP is that right you started giving out grants to middle and high school students yeah so we're building a national network of schools of entrepreneuring it takes a while to build physical schools so uh my friend Raj and I started something called the formidable fellowship and yeah we kind of I think like gen Z is probably going to be the most entrepreneurial generation and uh we saw a lot of them out there and so we started a nonprofit uh with 500k we're given ,000 grants to middle and high school entrepreneurs and so kind of just had our first class had 23 grantees you'll meet three of the great ones today um and yeah you know kind of along the way awesome entrepreneurs their mesh from HubSpot Sean griffy from industry dive a bunch of other folks have been contributors so uh so now we've got you know even more Capital to give out to these young entrepreneurs this is like your uh second Mountain so basically you started a company called CB insights that is in the range of $100 million in revenue or something like that uh now is this like your uh this is what you do after you've made a bunch of money and you want to impact the world positively besides creating you know business intelligence tools uh yeah it's it's a second it's it's the second Mountain I think that's a good way of putting it right I think like if you could build a system that increases human potential like that's a pretty tremendous thing to do um and I think we can do it in a way that will make money and eventually rival the public school system that's our goal all right well 500k and how did you find these kids so they reached out you reached out to them how'd you find all these Founders yeah we reached out to a lot of entrepreneur R preneurship teachers at schools and that was I think primarily the way a little bit of social media some parents who found us on Twitter and Linkedin but yeah I think a lot of them just you know Word of Mouth um and so yeah we got a few hundred applicants to First go around you know qualifications where you had to have Revenue uh so that was kind of a hard filter we had there's a lot of folks who have sort of a dream or they're starting something to burnish a college application and we didn't want that we wanted people who were actually building um and so yeah we narrowed it down pretty quickly and found some did you have any Revenue in middle school or high school I barely had facial hair yeah it's pretty insane like when I was a kid in uh in grade school uh it was like make a business plan and like fake present it to a board of directors and you think that like like you know what I mean like dear board of directors and it was nonsense and I'm seeing their bios this is so much more interesting uh than what we were doing when were you I mean at 14 I don't even think I knew what that word entrepreneur meant yeah definitely didn't my business plan was like mac and cheese but with double the cheese that was the whole thing all right so I have this notebook here and the reason I have here is I take notes whenever we have a guest not because it's my job and I'm a podcast host but because a lot of times what the guests are talking about it's just so interesting to me as a human I just want to go and like implement it in my business or in my life and the person I took the most notes for was Jesse ller if you haven't heard that podcast it's the best like it legitimately changed my life and so I thought let's share our notes and so with the help of the team at HubSpot we went and took all of the notes from that episode and we turned it into a 10 page document you can download it for free it changed my life that episode I think it might change yours so check it out the link is below in the description again notes with Jesse ller down below all right so we're going to do this we're going to see what we got uh they're calling in literally from school by the way which is hilarious like someone came on and their lunch the bell for like recess came on or something that was amazing all right so let's try this out let's go Lincoln all right uh my name is Lincoln Snider I'm a senior at Lake Dallas High School my business is sunshine exteriors so we clean windows Gutters power wash fence staining and holiday lighting um we're located in Denton Texas the main goal is to help the homeowners protect their investment obviously have a clean home year round um my business is 2 years old last year we did $60,000 in Revenue at about just above 50% margin hold on pause real quick Sam you know why he's good did you hear what he did there that was some sophisticated highlevel stuff he just did where he goes he's talking about cleaning gutters and he goes we help home homeowners protect their investment he didn't say we clean your gutters what's the biggest investment in your life your home wouldn't you want to protect it wow Lincoln I'm already impressed continue um yeah so last year we did 60,000 at just above 50% margins this year I plan to grow by 150% to $150,000 so you made $30,000 as a junior in high school is that about right I was a senior it was this year this year okay well yeah 202 school year yeah yeah yeah okay wow all right that's that's wild so just just a recap you go to homeowners you'll power wash you'll clean their gutters you'll clean the windows you'll put up Christmas lights whatever you got to do home services and you did 60,000 last year as a high school senior and you're think you're going to do 150 this year that's that's DEC correct correct all right yes and then so it's me and I have two 1099 subcontractor employees um so right now I'm completely off the field so that means that they're doing all the jobs and I'm the one in charge of booking scheduling finding the clients and how do you do that Lincoln how do you get customers so primary acquisition Source right now is next door um it's a neighbor platform with surrounding communities we We complain about stuff all the time on next door you no no need to explain yeah um uh so yeah I kind of go on there my angle is I'm a local high school student um I own a window cleaning brush washing we do those Services um if You' like a free estimate check out our website we'd be happy to give you a quote and Le how do you do that because my my understanding is you can't post on next door unless you've been verified as having an address or you got a postcard that shows you live in the neighborhood they don't want people from outside the neighborhood messaging how do you do that is that a new feature or am I just out of L so I post in just my neighborhood um so I guess in that area I am confined to my my neighborhood um on that app but it's been enough homes to keep me busy I think we got maybe 90 customers last year off the next door just between March and sep dude if you're listening how many people have we had on this pod saying I don't have an idea I don't have this you know this doesn't scale all this [ __ ] he's 18 years old he made 30 grand and it was from posting on next door in his neighborhood only in his own personal neighborhood yeah that's insane that's and by the way how did you hear about uh you know Anan is a tech guy in New York City how does someone uh in Texas who does power watching hear about this internet [ __ ] like was very fortunate um so there is a teacher who's a part of a teacher blog and I'm not well known but some of the people at my school know that I own my own business and do kind of power washing window cleaning things like that and so she told me about it and then I submitted my application and wow this is cool dude okay so what's your question before I start brainstorming because I'm I'm fired up all right so it's it's a pretty deep question I'm trying to figure out how to reliably acquire customers through paid advertising my current struggle is advertising on a small budget and not having the skills my question for you guys is should I pay to acquire those skills through paid courses um so far what I've been doing is kind of trying to learn on YouTube I don't think that it's in-depth enough to learn fully so I think that I might get more out of paid courses and content um seminars whatever that might be um or do you think that it would be smarter to just allocate a semi-large budget to pit advertising and learn the skill on my own and kind of have to figure it out as I go all right I got a bunch of opinions Sam you want to go first or you want me to go I have a bunch of opinions I think yes to all uh basically yeah uh do all I don't know what your definition of a large budget is the best way to learn is to do it uh and a lot of people will [ __ ] on online courses I think that's nonsense most of what I've learned in this internet world has been buying an online course uh I bought a copyrighting course that changed my life uh I would I would I would suggest you do that I don't know what the course offerings are but if there is a local Services uh uh paid marketing course 100% do it I don't know what a lot of money for you is but if you have to spend up to $2,000 as long as it has good reviews do it by the way I think if you emailed anybody who runs that course you say hey I'm 18 years sold I badly want to learn this I don't have the cash to be able to put that up or you know I'm willing to pay it kind of next year using the profits of this and I'll be your best testimonial for you you know I I think you can get those courses for free out of Goodwill so so I wouldn't even let cost be a barrier but like Sam said I think learning is an attack on all fronts so you you've you've done the right thing you figured out what to learn and if you're committed to being obsessed with it it's do it yourself then it's watch free YouTube stuff then it's do a paid course of some kind buy a book whatever and then the the the last one you didn't mention that I would do is what helped me when I went into e-commerce so uh 5 years ago I had never done a e-commerce physical brand before and I had never done paid ads before and fast forward to now you know I've probably run 40 50 million dollars of paid ads and gotten pretty good at it and so what's what was the learning curve one thing that really helped me was instead of just going straight to a course I started doing it myself so I had my bearings and I knew what I didn't know on a very lows scale budget and then what I did was I found somebody who already was winning with that method so I found either a friend or somebody nearby and I said hey uh I really think what you're doing is great I'm young I want to learn and I basically went and I said can I come by for the day and I just want to ask you a couple questions about paid ads and they yeah sure come over and then they come you come over and then you end up opening up their Facebook ad account with them and you start asking them questions and if you do it right and if you're Earnest genuine person you're likable like it seems like you are um you'll find somebody who will also give you that kind of like real world real time type of mentorship um and they'll just tell you the ins and outs and they'll also tell you oh uh your ad account got shut down email this guy or hey that's normal here's what happens right so they'll tell you stuff that you can't find just you know generically on the internet so I would also do that but it's a war on all fronts when it comes to learning you should be doing all of them and then the ones that are giving you a more rapid rate of learning do more of those and less of the others as you go you'll figure out what what work for you I would also suggest so I'm looking up next door next door is not a big company uh if I had a guess they have a thousand employees or less I would Google nextto account manager or I would go to the top I'd Google nextd door CMO or Nextdoor director of marketing something V VP or above uh and I would email them and I would explain this is what I did I got I just built a business that is about to is doing six figures as a senior in high school I'm going to advertise on next door do you have any type of firsttime customer credits and I would bet a lot of money that they will give you $1 to $2,000 in ad credits on next door to learn their platform and then I would do the same thing for uh what's the other one uh Sean that the guy who started Athena started th Thumbtack uh I would do the same I would do next door Thumbtack I would email as high up person as you can in marketing probably start with have you run next door ads yeah so that was kind of part of my question what I did last year for Christmas light installation um I you to I do if you need Christmas lights hey I can fly out if if the price works out um but yeah so I ran the ads and they they did extremely well which kind of it it's almost frustrating to see that it worked and then now I can't get it working again but I think that's kind of with paid ads it doesn't work for a while but when it does work it explodes paid ads is a constant game of cat and mouse it's constant iteration constantly trying things constantly goes up then goes down and that's that is completely normal for paid ads but it's a you know the you just have to zoom out and say wow this is a magic money machine I'm putting in a dollar and I'm getting three back out every day this is incredible how do I do more of that and so that's totally normal yeah I think Sam's idea of like reach out to their marketing team and find their account rep and be like hey I'm a kid I got this great story I want to learn this where do I who did I learn from who's the smartest at this how could you help me do you guys have ad credits available I would love to be a testimonial for it same sort of thing again use your assets to try to get to make it happen if you need help by the way I think I know people at next door that I might be able to connect you with um so okay so that's by the way hold on before we move on from that uh don't do what we're saying first the first thing you should do is you should type out a letter and you print 1,000 copies on your printer at home and you get a and and you want to make this look not professional I don't want this to be professional I want it to be a typed letter from you that's be like a a paper clipped photo of you like on the on the thing or like act like a big company act like a senior in high school act like a mature senior in high school uh and print it out Fold It Up put it in an envelope and go and put that in a thousand homes uh and I want I want you to Google the Gary Halper dollar letter so it's the there's a famous copywriter Gary Halbert and he wrote this letter and he stapled or paper clipped a dollar bill to the top of it and that was very attention getting people had to pick what is this why is there a Dollar on this thing $1 right $1 took his like open rate and his read rate from you know zero to to 95% type of thing and then he wrote this letter you could do your version of the dollar letter I think that would be tremendously successful so I think Sam's idea is great here but I think there's even a thing you do before that which is you already have something working we're giving you new ideas why don't you advertise why don't you go do Yelp ads Craigslist whatever you already figured out that you could go into a community's next door type something and and uh what was it $60,000 came out the other side so how do you just do that again in the neighborhood next to yours can you find a friend or a kid in that neighborhood and say I will pay you $100 and you were going to type this message in your next door on this sequence cuz they they can post because they live there right and so go get activate basically your brand reps your Affiliates to just clone the script you did in your neighborhood in the two neighborhoods next to you and see if that gives you another 60k per neighborhood yeah so I'm doing something similar uh I'm not sure that I would say it exactly the way I'm doing it because I'm not sure it's necessarily the right way to do it because I know that next door you're really supposed to be a neighbor in the community but to your point um I am doing I this hat is gray my friend this hat is gray I'm good with that I I mapped out a region I'm kind of going by radius um of different Nextdoor neighborhood communities and going from there yeah you're hacking the system that's good you're great can we just become your angel investor real quick and like I kind of want to see where the story goes over the next two years this is gonna be kind of insane Lincoln have you heard of um do you know a guy named Brian scudamore have you ever heard that name sounds familiar but you should Google you should Google this guy he uh started very similar to you it took him years and years to get traction 10 years to get traction uh now his company is called 1800 got junk and he holy he wholly owns it and it does a billion in sales a year so he's a billionaire uh you should you should uh write him he's a or I can introduce you he's a friend of mine and he will absolutely talk to you but you uh you just got to shut up and do this for about 20 years and the results are going to be pretty great that's how this business works right you just kind of put your head down and you get after it yeah but the beauty is you don't know it's 20 years at the beginning you just think it's just right around the corner and you just think it's right around the corner for the next 20 years well he can get rich you're going to get rich as you go if you own the whole thing like these companies can be great if you if you do it right are you going to college sounds like you graduated now or you're about to graduate I'm about to graduate um I'm going to college yes is that maybe Michigan is the goal um I got introduced through formidable Fellowship to uh someone at Michigan who's kind of going to introduce me to people on campus um and so that'll be they have a good business school and like chicks or what are you talking about who who who trying to meet on campus what what are you talking about like some professors some Deans um some people because I haven't gotten accepted yet it's still in do they need their gutters cleaned I don't understand why do you care about the professors and I have good grades and everything but the kind of what it takes to get out of state and to that good of a school what do your parents do do you have like a teal Fellowship Port of this where you just pay people to drop out once you once you realize that they should just keep going as an entrepreneur yeah I mean I could probably pay one person but Bank on that uh my parents my dad is a VP at Spectrum so not no entrepreneurship but he does kind of in the business realm uh my mom's a nurse do they understand do they do they critic uh not criticize they probably don't criticize you do they say they put respect on your name yeah yeah like you get just sit at the head of the table now at dinner no do they uh are they like L this is a fun hobby uh but you know maybe you should consider something more serious or do they and you don't don't disrespect your parents publicly but or or or are they like hey you got a gift this is working keep going they're very traditional in the way that they want me to go to college and they think it's a fun thing to do I'm in high school but yeah Anan do you have a service where you talk to these kids' parents no we don't you know I you know I think uh so yeah I posted about Lincoln getting into you Michigan and I guess luckily some people have reached out right because that's where he wants to go I mean any of these guys probably could skip college and just go pro in business uh but you know I got to respect what what they want to do of course but yeah no obviously if any of them wanted to I'm not sure they would you know they could they could be formidable uh you know without college for sure Lincoln just to put it in perspective real quick you said you did 60k last year you'll do 150k this year of Revenue you're going to make more money than your professors yeah exactly roughly 50% profit margin 40 50% so last year is 30,000 a little over 30,000 profit let's say you can roughly hold that you're getting close to having a million-- Dollar business already so you let's say you're doing 100K a year of profit right now grow and you basically 2x the business um arguably that could be you know somewhere between a $400,000 business to a million dollar business it's like one more year after that and you're a millionaire seasoning exactly U just to put that in perspective of like the opportunity and I I guess I want to make sure I wouldn't have known that when I was your age well I wouldn't have known how to do any of the [ __ ] you did but uh even if I was there I wouldn't have really had that perspective because you kind of as a as a business owner as a small business owner you sort of value your business just on what you eat at the end of the day so you're like oh I made $30,000 I did a whole bunch of work that's great but you know that doesn't pay for one year of college whereas you look at it you're like I'm one year away from being a millionaire if I just literally get two more neighborhoods on board or one more neighborhood to to to do the same thing that I just did right so you you are you are very close to a very meaningful size business and I hope you you know continue that as your new angel investor I hope yeah like I I I don't think people truly grasp this that if you do this is a huge generalization if you do roughly 300 Grand of seller earnings or sorry um of a business owner earnings ballpark in most cases you are worth $1 million and I think that if people understood that they would probably keep going uh a lot harder and I would bet that a lot of the people teaching business at Michigan up some percentage of them you would be richer richer than them before you graduate college yeah and I definitely understand what you guys are saying because the way I think about it is I compare okay a $30,000 salary which is what I made last year is like an entry level job anywhere but going to the point of debling it every year it which you're you're not going to do you're not going to double it every year but you're going to double it for a few more years maybe you should you honestly uh based on what you just described to us you actually have a path where you could probably Forex this business in one year because you've done all of this in a single neighborhood and guess what like you know mo a lot of businesses are like this where they're what I call Pond businesses it works in one Pond it'll work in all ponds uh businesses like any any uh app that takes over a high school will actually be able to take over every high school so Snapchat for example when Snapchat got hot it got hot in two La high schools and investors who were smart knew right away that sure on the surface that only looks like a few thousand users but if it works in one high school and two high schools it's going to work in 14,000 other high schools because all high schools are the same same in the same way that your neighborhood is probably similar to a thousand other neighborhoods or more um across the country and you should be able to sell local services using the same exact blueprint and model that you're doing in those neighborhoods and so I think that you are what you haven't done yet is just replicate it so like you know do it in another neighborhood yet but you said that your next door ads were working and you said that you're starting to be able to post in new neighborhoods I would I would be I would actually be surprised if you can't triple this business just doing that just doing that properly yeah so the I mean the next door eyes from last year um I'll kind of run through the numbers it was a $9 cost per lead $30 customer acquisition cost and a $600 $650 average transaction value so 21 to1 Raz um so I think that just based on 21 to1 by the end of this year if I just pump as much as I can into those ads I think I'll be and look it it'll go down it won't stay 21 to1 but it doesn't matter three to one you're laughing so you have a huge margin of safety I thought you said you didn't know what you were doing like you Christmas lights I guess but window cleaning I don't know I guess well the Christmas lights is because there's a a time there's an urgency on that so that's why it's such an easy sale but your your your website's great have you seen his website Sean no I got get I HH pressure cleaning.com URL funky but the domain yeah but the the website's great welcome to sunsh exteriors okay why not sunshine exteriors.com I have a sunshine exteriors Texas but saying I need six months before I can transfer the domain because I just bought it on a different hosting platform because I needed emails with a branded domain there's a you could definitely transfer domain faster whatever that that part's not right doesn't take six months but um okay great let me ask you a different question do people come back do they do it again like do you have you been in business long enough to know the repeat rate yeah so didn't do a great job of tracking it and not quite enough to know the repeat rate I'll start seeing the repeat rate this year because most of my customers were from last year um but from first year to second year I would say it's probably close it's low probably 10% okay wow this is great okay congratulations anything else linoln before we before we let you go because this was kind of great one question so if you guys were in my position right and you are going to against your parents judgment not go to college what advice do you have for someone in that position all right so the pitch is like this you're going to sit them down and you're going to say mom and dad let me show you the potential outcome so what's what uh what you're near A&M maybe I I don't know where you're okay that's another CA yeah I would say look the average salary that a graduate of B in the business administration school is this I don't know what it's going to be probably 80 grand I'm already going to make that and if you go to uh what's the the broker that we like Sean uh Quiet Light brokerage you go to quiet light brokerage.com and you say here's how much these businesses sell for in one year I'm going to already be well above the average in terms of of of earnings for a first second and third year postgraduate A&M business admin graduate or whatever I'm going to be already out earning that all I'm asking for is one year you don't need to support me financially all I need is your blessing I just want you to say say get after it Go and achieve your dreams because look if you look at all of the change in the world it all a lot of it is is due to someone who just went out and got after it and made a lot of money and I'm trying to do that and if it doesn't work after one year I'll do what you asked me to which is go to a great school but just give me 12 months to make this happen and I don't want anything except for your emotional support how's how's that pitch Sean is that good enough it's great uh that's exactly right you want to ask for The Gap year not the full four um so so you don't have to make this like long-term life-altering decision just say hey I'd like to basically I want to take a gap year and really give this my all I think I'm going to learn a lot I'm already learning a lot and I think this could really grow into something um and you know after school is about learning so that you know uh the way you know hey school's great but an education is more important like the thing I would go to school for is to learn about business I'm already learning a ton about business this way and I'm going to learn so much more if I if I just take this year and focus on it and hey at end of this year uh you know what maybe I will actually you know decide hey college is the right move I want to be around friends and I want to do all that and in which case no harm done one Gap year um and if this really takes off we reassess at the end you know I can go the other way and actually maybe maybe continue on this path but I want to take a year and I think I I would start with that so I think the ask is a year not to not to never go to college yeah and then you let them know that like the reasons why and how you're thinking this through and that you want their support that they believed in you you know all up until this point you just want them to keep believing in you you see how that lands you got your little emotional manipulation you have your uh puppy dog clothes you you got it all under the hood we got a lot of stuff going on there but um that's what you want to do and then you see how that goes but at the end of the day like look sometimes just you know it might come to this I hope it doesn't but it might come to this where they say no you got to do this this is you don't know what you're talking about blah blah blah you may have to decide for you what's most important right that's the coming of age that's 18-year old thing and there are plenty of stories of people who do it and then years later their parents are like you know holy crap I didn't know I didn't understand at the time you know you know they come around to it you at the end of the day you got to take control of kind of like what you want for your life but I think that the one year ask should land I think you got like a 50 to 70% success rate with that all right the the the the the median salary of an accountant student at A&M is $660,000 yeah you're going to beat that this year that that's got to that's got to be the numbers that you present to them all right but well they might not it might not all only be about that you know people parents ultimately they just want your good right so they're like we want you to have this education you have your degree that's just like safety net idea uh plus we want you to have that experience you're young blah blah blah so there's like other factors too so I wouldn't I would try to understand so like let's say they say no you got to do this before you start arguing with them just ask them get curious be like okay so like you know it seems like school's got a couple different parts right there's like the learning part which I think I'm getting a lot of here there's friends and social life and then there's like you know the safety net of having your degree like which one is it for you why why do you feel like it's so important what what is the part that really you know let me help me understand and then let them articulate it and then you know exactly what you need to smack down because they've served it up to you about what the reason is that they think you got to go to college that'll work that'll work we're gonna try ion let's give you a shot let's see if your your audio video is working so Anan you want to do an intro for him you want to be his his Bruce Buffer his Dana White here yeah uh so ion is uh a ninth grader uh fun fact went to the same High School is me uh has built an awesome baking business but I think he'll he'll fill you in he's he's a phenomenal entrepreneur yeah all right um hi my name is aan like Alan said um I'm a freshman in Hunter Central High School in Ringo New Jersey um so I'm the founder and CEO of teens to table um we sell homemade baked goods to local establishments across New Jersey and school suppliers as well so my business is one years old and last year I did 4K in Revenue um this year I expect to grow over 600% and aim to do at least $25,000 um which is really exciting um so in addition to my business I'm also a competitive chess player and so right now I'm trying to figure out how to hire people um to help with my production while also maintaining both efficiency and quality and So currently I bake everything myself from cookies to brownies and that really ensures my consistency but I'm considering on bringing a small team to keep with the growing demand that I'm currently gaining so I am before before we go into your question let's just get a little more context on the business so it's baked goods you sell it to who to you said classes and teachers or who are you selling to yeah so I sell to local establishments so bakeries ice cream shops and then I also sell it to schools so when schools serve food and lunch um there's usually my cookie on the Shelf as well okay gotcha you're making all the cookies right now you're going and you're selling to them how are you in that sale you're going you're knocking on doors what's the pitch yeah so the pitch right now is I usually either go to the bakeries and go to the ice cream shops and just go in person or on the phone and I say hey I'm 14 years old and this is actually something that astonishes a lot of people and I um really find that interesting so I say I'm 14 years old I'm the founder of teensa table and I pretty much tell them what I do um usually when I go in I bring samples in my cookies just to make sure they like it and everything's good um that I start with the pitch either can I sell and put a table up or can I put it on your shelves gotcha okay and you said you're going to grow the business 600% so how are you going to get go from 4,000 to 25,000 is it just knock on more doors or is there something more to it yeah so now it's more into the school suppliers so I'm supplying currently to machos and pomptonian which are two school suppliers in my local area um so I'm hoping to get more districts and more schools so C L I just got an order for 700 cookies between the two suppliers um and I'm in contact with two other suppliers arar and another supplier in the local area for my school so both of these plus machas and pomptonian should hopefully get me to $25,000 yeah and why do you have a bunch of uh some type of like Curry and and and other pizza and stuff on your website is that just a stock images that you that are placeholders for now or you actually going to make more stuff oh so that's actually the future goal to bake more stuff so those are the things I've made so far um along from baking I love to cook so I love to cook like Mediterranean food Indian food Mexican food um so apart from the baking that's just another one of my passions and hopefully as I go later on to my business I can incorporate those as well have you thought about putting cookies on your website I believe are there not cookies on there there's Italian food tomatoes and avocados and uh but a cookie would definitely be cool all right so um so sounds like you are you're going full Breaking Bad dude you're going up the supply chain you're finding the the Distributors how good are these cookies by the way I I need to know what are we dealing with here um so the cookies they're really big have you ever guys tried leevan cookies from New York yes that's how they are so that was my goal to design those recipes and I I think I cracked the code there um so that's the cookies taste how much money you have in the bank you you did 40K last year I I imagine you're just doing checky account 4K 4K that's what I said 4K you and you're doing like checking account accounting which is basically just like is my bank account going up uh how much do you have in your bank account so in my bank account I have around 2.1k I'd say all right cool understood that's pretty good okay and so now your question was something around scaling up or hiring right what was the question right yeah so right now I'm trying to hire people um because with the new school suppliers that I'm getting and then machos and pomptonian um it's really hard to just do this myself now especially since it's going to be around hopefully projected 1,000 to 2,000 cookies per week um so I'm considering bringing on a small team to keep up with the growing demand and so my biggest concern for this is I use a commercial kitchen cuz I can't do this really in my house so they charge by hour so if I hire people people to work um am I going to lose my profits and all of my money because they're not going to be as efficient as me when I bake the cookies um and then at the same time I worry that the quality of the cookies could suffer because the people I hire might not follow the exact same process and if they add one more teaspoon let's say of baking powder that might skew off the whole recipe wait so you said that you're doing 50 1,000 cookies a week so 52,000 a year and how much in Revenue uh so Revenue it's going to be around 25k so projected okay so cheap right yes with the cookies since they're bulk ordering I don't make a lot of profit off of them right now let's walk through that you get an order typical order will be how much how many cookies so a typical order is around 600 cookies great 600 cookies on that 600 cookies what are you charging that that end customer or the not the let's assume it's not going straight to the customer but you're sounds like you're selling to the school district or the akery or the the wholesale um relationship so how much are you charging wholesale for that right so for wholesale it's 80 cents per cookie um so between 700 and 800 I make around $400 in Revenue okay and then what does it cost you to to make those cookies yep so I make two cookies I make an oatmeal chocolate chip and I make a chocolate chip both um The Oatmeal costs 27 cents to make and the chocolate chip cost 28 cents to make okay gotcha so you're basically 66% gross margins on the on the cookie itself and that's like includes the kitchen cost and everything or that's literally just the ingredients yes so that includes everything from packaging to the commercial kitchen and to the ingredients and do you have like your Excel file that basically kind of shows your your unit cost and your percentages and when you do that what is it uh what do you see when you when you add in the labor do you see that the profits go to zero or do you CU you're that was your question you're like well my profits go way that's kind of an Excel question not a Sean and Sam question really right so like what does the Excel tell you so it really depends just based on like minimum wage say $15 or $16 per hour um it depends on how many actual people are higher so right now I've been trying to experiment with two or three and seeing if that works in a spreadsheet and right now I'm my profits are going a pretty pretty much to zero so I'm making like 20 to $30 per per order um so I just wanted to see if there was a better and more efficient way to do this um without like choking all my profits raise your prices that's the easiest way so basically I think there's like only two or three ways to grow a business right you sell more of what you already have you sell the same stuff to the current customers but you get them to buy more whether a larger quantity or more often or you raise prices so you those are like so you know there's a great book uh called getting everything you have out of everything you got and it just walks through like those are the only three options sounds like you're selling a lot more stuff if you're going to grow 600% uh but you probably should charge more I would think uh I don't know anything about the cookie business but I think that sounds really cheap right how hard is the sale is the sale really easy if the sale's really easy you should charge more how how often are you turned down when you're asking these people to buy your stuff though it's quite a bit so right now with machos and pomton I signed a contract with them um so that's pretty much going till the end of the school year for me so till June um so with them pomptonian is actually only taking 40 cents per cookie so to me that's like that's a really cheap thing because I'm really making 12 or 13 cents of profit per cookie so with them I'm making like a total of barely anything for profit with P or with machos on the other hand I make 80 cents so they charge I hope they're not listening to this uh oh we're giving out all the leverage um so I make around 80 cents from them as they charge me for a dollar um so I feel like in my question like a followup is if I raise the prices do you think there's they would say we don't want to for you to put your products anymore or is that a possibility well it's definitely a possibility but it's one you got to figure out so two ways to figure this out you can go to your existing customers assume you have a good relationship with them assume they're happy um and you could tell them you could be like hey um how's this going for you they're like oh it's great like awesome awesome I really love working with you you know I'm 14 years old I'm figuring this out as I go and one thing I'm learning is that I'm providing you guys 500,000 cookies right now I cook all of these by myself I need to bring somebody in if I do that I'm I'm not going to make any profit and so I was wondering would it be possible like for us to raise the price here and go to a dollar a cookie or 95 cents a cookie whatever it is that way I'm not losing money providing you business and see what they say they might look at you and your puppy dog eyes and they'll just say yes they might say know and you'll find out right and then when you go to that next Bakery you you're going to go cold test them and they're never even going to know about the 80 cents you just go to them straight away and you say it's $110 a cookie and then you say these cookies are amazing this is a have you ever been to the bakery in New York this is a New York City cookie that I'm bringing to you right so you you have to up the perceived value of the cookie through your packaging through your story through through the benefits that they get working with you and you could say hey I am going to be able to you know tell everybody in our local community that you guys support you know this young entrepreneurs blah blah blah so you got to find a way to be able to charge a higher price and so I think that's your easiest lever because you're not going to be able to get labber for that much cheaper but you can get more margin out of every cookie that you sell and you don't want to grow broke so if you have the wrong model right you have the wrong cost structure today and you let's say you do go get these bigger contracts and you're cooking 10 times more more cookies well you're just literally going to grow broke if you do that right because you're going to have to hire to fulfill those orders but if you don't have the margin to support it you you will go out of business and so and by the way I think you could test these things so first you test it in Excel then you break on one other person and you know you can always cut bait with that person if it turns out that you're not able to you know uh optimize them full fully to to get the cost out to get the benefits out of it um but you know you just go sort of one step at a time I wouldn't go get two or three people i' would start with one and then move to two move to three as you figure out that bottle right okay yeah that makes perfect sense thank you yeah you might also want to try to sell to a richer customer so who is going to be less price sensitive right if you go to local businesses you go to Real Estate you know the guy who's killing it in real estate down there you go to the dentists you go to people who are themselves local entrepreneurs that are making enough money where they don't care if it's 80 cents a cookie a dollar a cookie or $2 dollar a cookie really um they like the story they like you and they want to be supportive I think that might be helpful versus going to somebody like arar aark I think literally provides food to like prisons and and school cafeterias right they're it's going to be harder to get wiggle room with them than it is to to get you know the local dentist to to say sure thing but yeah or local car dealerships things like that that story is so much better when you have your face on it with the with a with the story and then your stuff right there you should maybe do you have like a sign so that let's say I am the car dealership and I do carry your cookies like they could just give away a free cookie to every customer who walks in by the way they're selling cars I think a pretty known sales tactic is you you know Sam you used to do this right you go negotiate with somebody off Craigslist what's the first thing Sam brings oh yeah it's called the rule of reciprocity so basically I do something nice to someone whether it's something really small like I go hey you know uh I was going to meet you to look at this car uh they I just brought a Coke I went and brought a Coke you you want a Coke a Coca-Cola as well and then uh the rule of reciprocity states that when you do something nice to someone they will always or almost always do something nice back and it's often times not in proportion to the gift that you gave them so you do one little small things nice they'll do something a lot bigger in return because you always want to just like be even right okay yeah so I would go to like a local car deal local car dealer and just say hey I want to provide you guys cookies every week that you guys can just give out to customers and they come in trust me there's have you ever heard of the rule of reciprocity people are much more likely to want to buy when they're eating a eating a delicious cookie and they feel taken care of and this thing is going to cost you a dollar but if you close even one more sale this whole year this whole year right you know that's a $35,000 sale for you um you know this this pays itself back in spades and so you can make a pitch like that and you can go get actually like uh contracts with people who are willing to pay more right so a simple rule of business is sell to the people who have money and dude I want to see you I want to see it give like a speech like a Wolf of Wall Street where it just like ends with like sign on the dotted line for Christ you know what I mean like I want to see him like like pitch these hard yeah actually that is one piece of advice I'd give you which is that look this this probably won't be your last business this is the first business this is your starter business and you're going to learn a whole bunch you're going to get more value out of The Story You're creating than the cookies that you sell my first business was a su Sushi business we probably made I don't know $14,000 of profit in the one year of operations that we were we were working on that thing but the story that I told about how we cold called a Food Network chef and how I went door to-door selling Sushi how we you know reverse first engineered the POS systems to figure out all the sales of all Chipotle stores in the Colorado area those stories got me bigger and bigger opportunities as I went they got me speaking opportunities they got me into accelerators they got me other other doors open and so one tip for you is while you sell the cookies you should be building the story so the story of yeah I went into the car dealership and I I gave a talk called how you can increase sales by 600% like me and I talk to the car salesman about the rule of reciprocity and how they they they customers my cookies even if it's not a lot of cookies it's an awesome story and putting yourself in those positions will build your skill and build your story which ultimately is going to be a lot more valuable than the cookies that you sell I believe okay yeah that that sounds really great and definitely for the car dealership that's a great thing to put in mind for me even even though I have these suppliers I think it's good to start advancing and thinking about more places to sell so I think that's a really good that's really helpful advice yeah all right thank you man uh you're uh you're killing it keep going just it's amazing how far you are at at 14 um all right next Abigail where you at Abigail hi where are you from um I'm from Odessa Missouri oh nice I'm from Missouri too uh hey Sean I posted Abigail's Instagram I want you to click it and I want you to look at what her hobby is so scroll down you're going to see like it looks like some prom photos but keep on scrolling down and you're going to see that in her free time she's a race car driver what yes okay Triple Threat student entrepreneur Sprint car driver how did you get into that Abigail so actually I'm a third generation Sprint car driver so my grandpa drove race cars my dad has driven race cars and then I kind of just passed it on down to me that is awesome amazing okay so Abigail uh how old are you and what's your business um I am a senior at Odessa High School I'm 17 years old and my business is growing and selling crinums so like mums which is like something you'd put on your front porch during um like the fall season and Halloween so that's what I do right now um my business is two years old last year I made 15 or this past summer I guess I made 15,000 in revenue and this year I expect to grow by 100% And aim to do at least 30,000 in Revenue now God damn okay so explain us the business so where do the flowers come from who do you sell them to so how my business works is I actually order the mums which we call plugs cuz they're like about this big and I order them from a company in North Carolina I also have to order fertilizer so we can make sure the plants get nutrients that they need I have to order the soil and then the pots for it so that all goes into the price for the mums and then we have about a two week long process of putting it all together because we have to mix the soil and then we put them into color blocks and then put the mums in the color Block it's a really really long and tedious process then we put them on our um what we call runs and they're like big tarps with watering lines and for the next like 3 to four months I spend watering and then after it's they're ready to go and they're fertilized and watered and they're grown to about as big as they can get we marked it them to schools and fundraisers and I also do retail at my own house so I try to post that on social media and try to hand out flyers to like local towns and post them at local businesses wow that is a lot of work um I'm looking at this this picture which is just like a field or like these like long long rows of these potted plants with the watering system is this where where do you do this is this your backyard what is going on so I live on 40 acres and um about 30 acres is uh leased out for farmland and the rest of it is for my moms pretty much so anywhere we can put them on the yard we pretty much put them there and right now we're in the process of building a greenhouse so from my profit with my mom's I've been able to buy a greenhouse so that I can have a place to start my moms and also a greenhouse is a good place to have a steady revenue for the other six months out of the Year where I'm not growing moms so you um sorry so I missed the part of you're selling so you're selling to said you said school fundraisers businesses and you're handing out flyers you said so who's the core customer who's the who's the main customer so right now we're trying to do um wholesale as our core customer so that if like what we do is I'm in FFA so FFA chapters will sell it for a fundraiser Sean doesn't know what the FFA is you got to you got to spell this out okay FFA used to stand for Future Farmers of America but we've kind of veered away from that because we don't want it to be the stereotypical about cows and like farming what we really do right now is we promote youth in agriculture and leadership in agriculture and we're pretty much growing the next generation of agricultur list so Sean if you grew up in a in a a more rural environment uh if you're in high school like you kind of by default join the FFA there's millions and millions and millions of members and it was kind of like a thing like instead of Boy Scouts or girl scouts maybe not instead of but it's similar to that in rural areas you join the FFA and you get like your FFA jacket and they're like pretty they're pretty famous what do you do once you join they you go out so for me I currently serve as my local chap chapter president in area 6 Sentinel and I'm running for a Missouri FFA State office so what I really do is I um do public speaking events and stuff like that so it's really shaped me into I who I am because right now talking to you like I'm am not nervous and I know that my freshman year I would have been completely nervous because I never did public speaking and it kind of just shapes you to get those like life skills that you need in the long run okay College acceptance letter all right that was a great great essay so you um okay so sorry so your Co you said your core customers wholesale what does that mean who's the who's the buyer so right now we're trying to do contracts with re with um like hardware stores around us so we have a couple like um Hometown kind of hardware stores and then some bigger ones that are all across Missouri and right now we're just kind of focused on Missouri because delivering my product is kind of one of the hardest parts so we actually get to use my Sprint car trailer to deliver all of the moms so that's kind of that's kind of funny how it clashes and how much profit did you do this last year we did 15,000 and you did 15,000 in Revenue I thought you said yeah how much in profit so our profit was about I think seven to eight wow right because just because of like each year it fluctuates like how much the soil is going to cost or how much the pots are going to cost and our really our big cost this year was making those runs and now we already have those so it's something that we can pack away for like the fall and the winter time and then we can put them out next year and that's another cost we don't have to pay for so abigo let me ask you a question if you wanted to sell 10 times more mums how would you do that like not you said you're going to double your sales what if you wanted to go 10 times bigger what would you do I think that right now that's kind of what I'm like my question to you guys was going to be just because I like to do the wholesale part of it but also know that I can't grow how much I want to grow just doing wholesale but I think really right now my biggest thing is going to be just getting my company out there and like promoting it better to other companies so that they would possibly sign a contract for us so we can have that fixed amount that we're going to sell to them like you know I went to farm con which was this conference that Sam had told me about it's it was actually in uh Kansas City and uh you know there was like 5,000 people there they're all farmers and if they had heard your story on stage I think a lot of people would have handed you a card said hey let me know how I can help love what you're doing I'm so excited that somebody in um somebody in this next generation is excited about agriculture it's great to see it I want to support that I think there's a lot of that Goodwill and I wonder if maybe the faster way to 10x your sales would be like who's the CEO of whatever uh Home Depot or what whatever like the wholesale store is that's hardware like how do you go to them and be like hey I want to be in your store like that is my goal that is my dream and I I want to get my moms on your shelves how do I make that happen and you just I think if you hustled more to the top you could actually get uh more growth faster than going Bottoms Up In this case because your story is your asset right yeah the the flowers might be great but your story is the real differentiator how many other people are there with your story zero and so how do how are you using your story to unlock the growth is what I would be doing whether it's telling your own story on Tik Tok it's getting on stage at places like farmcon or the FFA annual whatever event or it's getting that cold sending cold emails every single day to the CEOs of all of the major uh distributors or retailers until one of them takes your meeting and puts you on their shelves if you listen we did this episode with Nick MO he was this guy in New Zealand literally like on the other side of the earth making toys by himself and he was like I emailed every retailer in every country every single day and he's like I just kept doing that until they finally cracked and they would tell me no I'm not interested not interested and one day they would be like can I see a sample or hey are you going to be at that show I'm going to the show if you're there I'll I'll I'll take 15 minutes and meet with you and he would fly there and make it happen and I think if you 10x your approach towards getting the major distributor I think you you might Leap Frog into a much bigger space because otherwise the way you describe this like I'm tired just hearing how you grow these things like it is so much work to just get the product made that I feel like you it's only worth doing that if you're going to be able to have like land some like major sales versus then it's also double the work to go sell to every school for a fundraiser and Mom and Pops I think that's just like too much work there's also a for all of you all uh there's a small window that you have where you're like this Prodigy you're young and lovable yeah yeah that that's going to go away but you've got this like two to maybe sixe window where you being pestering that's just cute and awesome and then in a few years it's going to be annoying and weird and so so while while that window is open take it you know take that opportunity it's a we have a friend who was 18 and they got written up in the in Tech crunch as like the Young Hot Shot Prodigy he's 23 now and he's like he feels washed up he's like I can't use my store like my entire stick was that I was young he's like nobody wants to hear about a 23-year-old Prodigy there's no such thing you're not you're not a Phenom anymore yeah it's like a it's like a it's like a blind painter you know like you you got to use everything you can use that story like you know you can get away with a lot right now and uh the same stuff that you're going to be able to get away with now you're not going to be in the future and so I would definitely do exactly as Sean's saying which is go hard on going to the top and you you you you you're not really annoying when you're 18 doing this yeah Abigail in the next 30 days do you think you could get a meeting with the CEO of either Ace Hardware or Home Depot I think I don't know I think that that is something that like just sounds crazy to me like I feel like I probably could just because I'd like to say I'm a very well spoken person and very like good with my words but right now I just have like a lot of other things going on so it's hard to like Focus all of my time on my business because I am a senior this year so that's just like kind of hard that's the only time I think that this this excuse is valid I would say okay that that is the only time that I will accept that excuse I want to give everyone listening and you guys uh a little bit of feedback that I learned when I was a little bit younger which is the most powerful people on Earth are one cold email away and because of email and because of Instagram which you guys have grown up on and all these and everything else on social media you would be shocked at how small the world is and it sounds insane to say email the CEO of this large Billion Dollar Plus multi- tens of billions of dollar company that sounds insane but I think that you are literally I wouldn't say one email I would say you're one email and 20 follow-ups away from just about everyone on Earth and there's been times where we I even emailed um Jeff amazon.com and I think I followed up like 20 times and I got a no thank you but just it's just proof that you are you are much closer than you think to just about every single person you you want to reach particularly some type of executive all right I'm going to show you something real quick abigo before uh you know fifth period starts here so just check this out all right there's this guy on Twitter right now his name sonith he's uh or his Twitter handle sonith he's building zows which is another young uh student program I think it's at Stanford but just check out this this is a cold email that my friend Nico who's now a famous venture capitalist he invests in Snapchat really early on again off a cold email uh okay you might not be able to read this I'll read it to you it's uh him emailing Elon Musk okay so I'm giving you the the CEO of Home Depot and Ace Hardware this guy emailed Elon Musk and he goes Dear Mr musk and he says I'm a graduate student at Stanford and taking this class blah blah blah I'm writing a paper about Tesla's strategy because I think you're such an innovative company and we're going to put together our recommendations on the future of your corporate strategy since you're the chairman of Tesla I thought it'd be great if we could do a short interview with you in person over the next few weeks to talk about your strategy I'm aware that you receive dozens of similar requests on a daily basis that's why I'll do my best to make this not only useful but an entertaining experience for you and your company's exec hopefully we able to contribute first class recommendations I'm happy to sign an NDA blah blah blah I look forward to hear hearing from you I would be grateful if you participate in our research Nico and then Elon writes back okay if you can limit the meeting to 20 minutes or schedule for late in the evening and this was Nico as a student there's another email of him by the way that's not even a good email that's not even email that not and let me show you another one I just saw literally today so the cool thing about following this guy on Twitter is every day he's tweeting out a cold email somebody sent uh so this is Corey Levy who runs zfas now so this is him emailing Andy rodic the tennis player's mom so not Andy rodic his mom so he finds his mom's email address and he goes Dear Mrs rodic and he goes um as you already know from my previous emails my name is Ley from Houston Texas I'm 12 turning 13 and I'm a big fan of your son Andy I know Andy's playing this tournament in Houston I was wondering if I could uh meet him and or hit with him before I've been dying to hit with him for the last two years please email me back Corey and then she says Corey thanks for the note Andy's gonna beat Houston as the tournament gets closer reach out again I'll definitely make a range for you to meet him can't promise you'll hit with him but I'll try um please keep in touch and keep playing tennis it's a great sport turns out Cory was like 34 when he wrote that emo though so it was kind of weird when he showed up he's still got a baby face actually so [ __ ] I say all that to say this which is uh one you should follow this guy cuz if you see every day a cold email that works it'll go from that sounds crazy to this is perfectly normal and that's one of the reasons why people should listen to this podcast is one of the reasons why you should follow people on Twitter who are inspiring because they will make the crazy seem normal and that's all you need is to delude yourself into believing it's normal to actually make it happen the second thing I'll say is you describe the process of like a multi-month potting and moving and arranging and watering and kissing and touching the flowers to make them all work and then I was like hey could you send a cold email you're like I don't know I got a lot of class coming up so I challenge you which is I think this email is going to be the least of your worries I think sending a cold email every day will take you literally no no more than 10 minutes and I think you've got that 10 minutes I think so because you just showed me your 10 Acre Farm you're doing by yourself so so um what happens is that familiar work feels comfortable and feels easy familiar work feels hard and you you sort of talk yourself out of it you tell yourself a story about why it's your senior year you don't have time in reality the thing I'm telling you is a lot easier than the stuff you're already doing so that's my challenge to you whether you you choose to accept it pick 100 people who you want who you want to reach okay spend only 30 minutes a day for the next month and follow up with each of them 10 times until they say no thank you or yes uh and your your reply rate if you're any interesting or any good is going to be about 10% so most everyone's going to say no or not going to reply but I promise you 10% out of 100 is going to be awesome it's going to change your life one one more thing go Google Sam par cold email go read Sam's cold emails he sent to recruit speakers to hustle con this like you know random conference that he was starting and the follow-ups is where the magic is so there's the initial email which a few brave people are willing to do then there's the four follow-ups that Sam was sending that nobody's willing to do I would go read those the other thing is there's a great story of Tiff fa AB do you know Tim Ferris I don't believe so wow that's amazing Sam she knows us she doesn't know Tim Ferris holy [ __ ] dude our heroes are their grandparents you know what I mean like all right so uh Tim has this gra Tim wrote this book called The four-hour work week and he's this great guy he's going to Great podcast so he has a story where he went to a Stanford Business School course and he offered a challenge he said I will give a round the world ticket so an all expense paid round the world plane ticket to anybody here who can get in touch with the um whoever could cold email and get in touch with the highest kind of uh most hard-to-reach person so the whole class reach out to whoever you want whoever gets the person highest on the food shade gets around the world ticket and he um by the end of the class I don't I'll butcher the exact story you can go read it but by the end of the class he um he's like okay so who who got who and I think one person got like I don't know Bill Clinton or something like that and he's like oh amazing who else did other people get and most people like I think of the class only four or five people got anybody and he asked he's like what what was the difference was it your cold email script and it was basically that like 85% of the class 90% of the class didn't even try they just perceived it to be too hard anybody that tried reached somebody and then within that group of people some people literally reach like a former sitting president and so I think that uh there's a lesson in there which is that like most people just won't even try and this is something that sounds hard but it's actually not that hard especially when you have your type of story um I think it will actually be trivially easy for you you'll be surprised the CEO of Ace Hardware you if you emailed him you will be the most interesting email he got that day because guess what there's not a lot of other 18-year-old Sprint car drivers young entrepreneurs who are selling or who are interested agriculture who are actually out there doing it and not even just talking about it there's there's only you know a couple and nobody's emailing them so I think it's going to be a lot easier than you think it's something I'll definitely give it have to give it a try all right I'll take that hey thank you you're you're fantastic uh I'm gonna cold email you every day until you C email them all right I think that's how far okay it' be a good reminder I and you'll have to invite us to Odessa I want to watch one of your races I want to drive the damn thing definitely definitely where did you say you're from Missouri I'm from St Louis yeah I'm from St Louis you're from St Louis yeah I'm from Odessa which is just a little bit east of Kansas City yeah where uh a lot of people like if you told Sean that he wouldn't know anything but uh you know the difference between K KC and St Louis is like LA and SF Sean so not that similar pretty much um but all right who we got next by the way just to recap Abigail shoot your shot cold email use your story to uh to go to the top and think about how you could 10 extra business instead of two extra business and follow up until you die yeah Sam cold emailed his way out of Missouri and you can too all right Anan thank you for bringing these folks to us yeah absolutely um let me just plug real quick uh March 14th's our next deadline so formidable fellowship.org and I think for just generally this has given me like an amazing amount of Hope in like the Next Generation cuz I think the stories you hear are like you know everybody's just scrolling away on Tik Tok ruining wasting away their life and like we see honestly hundreds of like amazing young people you met just three of them today so um yeah so you know if if you like what these guys do please support them by cooking you Ms are you just doing good in the world now is that what's happened you're just doing good no I mean no this is I mean this is fun this is a lot of fun you know it puts a lot of wind in my sales he put up about 500 Grand or something of you and your partner's money he's just doing good this is amazing did it's called the second Mountain this is what you do when you we got 700 Grand with donations now so I mean we got lots of money for Grants so if there's young entrepreneurs if parents are hearing this you know we've had a lot of parents whove reached out saying this inspired their kids to start a business so hopefully we'll see them in six or 12 months so yeah and I mean it's it's pretty dope like what has started to happen and we're only four and a half months in so we're still why AR you doing this that's a great question that's what I'm asking myself this is amazing all right you just you can just join us Sean it's all all the infrastructure set up that took the longest so just you need like a hype man cuz that's kind of my skill else I don't really have much else but yeah yeah we need a hype man for sure so uh no but these guys you know these guys are great you know if you need to buy mums cookies you need your you know you want your uh you want your home beautified and to protect that asset as Lincoln said uh you know where to go dude it's also awesome not to hear about AI do you know what I mean like which is great which is great but like it's like you know these guys are actually doing the damn thing like in real life and it sounds awesome to hear different different stuff yeah I I think the other thing we like a podcast with these guys called future Titans and like ion goes through a story of like emailing and going door too like a hundred times and getting rejected right and so I think like the things that they learn out of building their businesses are phenomenal you know Abigail walks through this like horiculture issue which is like way above my pay grade where like the mums were getting overwatered

so that was the first Golden Goose and then you said you started stacking geese like a rapper you know at the club so what's the second I hope that becomes a term that we can use stack and GE stack and geese we we got to get some shirts my merch guy hey merch [Music] guy so Brent runs permanent Equity you uh started off as a Founder you started buying companies and you then started raising money to buy companies so you raised like something like 50 million bucks for your first fund you started buying companies with that then a couple years later you raised about $250 million to buy more companies and now you own I don't know something like 16 companies that do over $350 million a year of Revenue and I believe what you said was $50 million of free cash flow out of the portfolio now which is pretty incredible so that's who you are that's what you're bringing to the table and I think Sam where do we want to go with this cuz we could ask you about buying businesses I have some questions around that but I kind of want to start with something light before we go into like hey can you teach me how to be private Equity please yeah we we could do the light stuff and then you also you've got the we call it the all Shucks waren Buffett attitude where you've got a A list of onliners you write amazing annual reports you're a great writer so we have a bunch of onliners that we want to ask you about as well sounds good what can you tell me what's the what what do you buy and what are the biggest companies you buy like pool companies and HVAC companies yeah I mean we typically uh we we've got everything from a children's clothing brand to a military recruitment firm to manufacturing construction business services I mean it's really the 16 companies it's a you know it looks like the Island of Misfit Toys uh for us they're they're companies that we love the people who we get to work with uh they're in industries that we feel like are not going to be changing we can talk about how some of them maybe look like high change especially like the children's clothing uh would seem high change on the surface but is actually uh not and um yeah we try to partner with them for a long time what's the biggest one in terms of revenue and profit let's see our in terms of Revenue and profits probably uh our fencing business out of Dallas Texas is is probably the largest so we um we have a big market share in the in the Dallas Market and um yeah it's a it's a it's a pretty sizable business all right my friends so a lot of you guys who listen to the show you listen because you want to start a company but you're not sure what idea to choose or you may not even have an idea and you like our podcast my first million because we've done a lot of the work for you on Research ing all these business ideas well my friends we've made life a lot easier for you because HubSpot they just put together an entire list of all the resources that you can use to find a market opportunity

link below click it and you can have access to the whole thing it's completely free now back to the show I was going to ask you a similar question like you know people are always like you can't pick a favorite kid and as an investor you can you have this portfolio and like some are better than others and that's okay it would be weird if all of your companies were equally successful Investments I wouldn't believe you and so what's like the Golden Goose for you so which one is like like I know in my portfolio right I have like I have like a mini version of what you do where we have like four or five companies that we kind of have either bought or own a big stake in and I could tell you I'll be like oh this like for us like the somewhere. comom business was like my Golden Goose partly cuz I got in on a great price but also the business tripled since we bought it and it's just this business that just spits out cash flow and it's like the market keeps growing for this people need this and so for us that's been the the Golden Goose it just keeps laying a golden egg every single month for us what's the Golden Goose in your portfolio yeah well we've been fortunate to actually like we we've kind of stacked golden geese on one another is how I would describe it so uh the very first business I bought it's called media cross is a military recruitment firm bought that in in very early 2010 explain in layman terms what does that even mean military recruitment firm what's happening yeah so uh we at the time worked with two branches of the military now we work primarily with one uh we had two contracts one was to recruit civilian Mariners into a division of the Navy called military seed lift command that resupplies the ships that never came into Port so it's about uh 1,400 to 18800 civilian Mariners a year recruited into that division that's our responsibility so we do all of the marketing and recruitment efforts and then the processing to bring them into that branch of the military does that mean like you're out you're out on the street with people or does that mean you're running ads and you own like a Le gen website all of that stuff yeah we're we're doing we're doing Le gen we have a whole processing center we're actually doing qualifications for these people um so it's it's a complete Soup To Nuts uh operation and and the government just pays you per recruit or how does that work yeah we're on a fixed contract um that that that escalates every year uh based on the Staffing and needs of the business so we it's basically a staffed contract and then we have uh um you know sort of a built-in profit margin that's on top of that what do you get per recruit per referral for one of these things oh gosh I don't even know because we're not we're not based on that right so so we we've done this for the the contract is we've had it as a business for 30ish years now um it's been forever um and uh I mean we're so deeply embedded into what they do we know exactly what it takes we I mean we are the outsourced function of that that piece of the military why is that business great is it because you got this cash flow but you have this contract so you have the certainty and defensibility with that is that what's great about that business yeah I mean so like for the most part we know what our profitability is going to be in three years from now right and so once you get that business optimized and you get great people in place and the the leader of that business we've had uh I mean she's been with the business since the very beginning so we're 15 years into the relationship she's doing a great job and it just it it clicks so that was that was I would call the original Golden Goose that allowed me to paid back the SBA I I've heard you say you accidentally bought your first business is that what you meant when you say you what does that even mean how do you accidentally buy a business yeah I I I got a call from a guy and he was like Hey I want to introduce you to this guy he's at your uh he's in your industry you know he said marketing marketing because i' had launched a a call it an ad Agency for all intents purposes uh before then and he was like hey he's jior industry you should get to know him and I said okay great he's like oh by the way the guy's uh he's gotten left at the altar for the second time trying to sell his business recently and I was like well okay I guess I could take a run at it I had no idea what I was doing I was 24 at the time um no idea what I was doing and um I sat in front of this guy and and you know we talked about it and we negotiated and he said I would never sell it to you for the price you asked for and I was like that's fine no problem and I didn't talk to him for seven months and then seven months later he called me up out of the blue and said uh just renewed our largest account business is in great shape I'm exhausted uh I'll give it to you for the price you asked for but you got to close all cash 60 days from now and it was one of those where you kind of like you make the sale on you know you go down the elevator and you say oh [ __ ] uh it was it was like that right and I remember getting off the phone and I was like oh crap like I I just obligated myself to go buy like buy a business I have no idea what I'm doing did you know anything about digital marketing uh yeah I mean we had we we did digital marketing work back then you have a marketing agency you stumble into this business um you're like May somebody tell tells you there's a chance to buy it you're like all right I could try he says no to the first price he comes back you're not even following up he comes back and says hey still interested but you don't have a lot of money you're 24 years old so you go to the SBA and you get SBA loan for this thing yep correct yeah I I asked my newly married wife to sign a personal guarantee and she was like what's that and I was like a don't worry about it no big deal you're like good news and bad news good news no prup but you do have to sign this other thing exactly what happens if this doesn't go well I was like it's probably not going to be great um so yeah so for somebody who's never done an SBA loan what can you explain just like you put down X you get y what's how it all works yeah back then um so the requirements have changed a little bit I think it's like 5 or 10% you have to put down now and I think you can actually qualify with seller financing I'm not an expert anymore on SBA I've only done the SBA one time and that was literally 15 years ago back then what I did was I account uh leverag the accounts receivable from the existing business as the down payment and then got the the rest of the debt through the SBA and so I mean I put very little cash into the deal so you put basically zero down I mean it was a it was a lot of my my money but it was just tied up in other assets but yes I mean in terms of actual cash that was coming out of my pocket was not a lot I didn't have a lot of cash um and so um yeah I ended up asking my buddy at the SBA was he was part of an SBA lender I said hey do you guys do like expedited SBA Loans he was like not really uh we don't do that and I was like well I need it in 60 days and he was like that's really not possible and I was like can we make it possible like let's try how much how much are you talking that that you had to borrow it was a million bucks yeah it was a million dollars and was this like your C's candy like Buffett bought se's candy and returned like a billion dollars in free cash flow or more than that to the to the headquarters over the last whatever 50 years or whatever it's been yeah it's it's it's like a 20xr yeah so that's amazing so that was the first Golden Goose and then you said you started stacking geese like a rapper you know at the club so what's the second I hope that becomes a term that we can use stack and Gees stack and geese we we got to get some shirts made merch guy hey merch I you know how like Rogan has like Jamie I kind of have this like fictional studio in the room where I'm like pull that up hey merch guy get on that like there's nobody here mer guy yeah yeah merch guy um yeah I mean I knew I knew so little back then I remember uh my lawyer said okay we got to start due diligence and I literally typed into Google do diligence like due like I had no idea what it was um and I was I was like reading about it as he was talking me I was like oh yeah we just asked questions like how hard can that be um so anyway uh it was quite the adventure that's amazing yeah another another anecdote on that deal was uh a week before closing I said okay so I take all of my money and I give it to you you take all the money out of the business like how do I make payroll and the guy was like well you obviously got a line of credit on the business right and I was like no I didn't I didn't do that and he was like well the business is going to go under immediately and I was like yeah that's not good what do we do and he was like well you got to figure this out cuz you're getting getting ready to close on the business and I was like can I get a loan from you so he actually lent me money to as a line of credit to keep the business operating because I didn't even I didn't even think about it I didn't think about like oh well he's going to take all the money and there's not gonna be any cash to operate the business I was um I was with this guy this weekend and he was like hey should I start my own business you know I'm 28 I don't think I have enough experience though and I was like yeah I'm pretty sure like a lack of experience isn't like hasn't stopped a lot of people uh you can kind of be like a kind of a dummy and get into it and you'll learn in like 6 months and you are a good example of that you don't really need to know much huge dummy is exactly the way I think about myself and like the uh lean manufacturing part uh like kind of philosophy they have this idea of like just in time right you you you do things just in time versus doing everything ahead of time and so just in time learning is basically what you did it's like oh when I need to close then I figure out what due diligence is then when I need to take over the business I learn what working capital is and you just you learned each of the Core Concepts as you needed them which is actually the real way that people learn rather than I'm going to learn everything up front then I'm then I'm fully prepared to now go do this and like in reality that's not how how life works yeah and sometimes it doesn't work out and I you know I joke that I'm a force private equity for a reason so what else do you own that's awesome yeah so the next business uh we bought uh was a was a pool business out in Arizona um and that was uh just with again started uring cash and um started building that up and and bought that business and again that one turned out to be a a great investment as well you you say you say that nonchalantly like oh a pool business but it's also like dude that would be really random I don't think about pool businesses nobody shows me a pool business so what what were you doing you're talking to Brokers where does that deal come from like for you at that time yeah so it was about so see so I had no idea what I was doing after I bought the business the media cross in 2010 I was like oh that worked I should do more of what works and less of what doesn't at the time there wasn't a lot of writing on the internet about this um so I mean there was a little bit of uh stuff out of Harvard a little bit out of Stanford around search funds but there was very little activity online and so uh I was like well I just need to ask around like are there are there people doing this I didn't even literally know that there was a thing called private Equity That's how little I knew I mean I I started somebody was like oh you did a private Equity deal and I literally Googled private equity and I was like turns out there's a whole industry of people that do this like why would they not do it like in smaller companies and uh that was my forray into it and so at that point we said okay well if we're going to go find other businesses I mean how hard can it be this one just came to us there must be just tons of businesses out there just Flo around ready to be uh ready to be bought and so we started reaching out to people and developed deal Pipeline and one of the deals that took us so that that pool deal we first saw in 2012 I want to say um and it took us about three years to get the deal done and um it was just hanging around the hoop and they actually went with two other buyers before us and ultimately had a good relationship with them and time between deal one and deal two was three years it was uh five years Sean isn't it crazy how long things take like Brent's like a Brent's a big shot right now like you know people know you and you like you're talking about hundreds of millions in Revenue but you started this in like 16 years ago like that's a I mean it's a huge success and everything but it like really goes to show you that like you have to grind for or at least be consistent for a decade plus oh absolutely no I mean I I I say to people all the time like if I had been given $50 million to invest in like 2010 I like I would have lost all the money like it took so long to build up like to make a bunch of mistakes make a bunch of mistakes that were low stakes felt like high stakes at the time that were low stakes uh in order to be able to to to Warrant having more resources and so yeah so at some point somebody did give you $50 million how'd you get somebody to give you $50 million to go buy companies because I'd like that yeah uh well so uh funny story I met this guy named Patrick on the internet and uh literally he put out a tweet Patrick oan put out a tweet and this is when he was like an analyst at at his dad's firm and he put a tweet about Capital allocation I responded I was like yeah I can hop on the phone and talk about Capital allocation I didn't really understand what he was even asking he was asking about public markets like capital allocators and public markets but I I didn't know much and so I just reached out and said yeah sure let's talk we get on the phone he's like so what are you do and I was like oh I buy these these small businesses he's like well how much do you pay and I was like I don't know like between three and five times and he was like what like are these businesses going out of business like are these are these going under are these distressed I was like no these are healthy businesses he's like I've never heard of this what is this and so we talked like two or three more times and he said well can I come visit you in columia and I said sure So he flew to Missouri and we spent a day together at the end of it he said like I want my family to invest in what you're doing like I believe in what you're doing and I said sorry like we don't take outside Capital like I'm not going to do a 2 and 20 10 year fund life uh looked at that uh don't want to do a hold Co and value the current assets and uh you know get saddled with a bunch of Partners I don't know who they are like Life's good like we're making a bunch of money and compounding and like everything's fine and um he asked me the question no one else had asked me cuz we flirted with some family offices at that point and and he said uh well what would it take for you to take our capital and I said well I don't know and he said well why don't you figure that out and get back to me and I'll tell you if we can do it or not and so I whiteboard it out our current structure which is like kind of the opposite of traditional private Equity so we take no fees of any kind no reimbursements of any kind there's no cash that comes from the portfolio companies uh or from the LPS to the GP outside if we take a percentage of free cash flow above a hurdle as we return cash back you got to redo that last 20 seconds can you dumb that down a little bit I I got you Sam he's the guy working in Cinnabon that doesn't touch any of the Cinnabons so he's in an industry where everybody's like feing up everywhere they're just getting high on the sugar and he's like I'm good I don't need that do references or analogies cuzz that was uh much easier than talking about hurdles and sprinting and whatever yeah oh you're a runner cool me too yeah well so okay so traditional private Equity you you you raise a fund and you get 2 percentage of the uh of the amount every year every year by the way you get 2% so which is actually like getting 20% of the total correct every year for 10 years which is kind of insane right it's insane I mean people in private Equity get paid well because it's hard to do and not many people can do it and it's a rare skill set and uh yeah I mean it it it seemed High to me when I first looked at it but I was like okay well that's the market for it so whatever and I said I don't need the fees because I'm already paying for the team and the overhead and everything and so I don't need any cash flow from the fees just I want to be entrepreneurial if we make money like we want to share in that making it together and so um that's our model and we don't use debt and we hold it for a very long time so we have a 30-year initial term on our Capital uh typically a private Equity Firm will have 10 years and most private Equity firms you know use a lot of Leverage put a lot of debt on the businesses at closing we typically use no debt and uh so we're kind of in some ways the the opposite of traditional private equity and yeah so I went back to him and I said hey this is the structure that I think would work that we would take capital and he and Jim his father said okay so I think I missed it what what did you do as the carry then so you said okay no no on the 2% fees but what what did you do for the profit share yeah so we get uh 40% of the uh of the free cash flow of businesses as we return it back to the investor so you don't you don't have to return all the money up front first you just start participating from day one with 40% correct correct but it's only on what we return back only on what you return back okay great and then and you said you lose no debt correct yep so these are completely UNL buying all cash all cash deals using Equity from day one why don't you use like a little bit of debt what's wrong with like a little bit of debt yeah just just just a little bite have been bud just just a little icing on top of the cinn just this one time you don't even do seller notes like nothing uh we will occasionally do some seller notes although we found that uh having um the people that you work with be your creditors is not an ideal situation often um so we've really shied away from that as well um yeah no we typically just close all equity and uh try to keep things just super simple I mean we think that that that transitioning small businesses is difficult and it's pretty stressful on everyone we can always lever them up after you know after we close although we haven't really done that and is that strictly like a lifestyle Choice you're just saying that just helps you sleep better at night yeah is it a financial decision or a peace of mind decision to not use debt I think it's both uh what I would argue is that the optionality that we have in doing uh some pretty interesting things with these businesses to grow them is much better when you don't have debt when you're not paying all the cash to to a bank I'll give you an example so we bought an aerospace business in 2019 uh called pack air and I don't know if you guys know this but the Aerospace business never goes down um it always just goes up um in the history of the industry never really has a problem and uh I remember when we were closing that deal one of the advisers to the sellers said are you guys idiots like this business does never go down why wouldn't you guys lever this thing up with debt and we said hey here's our philosophy and all this stuff well it's not like we actually knew what was coming down the pipe but 2020 hits and we were literally the only business out there without debt on it like literally and so we were able to take all the cash flow that we were generating because we were still generating cash flow even though the business was down a lot and we were able to go out and basically make 10 years of progress in two years and that business now is sevenish times the size uh as when we bought it and everyone else that that had debt is you know maybe grown a tiny bit out of from 2019 but not much and so it's really been a transformative experience and we've had that happen over and over again in these businesses like we never know what the future's going to hold but we know that there's going to be options to invest in really interesting things if the cash flow is all going to the bank you don't have that option right right I'm going still use a little bit of debt but that I think that's good can question never heard anybody we've had a bunch of people come on this podcast and I'm always like wowed by their insights their personality I feel this way about you and and so many people that have come on this podcast where I I walk away being like that guy's the man like that person's a master of what they do they're kind of a master of the universe this is great and it's so easy and it's yeah it's so easy uh but and forget the easy part for a second I'm just like wow that really works and it makes sense what they said they're they're kickass and then if you look at people over like a 20-y year period or you know like a longer period 10 10 to 20 years there's this base question which is like if you just put money in the S&P you get some rate of return right so like Sam loves to put M money into the index and he's like cool I like that because I do no work and I'm going to get Sam what do you want to get eight n% something like that I would be very happy with 8% per year okay so 8% a year and so to be smart and do a bunch of work you got to beat that and so we've had people come on this podcast that when they talk they sound absolutely brilliant and then later you look at their returns and it's like oh they kind of don't beat the index actually um and I don't even think that's really like a knock on them or I don't even view that as like they're not like a charlatan I just think it's really hard to beat the index actually so what do you try to do in terms of like your rate of return and what what's your score so if the if the S&P is doing 9% of your compounding what are you doing out of out of permanent Equity yeah well so I'm under all kinds of SEC regulations I can't actually talk a ton and I would love to talk about that but I can tell you what's been put in the letters or annual letters last what you not what are you not allowed to say uh I can't say anything that would be futur looking I can't say anything that would be inducing investment I can't say anything that uh that would be considered marketing because we're like top level registered SEC finra all the stuff and what if we bleeped it out what if you tell us then we bleep it out so it's not it's not on air that's tell me where to stop like yeah yeah yeah so so what I can yeah here's here's the way I would say so we we target the minimum underwriting that we have is we target a minimum of a 30% irr is is minimum we underwrite to and we've historically been pretty significantly above that okay um but um you know we we really think about ter things in terms of cash right so I think it was last year that we talked about uh you know our total Cash Out irr is in the low 20s and that's without any marks that's without anything so you you know you stack marks and the growing obviously cash flows on top of that and the numbers get pretty ridiculous marks being uh the valuation the valuations of the business yeah that's correct and so I mean if you if you underwrite I mean if you think about it kind of the bottom line if you're buying a business with no debt right so take the debt side off of it you're just buying the business for all cash and you know let's say on average we're paying between five and seven times for a business kind of in that range and let's say that the business is organically growing 7 10% per year and we're increasing that to uh s call it mid teens a year maybe low 20s um the math gets pretty amazing pretty fast and that's without using any debt and so I think that's where it's obvious from the outside looking in there's gold in the Hills right if you look at small businesses Acquisitions I mean this is not a secret anymore I think when I first started talking about it in 1516 right I remember going on Patrick's podcast when it was brand new I remember Patrick being like Oh hey I'm thinking about starting a podcast I was like yeah sure I'll help a friend out had no idea it was going to turn into what it is right uh but I remember going on there and people were like shocked you know at like what you could buy these businesses for and people say oh well that's not fair it's an inefficient Market is is inefficient but it's inefficient for different reasons why people think it's inefficient not because people are getting taken advantage of it's inefficient because it's absolutely freaking brutally difficult and it's so easy to lose a bunch of money like I had a guy reach out last week and say hey I I want to be honest I'm looking for a job my wife and I went all in he was working at a big private Equity Firm based out of La as an operating partner he and his wife went all in on a business and it failed and now they're bankrupt what attributes make you and others like you successful versus this other guy not successful yeah I mean I think the the in the beginning if if the first deal I had done gone South um and there's plenty of opportunities for it to go south and so I I would say a lot of our success is is attributable to luck in the beginning and I mean look if you listen to any investor if they tell you that the early stuff they did wasn't lucky they're lying to you um I mean I remember uh getting a CH chat with Buffett about this and I said hey tell me about sandboard maps and dimster Mill and he was like oh my gosh like he's like if either of those Investments go wrong there is no Warren Buffett no one knows about Berkshire hathway none of that stuff happens right and they were that close like that's how he met when he met Munger he asked Munger hey do you know anybody who could help help basically turn around dster Mill because it's it's flailing and if that goes under like my future's done wait can you can you I don't know the story can you tell the story in more detail so Warren Buffett almost failed at the beginning of his career what what was it can you tell the story oh yeah so he had 70% of his assets into these two Investments one was called sandborn maps and the other was called dster Mill um and this is early days of the buffet partnership so this is pre- Burkshire hathway what did those two companies do so sandborn Maps was a was a mapping company um they basically had uh the time think about as intellectual property for for maps right uh if you needed to go build something or if you needed to navigate something they had all the the best mapping technology um and so um that business was a publicly traded business and uh I think he was a minority shareholder in it but he was basically the controlling shareholder that one um I think turned around independent of him installing new leadership but dimster Mill was a completely different story he he bought into that took control of it um and the business was just flailing so dster Mill I can't remember exactly I think they were building constructing U Mills uh of some sort uh hence the name dster Mill and um it was basically the biggest headache and he was staring down the barrel like I did and I mean I can talk about the early days like we almost failed like five different times so sorry so he he had 70% of his assets in these two companies but those were public companies where he's just a passive investor or he was like owned the majority of those companies where he could make a change in them yeah so I I think that he had he may not have had a controlling stake in in in sanborne but I know he had enough shares where he could basically throw his weight around in that one um I think dster Mill I think he actually did buy a majority of it and have control of it and so those companies they're not doing well and he you said he goes to m and ask him something yeah so we just met this guy Charlie Munger uh who had been back into town in Omaha and he had kind of gotten a matchmaking by a mutual friend who said hey you guys are the two nerdiest dudes we know you should know each other it was like Bromance like love at first sight uh they get to know one another and I think it was actually Charlie who said hey well like Warren what's your biggest problem you're facing and he said well I've got these two you know problem children especially dimster you know dimster Mill and uh do you know anybody and uh Munger said actually I do know this guy his name's Harry bottle and he's an accountant out here in La we should go talk to him and so they took Harry bottle to lunch and pitched him on moving his family to the middle of nowhere Midwest and uh running dimster Mill Harry bottle reluctantly agreed turns it around makes dimster Mill a you know a fortunate surprise on the upside and um you know again he starts stacking geese as we talked about so um everyone in the beginning I mean look you don't you don't get to be successful by not taking risks like all investing is taking risk and so the question is just how much risk are you willing to take and when you're younger and you don't have much I mean the only way to get ahead is by taking more risk when you are doing all this research are you an expert in the pool business or are you just an expert in looking at financial statements are you an expert in understanding how leadership thinks and how to find Winners what are you great at I think I'm pretty good at seeing the big picture so taking all those pieces like I'm not the best financial analyst uh the joke is I can barely open up Excel like I'm not an Excel guy I've never had the skill set I've never learned I never worked at another firm like I never took a finance class in my life so like I don't have a lot of the what I would call like hard skills that you learn as being an associate or an analyst at a firm um you know I think that I'm I'm pretty decent at putting the puzzle pieces together and the negotiation you know I think you know and going back to Buffett he talks about I'm a better investor because of an operator I'm a better operator because I'm an investor that's true and I think operating and investing are two sides of it but I think there's a third leg that's not talked about a lot which is the deal making side um and I think that dealmaking side especially at as you get into more inefficient markets becomes really the dominant skill set so understanding how to put the puzzle pieces together and like in that pool business um I saw a business that had a clear track record of growth uh they were an end durable business I mean you know we we kind of joke that you know people stop dipping their bodies in water for pleasure will be fine it's been happening for a couple thousand years I think it'll keep going like we try to have these like very simple thesis for everything and so if you look at somebody already has a dominant market share in a market they've had it for a long time the business is growing the Market's growing um you know you look at the business model of it and you say okay look we're an asset light business um they're not investing in a ton of equipment it's a very simple business model it's F customers that want pools uh do it better than they could do it themselves and and and and take a rip on that on the upside you know you start then looking at okay who is the leadership and how how do you structure a deal and how do you make sure everyone's interests are aligned um how do you continue to find talent to build the business I mean those are all I I say this as to sound to make it sound simple it's not simple it's very difficult it's just not complicated you gave one answer to the question I think the real answer it just was based off of your how you were answering it you are a uh really good Storyteller you are very persuasive and you have um you're I could just tell you're a good leader because of how you dumb things down to be relatively simple and easy to understand right Sean I mean just him explaining that you're like okay that's you're actually you're yeah like uh you don't get stuck on the midwit mountain right like the the middle the middle part where it's an over over analysis over overthinking over thesis out you know you're like do I think the people are going to stop dipping their bodies in water for pleasure no exactly all right cool uh you know that's great do I think we're going to get like do I think Tech you know is AI going to take us out of the pool business nope okay cool so this is enduring business great we got that seems like this guy's been paying himself a lot of money every single year as the operator great we'll probably be able to do the same also seems like this guy doesn't do any marketing he says that and he doesn't have any ads anywhere if we did a little bit probably would help right all right cool thesis done check check check right so like not um not over complicating things is a skill um I would also say like it seems like you have a good amount of level two luck which is the action luck like you were talking about that Patrick honesty example I thought that was a great luck example cuz you were like you didn't have any investors you're just doing this with your own money this guy tweets out hey I'm looking for somebody whatever to to talk to me about equities and or Capital allocation so you reach out right and you reach out you don't have some like impostor syndrome or insecurity that prevents you from reaching out you take some action and you've probably taken a thousand actions like that you know cheap lottery tickets where the downside is very low the upside if you made a valuable connection like you did was pretty high actually so you filled out a thousand of those scratch off tickets and then he had luck on the other side which was perception luck because he's like oh you're buying this company for four times profit that means like if you put in $100 you're going to get 25% yield every year even without growing the business and wait I'm in the stock market buying things at 25 times earnings and you're buying them at four so like something is good that makes a lot of sense so he had that that third level of luck which is like you uh you can spot it you could spot good luck when it shows up at your door and that's why you know that was good on his part so I think that's impressive to me and and a good reminder of like you got to take action to get that action luck and then when you know something and you spot something what he did a great job was he flew out to Missouri he got to know you he pitched you you said no and he's like he asked the magic question what would it take whereas like you know 10 other people could have done most of that and not gotten the result that he got you want to spend more time talking about why you're successful uh let let me ask you a different question so I have I have this goal I want to retire my sister so my sister has worked hard she's got her own business blah blah blah and she wants to just have an easier life so she wants to spend time with her kids she wants to travel like her business is brck and mortar so she's stuck in the certain location where those businesses are she can't really take her eye off the ball in that way um so I want to buy her a business and I'm like buying businesses sounds great you buy a business that's already working it's cash flowing you hire a CEO or you promote somebody internally in the company to be the CEO but I know there's obviously a lot of ways that can go wrong and so if you're me and you want to retire my sister where do you start like what what what is your thought process around buying that first business that's going to get you to $300 to $500,000 a year of free cash flow what what would you where would you Orient somebody who's trying to do that yeah I mean I think it's all about constraints um actually I wrote a piece called how to buy your first smaller company like literally because this is a question I get a lot from people um and I can remember had no idea when I when I first got going and uh I mean the thing is I everyone's got different constraints where do you want to live uh how much do you want to travel uh what do you actually know about uh what are you what are you good at right so somebody with a very different personality type than me should be buying things that are very different than what I bought somebody who uh wants to live in LA uh should be buying things that are very different than you know living in Missouri people who don't want to travel a lot or who want to drive to the to the place like that's a very different constraint uh Capital constraints how much cash do you have available to be able to invest I mean look like you know if you have uh you can buy really really high quality business assets there's smaller for like seven eight 10 times so if you want something that's going to be more hands-off that's an incredibly durable business model you can get something that's either software software adjacent you can get something that has recurring Revenue like the more you pay up into the value chain I mean you're going to have decreased I think total returns um but ultimately like they're easier businesses to run so like there are like level 10 difficulty businesses like I would not recommend buying into your local restaurant like that would not be something that I would recommend doing especially if you want to quote unquote have an easier your life like it depends on if you want the role of a hybrid investor operator which really is you're going through a short season of investment and then really what you're doing is you're buying a job like that's one very specific type of way to leverage your time against your money um if you really just want to be in the investor seat it's very difficult to only occupy the investor seat in the in the world of small businesses it can be done it's very very difficult the first3 to $500,000 of cash flow coming from small businesses are very likely going to require a lot of Sweat Equity in in exchange for that money he uh you should go to that blog post he has a good Q&A he goes uh the question is how hard will have to work harder than you've ever worked before the opportunity in small business in the small business Market is dressed in overalls and likes hard work dude you're poetic when you're right I love story my main skill yeah yeah that's great uh you have some onliners that are pretty cool can we just get you can I read you a oneliner that you've said and you just kind of rant on it so just basically kind of like make your case for this thing why why you think this is true or why you believe it why you think people should pay attention to this idea this is the lightning round right it's a lightning round yeah here we go all businesses are Loosely functioning disasters some just happen to make money yeah uh anybody who's ever operated a business knows this is true the only people who have issues with this are Consultants so if anytime I've said this publicly the only people who come at me are people who either got lucky the first time or have never done it and uh I mean look every business I've ever been involved in it doesn't matter how profitable the business how big the business um I've gotten a pretty good view into some very large businesses they're all highly dysfunctional why are they dysfunctional because they're full of people people are messy when you get a bunch of people together that messing as compounds like it is not a complicated concept uh and so I just think that people should lower their expectations and and understand what to expect when they get into a business it's going to be hard it's going to be hard in different ways like you know the first time you have to put somebody through rehab your your guy doesn't show up at to man The Warehouse because there's been a domestic violence dispute and he's in jail I mean literally like these are things that we're having to deal with um these are things that everyone's having to deal with now they may come in different flavors depending on how professional the business is but the reality is these are the things that happen Sean have you watched a land man I have it's really good um it's a for those listening it's a show with Billy B th Thorton and it's about like the oil industry and they there's this great quote it says our business is one of constant crisis interrupted by brief periods of intense success yeah how good is that yes yes uh yeah so I have a I have a quote on my wall and it says success is founded on a constant state of discontent interrupted by brief periods of satisfaction upon the completion of a job particularly well done um all right how about this one the more a leader has the more their business can grow what's an example yeah so look what is humility humility is acknowledging reality for what it is um and if you don't acknowledge reality you you can't get better and so lack of humility is basically a defense mechanism right this usually is is one of two forms it's either self- protection or self-promotion and people are usually doing a combination of both when they're in uh some form of Pride or arrogance uh they're usually terrified fearful I mean I can say this from experience when I get prideful uh is because I feel like I'm not enough and I'm not going to be enough and I'm worried that I might not have enough and so uh what is humility is is laying that down and saying hey I I want to see reality for what it is so I can learn and grow and become better and that's the only way to do that is to get feedback from the world around you I like that lack of humility self- protection or self-promotion that was strong um Charlie merer says this thing he says every time you see the word evida you should substitute it with [ __ ] earnings do you agree or disagree yeah for sure I agree I mean like look Eid do can be a useful tool in some very limited circumstances but for the most part it is dressing up something that uh is more than than often obvious skating reality so when you see eida especially in the small business World there usually comes a ton of capex a lot of reinvestment needs that are on the back end of that and what you have to really do is you have to figure out okay just in a steady state what is the business actually producing in free cash flow like we look at businesses all the time that are making quote unquote making 789 million a year that you ask the owner how much money they've taken out of the business and they're taking out maybe a million bucks a year maybe two million bucks a year I got news for you for the most part you don't have a business that's quote unquote making $7 million a year you have business making one1 to2 million a year that's the reality have you guys Sean have you ever learned the history of the idea of IA do you know that's like a newish thing no so basically John Malone I believe is that right Brent he yeah joh Mal invented it so John Malone his nickname is like the greatest nickname he's one of the cable Cowboys so John Malone U you would know him now as like the guy who owns uh or founded Liberty Media which owns F1 and all this other amazing stuff but basically he uh he owned a cable company it was like a small cable company I think when he took it over it was like 5 or 10 million in Revenue something like that like relatively small and he needed to uh get loans because he found that if he could just acquire way more cable companies cable companies were incredibly sticky and it was recurring Revenue I should go out and buy a ton in order to go and get more cable companies I need to borrow lots of money and for some reason he came up with this idea that iida was an amazing metric to convince Banks to loan him money and so he coined the term iida because uh for his business he had lots of depreciation lots of things like this so he was like no no no just give me like the earnings before all of this and I'm going to convince Banks to loan me against that and that I think it was the ' 80s the mid 80s became like the term and I've hated I I think iida is really stupid but what I think that like is in kind of insane is that we've all collectively agreed that this is like the metric and I always thought it was like weird but I never had the courage to say like this is stupid and then I would like read about Buffett and all these guys and I was like God think it's stupid dude I I take the opposite I'm like this is genius I need this in my personal life I need this I need the husband version of epida it's like you know my my behavior before you know before football before taking out the trash like you if you ignore if you ignore all those things I'm great I'm amazing actually well it's crazy that like you don't pay your personal taxes on eida you pay your personal taxes on a cash flow b or uh uh you know on a cash base it's just there's so many reasons why this is insane uh but and also you know what's the most insane thing adjusted eido what the hell does that mean means wherever you want it to be it's that's insane you have another one uh another quote you said you either operate with high Authority top down or delegated authority hell is in the middle yeah so this is uh hard-earned uh because I would say is I think everyone's temptation is to uh be high Authority when you think there's something wrong and then low Authority when you want to be lazy and uh that that combination uh just makes a mess of everything and so there's really two ways to uh be involved with the company you either say hey this is uh what we're doing this is how we're doing it you need to get in line I need people to go and execute this Vision uh or you say hey I want to be supportive and helpful it needs to be your vision um and I'm not going to intervene even when I think that something's wrong um I'm just going to go along for the ride and be helpful um and very very very lightly interviewing and so you just have to choose and I think there's both can work I think both come with certain upsides and downsides um but you can't do in the middle because if you do in the middle what you end up doing is you end up saying to the leadership team hey you're responsible but I'm basically telling you what you have to do and so it removes all agency from them and ultimately everything that goes right is going to be their fault and everything goes wrong is going to be your fault but to make the lazy the when I when you say the lazy approach I'm like yeah that sounds great sign me up yeah but that's hard how do you make that work you have to find uh the right person and what attributes does that person have and you know Buffett and Munger always said that like incentivizing manager was the number one goal of uh of was their number one job is that true for you yeah absolutely 100% if you're going to uh try to truly be an investor and not an operator in the business uh it all comes down to somebody has to do the work and somebody has to exert judgment and if you're not going to be the person to do the work and exert judgment somebody else does and you got to be interested got to be aligned with that person and so yeah when I say the the quote unquote lazy approach I I mean ultimately this is the only way you scale right I mean if you look if you look at again we keep coming back to Burkshire it's a good thing to think about because when people say hey let's talk about how you know Berkshire like buys businesses and leaves them alone that was not how they operated for a vast majority of the time that they've done like they had to do that eventually because they got to such a scale they literally couldn't intervene anymore if you go back and look at Buffalo News like Buffett and Munger were literally living in Buffalo dude they writing headlines they're they're writing like have you ever read of that Sean they bought a newpaper and they would literally uh like they they were news guys like they liked the news and they would like here's I want this many ads on the page I think the headline should be like this like they they yeah I did not know this this is amazing yeah I mean I would just say like Buffalo News is a good example of of like basically their their mode of operation in tell the call it early 80s mid 80s when they got to have so much money they literally couldn't be involved in the stuff that they were doing was to be highly interventionist I mean they would be involved in the smallest of details they would set the tone they would help on marketing strategy they would replace leadership they I mean they were doing all the stuff that I'm doing they would do all the stuff that anybody has to do because when you're small you can do it when you've got less capital and more time you can do stuff like that and by the way the returns are higher when you could leverage your time against your money it's an advantage right it's not a disadvantage it's an advantage but eventually you you have a limited amount of time and attention and as the money grows and your attention stays the same that ratio gets thrown all off and and you have no choice but to say okay I'm going to spread a much more thinly layered amount of judgment over a much wider thing of grouping of things which means you have to step out of the day-to-day operations and then you have to hire people who can exert great judgment and so Buffalo News I mean there's a a great quote from Munger saying hey like I'm down to my last like million bucks that I can put into to Buffalo News like after that I'm calling Uncle like I'm out um I mean it was there's been various times in berkshire's history they've gotten it's gotten very hairy uh it was not a guaranteed success and even when they had a lot of success it still gets hairy in various points and I think every business has that though that's what what should be expected like it should be an adventure there's a great letter um that you can read it's from it's in 1972 and it's the Buffett letter to the se's candy CEO if you Google that uh Buffett letter to C candy CEO and he says and because I went into this I I haven't like studied Buffett in depth the way that you would if you're going to do private Equity um and he I just thought the oh he's this ASU he sits at the table he drinks his diet coke he he just allocates the capital and he hires great people and they just do magic and this letter I was like oh Buffett had some mind of an operator right because he goes dear Chuck I was out of bry's a couple days ago and I have a few strong Impressions to pass along number one and he basically he starts talking like details about the store so he goes people are people are going to be affected not only by how our candy tastes obviously but what they hear about it from others as well the retailing environment in which it appears the class of the store the packaging the condition like this is like Steve Jobs talking about the Apple store right like a product oriented person um and he just goes through like step by step kind of like things that he thinks could be improved on um you know in in the store experience and I thought wow this is different than what I had kind of the impression you get when you hear about Buffett just sitting in his room reading all day you know making investment decisions off of you know Financial you Financial sheets this is a great letter by the way how awesome is this that this was a like a typewriter letter does that make doesn't doesn't that make it so much more uh substantial totally he licked he licked an envelope for this one dude how many how many you envelope I kind of want to like start sending letters like this it just makes it feel like more authorative let me ask you something Brent I have like I said we we kind of um my business is a little bit different than yours which is I create content on the front end it's the mullet so I have content on the front end which is what I love to do what I'm great at but media and content is not a great business model so my back end is I basically start or buy businesses that I know I can like turbocharge and we've done this maybe four five six times now and it's going really well but one thing I've noticed is I if I drew a pie chart of what makes it work it's basically like 60% of the battle was just the initial Market selection when we picked a project that was like the winds were blowing against us it didn't matter how much effort we put in or how great the operator was it was always just an uphill battle and sometimes we pick these markets that are just like it's a pull Market you're being pulled in it's just a sweet spot the people just need this it's you know it's shooting and a barrel type of thing that creates a big part of it the second part of it uh the next you know I'll say like 30% is the quality of the CEO that we picked who's going to run the business and when we pick a sort of limited CEO we get limited success when we pick an Unstoppable CEO we get like massive success and the last 10% was just luck like the ball bouncing our way on one or two things that could have easily not happened but that they happened or you know when the WIS that didn't maybe we missed out on something that we didn't see I got a question about that second piece which is hiring the CEO or or evaluating the CEO evaluating the operator I want to get better at that if you sit down with somebody you're recruiting an exec maybe it's a you're you're interviewing somebody who's maybe in the business that's going to become a CEO or you're taking somebody external to come run this company what are you doing to what are you doing that's like not obvious to get that assessment is there any little tips and tricks anything that you've picked up that that helps you find the right operators yeah well so actually I think this is a probably a pretty underappreciated uh aspect of being involved in small companies is is all about the people right and so the better you can be at the people the better it's going to be for the business and you know we've really deep dived into uh I would say all personality testing is wrong right uh it it just depends on uh what you're trying to get out of it and so we have actually a huge battery of personality testing that we do for people to try to get as close to a 360 view of who they are what do you use yeah so we're doing uh a combination of disc uh Myers Briggs and uh something called habit story which kind of it has them see like what are the habits that they've built in their life and how are they kind of supporting who they are with the structure and apparatus around them and um I personally also uh do a lot of uh study of inag and so I think actually if personally for me when I meet somebody I'm instantly categorizing them as what I think their inag number is and I'm automatically categorizing in them across the four uh main uh Myers Briggs uh D this is crazy to me I thought that just's just horoscopes for for dudes like do you really use this as like a core your core thing that's amazing yeah well so all of it tells you something about the person right so if you think about so so inag most people don't understand this so inag basically tells you who you are at your worst and um there's there's nine uh numbers and basically everyone falls into a number and then you have what's called Wings which is kind of where do you tip from that number so for me um I'm a three and I tip two so a three is they call the achiever uh my biggest insecurities is that I'm not enough and I want people to like me and so again if you if anybody's proud of their inogram it means they don't understand inag like like it's not a good thing right this this basically tells you what are your deepest fears and what what is the your areas of greatest weakness but if you can know that about somebody you can see them how is that playing out in their life right so like I when I'm my least healthy I'm a people pleaser I say yes to way too much stuff um I don't tell people the truth um it's really unhealthy it's it's it's highly destructive Behavior right I'm I'm very focused on hierarchy and and and my guess is that you guys have different inrs right I won't I won't guess your inrs but do it that's great yeah keep going do it I can't wait yeah my guess is shaa you're a three and my guess is Sam's an eight uh but what's three and what's eight uh the three is the achieve well so threes and eights uh both achieve but for very different reasons so so uh threes achieve because they want people to love them it's like less about the thing itself and then eights really want the thing itself so like as a three like I don't want money to just like want the want the money like I want the money because I want people to love me uh eights really want the money because they want the the security and they want the power that comes with the money uh so so I want to learn the TR I want to roll over so that I get pet and my tail can wag Sam just wants treat yep that's exactly right sounds right what do you think yeah well like he's he's describing everything at like the most positive way so like yeah it sounds great uh I'm I like that and then I looked up who other eights were and it's like Winston Church Hill Martin Luther King I'm like yeah okay cool um yeah yeah for sure what you but you what this is like crazy fascinating you said like five different things so can you give us the exact so you said Myers Brig uh and then you said this this other test what's like the exact stuff that you're using yeah so so I well there's two things one is when I first meet somebody I can I can walk you through what I do and then I would say is separately from that in a hiring process we we use that once we get serious about a candidate then we put them through a huge battery of testing to make sure we try to understand them right okay for me personally when I first meet somebody it helps me so much to be able to categorize them into what I expect based on just kind of how they're showing up in the world uh in Myers Briggs right so you have you have i and e so are they introverted or they extroverted right are they s or they uh n which is are they are they in the present are they sensing or are they in the future right um uh then are they a thinker or are they a feeler right so they are they primarily excited about ideas are they primarily excited about uh sort of the the the people themselves right um and then the last one is tnp which is um um are they uh it's or excuse me j& P which is are they uh very focused on Rigid schedules and on creating order or do they like to go and test and try a whole bunch of things right and how all these like sort of Stack Up and combine really gives you a much more holistic view of who somebody is then when you then pair with inag I think gives you probably those two together I think creates the most the quickest and the most holistic view of who somebody is where if you can get like a a pretty good idea quickly of who they are like how I would talk to somebody who's present oriented is very different than how I talk to somebody who's future oriented and often times s you know we assume the whole world operates like the way we do like my wife and I are literally the Opposites in every single one of these areas so you can imagine in our marriage like how she shows up and how I show up is so different it creates all kinds of miscommunications we've been married now for 16 years and it really we went through personality testing together about oh three and a half four years ago it was gamechanging in our marriage it was it it it completely explained a ton of behavior for her and for me that had been bothering us for a long time and uh it was just largely how we're wired so that's how we do it that's how I think about doing it in the moment that helps me relate to people a lot more it's crazy by the way Sean 16personalities.com is like these websites are huge that are doing these tests yeah yeah yeah they're they're really big I mean this is it's an important piece I would say five voices is a really interesting one they they um so it's just the the number five voices.com I think yeah those guys uh have created Steve cochrum and Jeremy KUB check uh are the two uh founders of that business they've created an overlay for Myers Briggs that simplifies it um I think a lot of their stuff is incredible um and um yeah uh we we we definitely use a lot of their work as well and then we finish off with a quick tarot reading just to see how the future is going to go and then we're we're all set this is amazing this is so good you you also have one thing I I read that I really loved you go uh you have this like [ __ ] test it's like we we don't nobody wants to work with [ __ ] how do we sort of fil for that nobody's trying to present as an [ __ ] in a job interview and you said like uh you can eat with them see how they treat the staff you could uh see them interact with their significant other that'll tell you a lot in their home environment and then he said uh the most telling environment is to travel with somebody it is impossible to fake it when you're at the airport you're grinding through security and if there's a delay your their true colors will come out I thought that was great yeah yeah it's fun I mean just want to I mean honestly the business we're in is predicting people's behavior like that's what we're trying to do and because if all these businesses are predicated on the people who run them they're they're all going to have the risks the primary risks of all these businesses are going to be the people and so we're trying to do is get to know people have you guys ever been out with someone and they've actually been an [ __ ] to the weight staff though whenever people say about this this [ __ ] test I'm like I I've never been around anyone that's like Rude Dude you don't remember the dinner we were at where this

I've got Steve Jobs stories I've got Jack dorsy stories I've got Ross elri stories you name it I got [Music] them all right Sam has been telling me about a book for probably 10 years in a row and I finally got around to reading it this year and the book is American kingpen it's a story of the Silk Road of Ross alch who created it grew it to great you know prominence ended up going to jail what we thought was for life and then he just got pardoned by Trump and so Sam just reread the book I read it this year we both love this thing it's a it's a page Turner and the author Nick Bilton not only wrote that but he wrote hatching Twitter and a bunch of other stuff fascinating guy and uh he's here with us today on MFM so let's do it Nick what's going on we wanted to talk about all types of stuff we want to talk about storytelling we want to talk about things that you researched that didn't make the book we want to talk about like the OG stories of Silicon Valley because you've been covering this stuff forever but you're like one of the three people who we've had on the Pod that I'm like nervous to talk to and I stayed up all night like reading everything about you don't be nervous this is exciting this is fun it's going to be great we're going to tell some some crazy stories I've got Steve Jobs stories I've got Jack dorsy stories I've got Ross alri stories you name it I got them who of all those people did you have you become friends or uh admire any of them or do you are you like a strictly like a journalist who doesn't cross the the barrier well that's a great question um I feel like we should save I should save that answer cuz I've got such great stories about all these people about Bezos everyone where you know there are some that I have become friends with and then unfriends with and some I'm still kind of friends with but um we let's save that for when we get into the hatching Twitter Elon Musk Jack dorsy territory of this of this pod I was listening to an episode with David Perell uh it was all on writing and you talk about um uh like what makes a great story and this sounds like a like a backhanded compliment I think that your writing is amazing your storytelling is amazing I think you just happened to pick the best story of all time with the Silk Road like it was like set up to to win well I think I mean let me just tell you how I came to the story so I was a reporter at the New York Times and um in Silicon Valley covering Tech I was writing about Apple and Facebook and Twitter and and I I I don't even know how to describe this moment in time you know it was like 2008 2009 it was you know right after the bubble had popped um the second bubble uh and it was again once again this no fly zone you know to be in to be in Silicon Valley to do startups and whatnot and I started covering these these companies that were not there was the idea of one of them being a trillion dollar company was just it was ridiculous that would never happen and I would spend time with Steve Jobs and Bezos and Zuck and and dorsy and all these guys and I wrote the Twitter book which which we can talk about and this incredible backstories to that that um and uh of people uh trying to kill the project and so on and so forth but I'd finished the Twitter book and the Twitter book had done really really well and I was looking for a new book and um and I couldn't you know I really I love writing books it's it's one of my favorite forms of writing to do and I I heard about this guy who had started the Silk Road who had been arrested at this little Public Library uh there was like four blocks from my house and I I knew the the library I knew this and I knew the area and I also knew the Silk Road and so I wrote a piece for for the New York Times about it it's like a short piece and and then I was like maybe there's a book in this and as I started to dig further and further it just felt undeniable it was like it was just an unbelievable story of this kid who um I say kid because he was very young at the time but he he got he grew up in Austin he was incredibly smart 1600s on his SATs you know studied astrophysics um went off to one of the best schools uh and and then had this like libertarian idealism to him that is no different to like Travis kenck when he's building building Uber and you know all these other people in Silicon Valley and he decides that drugs should be legal uh and the government should not be able to tell you what you can and cannot put in your body and the only reason that the the drugs lead to these you know to Deaths and murder and so on and so forth is because the government has so much control over it and so he takes the Onion Browser which is is the secret browser that you can uh where the dark web exists and then he takes Bitcoin which both both kind of come along around the same time and he creates this proof of concept which is this website called The Silk Road and then next thing you know he's making millions and millions and millions of dollars a day is the biggest drug dealer on the Internet by the way how good was The Branding for that the fact that he called himself The Dread pirate Roberts the Silk Road the like the logo behind it The Branding was actually like the whole it was pretty brilliant no The Branding was great there was I forget the name there was a name that he had originally wanted to call it was like some terrible name it was called like hardcore underground or something like something where it was like it doesn't sound like a p like I I'm interested in that but what's what's fascinating is you know at the time he's living in Austin he's got this girlfriend Julia and they're kind of in this like toxic relationship and he has this business and it's like a it's a pretty like nice business where he goes around he collects books that people want to get rid of and then sells them and and and mails them out so when he when he moves into to the drug trade and he goes he goes to Bast up State Park and he rents a cabin and he grows mushrooms so that he could sell drugs on there to show that you can sell drugs on there and then he starts mailing them out like he's mailing the books out and then the drugs out and like and it all kind of you know it all comes together in this very very unique way what ends up happening is Gawker uh the website that is uh obviously now defun uh they write about it and then that's it it's like game over like everyone on the planet knows about it and senators are coming after him and every government official from the IRS to the FBI to the Secret Service to the DEA they're all trying to hunt down the dread pirate Roberts and Ross essentially goes on the run around the world as they're as they're trying to catch him yeah it's one of the best things about the book is that it starts with like I don't know how much of this is your conjecture versus you had his diary I guess and you knew some of his thoughts but it's like he knows he's smart he wants to do something special he's sort of bummed out that he hasn't done anything interesting or special with his life and you know has sort of tried but hasn't really made it yet doing anything and then you've got his girlfriend and there's that part of it they got the libertarian ideals and then it leads to all you know the thing escalates like crazy where I think I don't know if at its peak but it I think Sil Gro was doing like you know over a billion dollars like gmv through the the marketplace and there's like you know Murder for higher plots going on like it escalates like the craziest crime movie would would would escalate but I like that you had that beginning part where it wasn't just this criminal mastermind it was like this smart kid you know just trying to trying to do something and had had a certain set of ideals how did you know what he was thinking how did you get access to his diary why do why does a writer like how does a writer like you get that and you got a lot of stuff you got like the footage of the library where he got arrested you got like the chat logs from you know from the with the government how did you get access to all this information well I can't tell you exactly how I got a lot of it because that's the that's investigative reporting and uh and I you know obviously can't Dev to where it came from but the way I approach these stories is I want to know everything literally everything um and so I have these researchers uh who worked for me and one of them uh one of them actually used to do Oppo research for the for the the Democratic party trying to find you know bad stuff on Republicans and um we literally just blanket approach it what's been really interesting I've been do projects which I can't talk about but I can tell you a little bit about how I've reporting it what's been interesting is it's a new project that we're doing and we've been using llm Google llms notebook and so now we stuff millions of words into these things and I can just query it whereas before we had to build like Excel spreadsheets and databases and like it was very very complicated the way we did it but we kind of put it into three tranches so we we have the dread pyro Roberts and we get access to the chat logs that were on his laptop um which I don't actually know if he knew were there because they were in a hidden folder and I don't think he actually knew he'd been saving them or maybe he was I don't know uh and then there's some diary entries he'd literally been making diary about about the thing cuz he would he the best line ever is he thought there'd be a book written about his life one day um and then we and then we go through social media and we and we get all the photos and all the posts and all that and we everything's on a timeline it's all got timestamps and then the and then lastly it's the interviews with everyone and with as far as like you know I we reach out you get your books and you go and you find out everyone he went to elementary school with in middle school and high school and you interview everyone you find the neighbors you the kid that lived across the street uh um you know which coffee shop you went to you go to the coffee and then the thing I do which is a little psychotic but I do it anyway is I want to be able to describe what the I want you to feel like it's a novel in some respects but it's all real like nothing's made up and so like if I know he let's say he took a picture there's one instance where he went camping uh and um and so I didn't know where the campground was it was near San Francisco but he had taken two pictures uh uh three pictures sorry one was when he left and I we could figure out the street because we could you know see the Angles and the street signs the next was when he was driving over the Golden Gate bridge and then the third was when he got to the campground and we could te tell the time stamps so we just did the math and we're like okay it's probably 45 to 50 miles away and then we looked in the circle around San Francisco and then we found these different campgrounds and I went to one and there there we are at the campground so I go there and I find the place that he took the picture from where very sitting I sit in that spot and I can I can smell the S everything and so I can describe that because it hasn't changed in in six months or a year it's still looks the same and so I do that with like everything I I go to the coffee shops he goes to I walk the same street and so you get to describe this and then you also can look you know with um uh with different apps where you can see the way the Sun comes on certain days and you can describe what the Shadows look you just can describe everything Sam isn't this wild like it's wild in two ways one it's the same sort of obsession of why jobs is like I'm going to design we need to finish the inside of the casing of the computer and they're like Steve nobody's going to see this and he's like I've seen it um I know it's there that's why we have to make finish this the inside uh case so this is a weird kind of producct OB session which I respect um but then there's also like dude nobody would know nobody would ever know and it might not ever matter why does it matter to you to do that well and it's also weird that Nick you've written like hatching Twitter wasn't the most favorable towards like Jack dorsy and some of these guys you guys all have the same flavor of crazy though you know what I mean like that that's what Sean's describing is like what the look I totally agree look I mean it's it's fun for me I think it's like I I love the challenge but I it's what's interesting you bring up jobs like I SP I spent quite a lot of time talking to him when he was alive um and he was incredibly obsessive and of course and like and you know one of the things that he always said that that I mean he said it publicly too but like you should never know that the technology exists and how it happens and so on and so forth and and it's I'm fine coming on a podcast from talking about how I did it but when you're reading I'm not going to tell you like it there's nothing that drives you more insane where it's like according to a a transcript that I found it it's like who gives a [ __ ] like just tell me the story and like and and I think that um I you know one of the beauties of great products is when you don't know how it works and they and and I think one of the and it just works and it's magical and it's you know all those those words that they use and the and the ads and everything and I think the same same exory for storytelling you you know like a lot of the greatest novels I I vicious reader I read a ton of novels and um a lot of the greatest novels the amount of research that people like Gabriel Garcia mer C put into 100 Years of Solitude and like into chest it's like when you read these they they're not telling you all this they're just telling you a story and uh why would uh I saw that you T I think you said in another podcast you spent like three or four weeks with Julia Ross's ex-girlfriend when he was starting it and there and and and I didn't know that you had spent time with them when I was spent time with her because I was like why why on Earth would she ever talk to Nick like you know if I'm her I'd probably just kind of shut up but you knew stories like you knew like when they had sex or like like the comments that they made to each other I'm like how on Earth does he know this and then I find out that you I heard you spent time with her like getting info why on Earth would some of these sources talk to you why not why would they just say I don't need that in my life get out of here I think um uh one of the things I've learned as a reporter for two decades is that people talk people want to talk for different reasons so uh you get there's you know endless numbers of them and one of what one of I think the think people think being a reporter is like you got to break the news and you got to write the story it's like no it's a it's relationships it's like it is literally just relationships and and what you have to do is you have to figure out you need these people to talk to you and you have to figure out how to make them want to talk to you and so for example everyone has a reason so people that would would leak stuff to me that worked at Apple or Facebook some of them were so just so excited to say oh my God I worked on this thing and it was like and they and they just want it out there and they don't have the patience and you know and others of them worked on something that never got made or they got [ __ ] over by their boss or they didn't get the credit and like or like they have other ego IAL reasons whatever it is and so your job as a as a reporter is to try to get them to talk to you and to try to figure out and my job is to be like why what can I say to you what is it that you want I know you want we all want something and so with Julia um you know I think I think she wanted she wanted to be part of the story um and I think she wanted to be famous a little bit and I also think that she for her there were there was some things that hadn't been said and hadn't been finished and and that she hadn't it was like a little bit cathartic I think in some respects um and so that's the reason she talked when it came to the agents you know I spent time with all of the agents involved in the case um or almost all of the agents and um and you know with jeden and I probably spent 400 hours 500 hours together you know we I went to his office I went to his house I went to his we we met in all different places I saw the Postal Service where he worked and that we went inside the Chicago airport and underneath the bowels of it I mean it was amazing to see all the stuff Sean do you remember that where so Jared was the guy who like he wanted to be an FBI agent or something like that but he ended up being a Homeland Security agent which is like like I think the book starts with him it's like a pill yeah single pill one one pill and what shocked me about Homeland Security and mail is that they would just sit there and watch packages come in and they would just be like that that envelope looks weird because uh like it's handwritten in a certain way uh and it's just similar like it's just so crazy that one of the one of a few different ways that he was caught was just like traditional uh police work as opposed to like something more complex it it was shocking that it was just like eyeballing things well it's what's what's what I why I started with the pink pill the single solitary pink pill is because and then there's a there's a a a line there's a paragraph in the book about how you know the website started with a single line of and all of a sudden he creates this world and so on is I I think what's interesting about techn and this was just me the way I wanted to tell the story but what's interesting about techn there's also the scene where and I say scenes because I think of them in my head as scenes they're not chapters like everything's visual in my head and there's this scene where we see a computer being built and um and it starts with like a single diode and I what I find so fascinating about technology is all these websites and all these products and all these companies they start with this little this this one thing and the same with the books and everything and they they grow into these they take over the world and and so for me the pink pill the single solitary pill of ecstasy was the beginning of the story which was just going to become a [ __ ] Title Wave that took over everything did you ever feel in danger uh during your research I felt more in danger during the Twitter book quite honestly um uh what was the danger there the power didn't want Jack dorsy did not want that book out uh and he was trying to do everything he could dud he's he's a peace loving hippie as far as I could tell he sits with a beard and a tiey shirt he just wants peace and love for all I thought he he uh no it's that that is all a it's all a story uh that he tells um look there are definitely stories I've worked on I wrote a book that didn't that we I chose not to publish which was about the NRA um This was um after marre stom and Douglas had happened because I went to school there and um I spent a couple years on the book and then then decided to not do it for for a few reasons but that one I wouldn't even say that was that I wasn't like afraid someone would come after me except maybe like some gun nuts later um you know I've done some stories Mafia stuff like Russian hackers things like that um and I've never you know I think a lot of the times people respect the process and they don't they they don't want to start a war with the New York Times or Vanity Fair or you know right I think it's different if you're like covering Mexican cartels in you know in Mexico that that's that's a whole different thing or if you're trying to be a reporter in Russia or something like that that that's where you really do have to start to worry but in Silicon Valley it's a bunch of nerds that you know talk a big game and and and that's it I did have I do have one story uh but it's from the Twitter book so when I I won't mention names here but when I I wrote the Twitter book and there's a moment in the book where someone gets fired and I got a call from a friend who's a journalist at Bloomberg and they said hey someone there's there's a bunch of people these like Crisis PR people that are trying to H they're calling all the journalists they just called me and they're trying to say that your book is all fabricated and it's not true and this especially this moment it's all made up and um and I just wanted to let you know and I so I just called this woman directly and I was like hey uh heard you're calling everyone and saying she and she's like I didn't say that and I was like I said look I have the tapes of the interviews and of that moment and I was like I will happily post it on Twitter I said you just keep calling people and I'll put it on Twitter and that was the end of it so you know uh so there are these moments where you get these crisis comms people that come after you but well you know when you do as much research research as you do um you end up getting to know the subject and some ways better than themselves it's like these bu in business the you know CEOs will pay for these expensive 360 revie views where you go where somebody goes and talks to their wife and their their their co-workers and their interns and they get they come back with this feedback and it's supposed to be this eye opening thing about them uh this person can can find out more about them and show them a mirror that they haven't really seen before in that case they want it but um you know when you're researching Jack dorsy and you say something like you know that's all a story who's the real Jack dorsy well I think just one just one thing about what you just said is I know somebody asked me how do you know when your book is done when you're like when you're ready to to CU what happens is you research for for a long time you don't write a word until you're ready until you've done all the research and you have everything and I have in my office I have these boards and I like create these cards like that that you can you know we they're just all the scenes of different colors and everything and put them up on a wall and um and uh and I know that when I'm ready to write when I'm start telling the people I'm writing about things they don't know about themselves and that's the moment I'm like okay I got it and so that happened with the Twitter book I remember sitting with all the founders and there was a moment where I told Evan Williams something that had happened be behind his back that I thought he knew about and he he had no idea and I was like oh okay well there you go I'm ready and you know as far as Jack specifically goes the best quote I ever got about Jack dorsy and I've written a lot about him was um from one of the board members years ago uh who said the best product Jack dorsy ever made was Jack dorsy because it's because that's what it is it's a Everything is Everything is a story right every single solitary thing we do every single day is US telling a story The the outfit you chose to wear today is a story about yourself me telling a story about the book is me it's we're all it's all we're doing all day long and we're telling these stories and we choose which story we want to tell certain people based on how they want us to perceive us and I think that people like Jack and jobs and Bezos all of these guys and Zuck they that's one of their one of the things they're great at is telling a good story and and I think like I personally believe that your story for a company is more important than anything I don't care if you have the greatest product in the world if you can't tell a story about it what's the point what what's the ex example that drives that home YouTube is a perfect example YouTube was not the first video platform there were dozens and I remember seeing this like when I was a just a a beat reporter covering Silicon Valley and and I would my days were like it was like office hours and you'd have like startup after startup in like 2009 11 12 come in and meet with you and they would have you know some of them have great ideas and and but they couldn't walk you through it and they didn't hire a PR person and they didn't like and and so so you know and YouTube YouTube had a great story and and that they were able to tell and that became and it became the video platform there were other video platforms there were I would argue way better than than YouTube and I mean Vimeo is a perfect example Vimeo was was a a thousand times of a better product and um a prettier easier to all these things and and YouTube just told a great story and Google helped them do that and it becomes that's what it becomes and if you if Jack dorsy had told the real story about Twitter that his best friend Noah glass really was the one that came up with most of it and he stole it you know from him and and like and that the place was a [ __ ] show and no one knew what was going on it was all an accident like you'd be like oh okay but I but to tell the story that I am the next Steve Jobs and and I I conceived of this idea of Twitter while I was in my mother's womb and and like holy [ __ ] I got to check this thing out what is this yeah like the Jack dorsy Twitter story I know is he grew up and he was just fascinated with dispatch or something like that he talks about like I loved uh either taxi dispatch or some some Transportation dispatch service he used to listen to and that short form dispatch communication was always something he was into and then when had the you know the idea for Twitter and he has the sketch of the original Twitter thing that he posts you know he's posted before that's the story that I know right because I'm on I'm just the receiving end of that product he's cre worked right that story the story worked uh does is it true no it's not true yes he was interested in dispatch in the same way he was interested in writing poetry and painting his nails black and dying his hair blue like but that's not part of the story because what really happens is and as I say in hatching Twitter and and no one knew this I was like I had to talk to all these different people to kind of pin it together except Noah glass knew it um was You Know Jack was living in San Francisco he was in a the early 30s he was like a part-time Manny uh in Oakland he like he his life had not turned out in any way like the predestined version of Jack dorsy we think of today he got a job working at a um you know the ticketing booth at Alcatraz um the so they these booths that are pretty small and he was the C programmer who would go and fix the ticketing booths and the reason he got the job was cuz he was small enough to fit inside the booth and programmed uh um this was the life he was living and he he had went he applied for a job at camper shoes to sell shoes not not like to build the website or be the CEO like and he couldn't get the job and he was at a coffee shop and Evan Williams walks in he' read an article about Evan and he just felt like it was a sign which it probably was the universe was putting them together she sent him a note and he said I'm a programmer you know and um they had Odio at the time which was the podcasting company which was a decade ahead of its time um which was a brilliant idea that that Noah glass had come up with and so Noah and and Evan Williams had created this thing called blogger um uh and blogger was again ahead of its time you know and Google purchases it and one day this guy bis Stone reaches out and he says I love blogger I'd love to come work for you and uh so Avan Williams and Biz become friends at Jason Goldman who's also another part of this he's working at Google they all kind of become buddies they end up leaving um and get Goldman stays but Evan Biz end up leaving and the reason that they leave is because Evan lives on I think it was like 18th in Market or whatever the streets were and he one day he was on his balcony and another guy Noah glass was on his balcony and Noah had been reading that same article that Jack dorsy had read and he recognized in the article that the photo of Evan was of EV Williams was taken on the balcony and in the background there's a little Noah glass because they were neighbors and so he goes out and he goes hey blogger and they become friends and then he pitches in Noah pitches in this idea for this podcast company he's like this is the VIS this is the future it's going to take over radio and so on and so EV is like looking for a project and so he agrees to do it it's all discombobulated no one knows what's going on like they can't run the startup Apple comes along with podcast they're they're screwed Jack dorsy comes along long and they do a hack day and um to try to like last Harrah to save the company and they um during the hack day Jack presents this idea for status okay and everyone's everyone's kind of doing the same thing the the ideas are very very similar and I'll tell you a couple of them but Jack presents this idea for status and what status is is stat. usnick dilton right and you go there and you see my status it's one status so if I say and it's three four words you're not really supposed to do anything more than that on a podcast now if you go an hour from now if I put it post a new status and I'm like taking a walk the Onna podcast is gone and it now just says taking a walk it's like an a away message it's literally an AM away message that they were doing and and so so Noah has a very similar idea but Noah's like no one is going to go stat. usnick built five time your mom will do it CU she wants to know what you're up to but no one else is doing that and so they all start bringing these ideas together and it's truly it's like 11 people in the room it it is a collaboration between all of them and what Noah has this realization is he's a very emotional guy very smart and he's like it needs to be about friendship it needs to be about connecting with your friends and that is what it's about and so he brought this Humanity to it and so he came up with the stream and the it's like all not the replies but the friend like that you had friends and you and that was what that was Twitter it wasn't status you know it there were a million other statuses are back then I mean um and so when it ends up becoming what it became Noah was a mess he was getting divorced he was like just his life just wasn't work and and he gets pushed out by Jack and and EV and and those and Jack who is best friends with Noah goes into ev's office one day and he says either you get rid of Noah or I quit and as far as EV knew Jack could come up with the idea himself you know when he was a little kid listening to firet trucks that was a story that was added later and um and so you know so but that's but the better story is not oh I screwed over my best friend for power and control of this thing it's when I was a kid I used to sit in my room at 12 years old and I had the vision for Twitter by listening to fire trucks okay that's a great story and so you know you seem like you don't like Jack dorsy is it a you don't like him or you just feel like that's a wrong that needs to be writed that story is you want to the record that is I don't like people who [ __ ] other people over especially their friends did you find yourself like you had this great podcast with our friend David Perell and you set a line that Hitchcock someone came up with where it was um every villain has a mother uh and it was like I guess like you you see yourselves in the villain at times that's what a good story is do you kind of like uh like a villain a little bit or they're a little uh uh you know you're you're interested in them did you find yourself liking Ross did you find yourself liking Jack at times like because you get so into their minds and you also see that like even though they do a lot of bad things they do a lot of Epic things a lot of big things do you find yourself admiring and liking them well they all have a Charisma to them you know that that um you can't pull this off without the Charisma um I've met Trump he's very charismatic very very very charismatic you like want to be around him even if you don't agree with him what was the context how'd you meet him oh just at this at a rally once um years and years and years ago I think 2015 or something like that you know spent time with Elon like he's kind of funny he's funny he's like a weird dude but he's funny you know jobs had this like Aura to him you know Bezos too like they um funly enough Zuck doesn't necessarily have the Charisma but it's almost like he's a robot and you're like oh how does this thing work uh uh but um but they all have this this there's something to them that is um that is enticing and and and Jack's funny he's a funny nice guy like when you're hanging out with him he like it's like you're you're like oh this he's fun I like hanging out with this guy and um and and so and I never met Ross I covered him in the court in the trial so I saw him many many times but never spoke to him um and um but they have this Charisma to them that I think makes them great in some respect and it's not something that you can learn it's just something that you either have or you don't have and um and so you cannot help but like them for that but I think for me I just I don't understand here's the part with Jack and then we should move on from it because uh I could talk all day about this but Jack is worth2 billion give or take um Noah glass is worth about a z okay he never got anything he EV gave him something and he had to live off that and and and whatnot if you're worth 122 billion give the guy 10 million you wouldn't even notice you it would literally be like losing a penny between your couch cushions and like that to me even if you believe that you are the Creator even if you believe that that you that you really came up with this on your own cuz he may believe that today I just don't understand like why the kid that you were best friend the guy you were best friends with who who without question helped you with this product like go take care of him and it never happened and for well no glass I agree with you but also no glass now has a thing too right didn't he have Olo or no that's a different no glass no [ __ ] they're not the same guy not the same guy so everyone think that I thought they were the I thought it was like his second coming no he's uh he just he has a family and he like he married this French woman and they have two kids and I think not only Twitter got stolen from him his own name got stolen name Google got stolen from him tooedit mess him up I did not know that I thought it I thought it was like oh he's getting it he's getting it back oh man that ruined the story for me can you can you tell us some other um stories of uh that have stood out to you things you still remember either experiences whatever you said like I got job stories I have Zuck stories I have Elon stories let's let's see like jobs is the best one I think I'll I'll do the job story um so when I was a reporter at the Times um I I didn't really know what I was doing like no one knows what you're doing when you start out in these jobs uh you pretend you do but you don't and uh um and I I don't even think I think the 10,000 hours is nonsense I think it's about 30,000 right to really understand what you're doing properly but I was at the times and I was what had happened was I come into the times um by complete accident uh uh let me just start with that story because it's actually a very funny story so I was a I was my dream job was I wanted to be a war photographer um and I'd read all these War photography books and uh and I bought like saved up and bought like a fancy camera and I would like do practice War photography with my friends where they would like run through the streets with you know and I would take pictures and and so I put together this portfolio and I was a graphic designer um and I'd done toy package design for a while um and they like designed the verse Britney Spears doll and stuff like that and so I was like oh I can use the designer job to get to the times as a designer and then I can become a war photographer and so I end up doing that I become I do page layouts and stuff like that and when you do these the way these meetings work is uh these newspapers you have a morning meeting where all the editors and reporters go in one big room and each section the business section the culture section the front page and you pitch they pitch their stories the editor decides which is going to go where on the front page and and and off you go and but I would always speak up because I didn't know you weren't supposed to and so I'd be like what about this and what about that and I like that and what have you did this and and I just became like friendly with a lot of the editors and one day I sit down with the photo editor and I show her my photos and she looks to her name was Michelle MCN and she like slowly goes through one by one and she closes the book and she goes she's like you're a good photographer she's like I think you'd be you'd be a good War photographer but I'm not going to hire you to do it and I was like why not and she goes because you're too normal she's like these guys are [ __ ] up they're on drugs they can't be in a they can only be in a war zone half the time like they've got like they've just got something that's missing that they need that adrenaline and she was like I don't feel that from you and I'm grateful that so grateful that she she said that and so I was like well what do I do now and there was at the Times um I I become friends with with Marissa mayor and I that was talking about going over to Google to go to Google news I mentioned this to the editor-in-chief of the business section and he said oh God I wish we could keep someone like you to be like a reporter because everyone wants to write for the print section no one wants to write write for the web and I just the words just came out of my mouth I never wanted to be a writer it had never been anything on my list of things I wanted to do and I said well I would do it and he was like oh well why don't we try it and then I was like oh [ __ ] what have I done and so the first day I'm on the job at the New York Times and I'm in this massive Newsroom with all these insane people that you know back then you were just like enamored by these these by lines that you were just like holy [ __ ] and uh my editor comes over and funly enough it was Twitter had gone down and he said Twitter's gone down can you write a blog post about it uh you know call the company and everything and I was like yeah yeah yeah no problem and so I looked at my computer and I googled how do you write a blog post uh so that was first and then I realized like oh my god what have I done I I found myself in this job that I just don't know what to do and so I just I spent weeks just reading every by line of the greatest reporters and I was like okay this is how they write the intro this is how they do the quotes this is how they do the nut graph and I just figured it out and I made mistakes but like that was my that was my foray into it so one day about I don't know six months a year into me being a tech blogger for the Times um I reach out to Apple as you know you call and you say hey I'm doing the story and this do you have a comment and um the pr woman that answers uh uh she says um Steve's going to call you and at the time there was a guy called Steve Dowling who was like a very senior coms person and I was like oh cool steve Dowling she goes no jobs and I was like what and and I was like is that normal does that happen and she goes sometimes he's going to call you once to talk to you and i' been writing a lot of Apple stuff and um and so he never called and that night I went out for dinner uh with my girlfriend at the time and and we went for sushi and I had a I had like a few sakis and then all of a sudden I get a phone call from this number in in in San Jose and I answer it and it's jobs and I was like a little tipsy and he talked to me for like an hour and he just he just like convinced me not to do the story in the way I did it and I didn't I didn't it didn't make any sense but I he made so much sense and he just kept he was like oh well you got this wrong and that and then if you actually if you look at this you can and and then the next day so I wrote the piece and then a couple of days go by you know when like you've seen a movie and then all of a sudden you process the movie and then it's like oh that makes sense I I play this conversation back in my head and I was like holy [ __ ] he convinced me not to do the story that was that was the right story he got you he got me and so John marov who who is a veteran reporter I told him and he goes he just says it's the reality Distortion field and I was like what's that and he goes jobs Jobs invented it and and every time I would talk to him from time to time and every time it was the same thing it was like this he had this ability to make you believe that what you were doing was not the right story and that this was the way to do it it was it was a really fascinating thing to see how does the reality Distortion because I've heard that so many times the reality Distortion field never been in it you've been in it what is he actually doing in your opinion you're a smart guy you're a Storyteller you're a persuasive guy you've been around other charismatic people is it just his Aura is it his gravitas is he really good at reframing things is it um is it intimidation what is he actually doing and it's one of those things where you hear about and you're like that won't happen to me no exactly I was I yeah like he it's hard to describe what he's doing cuz it's so interesting he he convinces you that you're wrong and you believe it you know you um and look I think I there's a part of jobs that we should all admire and respect and and be be really Amazed by but there's a part of him that he was he he could be a real [ __ ] like um Walter isacson told me this story once jobs was was he presented the iPad and and then what they did back then they don't do it anymore as much because the media has changed so much but what they did back then was they would go around to all the newsrooms around the country and they would meet with the editorial boards and the reporters in in off the Record in total private and they would show you the products that they were doing so um and presidents would do it too and you know you would sometimes get invited they'd be like you know bush is here or the Secretary of State like come and it's a huge at the New York Times it was this massive conference room and on the walls were all these photos of all the dignitaries that had come over the last 150 years and and business people and so on and so we got a call that jobs was coming and there was 20 of us that were invited to this thing and I end up getting sat next to Brad Stone who now runs Bloomberg business and uh and jobs was right next to him and Brad was the the appple reporter at the time and I was the tech blogger and there was this moment where he passes he brings an iPad prototype and you know we're playing with them and everything and I was prodding it too hard and he was like stop it you're hitting it too hard Nick and I was like okay uh and so but then he says this is another reality Distortion field this actually will make more sense he says um we're doing questions and answers and and everything and then I said to him I said Steve I saw you a couple years ago at copertino and you were sitting on there was three stools on stage and you were on one of the stools and you had just presented the Apple television box and I said um you said that you you see apple as um having these these three businesses right um there's the mac and there's the iPod because that's what it was back then and and whatever and I said and then you said Apple TV will be the fourth lag so the stool will become a chair something like that and I remembered it verbatim back then um and he goes I never said that and I was like no I you no you said that I'm pretty sure you said that and he goes I never said that he goes I've never said that about Apple Apple television's an experiment for we're just playing with it it's like you know cuz it wasn't doing very well at the time and that was my question was like it's not doing very well like did you say that incorrectly and and I was like and I'm sitting there with all the editors and the you know and the big the big mackas at the at the New York Times and I'm like and I'm just like this young reporter and I'm like no you you definitely said that and he goes Nick I never said that and I was like okay and so and then I just like shut up and then afterwards John marov was there again too I pulled it up on my computer and I was and I watched the video I was like he said it and he goes reality Distortion field and that was just it and so what was I going to do go run around to the 20 people in that room and tell them say that he made it up no he he did what he did and it worked and they all believed that that was just an experiment right are there any of these guys that you felt like had had had it all meaning they have the extreme success they're the they're the extreme Achievers of society but you know most of the time you look and they're on their fifth wife and they're kind of an the stories that that they're kind of an [ __ ] to work for or that they screwed somebody over whatever right like they they same as this quote you know show me a great man and I'll show you a bad man right like you there's a there's this stereotype with that was there anybody you met that you were like no this person's actually they had it they did they had the Career Success but they also were a good family man or they were actually good to be around they were a good good human being to be around yeah people who you would say they're winning yeah um there was one person and I say was there's two there are other people look I I think like there are really good people that in Silicon Valley they're not the most successful of like you know they're not the worth the hundreds of billions like I love Aaron Levy I think he's a great guy like Dennis Crowley you know there along L people that I really really admire and like and I think are good people um but there was one person that I was like oh you have it all and I had met him because I'd done these series of stories on uh on the Kindle and uh um it was Jeff Bezos and I remember spending time with Bezos and when I became a columnist at the New York Times like when I got promoted to be a columnist there was a guy I work with David Carr who was just a wonderful wonderful human being who was the media columnist uh and um he since passed away but he was like he was everyone's Mentor he would make time for anyone he was just a lovely lovely person so smart and when I became a columnist I didn't the first few columns I wrote I was like I don't know what the hell I'm doing and uh and David used to smoke outside and I would go down and like hang out with him and he said uh and he said pick a fight that you can win that's what you need to do the first time when you first become a columnist so I was flying out to LA for for Thanksgiving and I was reading a book on my Kindle back then it was like 200 10 9 11 12 and um I was reading a book on my K it was like three pages to go and I was like oh my God they were like you must turn off your put your devices off now and and put them in airpl mode and whatever and um and I and I wanted to finish so I was like hiding the book so I can finish it and the ER the startist was like we are not allowed to take off S until you turn it off and I was like it's a calculator like it's not going to destroy the plane and she got very tur and I was so angry that when we finally got up to to altitude I wrote a column about just how ridiculous it was and it got published like the next day whatever and it was like the most red thing on the on the New York Times for weeks and I was like oh I'm picking this fight and so I started doing went to all these testing facilities because back then you were allowed there were rules in the fa you could use a razor a tape recorder a heart monitor and some other so we got all these Sean calls it a going to Petty Court yeah took Petty Court yeah I was I was in Petty and so I we went to these testing facilities and we did like EMP testing and we put a Kindle the it's amazing these giant rooms that like and you just have a device in you can test all the emps it turns out like the razor puts off like a hundred times more EMS and a Kindle and so I did I just kept writing these stories because people like were so irate about the fact that they couldn't read their Kindle or you play on their phone while they were taking off and eventually it got overturned and um and Bezos during his earnings call that quarter was like on the earnings call was like I want to give a shout out to Nick bton for like because it helped his business of course you know and um anyway I ended up meeting with him uh and um and he was like so smart and thoughtful and just you could tell was on a different level like he you could just see like oh this is someone who who never forgets anything who and he was married he was talking about his kids and how his his teenage son still sits on his lap and like and then I ended up end up going to a dinner at his house and um uh and he you know talking about his family and like and I met his wife McKenzie many times and and I was like oh this he's the guy who has it all he's like created this unbelievable business he um he doesn't from what I could tell he's not like people don't say he's an [ __ ] to work for right I'm sure there were some but most people like really really loved working for him and stayed at Amazon for years and loved the culture and then uh and then they got divorced and he ended up uh in a very very different relationship so I um uh and now you like he's like this bodybuilding looking like raver so I think he had it all but for whatever reason he had like this midlife crisis that made him throw it all away I don't know I don't know so that was the one person that had it all I I want to talk about one more thing um you want me to tell that that Walter isacson story yeah yeah yeah go ahead so Walter told me the story of after the iPad where he had met jobs in the Four Seasons I think it was which is connected to the the um muscone Center um and they had met for breakfast I don't know it was before or after the iPad and jobs had ordered a fresh squeezed orange juice and the waitress brings it out and it's not fresh squeeze it's got like Pulp in it and he calls her back over and he says I asked for fresh squeeze orange juice and um she brings another one out again that's got pulping it and he just becomes more and more angry and about this orange juice and at one point it sens and she's almost in tears this like this this poor waitress and at one point um Walter says like Steve what are you doing like it's just an orange juice like she's try like she clearly doesn't they they clearly don't have like non- pulp orange juice because it's fresh squeeze whatever and he says if if she's chosen to be a waitress for her living then she should be the best waitress she can be and it's my job to push her to do that and and it's like no you don't know her backstory you don't know like where her life has gone and why and things like that and like and I think that like so for all the Brilliance there was a lack of compassion and look we all I think the thing is the reality is like none of us are perfect we're all good do you think you have that you're one of the best there is do you lack that comp I mean like are you accused of being an [ __ ] yeah I I [ __ ] love when people call me an [ __ ] like I just like I I just don't give a [ __ ] but like I what I pride myself on is I pride myself on being very very easy to work with like if if we're doing a creative if we're write if we're writing a movie together and I'm working with the producers or we're doing a documentary like I am there to make this the best possible and you I will never ever ever be an [ __ ] you and you could never find anyone that would say I would because I understand that what we're doing is really hard and we're all doing our best and like it's the pursuit of creating great creativity however I've picked fights with people as a writer and a journalist and gone after people that makes me into a [ __ ] [ __ ] quite honestly you know like I had a thing um when Dave Moren was doing you know all of his products and startups like I went after him and and then later I actually later apologized to him because I felt like I was too much of an [ __ ] and we had like a heart tohe heart about it and like and I do think like there's a great line that bill Keller he was the editor and chief of the New York Times many years used to say and he used to say I don't believe people should be able to write about other people until they have been written about themselves and I learned that when I people started writing stories about me and it was like oof that feels awful like that sucks and it was like a moment where I realized like oh like I don't need to be such a dick to people like I can I can I can write these stories and I can be honest and I can tell the truth but I I need to you need to have some compassion to and I you know that was something I had to learn in my the beginning of my career you um you talk about like your time at the New York Times where you're like we were in this room and then the room had the portraits of all the important people who used to come to us and and try to tell us what they were doing because we were the messengers and we used to kind of shape the narrative out there and they tried to shape us and we shaped The Narrative and there was these people who were you know you recognize their names from the bines that you had just like so much respect for them do you think that that's still like the like does does that [ __ ] matter at all anymore because for me I'm like if I'm a founder of a company now I don't I put zero dollars in the pr I put zero care in if if I can get a press mention it's like so low on the total po compared to how it was 15 years ago when I was building a company that has changed my my respect for kind of main I think Trump really like reality distorted everybody when he started going after fake news and then you started seeing examples of it like I just feel like The credibility has gone down but I'm also on the outside you're almost you know you're from that world do you feel the same way or do you do you think that's completely misguided there's a practical thing of like you you can get an audience on Twitter on wherever and you're like I don't want you nor do I need you um there's two answers to that question and the first answer is that I think 90% of the media is utter garbage and it is complete and utter ridiculous drizzle that is opinionated and uh bad for society and I think 90 I think 10% is people that are working really really [ __ ] hard to try to do investigative reporting because they care and I met those people I remember those people at the New York Times when I first started and I had they were you know they were people that were making 120 Grand a year and could be making millions like working for a hedge billions I don't know for like wherever they wanted and they wanted to pursue the pursuit of honesty and setting the record straight going after these bad people CU there are a lot of bad people in the world does that 90% of the of the crap include your past employers that does that include everywhere yes 1,00% because I think and because the system it all broke like it's broken be and I I believe it's broken Reon repair for now I I My Hope Is that and maybe this is me being delusional but like my hope is that AI can somehow help fix it but for but I believe that or AI in the hands of people can help fix it but when I first started at the times like you weren't allowed an opinion you weren't allow there was no you know you there was no social media like there was no Twitter like I was at the times when Twitter came out like you if I remember being in meetings in those rooms and I would ask an editor right what do what do you think and they would be like I'm not I don't have an opinion on this my I'm a journalist who comes with this impartially and all I want to do is report the facts and and and so I think that what happened was you had this the pro problem was the internet came along right and you had to to get to the times like I was the first one that one of the first ones that came in I remember being in a meeting once with 40 or 50 people at the times it was this big meeting and everyone kind of went around and they introduced themselves and they talked about like where they'd gone to school and how they'd ended up here I I barely graduated high school like I literally had a 2.1 GPA I got kicked out of art school and like they were all like I was at Harvard and I worked at the Harvard crimson and I did this and the other and I was like oh I'm the odd one out here that shouldn't be here and like was only here because no one wanted to write for the internet and that became everyone became that and and I think that like what ended up happening was you had this generation that came in after I left that was they were all they they were the internet people they hadn't been mentored they hadn't you know they hadn't learned the ropes and and they didn't and they felt like they had a right to say oh we shouldn't we should not publish Tom Cotton in the opinion section and we're going to go we're going to be irate because we that is not the way the world works the world works is by listening to other people's opinions and like and I think the reason that so many people in Silicon Valley have have veered to the right which they have is because the left tells them oh you can't think like that and you can't and you're stupid if you believe this and so on and so forth and I think that so the the whole apparatus is completely broken but at the same time I I'm friends with a lot of startup Founders who tell me that like oh we got a profile in the New York Times and we had the biggest influx of customers we've had ever or we got mentioned you know a write up on here or whatever it is and the same thing happened and so the eyeballs are still there people just don't necessarily trust them in the way that they did and I and I think that you know what's interesting is that you have all these new news outlets that come along like sehore and the Free Press and things like that and they're trying to get people they're trying to say we're we're impartial in the middle and so on and so forth but inevitably what ends up happening is as soon as you put that opinion in the view the everyone the the number of listeners or viewers or readers go up and then the product ends up steering that way and so I think that there is a desperate need for something that is what I think the solution is honestly is you you you know you don't need a right-wing publication or a leftwing publication you need a both you need a place where there are people who have right-wing point of views and Centrist point of views and leftwing and they're all in there together and they're debating it and they're respectful of each other and maybe they disagree but they are all there and the problem is the New York Times is all left and the Wall Street Journal is all right and so on and so forth and um and so you you don't necessarily trust any of it yeah I would love to read the debate I think that's a lot more interesting format um two people who take the other two people who each each believe or willing to like argue the best case for each side so you can read it and I think that's both entertaining because it's sort of a fight an intellectual fight uh but I think it's also more informative because you get both perspectives you know sort of Steel Mann um is there a story you wish you could write either if you had like infinite time or uh you know sometimes you get successful and you're like oh somebody should do that it's probably not worth me doing it but somebody could do that is there is there a great story out there that you think somebody should be doing uh I don't know I my dream is I uh I've I love thinking about stories from all different perspectives like how you know when do you do when is a story a documentary when is a story a book when is it a magazine when is it a tweet when's it a movie or or a nine-part series on Netflix or you know and and I do I write all all forms of of writing and and um and I'm fascinated by you know there's there's these different things that are fascinating is like um you know a documentary is the people from the past talking about there in the present talking about the past right uh a TV series is the story unraveling as you're watching it unravel a book is you get to climb inside crawl inside someone's head for seven hours and let them understand how visually things smelled and looked and and like so I've always might I want to write a novel at some point I think that that's like the next thing I want to do um and so uh because I love I read I'm a voracious novel reader and um and I just have so much respect for the amount of research that goes into them and then they become but they it's like goes back to the beginning like the magic is you don't know that the people that wrote the novel spent hundreds of thousands of hours researching all the history or whatever it is to to to do that um as far as like a non-fiction like I just love stories that are that you know that old cheesy saying that like you know it's if it was fiction you wouldn't believe it you know it's like I really think that those are the stories that to me are um are the most the most fun to read and report and research you have uh all these different seasons of life you know you said you in Evolutions you said you want to be a war uh photographer and then you accidentally became a colum a columnist and then you uh became an author and you've even though you've disliked some of the guys you cover it sounds like there is a lot of admiration still for a bunch of others as well have you ever thought about like going into the business World um since you've been able to see it so closely uh I almost did this year actually there was a project that I was going to go to um which was a startup in in the storytelling space can you say what it is I think that what's happening is there's a change coming in Hollywood as far as um how we can content and short form versus and the way you know there's there are these structures that happen to stories that um that we that become norms and so for example in a film screenplay a film screenplay is 120 pages long because each page is a minute that's why when you look at screenplays their Courier and the certain font because each page shot is usually one minute long and so 120 pages is 2-hour movie and so there's a there's a whole system setup there's a book called uh save the cat which essentially made this world where you you on page one the first person you meet is is your is your main protagonist um by Page Three you have discovered what the movie is about by page five there's the introduction of the antagonist by Page 30 every single movie if you go back and watch on page 30 which is 30 minutes in it's the changing moment it's the you know it is the Joseph Campbell like this is when the Journey Begins and and then by Page 90 you've entered this third act and and we we've come back around and so on and so forth and um and while every movie is different we we understand that that's the same thing and I think what what's happened is that that um philosophy has been overused and I think do you remember the movie parasite uh that won the Academy Award parasite changed it and it wasn't by paid 60 turned into a whole different movie and you were like whoa I've never seen that before and that's why people I think really love didn't I think what we what we look for in culture is things that are new and different and everyone wants in a while a genius comes along who does it and um and then everyone else copies that and then you got to wait for the next genius to come along to do the thing and um and I think that the that page one page five page 30 page 90 thing is complet it doesn't work for today's audiences they don't have the patience to wait till page 30 to find out when the turn is and so in short form there's like this new philosophy of like 1 second 7 Seconds 9 seconds and I think that like but then they don't know how to tell stories and I think that there is a world where um you know we were exploring this idea of like thinking about the new approaches of how to tell long form stories and short form bites and things like that and um but at the end of the day like the reason I didn't end up doing it is because I just love telling stories and I don't necessarily want to be like a manager meeting with VCS and boards and and getting kicked out by Jack dorsy how many uh how many copies how many copies of your books have you sold uh hundreds of thousands of copies yeah o o over time um I don't I haven't checked in a long time but uh hundreds of thousands and they've been printed all over and everything why is American Kingpin not a Netflix like seven-part series like I can't believe nobody amazing show it was okay that movie was okay I mean no it was bad it was bad it was bad yeah it was bad I'm not going to tell you story but the reason the reason it has not is because I got screwed over on on the film film right deal so that's the reason why but it may end up in it still today it still may end up uh may end up there we'll see all right if I wanted to spend six weeks getting as good as I could at storytelling what would I do is there a book or is there some process like if I was dedicated how would I become an amazing Storyteller what would you well if you dedicated you'd need more than six weeks so let's pretend what would be the first what would be the what can I do in six weeks I got 19 bucks what do you got for me if you um I have all these books on like on storytelling that I read and like and they're interesting and like you get a little snippet I think the most interesting of all the books was I read was um when I wrote hatch on Twitter I really wanted it to feel like a murder mystery because no one knew what really happened and I read a book on murder mysteries which was unbelievable like you can read any of them just Google like how to write murder mysteries it's a it's a blue book it's a collaboration where bunch of murder writers and and screenwriters and so on each write a few chapters each and there's a few things I learned from that which were um which one is um I when you read a lot of books um people forget to describe smells um and murder mysteries always do and it's like and it brings it really brings you in it's it's wild to see how it can add like this extra layer like sounds smells you know the noises you know um uh not just the creaking stairs but but the you know the mold or whatever it is it just creates this sense of story in your brain the other thing is um the save the cow which is a really interesting even if you don't write screenplays it's a really interesting way of understanding character and so on and um i' read a bunch of screenplay books by like some of the old greats and they talk about characters and and and things standing in your way and so on but I will say for me the best way to become a great Storyteller is to read stories and I I think one of the things that frustrates me about Silicon Valley and the tech bro culture is everyone's trying to optimize their life for the most number of seconds of this and that and the other and it's like what they don't realize is that some of the greatest things that they will learn is from things that have nothing to do with what they do so I in uh I'm 48 now when I was 45 I I love listening to piano music I I've never played before I was like you know what I'm going to I'm going to just learn the piano uh and um and I got obsessed with it I learned how to read music for the first time oh look at you what is that I'm on U all right the cover fell that's his like a New Year's resolution my how doing well I'm on the Faber method here so I'm on book 2A right now I'm playing uh I'm playing there's a great app it's like um it's called um that I do in my spare time it's called notes teacher and you just do it for like five minutes a day site reading practice Yeah site reading practice but I got obsessed obsessed like I literally would play two hours a day and like now I can play a couple of chopan songs and things like that and I and the thing I and to me it was just a fun hobby and it was like really like but what you learn is that like they are telling a story and they're telling a story you know H Hans Zimmer says like the notes will ask a question and then the next notes will answer the question and it's like and the way shopan like is you just unbelievable when you if you sit and analyze the music and think about like the highs and the lows and the things that are repeated and it's and it's amazing and it and it started to kind of inform some of the ways I thought about screenplays and like I read as me as many novels as I can I hate non-fiction books I can't read non-fiction books which is funny because I write them uh I just they're just boring to me uh so I um but I read novels and I love like just studying as I'm reading like oh that was really unique of the way they did this and I I read a lot of like 1950s sci-fi and then I read a lot of like 1930s 40s 50s 60s um incredible you know the like the writers that we all should read um and you just understand that they it's really these stories are about people they're not the stories that that we think they it's like the the guy who wrote Game of Thrones George R Martin I saw him speak once at a conference years and years ago and he said you know you could take my story you could put it in a spaceship and it would still work you could put it in present day and it would still work it's about the relationships and the characters and I think that that's what ends up happening is as you watch something the best stories are the ones where you imagine yourself as the character and then you want to know how you would solve the problem if I'm James Bond how would I get out of this as the as the drill is about to you know sever my heart or whatever and and then you can't figure it out and the Storyteller does and you you're like delighted by that because it's great Stelling I think that's your secret by the way you're like I non-fiction is usually pretty boring but yours aren't and I think yours aren't because you consume so much content that's uh you know on the mystery side yours are page Turners and so what you know that lateral thinking where you take a skill from one discipline and apply it to another that usually doesn't have it that's what some of the best business people do as well is they take corre yeah the best uh uh hedge fund you know Renaissance is cu they took the best AI machine learning mathematical prowess and applied it to finance um and like we had Mike poser on the podcast and he was talking about how he started as a rapper but all his hit songs are him singing and he's not the best singer but he's like I am the best writer because he he sang one of his lyrics and he's like the rhyme scheme I'm using here the reason people like that hook and it's catchy is because I'm using a rap rhyme scheme which no singer songwriters would typically do but that's why my song sounds different because I'm using a rapper's lyrics but I'm singing them in the way that um you know is is rarely done but it sounds like you've kind of done that same thing no it's I think it's totally true and look I think jobs jobs did this thing where he you know computers back then were these nerdy like circuit boards and he was like oh I'm going to marry graphic design with technology and so for me like I want to marry the style of a novel with a narrative non-fiction story and um and you know there's great writers who've done that in the past that I such such admir for whenever I get done reading your books like when I get done each time after I've read American Kingpin I'm like pretty bummed I'm like H I was so like in love with like reading this and I was looking forward to fin or I was looking forward to like I would sneak off to like find the page and and see if I can just like read a few uh chapters and I felt Bumm that like I was like in this relationship with this book and it's over now and I would I've like searched so long and hard to find something that could fill that need and like only one out of like 20 or 30 books like fills that need I think Mastermind was another great book that was a very similar topic and he did a and the author did a great job of a very similar style of Storytelling but in general it's been really hard for me to find things I I read a lot of novels but I like reading I like sometimes when I read a novel I'm like I fall in love with this character and then I find out that I have to remind myself the character is not real and I get kind of like bummed about it you know and so what who do you view as a peer uh or uh someone you look up to where they do your style of non fiction storytelling oh well just real quick on the novel like yes they're not real but they are based on reality like every every novelist pulls from the people around them to create the characters that you're reading so you know it's like what you know if you go do research into like whatever your favorite book is uh your favorite novel like and you look at how they did it if they talk about it they're like oh this you know when I was a kid my grandfather used to tell me the stories about or like there was a neighborh across the street so I think they are it is real and it's still people um as far as as um as far as people I admire and I look up to I I like I said before I don't really read a lot of narrative non-fiction uh sorry a lot of non-fiction I I don't think there's that like I and I love I have such admiration for people's reporting and and even their writing but this is I I need a story I can't have an so that's what I'm describing I want more like story driven not this is the [ __ ] man I just like I just love learning about this stuff well you had you had one last question Sam and I interrupted you what or did you get answer it well it was about um I Sean did you see the documentary on Netflix about uh was it what was it called uh it with Ilia was it bit bitf finex what was that called it was the couple uh Bitcoin Bonnie and Clyde I did a documentary on them for Netflix uh with Chris Smith who did Tiger King uh that was about this couple that had stolen 5.4 well they stole $72 million in crypto uh and then were trying to launder it and every they were the only two people on the entire internet who wanted the price of Bitcoin to go down uh and they had every time they were trying to launder it it would double and double and double and double and double until the point that it was one point at its peak was worth $8.4 billion and she was this like wacky uh cring rapper and he was like a part-time magician investor and like it's one of those stories if it were fiction you'd be like this is stupid this would never happen she uh sh she or the the guy Ilia spoke at the very first hokan which is kind of funny oh and then the woman Heather the new Forbes 30 30 dude you well listen listen listen the woman Heather she was like a copywriter or something but she wasn't any good and she like dm'd me asking to talk at one of our things or to like do freelance work or something like that and then a she was kind of a sex freak I had a bunch of friends that like fooled around with her and they were like this woman's wild man you should stay away like like those type of stories and I was like joking with Nick I was like whoever I guess we interact with just like you know maybe 10% of them are going to end up becoming like amazing criminals uh because for some reason we we've been around a bunch of these people like right as or right before they were committing some huge crime um but that was also a good story yeah that was a great story that was just wild story that they that they went on they went to Ukraine and like uh had like fake passports and I mean it was just yeah it's nuts is uh is making a Netflix documentary is is there good money in that or you do it just cuz it's sick and it's like you know as art and I'm doing this for art how does that work there's not look being a writer I think you know it's good money like if you can pull it off there somebody sent me an article a while ago that you're more likely to become a billionaire than to become a a a successful writer uh and yeah it's like I think the way in the olden days is you know at Vanity Fair for example or the New Yorker they had these contracts for these writers they would get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars a year and they would write four stories a year and like and then they had the house Upstate and the place The Brownstone in Brooklyn and like it was a different time and now you know everything's been dilute media has been completely diluted um where we have podcasts and blogs and newsletters and mainstream media and all and all this stuff and so the advertising dollars and the revenue dollar it's not like they've gone up it's just they've evenly been more evenly distributed and so for me I just want to tell stories and the uh and I just don't give a [ __ ] in what format it is and so it's really fun to be able to write screenplays to write books to write magazine features to make documentaries and like and then you know it all just kind of adds up from there I could talk to uh with you for hours man thank you for doing this thank you so much for having me this has been really fun we appreciate you all right that's it that's a pod that's the pod [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
the point of this conversation is this is a gold rush and who knows how often these come around how much revenue will your brands do using this Tik Tok model this year 100 plus so five Brands you're going to do over 100 million this year and this is the Playbook you're running across all of them yeah so what's an example of one of these videos I think this video had made this kid close to $50,000 the single video what you said in this video will make people millions of dollars if all they did was just try to act on it millions are being printed on Tik Tok shop like what are the m mistakes people make my advice is be an observer not a consumer that's the best thing you can do let's brainstorm live $100 million Tik Tok I'm going to show you something that the world is never going to see but I'm going to show how serious I take [Music] this all right ready has has anyone ever wore a cut off like this before the first one to bring the gun show to MFM that's so I was just thinking like watched a lot of these and I've seen a lot of guests and I was like like I'm Different in a lot of ways so I might as well visually capture that you know make a statement you were early to the Amazon Trend and you took $5,000 you turned it into a $30 million company you sold and what you told me was basically that this now is the first and biggest thing you've seen since that Amazon opportunity is that right it is it is and I've looked for these I didn't appreciate it in the Amazon era but I look for these moments in time where you don't need a ton of startup Capital you don't need to raise money and you can basically just find something that works a system a platform latch on to that and create something of substantial Enterprise Value and Tik Tok represents that so what I want to do is I want to go through the big idea so why why people should be caring about Tik Tok right now what you see as the like the big opportunity and then specifically what are some examples of people that are crushing it how are they crushing what's the Playbook and then where are the opportunities that you see that are still open that anyone could go do so that's my game plan absolutely so top of the funnel here fundamentally people don't appreciate what's actually happening with Tik Tok like like shop is a component of that that's the center of their model but you think about even restaurants you think about Google you think about Facebook meta ads like all of the there's a paradigm shift so a good example my now ex-wife and I went to uh Tokyo like a year and a half ago and if we went 5 years ago she would have gone to Google to search for restaurants she would have yelped now she goes on Tik Tok and wants to visually see what is going on right the shopping is turning more live all of these things are fundamentally changing even the creators of this last generation the influencers they're coming up off short form content we all know how important you know clipping and and all that stuff is by the way I I read that 30% of J Z's primary news source is Tik Tok yep uh and so and then same thing uh SE primary search engine so in my company we did a little p there we were trying to work on our Google like search result yep and I was asking our employees I was like so when you Google for this what do you do they go I don't really Google for that I just go to Tik Tok and type in the name and then I whatever comes up on Tik Tok is what I use yep that blew my mind because I wasn't using Tik Tok as a search engine yep and that that's the paradigm shift and that's that's the opportunity because it's so early and it's I don't like the word like gam fiable but when you just think through these new models and like how information is being shared that's where the brands of the future are being created that's where the artists of the future being created that's where like fashion design it's all happening through this new means of distribution all right so imagine Landing a call with Richard Branson from a CT email one founder one of our listeners they did that and the HubSpot for startups team just launched a Playbook sharing exactly how it was done and not only that but also a killer report on fundraising for Founders so you can steal Ava's cold email Playbook you can get the insight into what investors want and the top Tech stack across Founders and so much more I can't stress this enough how crucial this is if you're looking to get into networking and to raise money right now get the link in the description below now back to the show by the way this happens in everything so I don't know if you ever heard the story of why Obama was so successful when he did his first presidential run do you know this story just tapping into the social media and all that it was kind of social media but he got this big Grassroots movement going from two reasons one he was one of the first presidents to build a huge email list at the time president the people who were running they were doing you know fundraisers they were doing TV they were doing you know traditional interviews but they weren't building an email list and he built a giant email machine before anybody else and then he started using social media on top and he basically hired people Trump did the same thing when Trump won in 2016 even this year when he when he won he raised way less money than his opponent right the first time way less than Hillary this time way less than k/ Biden and in both cases it was because he was using a different marketing strategy his his was all Facebook and and online and the others were doing all like traditional TV buys commercials stuff like that and so when you see this like you said Paradigm Shift it's like the new marketing opportunity if you can pounce on that that's where you can get rich can you quickly just say like what you saw in Amazon and when that was back in 20 what was it 14 or so yeah yeah and I'll go from that to now like the numbers we're seeing the difference in terms of like Raz right um and it's challenging for people because it's happening so fast like I think a lot of people still think that you know digital marketing is the new paradigm and like actually it's like all the way over here now and so Amazon's a great example I remember seeing Brands like Billboards were a huge strategy back then I'm like I started by working with Brands that's how I got my start as like a consultant helping them sell on Amazon and I'm going guys you're spending $50,000 on a billboard campaign and when you give me five grand to spend on Amazon you you're having trouble tracking that but right here we're making $5 for every dollar spent and this is me as a 22-year-old kid they're like no this is the way it is or like you know we're going to double bodybuilding.com needs these or or or you know GNC needs these and by the time I finally it probably took me like a year I'm going these guys are slow right at first you think you're dumb eventally you realize they're dumb you're like yo I keep putting a dollar into this magic money machine and $5 are coming out which is a 5x is cool Raz for people don't know Raz is return on ad spend so it's for every dollar I spend on marketing how many dollars do I get back out in Revenue yep TV billboards you don't really know right the famous advertising saying is half of our advertising doesn't work problem is we just don't know which half like and actually for a while CMOS didn't mind that because if you can't track it you can't be held accountable but then Facebook and all these guys came and all of a sudden every dollar you put in you get a like verified amount of how much revenue you're getting out of it now you're held accountable but that also presents an opportunity yep just for a kid like you you're like all right if if this works it's inarguable this is working and I'm getting 5x for return on my money and so now what we're seeing what happens over time is that compresses right enough guys like me do podcasts like this Facebook ads are great godamn podcasting it shrinks the margin and um so like you look at like an Amazon now which has been my you know I've been doing ads on there for 10 years now and like a like a one to one and a half Raz is like good in a hot category which is not profitable but you're you know that's where you're like okay repeat customers building the brand and so you have that modeled as like that was the last couple years and then Tik Tok comes along and that organic algorithm is so damn good and then if you this is where now it almost goes back to the billboard era of like actually tracking becomes a little more difficult but we're seeing just money spent on this this system which we can get into a little bit later but this system is like 7 8X minimum return versus a 1x Raz and upwards of like when I first did this with you know Jimmy 18 months ago it was like 30X you know like and then the question was how can we spend more I mean it's like Peds for marketing right it's like if you're going to get if I can use this channel that not everybody understands this Playbook that not everybody understands and get 7x or I go to Facebook and Amazon I get 1X 1.5x I mean that's like cheat codes in the game of business can you give people a sense how much revenue will your brands do using this Tik Tok model this year so directly attributable to like Tik Tok shop we we modeled probably like 40ish million and overall the halo effect of all that plus so your Brands which is what you three four roughly brands or how many how many are you running right now F five that I either own you know majority of or or a meaningful yeah so five Brands you're going to do over 100 million this year and this is the Playbook you're running across all of them yep Y and and and by the way how old are these Brands one or two years old it's actually it's unreal and it it I don't want to say things stress or scare me at this point but it's one of those things where it's like all right we got to see this through because the point of this conversation is this is a gold rush and who knows how often these come around right and so I feel like I'm getting to go back to my 22-year-old self and saying hey like this is going to be really big you know Focus right now do the right things execute you know and and and that's where we're at is that a conversation you had with yourself back when you were 22 and and the Amazon Gold Rush was happening I took it really seriously but you don't know what you don't know right and just I didn't appreciate like who knew private Equity was going to come in and value all these Brands and who knew that Amazon was going to grow to that extent it was still kind of a discount site when I was first on there that's why Brands didn't want to do it you were in the supplements category and you said the way the supplement game worked was you had GNC or these like retail stores if you wanted to be if you wanted to win in supplements you had to win in retail and then you're like Amazon came around and changed the game because now you have this online retailer and suddenly new supplement Rands could win there where you couldn't get on the Shelf at GNC exactly and you were saying now the same thing's happening to Amazon basically there's a new one coming in it's sweeping the rug and creating the opportunity maybe you weren't going to win on Amazon but now you can win in this new way is that right did I that's exactly right it's these continual Paradigm shifts like Amazon it was you know there's this brand BPI Sports who was number one in GNC and then I just remember seeing that flip where Amazon all of a sudden was like 50% of their revenue and then they didn't focus on Amazon and then there were Brands passing them up right and so the brands of the future were born on that digital platform and and Amazon was you know their Facebook ads there other digital means but we'll call it the e-commerce era and now it's happening again with like the short form Discovery era so it's much less about what does your website look like or this and that it's like how are you optimizing for this means of information dissemination and you know I think when most people say gold rush if you call 10 things a gold rush then what's really a gold rush but I feel like you genuinely believe you're like yo this I'm not [ __ ] around I'm serious right now there is a window where something can happen could you like make your pitch not to me but to like the next Rob who's who is 23 24 25 30 years old it doesn't matter what age but like to be like yo take this serious you can even just direct a camera like what's your message to that person about this opportunity honest I'm going to hijack I'm going to hijack your your friend here how many how many businesses a day do you think Ben looks at just in general 10 to 15 a day a day yeah a day so he's constantly looking at opportunities and he sent me a text and he goes oh this Tik Tok thing really does seem to be the best opportunity to go from like no net worth to like 1 to 5 million with no skills no background no Tech whatever and when he sent me that because obviously I accept my opinion is going to be biased I do this every day but when Ben sent me that I was like oh okay yeah no this is for real and then you look at our own you know like we're doing this our company growth even though we have skills we've been doing this a while but to go from zero to you know 100 plus million run rate is actually insane with no you know not raising it's we're profitable like super profitable yeah you've boot trrap these right like you know I'm a small investor but you didn't take our money for the money you just no we love you you just you want us to be on board uh all right so let's let's stop uh teasing what are the brands like tell me some stories like I I don't live in this world you do tell me some stories of some brands that are crushing it what are some examples that make this real one that I think we can start with is this company Roose research and this guy had a little Amazon experience he's 27 and this is like a a nine figure play and and I I I just couldn't be more excited for him and so I'm like you know hyping it up here but he reaches out to me two and a half years ago before Tik tok's even taken off and he's like hey I'm thinking about starting the supplement brand on Amazon he picked the right category he's like longevity is getting bigger he gets on Amazon he's doing all right and then Tik Tok comes around and he he pours all in on it and two years later I believe this month you know he'll do he'll do north of like $15 million between all online this month this month so what is the product what what do they do something like research NAD Roost research and it's that like you know it's that every couple years a new supplement category comes along where like this might have long-term staying power collagen was the last huge one you know $4 billion exit vital proteins to uh Nestle and he's betting on that and then he went all in all bootstrapped no raised money not even like he hasn't revamped the brand yet if you go look at it you're like no this looks a little like you know it doesn't look like a multi hundred million doll thing but that's what he's building so I'd say that one so he spotted the health Trend early early enough not like the first guy but early enough built a good product in that space you said he went all in on Tik to you know figured out Tik Tok What did he actually do to make it work on Tik Tok he tapped into this Creator model so should we go in detail on what's the Playbook so if I for all these ideas they have a Playbook what's the Tik Tok Playbook so it's important to preface it with this everyone is used to YouTube Instagram like where your followers matter right like you have an Instagram following of a million people that's valuable Tik Tok shattered that and you have to look at everything through the lens of views you start a brand new Tik Tok account I do we walk out of here we start a new Tik Tok account together we start a video of dancing in the street that could get 10 million views right and so that's the center of this whole model swings at bat screw your your brand page like Roose doesn't have a brand page right they might run ads but the key part of the model is how many people can we get creating product specific content for the brand like an army instead of one influencer becoming Kim Kardashian or the rock or whatever instead of I will become famous to get a lot of followers and then product saying is the new model is an army of people need to create content and then it's just the content wins one of those pieces of content needs to pop in order for this to work yep is that it yeah exactly and the first big use case of this before product was Andrew Tate like that's how he can we say that can we say that name that's how he he broke the internet not even like intentionally but he had Affiliates making Tate content right so he's not T's not on Tik Tok but he has 500 hungry little minions who love him and he was paying them or they were just inspired what was going on yeah there was an affiliate commission back to make more videos for him so like like you could get people paying $50 a month by making this content he created basically like a Content MLM almost pretty much yeah no exactly so he and what what was his I mean that's kind of Genius of him to do that because no other you know we were content creators podcasters whatever but if we created content we just put it on our Channel yep and it was just us or like we would hire people to create clips for us what but on our one channel Y what he did was different he's like yo here's a bunch of raw material it run it you figure out how to go viral and if you do I'll pay you what per view or what was he what was he doing per sign up they got back to the community that would teach you how to do that so I mean and the end result was most Googled man on the on the planet right and um and so now you see that everywhere streamers like Aiden Ross and those guys they they spend six figures a month paying on a CPM metric paying people to chop up their streams and put it out on New Tik Tok like I do that right with my my stuff like someone from my team will chop this up and you might see it right swings it back and so now take that same idea sorry when you say my team do you literally mean like my employees or you're like I just like both we're trying to hit it from every way and brands are too like this is the fundamental thing how can you get as much good quality swings at bat as humanly possible and sometimes it's freelance people and then sometimes it's internally it's a little harder on shop so beautiful because the model itself incentivizes it without us having to change hands you know like internally I'm trying to figure out metrics like you know see like all that right whereas if you have talented creators they just go and that that was Tates too it worked it fed itself the the economics fed itself so shop feeds itself so just to explain instead of just sending it to famous people influencers or random people what happened was certain people realize oh [ __ ] I can make money doing this so instead of just doing it once what if I made five videos a day what if I started picking brands that I thought would perform well and they started making $500 a month and $5,000 a month you have creators that make how how much does like the most successful creators make per month just creators they don't own the brand they don't buy inventory they don't have to run the operations they're just making Tik toks what do you think what do you think I I've heard that like there's like 20year olds that are able to make 100 Grand a month yeah like like yeah like like a lot and and way more than you'd think I was at an event for one of our you know the group that I own a little piece of and we've had 27 people make over $100,000 in a month as freelance creators and the important part is these are not influencers like jacine I have a YouTube video with she was working as a server eight months ago making 20 bucks an hour and she made like 180 Grand last month and what they do they go in the lab and they're basically like all right I have to figure out what content can I create that will make this product you know interesting appealing to other people and then they get like they're making making like 30 40 50 videos a month most of them don't do well but a few of them start do well and they're studying and learning oh if I do this hook that grabs people but it's not converting okay what can make it convert better and they're just specializing in the craft of short form content no no not too dissimilar than David Ogie in the past figuring out how to do print ads that are going to convert right all the great marketers in the past it's just instead of going to an ad agency you're going to these Creator armies where young people are specializing in how to create short form content response marketing this means that's exactly what it is and and there's varying degrees of it there's like the innovators who can sit down the algorithm is the algorithm you have to capture attention you have to keep them watching and then you know something to to convert and then there's the second wave of that whereas you know one of the innovators hits what's works and then there's literally 500 kids that are going to copy that same idea right only make 20% of it but then what does that do for the brand right then all of a sudden you have all these videos going nuclear I bet you R show me a video so what's an example of one of these videos that this is a great one I think this video last I checked I think this video had made this kid close to $50,000 the Creator the single video and he he paired you know modern thing Trump like getting elected with conspiracy and all this whatever just got into office one day ago and is already going after one of the most predatory Industries in the world watch this we have a public health system that does so the hook was first he's writing the news Trend Trump uh instead of saying hey I have a product I'd like to tell you about no starts by talking about Trump and then he has this uh curiosity would you call it that that information Gap right where all of a sudden he went after one of the biggest industries in the world what did what did he do predatory which one what's that industry and what did he do and then you hear it in the background it's that mysterious it's a trending sound change starting today but you know what's crazy his buddy donno white was coming after by the way even how raw this is he's taking a video of like an Android phone yeah so if does you don't think this is an advertisement no exactly and and everything nowadays is Shifting to that just raw organic like you don't want to feel like an influencer is selling you and that's not what he is you know like this is like this is a random dude making telling you a story yeah okay what's he put theats back I give ahead a little bit here the got Dana White more social proof it's interesting because around the same time they were trying to silence this doctor for giving us the scientist now yeah uh B it's another famous scientist so they're building he's building this case for for something still hasn't told you about the product right problem that lives up in through here and oil of oregano is the absolute best remedy for that it's antimicrobial antibacterial anti- fungal anti- candida antiviral anti- parasites and antimold now I did some research and not only is oiv so really you get the idea right and then he still hasn't sold you he building this idea of oil oregano and then at the end I believe he but I've been taking two of these pearls anytime I feel like I'm coming down with something and it knocks that [ __ ] right out the only bad thing about this product is how fast they sell out especially around this season so if you're sick of being sick and you want to try these out for yourself and you see that orange cart right there that means they are still in stock and the Flash sale is still Al unfor Tik Tok Shop video that's a masterful Tik Tok Shop video and like if you know marketing you see it you go yeah but you forget like the average person sees that and they're like you know they're going to the coffee table at work the next day and talking about man you know like mold and fungus is everywhere but I hear you take this oil of Oregan dude I got cousins that will send me this and they'll be like yeah you got to start taking this yeah the government's out to get you yeah whatever they have these like that conspiracy combined with you know in ancient times this used to be the way we do things and then you know his last like scarcity called to action where he's like the only downside is they sell out so fast so if you see the button is orange that means I still have it just get it while I'm still there you better go and it's on say it's on flash sale right now you know it's like did you see um you know the the brand you're invested in did you have anyone send you content from that at any point like just not only did I have people send me content from that brand which we were the the founder of it doesn't want us talking about it all right but then also he sent me a video of other people creating videos being like I'm tired of hearing about this which is like the ultimate sign of respect it means it dominated Tik Tok so much which is like there the video was like if I see one more video telling me about this I'm not going to buy your thing but like even that video had 7 million views of the person complaining about seeing this so much which means mission accomplished we got 600 million views in a month like that is an insane insane number and that was before shop how much did you spend that month to get 600 million views it was a little over 100 Grand that that was before shop too so shop now is changing the unit economics I'd say like not in the favor of the brand at the end of the day it adds a level of scale but now with commissions and stuff that was when we were like sending it to Amazon and just we're not even tracking it we're just like if we can get 600 million views we're going to be all right you know for for 100 grand well it creates this amazing fly wheel right because you hear about a brand a bunch on Tik Tok you go then Google it and click the link or you go to Amazon and you search on Amazon it tells Google it tells Amazon people are searching for this brand name it UPS your rank there so now you get organic ranking off of this social in addition to the direct conversions on social yep no exactly where do you go to find these brands that are crushing it this tool and this is the other crazy thing C data is directly plugged in to Tik tok's API Hall data k a l o data da a t like so they if you go to the homepage here you're seeing top products top videos so you can go look at like you could study you can study that's that's that kid's video I know him he's in our in our group but that was like the one of the top videos from last week it made him if you go right now to like the top products what do you see and they just it's like rankings weekly or how do they do this yeah so like beauty Beauty and personal care you can filter however you want so this is last are you are you in this list this is last 30 days we are in this list we're top five and we're not 3 four five and then I think if you expand it like we have a couple products in the in the top 10 can you talk about what your products are which products can you talk about yeah yeah I mean like a really good example has been are we gatekeeping here or are you no no I don't I mean I I Yap about stuff on Instagram all the time so uh evil Goods has been a really good case study of of beef Tallow in the you know skinc care section how' you decide to do beef Tallow of all that was that was an investment and so one of our students or whatever like saw that category as similar to longevity like okay holistic Wellness is obviously becoming huge people don't like toxic skincare this seems to have some good supporting like it has this like Grassroots Twitter movement let's bet on that and so you know that's what we did and and pretty much whenever you see the ability to Market to fear like that big Pharma or whatever it might be or or insecurities from IND Plastics whatever that that that will do well on this platform like just just period because people feel like they're learning something and so it checked all those boxes he came out with a crazy aggressive name evil Goods is like um you know we'll see cuz that could disrupt the ability to like go to retail and stuff like that but at the same time liquid death yeah yeah so so could be liquid death exactly exactly so hope hopefully plant a flag on that but this thing has gone just nuclear what's what's your uh cologne brand uh top shelf and so this ties back to my thesis that massive Industries are overturned like in these eras I want top shelf it's like a passion project of mine but I want to build a Creed for jenzy you know Creed like fragrance and um it it presents the opportunity to do that so the way that cologne like I don't know much about Cologne uh but it seems like it's kind of luxury sold through retail traditionally super high margin like crazy margins basically you know water and a little bit of essential oil or whatever and so how do you sell that how do you make a popular how did how did you make a popular colone brand and can you say like Revenue wise what that's going to do this year we've been doing we've been doing close to a million bucks a month so it's been it's been but it's it's a unique challenge for me that I like this ties back to I mean seriously everyone in this world if you're venturing into it pick something you like and see some area of disruption and make stuff for yourself like that that's really what I see and as I've gravitated more towards you know we talked about offline but I like high fashion I like design and so this seems like the perfect segue for me to go from consumable to something that can play in that world right fashion culture yeah exactly exactly and so like like cre is relevant at like these big um fragrance houses are relevant in in Paris and stuff like that and so for me it's been a I know it's luxury because I've have never heard of what you're saying must must be good have you seen Creed or no the you probably see like Creed aventus it's like a you know popular fragrance that sells for $250 a bottle and so when I'm seeing that I'm going I can there's a lot of let's walk through it so you're like all right I want to go into cologne mhm you get it made how where'd you go to make it so I I had to hire a he's like he calls himself a professional nose you know and has been like designing fragrances for God knows how long and so I'm learning just Google this guy or how'd you find him um relationship through our other business partner he had done skincare before and this guy was like a known guy in the industry charges an arm in a leg made one good product don't think I like it right so I'm like how can we build this out internally and and I've learned more about the industry like what you know what smells actually fascinating like like how it makes people feel what's fascinating about it just all the different you know mechanisms and mixes and like like you go to abomi you know exactly what it smells like it's like it can be a signature of branding it can be a signature of a of a person you know like it's probably like the least used sense in marketing so th% but do you think about like a a fresh pair of Nikes like that that's intentional new car smell new car smell and and and uh so it's just been a fun Avenue to learn more and I'm far from a expert in it just to be honest like we have the one product we're moving well with and then we're trying to build out wait so tell me so you say you went to the nose nose makes something for you that's what you use or you say you didn't like it so he he actually made us eight different samples we we chose the one he wanted to use we blow it up we did 700 Grand our first month it just gets murdered with bad reviews people hate it like hate it and so now all of a sudden I got all you liked it or no no okay you yourself were like one star yeah and and I'm kind of I didn't hate it I didn't hate it but I wasn't like oh I would I would wear this and um and and at the time with genius I was really big on making products for yourself and like being all in on that and then we have all these things going nuclear and so I'm like money right where's the money $90 I'm trying to make something for myself but this time it's money instead of a product and uh and honestly that blew up in my face a little bit and so we revamped on the the second one and had a you know it's it's a winner and like it was very methodical and so that's the one doing like a million bucks a month um but before he made a million a month it must have made a dollar so how did it what did you do initially to get that to work so you go to the creators that was the nice part the the first fragrance we got the Playbook like the angles that worked and so good marketing bad product yeah and so what was the angles that work give us an example for that that's another one it's it's huge in this this gen Z era and I I don't like saying gen Z actually it's Tik Tok person and and male there's a billion users on there right so it it's it's a disservice to the app to say it's just gen Z although that's where a lot of these ideas percolate from but like the self-improvement and dating and all these little boxes that this generation's trying to check are hyper relevant to smell like like that's a thing in their world like how do you smell around the girl you're trying to to talk to very easy fear yeah what's the name of your thing it's like her loss her loss uhhuh where did that come from that's genius it's actually I went through this whole like Drake era on my personal brand and he has an album called her loss it's like don't reinvent the wheel they succeeded what would be like a killer hook to sell that cologne on they do actual skits so actually actually one that that worked really well was we had female creators do it and they started calling it like [ __ ] magnet juice if you got to believe that my boyfriend came home and this or whatever you know and um really high converting stuff there's a story so I just did a podcast with this guy Craig Clemens do you know Craig so he monster he told the story of like OG marketing that's super relevant for this so I'm going to retell it his episode's going to come out too but he talks about like one of the greatest headlines he's ever read in marketing he goes he goes got four for you and the first one he told was he talked about this headline he goes here's the story this guy's a famous marketer he's one of the best he's known as one of the best marketers on Earth and this Hollywood actor hits him up and he says my wife wants to launch her own perfume brand will you come and help us with the marketing of it so he goes he meets the wife wife says I want to do this he goes say no more I'll make this happen and he goes and he starts studying fragrances and he goes to a mall and you know the guys at the mall who are like you know they had like a make your own fragrance thing like you know you have all these oils you can mix your own and he just asked the guy he goes what's the number one fragrance that women love and he goes oh sir easy China musk and he goes China musk and he goes yes China musk smells that smells good so he takes it and this is like you know he's only a couple weeks in but he doesn't go back to the Hollywood wife uh he sits on it he's like I need to make her wait for her to Value this I need to make it feel more important so after 3 months he comes back to her he goes I'd like to meet you I have something for you she goes okay what you got he goes I've traveled the world I've tested you know thousands of things I've studied I've talked to everybody and I found it I found the greatest fragments uh for you she smells a China musk she's like this is perfect in the meantime he goes to um a jeweler and he goes I need you to make me the fanciest bottle you can come up with for this thing it's like this like whatever diamond shape or whatever and so he comes up with this beautiful bottle he's got China musk and then he tells her we're going to do a launch and she goes yeah we could do it at this like small place and he goes no no no we need to do it somewhere bigger um how about the the Crown Plaza Hotel and she's like that's huge like we would need thous you know few thousand people to show up he goes that's my job so she she baks the bet she books the hotel and she's like you better not embarrass me so he goes home he's like I got to figure out a way to get thousands of people to come to this Grand launch and he goes home and he writes this headline that says wife a famous Hollywood star swears under oath that her new perfume does not contain illegal sexual stimulants and he goes she is and then the sub the sub is he's like um to prove its safety and that it is not what people are claiming she is doing a live testing where she will prove without a shadow of a doubt um that this uh that this fragrance works and is safe um at the Crown Plaza Hotel on this date and and like 10,000 people show up to this thing it's like pack he cut he hires like armed security guards to walk in with handcuffs to a briefcase that contains the perfume so people see them walking in they're like holy [ __ ] what is this thing that's being presented in this way and there's this whole story and it ends up becoming this bestseller and he's like that headline but he's like you know he broke down the elements he's like wife of Hollywood star curiosity gap which which Hollywood star um swears under oath right that's kind of like the conspiracy y the seriousness the drama the stakes of the situation and then doesn't contain sexual stimulant so like how good is it people think it's it's it's so good it should be illegal and you know evil Goods or the stuff you're talking about with like your your cologne it like hits those same notes now that was back in the I don't know like the 70s or something like that it's a long time ago but same Playbook just redone today in 2025 and then Craig took it and put in Facebook ads and I'm taking it and putting quick quick side note too for anyone I know there's like a vast internet world of gurus and people that talk about stuff and if a guru or like talking head in the marketing space doesn't know Craig they're they're not really like tapped in on simple test yeah like actually like simple very like anyone that like I don't know Craig personally I don't know if he knows me but I know that operation is run like [ __ ] Skunk Works and like he he has popularized a lot of things like actually that framework has been seen on a Facebook ad from him that his name's not you know that he's you don't you don't know him exactly he's a mad man um what else could you show me so give me a couple other stories that you think are are pretty badass that we should know about the stuff that's working on Tik Tok underbrush gum is another example of really startup Scrappy entrepreneur that's doing Millions a month now who makes this gum himself and they they built their own Factory and he's had a crazy rush over the last month but uh like like Brands will go like this and then down and you got to find the new angles right like this that Trump video I just showed you will work for a month and then it'll go away underbrush just hit a huge one this last month playing into Tik tok's going away my small family business is going to get crushed and it was the founder doing like some ASMR video of like how he's making it right while talking about that yeah well no and then he just gave that out and then the Army picked it up and all put their own play on it got so it was the same angle over and over again with different voices and some claiming it's their business but that that did Millions for him over the the last like 30 days can I put you on the spot yeah let's do a little magic trick so let's brainstorm live yeah $100 million Tik Tok brand yep so where do we start I'm I'll be your your wingman I'll be your brainstorming partner let's go right into gen Z and this younger generation that there's so much change like if we've talked about looks maxing right where like explain what that is so looks maxing it's a it's interesting to say the least but there's this subset of like young men that are hyperfocus on looks almost to the point of like it being super feminine but like they're optimizing it yeah exactly and it's like they their again their hearts in a good place most things can be boiled down to basic human desires of like they want to reproduce right but but how they're going about it is all of a sudden like have you seen those funny videos on morning routines now it's almost like Patrick baitman esque but it's just like so elaborate you me trim each like that that's so but there's a market there there's not enough products there like the um so it's kind of like a community it sounds silly right when you say it sounds superficial but you know how different is that than you know maybe the bodybuilding movement in the early days it's like these guys who take it really seriously and they're counting the Reps and the sets and they're figuring out you know um what type of training is going to lead to like you know this muscle right back here the lower head of the tricep and it's to anyone else it sounds like Overkill but they got into it they got passionate about it and they wanted to like what if we took this to the nth degree Brian Johnson doing that with longevity right now yeah it sounds crazy it's easy to make fun of him but he's he's like I'm going to take it to the full Mani Y and there's people who like rallied behind that and they think that that's cool and you're saying look maxing is this early wave where people are doing that they're they're taking guys taking their looks as seriously as women take their looks yep because there's we all know women have this huge you know like tutorials on eyelash extensions and every little you know nook and cranny now you're saying guys are doing it's happening exactly for guys and there's no it's an underserved Market you've seen products like there's a product called jar size have you seen that oh jar size like your your jawline yeah exactly that's like the one of the core foundations of looks maxing and so that product blew up right it's like a jaw exercising literally just you just you just bite it each day does it work does it not I don't know but then you know kids are right me and so you're just studying culture it seems like you're just watching and I want to point out one thing which is I had a really early friend in silica Valley teach me this I never forgot it he was the first product manager at Twitter and if you remember Twitter at the time was really like made fun of when it came out because it was you would text a phone number there was no app you just text a phone number whatever you wanted and anybody who was subscribed to your phone number would get a message that says like Sean's eating just it would just say I'm eating a ham sandwich and so it got made fun of if you go look up old Tech crunch articles people make fun of it it's this like frivolous stupid thing but not but it it turns out you know now it's like the beacon of free speech like that's what happens in the world right and so at the time I go why'd you take the job at Twitter did it you know like did it seem like the next big thing he goes no but he goes I had figured out that anytime there's a phenomenon of behavior that you see as weird you don't even understand why they're doing it but they are in Deni undeniably they are doing it you should lean in as an investor or like a like an entrepreneur that's your signal to lean in whereas most people use that same signal and they they point they laugh or they push away yep and it gets it gets harder the older you get but but staying tapped in on that and and not being oblivious to like the change in the future like cuz I was my dad with Instagram like what a stupid platform people posting pictures and now everyone knows you have to have a an Instagram and so that's happening again and yeah I think it's great advice like U we were hang out with Mr Beast last week and he has this thing he says which is you're crazy until you're successful then you're a genius Y and he goes I've been doing the same thing the whole time you know I used to sit in my bedroom and make ridiculous videos at the time I had no money so his ridiculous videos back then or me counting to 100,000 and it's like a 19-hour video or something or him taking a plastic knife and cutting through a plastic table uh with Just Like a Knife and he's like it was just a stunt now it's like taking a bulldozer and cutting through the Eiffel Tower right like he just scaled it up but he's like at that time I was seeing as stupid and crazy why are you wasting all your time on this YouTube thing go to school get a degree get a good job and now I'm this you know I used to be weird now they call me passionate I used to be you know I used to be kind of like you know uh crazy now I'm obsessed and he's like it's he's like I didn't change the whole time and so kind of what you're saying is you see the culture doing something that seems novel seems new Instinct as somebody who's a little bit older is that's stupid that's stupid this and now you're like get curious instead be be my advice is be an observer not a consumer on all of these platforms and so observe what's actually happening like hold your opinion to yourself just be super matter of fact back and observe CU if if looks maxing views are going up month over month that just is I don't really care what your opinion on it is like that just is that's that's that's fact right and work backwards from that but so so Lix maxing I mean with that all of a sudden it's literally this is how broad it becomes just like when pet supplements became a thing on Amazon it's a category that becomes potential billions overnight with nothing in it and so men like who makes men skincare products well like two or three brands that aren't even focused on it and so I mean right there you can build a anything so you would be like look maxing Trend go and then you would brainstorm maybe like skin care Mastic Gum like jawline stuff yeah I like to look at exploding topics and I like to still look at Amazon data like there's different tools you can use and and you'll see searches for those things and do you get afraid oh somebody's already doing this or whatever no it's like more validation of the idea and then you're going to try to out you know out horsepower them on the marketing and then you come up with the hooks so like what would be like an example of a hook for let's say let's just go looks maxing now what's what's an example of the product it would be like a a gum or like a jaw thing or you think skincare which one would you go into let's just say a gum because what consumable novel repeat buys probably relatively straightforward to do okay and now you have a gum great we got our product you want to name it it's part of our improv here ooh Chad CPT yeah well would you prompt cuz you use AI for a lot ofu a ton I I actually do and that's yeah let's do it let's let's go on yeah uh it's it's actually gotten so so good do you think the jaw angle is the trick with the gum or would it be breath or would it what what do you think it would be it would be jaw you you'd call them feminine in some capacity for not having a a strong I like how your brain went there like I have this phrase that I say which is the only positioning is counter positioning yeah like a lot of people just want to say they're position oh we're healthy we're good for you we don't and it's like everybody is saying those same things so you got to be counter you got to have something you're is the enemy or you got to call you know diagnose a problem and then sell the solution so the only positioning is counter positioning so what you're saying is if you're not working on your jaw you probably have a feminine jaw exactly and if you can live with that if you can sleep at night with that that's not you okay yeah okay so I start by asking Chad gbt like do you understand looks maxing yes it's about small natural tweaks the goal is to maximize aesthetic appeal emphasis on facial Harry Symmetry and overall attractiveness um I'm creating a product for a jawline jawline enhancement gum some every day and I like I like dual meanings and stuff too I love when names have like you know like I like double on tandas I like I like stuff like that so that that's where I would probably go with this I would say uh that would consume every day I'm looking for a clever powerful name that has you know dual meaning chisel so chisel's a a nice I feel like that's a nice name is that it gave you yeah chisel's the first one uh masticate is chewing but also sounds intense and Chad chew these are all great names you know aesthetic I like chisel though chisel's good yeah chisel is my favorite so far all right so we got chisel gum Y and now you got to come up with how we're going to Market this so you're going to go to your creator Army you tell them what you want them to do you just let them go let them go and this has been part of respecting the future but understanding that I'm not the person in that anymore letting go yeah exactly and so let's pretend we're those creators we're not so we're like we're going to be you know white belts at this whereas there's there's black belts but like I see videos trending on Tik Tok all the time about transformation so it's like weight loss whatever and so you could almost make it where you're not talking about a gum obviously it's like you know somebody being like my you know they use the trending music that people are usingg influencer and they would put him up there and they would like highlight the different things on the facial Symmetry and this and that and then like look at his job line right why this you're saying why this person is attracted the human mind is attracted to symmetry the golden ratio stuff like that you you would use like oh I'm kind of teaching you a science about why or or you could even do like why guys don't think this guy is attractive but girls do yep and you're like oh okay what's the difference there or you could do a transformation and be like I did five things I took creatine I did this yep the third thing is I started chewing this gum daily honestly I I didn't believe it but look at this boom boom and you're like it's available on Amazon back to my story about like you know my transformation it be a video like that yep that was one of the first ones that blew up on evil Goods was was literally that this girl had like hormonal acne and it was like the it was the three things that helped with that and she showed a before picture and after and that was part of it and it just went nuclear all right so we got our our our our hooks there um we got our brand chisel so what was the other one you said you're like basically we can fund a startup right now we can find an operator it's a request for operator yes luxury pet is screaming at me like Louis Vuitton is doing full popups of $500 dog bowls and it just shows again it's like luxury is such an interesting world right because it's just like signaling and status and what are people willing to pay there's no luxury Pet Brands yet dude you hit it again where my initial reaction is oh my God that's so stupid what a waste how I can't believe people are doing this but you're saying people are doing this period Vuitton that's the important partou Vu valid this is stupid it's the the second part of the sentence people are doing this that's a fact Jack you can't deny that well I've just seen so I had this idea probably like 18 months ago when I was just hearing what people spend on their pets like it's actually insane from a like even the pet supplements you know it's like they're paying more for pet supplements than human supplements and so I'm like okay there's something here I wonder if you could ever do anything luxury and then Louis Vuitton rolls out literally like you know it's like lovers like pet lovers and they're doing $500 dog blls and you know $300 you know high-end leather collars I'm just like oh validated right and how many do you have to sell in that area too to to have a successful business you know yeah yeah yeah would you so my initial hesitation would have been can you build luxury on Tik Tok like isn't Tik Tok kind of the like you know it's more like a Walmart than it is like a luxury but maybe I'm wrong maybe it's just there's a billion people on it and so you can't generalize like that that and that's why I love that's why I said let's not do a disservice to the app and the and the platform they built that's why I did on Amazon with genius genius is a is a very high-end supplement brand like we were selling um you know I me we had we had $130 product that was by all intensive purposes like luxury and like oh that would never work on Amazon it's a discount site and and Tik Tok has a lot of those components in it now too but again you tie back to a billion people and you tie back to I my cologne's $90 so it's that that's not that's not cheap right it's not a $30 cologne $30 Colones out sell us but I only need to sell one of those for every three and um and it's done well so I I think it's it's there and how would you if you did this luxury thing like what what would you do to make it to build the brand because I think you study High fashion you study like kind of the the cool stuff in culture what would you do if you were Translating that to the Tik Tok world what would you do for for luxury pet brand do you know Renee Gerard like Peter teal yeah like mic Theory mhm I love that and so I explain the simple explanation of that I mean people don't know what they want so they want what others want and so from our perspective as brand owners influencing influencers and finding you know those names I think the most straightforward way to run this one is is find one of these streamers or you know if I could get a clip of Drake using my cologne and then give it to the Creator Army we would do millions of dollars and I think you can do that imp where I don't know if Kim Kardashian has a freaking poodle or whatever do but but not even that you don't even need that big of name just someone in that space and then you feed it to the Army and I think that's the most straightforward thing and I think it would go overnight yeah I almost wonder if you could even just use the outrage um so like yeah of the cost of it of the cost of think I can't believe people are doing this this is the craziest thing I've seen celebrities are doing this it it makes me sick whatever and some people in the like it'll get to so many people and most of the comments will be negative about the idea but it's just going to get so much reach that some people are going to either just it'll plant the seed that this exists y that I'm not doing it that other people are doing it that hey maybe I would do that I do love my pet yep or even like you could even play into Louis Vuitton doing it like with the you know there's I think there's a lot of different ways to approach it and I just like those areas where there's there's that much margin to play there's just more and and again it ties back to like human nature we we exist in a culture in a world where we've created so much abundance like bottom line like like we we could afford things like Universal basic income and we're automating the hell out of everything and anything and everything is is freaking possible and so with that mind there's really no shortage like you see some of the services that exists for billionaires like it is just the most absurd hyper but it exists and the people providing those do well it's not like a hormos thing he says sell I want to sell to people with more money or whatever yeah yeah something like that one of his genius Insight sell to the people with money but there is a there is a like a actual like business framework here which is if you take what the rich have but you find a way to democratize it you can build a huge business so Uber is a classic example of this rich people had private drivers where you know when they're done with when they're done with the meeting they send a text done driver pulls up they get in they get out they don't have to go worry about parking and gas some there's a guy who does that Uber democratized that private driver experience and it literally that was their homepage was a private driver for every everyone um and so like that became that was the start of uber black cars um you know even airbnbs what is Airbnb it's having a vacation home y being able to go and stay in a home in you know Tahoe or in all these different places Airbnb became a thing that rich people have vacation homes in different cities but now everybody gets access to that in a in a in a different way Marquee Jets was private private flight so instead of buying a private jet you know $50 million $100 million you would instead uh buy a fractional share and get to ride certain hours and there was a huge Market of people that wanted to do that even jsx now probably to some extent jsx is exactly like that so so you know that's a b if you can find a way to drop the cost and you know even du a lingo like we have rich people who will hire a mandarin tutor for their for their kid but then if you have an app that can teach your kid you know a foreign language in a in a way it's doing the same thing and so I think that's um that is just generally a business model what what are the mistakes people make so like if somebody was to go into this what are the common Pitfall someone could fall into that you could just like save super top of the funnel here how they treat those Affiliates it's very culture-based it's I've seen Brands there's so much money being made right now brand owners need to be super generous because you know a Market's a market and right now people are paying you talked about the goalie challenge yeah explain this because that was in an old episode so explain what they were doing this brand comes in and and in an effort to get as many creators as possible put together all these prizes with like the number number one if you did a million dollars in sales for them in a month I believe they'd give you a condo in Brickle or the cash equivalent which was like 600 Grand or something like that like Lamborghini was the next one it was like this like rewards to your list Rolexes left and right and you're selling goalie gummies like they just make these like apple CER vinegar gummies basically which also was a health kind of like a holistic health Wellness things apple cider vinegar has benefits in your gut and whatever maybe maybe yeah that well that at the time was the the Nar the Creator said so yeah this 22-year-old who's trying trying to win a condo told me that that's how this the world works oh man do you believe any advertising at this point no once you've seen how the sausage is made you're like there's a reason I hate supplements too you I'm not launching new supplements I mean there's some good stuff out there but overall when you really peel back all the like really like a decent amount of Health advice online nowadays is coming from 18year olds making conspiracy videos yeah that's pretty wild it's just reality so a brand like goalie comes in though and they they set the stage for how creators are being treated and obviously they have a lot of money and they're they're trying to mess the game up for everyone else right they can afford that maybe lose some money but then if you're this startup brand owner and you're coming in and you're no man I don't want to give you 25% commission I'm going to give you 20 and and and that that can be super off-putting and so in this current ERA I would say and even the culture from like like the group we own part of it's like abundance it's like put it out there it's going to come back and I think as an owner of a brand like bringing that not you know accepting that we are a different generation and not not infringing on them I think that's the best thing you can do right all right what give me your like just summarize if I if I tuned out and I just need to hear one thing to summarize what your thoughts are on this kind of Tik Tok opportunity give me a little summary and I want to ask you about some other stuff millions are being printed on Tik Tok shop like what are you doing just starting Brands and and trying to get as many I'm trying to perfect short form content and short form content distribution like period from a from a brand why do you believe so much in short form content because it's it's it's changing the world in front of our eyes like like it it's from personalities we know to songs we know like it's so like music even we're hearing songs that are blowing up from this world and and that's just it's the future D we have this friend Connor price have you seen what he does on Tik Tok wait who is he again he's he's rapper white guy rapper yes yes yes yes yes yes he he used to work in Ramon's Warehouse like moving boxes no [ __ ] and he was like and then during covid Warehouse shuts down he goes home his wife's like you should put your music out there let's do something we're just sitting at home um and he was really shy about it and she's like you got to start making content he puts out a YouTube video and it gets like you know 11 views like most YouTube videos do and then she had this genius she's like she's the real Mastermind behind it because she was like let's make a Tik Tok and he was like he had the same reaction Tik Tok that's stupid that's that's not serious like I'm I'm an artist I'm musician I'm not just one of these kids dancing yeah and what he did was he started making these videos we'll put one on the the screen here so people can watch it but he created a little skit so his instead of just saying what I would have done like a boomer is I would have been like hey guys I got a new song here or I would just make a video of like playing the song yeah and guess what happens when you when you're scrolling through Tik Tok you're swiping every 3 seconds and a song starts to play that you've never heard before you just keep swiping like it doesn't grab you right away yeah so instead he started doing these funny skits where he would he was three characters almost like an Ed Murphy movie he would open the door like every SK starts him opening the door and there's uh that's the rapper coming into the studio he's got the guy with the headphones on that's him him as the producer and then they have the weird brother and the weird brother is kind of the key to make the whole thing work so he would walk in and he'd be like he has one where he's taking a carrot and he's drilling holes in a carrot and you're like and it's like the sound of a drill it's the carrots visually weird and they're both like like he's being weird again and then he's like let's get down to work um you want to play that song and then the then you hear this flute playing and they both look at the brother and he's playing the carrot flute but it's the beat of the song like it just they he overlaid it that way as if that was the beat and the producer's like Go With It Go with it and then he starts rapping and then then the song hits and the song is almost the punchline of the skit yep and dude he became like independently no record label billion streams on Spotify doing no marketing on Spotify only on Tik Tok off that if I want to summarize all of this it it almost seems dark for a second but like one of my favorite you know quotes is you know if you tell a lie enough times it becomes truth and that was obviously War propaganda back in the day but you take that idea and then you just think purely in terms of views and more specifically cost of acquisition of views so you have like a um you know if you're a tobacco company whenever and you're getting doctors to promote it like you have the money to get the views and the and and control the narrative right and the more you can do that like it's usually a pay-to-play game except in these windows when all a sudden an Andrew tapate burst on the scene doesn't matter what he's saying is real or not he's getting seen a billion times a month and so all of a sudden that become there's some narrative there being formed that he has serious impact on and these Gold Rush windows are when there's the ability for normal people without you know multinational level marketing budgets to form a mainstream narrative or get a billion views on a Spotify and you know become something because of these windows we couldn't have done that he couldn't have done that without Tik Tok like he just the old Instagram you wouldn't have gone viral on there's no means of connecting yes this amazing circle like 12 years ago Instagram comes out and imagine if you were like what are you doing all day today day it's like oh I'm filming myself I'm making I'm cooking at home and taking pictures of it or making videos of it like you're a weirdo dud get a job you doing so you go from weirdo wasting his time but you were early on the platform to now let's say you wanted to go become a food Creator it's like dude it's too saturated man it's it's impossible to win it's like but now everybody's accepted that influencers are a thing and that they have they they can they can move product they can they can become rich they can become famous doing this and what you're saying is kind of like on Tik Tok it's the same model but instead of you becoming a famous Creator it's your product can become famous by putting it in the hands of talented people who are going to make all kinds of videos taking literally like a thousand shots on goal a month and if they get the right story or the right premise and they keep innovating on that your product gets famous that way yep whereas dude you weren't going to be able to walk into Walmart or Target and get on the Shelf yep you're not even going to be able to really go on to Amazon and just rank number one in these categories cuz they're so competitive right you're not going to become a influential influential Creator on Instagram it's harder this is where the Green Field is my my dad called me an idiot when I was pouring into Amazon like actually like you know like like question my sanity as like a as a human right like it was like a crazy experience now hind side it's like God thank God $30 million later yeah thank God I didn't listen to my parents you know and and it's just it's just weird that's why I admire guys elon's a good example I think when you look through things look at things from like a very groundup perspective and don't take the the common there's so much Arbitrage everywhere because humans are narrative machines and we live off that so it's like common knowledge becomes whatever and and yet technology is reshaping everything and that that's why I just want to keep leaning into that and being I think more people that aren't afraid to just send it with like that in mind in some capacity the more it gives others the confidence to to stand up on their own right and and do their own thing you know right I like that you said send it you have this phrase I like so we talk about looks maxing you have said this phrase before life maxing yeah and I kind of like the philosophy but I don't really fully know it because you know we've only hung out in group settings a bunch of times what is the life maxing philosophy is this something that you think more people should be kind of taken as a mantra yeah I I think I think so I think there's a lot of exential dread in today's world and there's also a lot of us trying to ascribe even among successful people you mean especially among suc uccessful people especially among successful people and it manifests in all all sorts of weird ways you know look at Brian Johnson um I'm kidding crazy take but love you Brian no he's awesome he really is he really is and I I think he's a good example of someone that that's all in on life maxing because everyone my thing is we have this he took it literally he did yeah lifespan maxing lifeam maing but we have this blank you know uh scorecard right and and we have this finite time here on the earth and I think the more you can fill it up with things that you thoroughly enjoy and then kind of like maxing out those stats so to speak we're capable of so much and instead we fall into this like oh I'm only going to chase money or oh I'm only going to do this where living a well-rounded life what's the difference between just being well-rounded and life maxing are they the same thing with just a cool name or is there a difference Pro I I I don't see many people it ties back to that full sending it thing I don't see many people that are really like yo I'm living for this like what was your your shower thoughts this morning my my shower thought was I realized that the the the optimal way in terms of uh how the optimal mindset for me is to be ignorant of the past realistic about the present and delusional about the future yeah too many people are living in their past or they vacation there all the time just going to visit and they tell themselves it's for all kinds of reasons maybe it's therapies tell them to go think about their childhood maybe it's they're saying I'm going to go learn lessons reality is the more you live in your past the less happy you are yeah um you want to be delusional about the future why not why be realistic about the future because you can be only when you're a little bit delusional about the future do you actually like kind of blow your own mind you get you get to do more than what you thought was reasonable but then you got to be realistic about the present if you're just delusional about the present you're like I am the best dad but you're not then you go nowhere right oh I'm already Uber duuber successful like bro your bank accounts you know three digits right now it's like you got to be realistic but just say like all right that's where I am but it's not where I'm always going to be forget the pass it don't matter if I failed 10 times like most the most successful people when you talk to them they're like yeah 10 years you grinded if you ask them be like what was that like what were you doing it's almost hard for them to even remember yeah and it's not because it was so long ago it's cuz there's actually like a a useful part of your brain that just blocks it out like it's like my wife she did like natural delivery of birth like three times and if I ask her about it it's like her body has like a mechanism that's like you never forgot that you need to I never forgot I'm traumatized I'm like how could you do this to me D she like what you talking I'm with you I'm fainting right and and she's and she's like forgot about it she's like only remembers the good it's like wow your brain gave you a survival mechanism that was actually really good for you that you don't remember how bad it was how hard it was and I think ignorant of the past realistic about the present delusional about the future I think that's a good motto to live by so I take that there's two things I'm obsessed with this idea of character design and that that's what I'm living real time I think we have the ability when you zoom out long enough to create literally whatever type of thing you want to be like you can you can truly design that and so you have that and then you have another idea I'm obsessed with which is bezos's 80-year Regret minimization framework where he wants to like that view of his deathbed you know how he wants his few regrets as possible and so when you work through those two Avenues you can quite literally like do anything so explain the character design because I've heard the regret minimization which is basically like if I'm dying I want to have the least regrets possible so therefore today which dis if I have a fork in the road yeah you know do the one that will lead to the least regrets when I'm 80 when I'm 90 when I'm 100 that comes back to to your piece be relatively delusional about the future while being very aware of where you're at today while pretty much disregarding everything right and so like I look at like like this is music I've been working on right and I remember going to uh a show in Puerto Rico John Summit and I was like you know in the booth right next to the DJ thing and just watching him command that crowd and the energy and like the impact and I was like you know if I'm 80 years old and I didn't at least try to send it in this space I'll regret it and and then I start thinking through the character lens of what does an artist look like and what is this like things I have in me so I'm not like completely disconnected from reality but now taking all of the hey this is a business hey now the product's music hey this is streaming hey you know marketing and and that's that's where I'm at with it one of the things that you're reminding me of when you're talking about let's say the music production or getting people to remember is you were talking about whether it's marketing or music or if you have something good to say you almost owe it to yourself it's like do you believe in the thing you made the thing you have to say because people are very bashful about marketing they're bashful about putting it out there I know this I would write things I wouldn't even send it to my own friends and family I wouldn't post on social media I wouldn't promote my product I just kind of wanted it to be organic and I when I look back at that I'm like damn I did myself a disservice like did I think the thing I did was good or not if I think it was good then I owe it to that to do marketing just to send it to fully send it send it and you know when you uh when you talk about storytelling music you got to study the art of how do you get your your stuff out there it's a phenomenal skill it it's like a crazy crazy like that's the vehicle you put the package in the trunk but you need the vehicle that's going to actually get it out there to the masses it's crazy dude we're going to watch this video this this YouTube video right now you just said it yourself what you said in this video will make people millions of dollars if they all they did was just try to act on it give it two years try to act on it you will become a millionaire if you just follow what you just said and if I go look at the YouTube video stats the retention chart is going to look like just a downhill slope most people are going to click off within 30 seconds and then by the end of this there's only going to be you know 25% of people are still watching this at the end that means 75% of people clicked on this because they wanted something out of their life and then are not going to even stick with it enough to watch the video yep but that's just the laws of nature that but with that in mind I think this last chunk of the video where we're talking about these stories and the ability like the model is becoming less important the more I understand people and and and tapping into to whatever that innate thing in all of us is is way more important and I want to bring that out of more people CU I've been through like a ton of stuff in a in a short period of time and I think the more I can bring that forward the more General impact there'll be there there's one of my other favorite internet Clips you know for for the Elon musks and like what Brett Hancock do you have him on or like yeah sorry there's those Minds that are just like obviously incredible in their own space but then there's that Elon interview and it's like El you inspire everyone in this room who inspires you it's like Kanye West of course you know it's just he said it it's hilarious and it's it's it's that's the opposite side of that like yeah okay Kanye is nuts in every way but just that ability and desire to create and stand up for new things and and like have that confidence in yourself regardless what people say is nothing short of not only incredible but necessary for for people I love the sended attitude I mean I want to make merch with the send it thing and also I think you you made me realize there's probably the way I used to think about it which is well-rounded um you know Mike poser came on the podcast famous musician he wrote like took a pill and all those songs first song went viral and he tells the story he's like first song went viral I'm like of course that's what I do you know like uh I guess that's what I do I put out a song I go triple platinum and then the second song Went double Platinum then single Platinum then no platinum and and then he was on the Shelf the record label was like it's not even worth paying to produce your music because we don't think it'll sell but also you can't go do something else you're under contract so he was like dude I'm [ __ ] out of luck he like went back to school and started learning how to sing better he's like dud I was work on my craft and then he came back and now he's had he's like had this Resurgence but he talked about he goes I had to look at my life and realize yes I was Uber duuber successful in my career but I was a desert Wasteland in relationships and health and whatever he's like that I realized was just not success for me and so I was inspired by that and I started thinking yeah you do want it to be well-rounded you want to be the you want to be the dad the husband you also want to be having fun you also want to be you know being creative and making cool [ __ ] and being successful making money but the well-rounded thing is more like a check the box it's like am I doing you know a sufficient amount of X Y and Z whereas life maxing is saying what would it look look like if I really sent it in terms of my fitness like yeah I'm going to work out anyways but like I know you you do tie right you're like I'm going to out for an hour anyways what could I do that makes me like what what would be full send on this workout dramatically better that that's the great example it's like two years ago I couldn't fight at all and now I feel pretty comfortable like in there with with a lot of people right that aren't named Jon Jones you know um but but just taking things seriously and really put that notch on your belt it's like now music or even like learning Spanish is one that I'm like going to do and I'm going to take it very seriously and it's not going to be I'm half learning Spanish I'm going to be fluent in you know do you do these one at a time or how do you how do you like how do you not stretch yourself that's what I'm discovering it's like like how much and I like that healthy balance of pushing yourself to we're capable of so much more than we give ourselves credit for I've already I've already seen that but there is some line and so I don't have a good answer for that but that's I'm trying to also be an open book and show it all real time like I want you to look back at my fighting clips from two years ago and I want you know to meet like all of it I want to be an open story that that is Ono and constantly iterating so this year I um Jesse hler came on the podcast he gave this idea of a misogi he's like oh this's this Japanese tradition and the way kind of the American translation or the way he translated the Japanese idea is um one Grand Challenge a year but specifically like do something so Grand that it changes you yeah that it changes you so then it's like so he for him it was like he ran this 100 mile race like and he every year he picks a different one one year was write a book uh another year was so he's done this for like 15 years or so and I was like damn I never really do something like that right like I have like New Year's resolutions things I want to improve about myself but I never really like put out the Mogi the Grand Challenge for the year and so I made one I was like all right I want to and I like that it's one because I was like oh I want to do this and this and this and all that was going to do was guarantee none of them happen y so all right what's the one for this year and I was like I would love to be I was like I want to have more fun in my life I have fun playing basketball I have fun doing the podcast I have fun you know in business my kids where can I where can I dial up fun and I was like I want to be able to jam out with music CU music is like its own little like magic potion music makes you feel good in 13 seconds I can play a song and change your mood in 13 seconds there's not much I can say to you that's going to do that like to change your mood for the better um and so I was like all right I want to be able to jam out on a on a piano but then I was like all right what's the life maxing version of this so I was like all right not only am I going to learn to not only just going to learn piano like I'm going to get good I'm going to be able to jam out to any song I want on the piano that's going to be my mission two what if I could also teach my daughter she's five I was like what if she could do it with me now I'm getting dad points while I'm getting piano points at the same time finding those synergies to weave it all together like oh it's integration I'm not choosing family or my piano hobby is both so she comes with me to every single lesson she begs me to do piano now every night I'm like okay that's cool then I was like all right what would be like the max out the full send version of this if I really was to send it what would I do and at first I was like what would I make a song would I form at a theater and I felt like that's kind of playing somebody else's game so I think a key part is like pick what's real for you uh don't just like take somebody else's scorecard and be like that's now how I'm going to judge myself so I had this idea from my cousin of um go play go play a recital at an old folks home okay I was like oh that' be just like more fun like that would just be more fun for me more meaningful for me versus like post it online and get a bunch of views or perform it in front of other people it's like dude go to this place where I've been to a bunch of like senior centers uh not a lot is happening there like I could go be there Kanye cuz there's nobody else there ab and for me that would be meaningful like I made other people's day brighter if I did that um so I was like to me that was a real Learning lesson of like how to choose these side quests how to choose these misogi these these one-year challenges in a way that I'm going to use now going forward absolutely I think you hit the nail on the head with being hyper individualized like my my life maxing scorecard is not is not yours and it shouldn't be we're all drawn to different things and and I think keeping it individual is important while keeping that like my main framework is like don't let anyone else dictate it for you or don't let anyone tells tell you what you can't be or can't do right what's your what's yours like what do you what is that scorecard look like for you so I'm like moti starting to take like a a back burner thing I'm putting you know being a dad at the the top of that which has been so that that's like reshuffling everything because I'm learning what it means to be present at as an individual and that means like you know we Less phone which inherently means like it starts to crumble some of the other pieces but the beautiful part of this is when you put your priorities in in place things start to handle themselves like then all of a sudden you start thinking smarter just naturally like okay like that still has to get done so I have to trust you know my team for that and this and that so that that's at the top of it um the the the music is the second second piece and then still the other uh you know it's like I'm taking content as one of these these things now like just from uh storytelling like some of the stuff I'm going to do on YouTube I think is going to is going to well let's talk about content real quick cuz when I first met you um through a mutual friend you showed up and you had this like again you always have a different like crazy outfit on and somebody was like oh you got to check out his Instagram and I go and I was like bro like I was having a great conversation with you and then I went to your inam I was like I would never talk to this guy your brand name was like the genius SE o every video was like Dan Bilzerian meets like inst meets like uh drop shipper like it was like oh man this guy's selling courses and every video was like over the top he's talking about how you can make millions instantly it was a get-rich quick Vibes but I met you I was like dude you you yeah and you and you were like I'm like you're like it's an experiment like I'm being intention I'm intentionally turning that knob up that way because I want to see what happens and you were into that at the time I think now you're you're making a shift but like can you just describe what what you did there because I almost once I met you and I was like oh that's he created a character so my my I like that that's actually respectable in a way I I'm huge like one of my core things is obviously intense ownership of like oneself and one of my problems after I sold that business with genius I had my first daughter I was really frustrated with the world like I just was and it started to become like a cope and like a you know other people have weird ways of ducking ownership and responsibility and like disconect connecting from their own unhappiness and I remember just thinking like I don't like where the world's headed and so I could sit there and keep crying about it or I could try to have some influence or some dent on it and that's what kind of Drew me to intentional social media I had tried to do like this cool Health content like like I I was doing not not full Brian Johnson but like Dave asprey level stuff like seven eight years ago like hyperbaric chamber red light and like literally nobody cared like just nobody cared and now in hindsight the nice guy was finishing last yeah and in hindsight it was CU I didn't know how to make the content yet right but I saw this like clear formula of oh my God if I post a car like I am actually rich I still a business and if you post a car or watch or whatever people respond and so as that started to work I started doubling down on those those things and um it wasn't until like you kind of got to play the game to change the game a little bit it was is was my opinion and um that's when you met me kind of in that wave where like pseudo relevant even if maybe not in the right right lens but until you have learned those skills and learned to kind of you know develop a platform then then literally nobody cares like nice guy does finished last and so I guess that's just been my personal Evolution like it's been fun because I I got I'll be the first to say I got way too far in that stuff like I got lost in it like that actually does happen Ben your your partner um flagged that for me like seven or eight months ago in a really casual Ben way but like Ben's non-confrontational what did he say to you it it was just something along the lines of like well if you if you do that stuff enough don't you start to kind of Believe it or or become it and that stuck with me and like I don't think he knows that stuck with me I don't know if he remembers he said that but there were a lot of little things like that that prompted me to go like an actor you stay in character because you're doing it for the role but then at some point it's method acting yeah you lose yourself in the you get lost in the S and actually that happened to me and and unfortunately like a lot of the things I was leaning into do make you like cool whatever so now there's this this audience that looks up to you in a very specific light so you have two choices you keep down the same path or you say whoops you know like this is what I actually am and so I feel like I've separated a lot of the negative Parts while like I love fashion I love design like I I genuinely do I think it's individualism I think there's like you know um can we do the fashion uh okay so so here's me I have Nike shoes is it should have been just New Balance to go full dad mode I'm wearing sweatpants and a plain black shirt those Kobe though the no these are not kobies these are $90 Nikes I just like this color of green so let's go head to toe teach me what you what you got on San Francisco this is and I love it I got matching Socks today that's only because I knew I had to step my game up for you normally it'd be mismatch socks it'd be more sweat jeans these are Lulu at least and then like this this might be my daughter's but I was like oh hold on he's going to have hella accessories let me come strong with the with accessories than usually so start with the wrist how much do you think this is you start with the wrist is that like part of the fashion build around this talk about Louis Vuitton uh that looks it looks fancy to me all right my honest guess would have been that that's a $20,000 watch there's a a Vintage Oakley from like the 90s and it was like $3,500 okay so so I don't believe that like expense and cost like I have some expensive stuff but I think like it's way cooler to put together like unique kind of stuff this shirt is uh this this gentleman the Brand's erl I can't pronounce his name but he's like the head photographer for Vogue and like he did all Kendrick Lamar stuff and again not super expensive but like very on the come up the jeans were from Kanye's like this is probably like it's not cheap like probably three 300 bucks or something but not mind-blowing um Kanye's free Larry Hoover tour with with Drake these were probably like 150 bucks like bucks not expensive Louis Vuitton boots which were expensive they're $2500 I love what Fel is one of my business Idols I think there's a huge gap between um like Artistry culture and actual business frell has that quote it's uh creativity without business is victimization and Business Without creativity is just dumb and I think he stepping into the head of Louis Vuitton like a brand I would typically never wear or care about is the perfect example of those two things merging creativity with meaningful Enterprise Bernardo knows top three richest people because of that all right I got a little bit I got a little bit cooler I don't think I could pull it off you pull off but maybe I don't know you got to give me like the uh the dad baby steps version of these I'm goingon to start just I'm gonna start at the wrist take a take a simple and then we'll go from there actually I should just show up for um we should have done a thing where it's like I don't know if you've seen Rick Glassman he does these interviews where he does a podcast but he'll go and then it'll cut and they'll switch outfits it's so funny when they do [ __ ] like that but we'll just pretend I did that that's awesome Rob thanks for coming on man you uh every should find you rob the bank which is one of the greatest handles of all time thank you for that well you were already saying it I didn't come up with it but I was like dude that should be your handle like that should be your brand what is this the genius CEO no no no you should be rob the bank and and just wait full disclaimer before we you know my last company was the genius brand so I didn't just you know it just looked bad it looked bad but no thank you for having me seriously like this means the world I really appreciate it awesome thanks for doing it [Music]

and they said well you should couldn't confuse revenue for Success so I said well you guys shouldn't confuse a lack of revenue for Success either and then they got like kind of upset dud this meeting it goes in like the Silicon Valley autistic Hall of [Music] Fame what's up we got our friend siki here founder of Runway back in the day built a company sold it to Zinga built another company sold it to postmate has gone viral many times and there's a lot of people in Silicon Valley who you almost it's like a film director it's like oh they're working on a new project you really want to know what they're doing that's you uh because you do things with taste so excited to have you here do you uh do you have any good stories from early days of Zinga because you sold a company to Zinga back when Zinga was the [ __ ] did you work with Mark pinkis what's he like give me a good Zinga story uh okay I have a great story actually how I came to rerto Mark pink is actually a s a great story I like so many good March stories so yeah Zing about my second my first company and I joined as retro produ own Studio wait can you give the background of Mark so he Mark's like a Silicon Valley OG I did he help uh fund Facebook to get off the ground was that his first big hit he did so um he and Reed Hoffman co-owned bought the uh Six Degrees of Separation patent from a company of six degrees and he Angel invested in Facebook and but also licensed to patent I believe for more stock into Facebook that patent was basically the kind of the social networking patent right like how how we're we're connected Six Degrees of of Kevin Bacon away from each other and I think Reed the sto some there's some story where Reed and him realized that if this patent got in the hands of Microsoft or some big company that they would be able to squish Innovation by a startup by like holding this patent over their head so they bought the patent I believe and just decided we're not going to use it to stop anybody and then they I think parlayed it into to getting extra shares in Facebook amazing I think that's what happened yeah um so when I joined I was a director of products and my girlfriend La wife who I recently met moved to China for some job work thing and I was like three months into Zinga and I was like I'm not really feeling it's not not fun so I told them I was going to resign and move to China and they said hey why don't we just give you this new job um you know you can report to Eric shyi one of the co-founders and basically be head of product for the company I said that sounds fun that sounds great so so I did that so I reported Eric Sher he was a co-founder Zinga and what happened is a month into the job Eric Sher stopped showing up to work like wouldn't R the emails wouldn't go to work and I was like what and basically that's when I reported to Mark and I was the head of products uh and later the the the punchline of the story is what I the reason why he sto show him the work is I later found out that he decided to become a ninja pretty good reason this not what I thought was coming he L literally he was like he wanted to start a ninja dojo and he wanted to GGO ninja training and so when I what in the Napoleon Dynamite is the story how's his ninja career now uh I think he started another um uh social games company all right so I have this notebook here and the reason I have here is I take notes whenever we have a guest not because it's my job and I'm a podcast host but because a lot of times what the guests are talking about it's just so interesting to me as a human I just want to go and like implement it in my business for my life and the person I took the most notes for was Jesse ller if you haven't heard that podcast it's the best like it legitimately changed my life and so I thought let's share our notes and so with the help of the team at HubSpot we went and took all of the notes from that episode and we turned it into a 10 page document you can download it for free it changed my life that episode I think it might change your so check it out the link is below in the description again notes with Jesse ller down below so at the time what was zingga like was it like on top was it king of the world at the time or was it on the down yeah I mean what's interesting about Zinga is they hired a bunch of people who are used to be investment makers to be product managers there um because it was just all about the numbers going up it was highly an analytical so I went in and just the amount of like knowledge they had about about growth one of the things that really blew my mind I think about a lot is when I first had a convers with Mark pinkis uh early on I think maybe during the acquisition I asked him hey what do you think about this like industry it just seems really low Mo it's it's hard to have a competitive mode here because it's just so easy to enter you build a new game and for it to expand and how defensible is it and I think about his answer quite a bit because his I like no this is great I wonder to be more new Ines into the space because it's free R&D for me and I just like okay that is that blows my mind that is next level because he was just so confident in his ability to execute that like anyone who's going to come in with some new idea they can just like Fast follow it and do a much better job of growing it which is like what they did right Farm was in the first farm game poker was the first poker game um and that they work really really well at least during a Facebook era wait did he have like Gas khanan Energy where he was like he is he conquer yeah he did he did I me you know we were working like 80 90 100 hours a week asinga and uh that was kind of the norm it sort of seems like a waste of talent though to have that Cocker energy and do it in the lamest way possible you know yeah like far bille like that's what he's like trying to do this on like a few billion dollars a few billion dollars there's a um there's a quote by Max Levon at the time Max Levon who created PayPal is by all accounts like a genius computer engineer single-handedly was like fighting fraud at PayPal and and like with as a oneman army like with stod you know the attacks of all of these sort of financial scammers around the world the guy's brilliant and then his next startup I think was slide and it was making like widgets for Myspace in Facebook where you'd be like slides shows or super poke where you throw like chickens at your friends when you wake up uh you know by pushing a button and it it just slaps a friend with a chicken or something like that and they go what what was your take away from slide slide ultimately didn't fully work out sold to Google I think for a little bit but he goes be really careful what you choose to work on because everything can be optimized endlessly so he's like once we got in that we could just sit there and optimize and just get the number of chicken slap per day up um so you know Choose Wisely what should should I be optimizing this chicken slapping or should I be doing something else and I've always thought about that because I found myself falling into the same trap no matter what I'm doing if I'm selling little widgets my life Bec comes about selling widgets and I can optimize that to infinity and people do if you go look at how any company works that's what they've done they've optimized it to Infinity dude when my wife worked at Facebook years and years ago I remember like I was talking to all of her co-workers at a party and I was like oh you guys are amazing you guys are so smart what are you working on and they explained it to me but it boiled down to they are trying to convince Brazilians to put more stickers on their photos like the there was like one dog that had a long tongue do you guys remember that [ __ ] dog like they were trying to convince that [ __ ] dog sticker to put or Brazilian like the face it was like the face filter thing when Snapchat came out and then if you opened up your mouth a giant tongue would come out dude I felt like and they explained that to like I kind of B I was like wait so you TR you're just trying to get like Brazilians to use more stickers because they share more photos I felt like a cartoon it was like l i was like what like you know what I mean I was like what are you guys doing I Al have a Max lein and slide story uh this goes back 17 years so I don't think it'll mind anymore but um when I this is when I first moved to the city and I had this app on Facebook is blowing up and so some guy who worked with Kei R boy Kei R boy was I think the CEO of SL of the time said hey we like your app you want to meet you know the team I said oh my God this is amazing I mean you're out of college give be Max lechin um so I go in we had a meeting at noon and I would go to the SL office and no one was there everyone was out for lunch and I talked to receptionists I said I'm here to meet Max and Keith They i d lunch uh they'll be back in half an hour I said okay so he slipped there for half an hour and then they walk in and they act like they kind of forgot there was a meeting um but we go to meeting room and we should start talking about what I wanted to do with this app build whether I wanted to build a independently or maybe like join slide and they asked me how much I wanted for it I said well I have a co-founder so $2 million I would probably do it a million dollars each I kind of laugh at the number I'm like what like I looked uh the valuation app data and like the amount money we're generating not a huge ass but it's fine it's too much um my friend heel built super pooke which I recently bought and they said verbatim you know we bought super pooke and he's easily the 18th or 19th most important person in the company now out of a company of like 60 people uh I said okay that's a compelling offer and then I said uh and I said yeah this is probably not gonna happen and I said you know we're profitable we're making a bunch of money from ads so it's cool if you don't want to buy it and they said uh you should couldn't confuse revenue for success and at this point I was just like really upset so I said well you guys shouldn't confuse a lack of revenue for Success either and then they got like kind of upset so then so then they got really weird um oh I forgot to mention like at the start of the meeting they said something like hey you know there's a recession coming up to each other and they're like yeah there's recession Comey out and then he said I can't wait to buy all these shitty companies for cheap like I we're in the room like what what the hell dude this meeting it goes in like the Silicon Valley autistic Hall of Fame and then at the end Kei was like Hey Kei hey Max what was your body fat percentage in the when in the PayPal days and Max was like 8% and it's like yeah and I'm like look I'm not the fittest person but I'm not selling you my company because he like you're fitter than me like what what's happening so that was like meeting with them but the thing that made it all make sense made sense is the next week I was talking to my one of my friends John who also is had a company building house and he Co comes up to me at some party he goes Seiki man like you won't believe this so I just had a meeting with slide last week I'm like really he's like yeah it was so weird because they started a meeting talking about how there's a recession coming up and thinking all these cies are cheap I was like oh my God is a script uh it was in episode one of this podcast I think um my buddy suly told almost the same story he goes he gets invited to slide he says and what they said was they were like you should uh we want to hire you and he's like I don't really want a job like I have my app's good I thought you wanted to like maybe buy it or something and then he opened the door and he goes you see all those guys out there they they're going to build your app in like six days if you don't take this offer and he was like okay I'm not interested in this even more now I'm like this is horrible my app is stupid what he said he he goes his app at the time was called like superlatives it was like you would name your friend like most likely to you know go to jail or something he's like you're threatening me that you're going to take my app I think my app is stupid the fact that you think my app is cool makes me think you're stupid that's what he thought in his head uh siki who did you meet I love talking to PE uh to people who have been around a bunch of these folks before they kind of quote made it who is a tycoon or a big shot now that you're shocked by because of when you knew them when you guys were both younger you uh you're like oh I can't believe they they actually developed into so such an amazing uh business person I I I don't don't know that I met a lot of people who weren't great than I think great that were huge later um who who's someone you met that wasn't huge then but you knew and why did you know oh yeah I mean Drew H you know drop 10 people it was 2000 late 2007 early 2008 and we were just talking about growth so like they they had this like college referral plan um so Drew hon I mean Anish who's General per Andre like he was a just a Founder building ass on mobile phones right and he would come to my office and we talk about it oh probably the best one is Chris wroth who's that he's co-founder C ghub and he was a contractor at po set which was like this job I took when I first moved to the city but he was actually contractor for my first company serious business he I have him build this translation layer between Facebook markup language and my Stace markup language just captor and he was really good at it um and I distinctly remember that we were at 21st Amendment um yeah or or actually the bearer a brewery doesn't matter but um I gave him a full-time employe playment offer uh in early 2008 and he was considering it and the same night he when we're talking about he said you know dhh just put rails on GitHub and so I think I'm might work on get H fulltime and I was thinking in my head and I was like the smart thing for me to do is actually shut down my basb G business and go work for you but I didn't say that but I was thinking have did have you had any massive um uh Angel investment wins because you're around the hoop for so long and so and early yeah I mean the best I mean the best one by far is amplitude um and that one was I was introduced through um actually yes someone of Zinga uh Matt AKO who runs data Collective Now and he introduced me a very first angel of bestan after I sold to Zinga uh and that like 10x in like 12 months and so I was playing with play money up after that and he introduced to this team that we ended up being the fourth customer of for analytics platform it's now amplitude and we used it we thought this is great this is the best thing we thought we've seen since The Zing internal tools and I managed to get into the SE round and that IPO that you know we ended up being a 400x uh return on that which is pretty great let's jump in with ideas opportunities you're an idea guy what do you think are some cool ideas or opportunities that that you would want to be working on right now um so I built a zap here and it's basically categorizes my emails with gbd4 into different labels so I have this very long front in automation um and I also use a prodal sbox uh which also does something similar to filters by emails but there's been no good version of email manager software that I'm able to customize the prompt and train it so I want to say hey here's the things related to my kids and there's no keywords necessarly you can you have to kind of read it it's like some email to my bitter or or an email from the school and if it's related to my kids I want you to put in this folder and the idea is I want to inbox for like these different contexts um and so people are doing different kinds of email categorization what's missing is there's no way to train it so I think building some way for you to for a product to understand all the concept about your life and organize your stuff starting with inbox will be really handy for me um and I've seen at least 12 companies do this and no one has done a really great job of it I just tested this product have you guys heard of this um I can't think of the name right now um but it was this thing where I it it sounds insane where it recorded my screen for weeks at a time and it would see how I'm typing what I'm saying to people and it would give me feedback on the productivity of my day and how I can approve it have you guys seen this it started with an R I think is it called uh or something isn't it uh resue no Sean you're right started the guy who started like a like a he's like a guy he's like been around uh he was doing like a pendant or something right at one point and then now it's a oh rewind then rewind yeah yeah yeah yeah rewind. a is that it yeah they stopped working on it now it's called Limitless and is working on the pendant now yes I was tinkering with rewind and the promise it it's not there yet but the promise of this is is was amazing I like I was like so into this um and it's kind of describing what you're what you're just explaining because we're having to use zapier and open AI or chbt to like kind of duct tape this all together their premise was amazing and that is exactly what I'm looking for I got a third one which is like a lot spicier but but you know like this is not a venture bable thing but you know just character Ai and chai and all these like chat Bots that really people are using for um sexy chats I think like someone could and these things print money by the way like they immediately generate millions of dollars a month uh I thought if if I were just in it just to like print money the thing I would make is something that is kind of like tender but basically everything is AI generated so it's not like oh you're creating a robot but it's a fake dating app where everyone is attractive and is super interor and then you can like then then you can go off of your Tinder app and go on Instagram and have an Instagram account on actual Instagram is it's owned by the the the the person that you met on your fake tender app siki do you know who Ty Lopez is he's like the guy who had the infomercial that was like here in my garage I do know Ty who who he is yeah so Ty uh one accus he came on MFM years ago and an accusation that I learned about him based off of the comments on YouTube is that years and years before he was whatever he was famous for he owned dating apps and the acquisation accusation was that all of the users were completely fake and that it was guys in the Philippines like running it and uh doing exactly what you're describing that's true of the majority updating apps what do you mean that's just like standard offer procedure like Plenty of Fish you know like uh a a a seeking Arrangement like that is their business model um they're like and in fact outour men acting as women yeah there's also like the webcam industry like like they up until open AI the companies with the most advanced AI technology is going to be one of these companies because they are better at creating chat Bots than anyone they have the most advanced technology I'm not I'm not kidding like I know people who work there or run it uh they've just developed better chat B technology anyone and that' be so funny if that's where AGI starts actually it's not open AI it's none of these Labs it's like whatever some of these like web webcam sites develop that's not that's not a crazy idea I mean it isn't that how it typically has been where a lot of like the vice Industries are the ones pushing the pushing the envelope yeah yeah it's they transformative for only fans right like I don't know if you've read but like there's you know you're a big influencer on only fans and you have an army of a 100 people who are like typers or Chatters right fun is they're not just Chatters that are flirting they're also basically salesmen so what they're doing is they're chatting to try to upsell you into get buy this video buy this photo I don't know exactly buy the subscription whatever the the thing is but they're they're not just customer support they're actually sales but they need to come across like they're the original person um which is just hilarious what do you think that office environment is like uh so I actually I know someone who works in um that and it's just normal it is like the most boring cubicle normal office environment You' ever seen that's almost better it was weird the uh the other thing with the dating apps I think that they did was I remember seeing the study about match.com because if you were a guy on match.com you would basically send out you know 30 messages and you'd get you know one back or whatever and what they would do is they realize that a lot of guys accounts would go inactive because they're not getting replies and so what they would do is is they would basically send they would show an active person 30 inactive profiles knowing that that inactive person is not there to reply but that that will be the notification for that person to come back and reactivate their subscription they have to pay to go read their inbox and to be able to reply and so the it's almost intentionally a horrible experience for the person who's there trying to find somebody in order to reactivate all the churned members and they would do they would basically in a the first 100 matches they would show you you know something like 50 60 70% of those matches were all just inactive people they wanted you to send a notification to to make them come back D sounds like a Zinga train PM dude I went to the Zinga office once back in the like Heyday it was the craziest office I've ever seen Sam did you ever go to this thing yes uh it was right it was like it shared a building or was next door to Airbnb and it had a huge bulldog in the front right and I think at one point I think I think they owned the building and I think the building was worth at one point more than the company like you know hundreds millions of dollars why what what what did you think of the office Sean well you would go in there's a giant tunnel like a LED tunnel you would walk through just to enter and then when you're there first of all there was dogs everywhere and it was like everybody it was bring your dog to work there was just like herds of dogs running around it was insane and we met the chef and the chef like the food operation was more sophisticated just the cafeteria was more sophisticated than any company i' ever I'd ever been a part of like just the food part was better than my actual company so like they had a staff of 60 people on The Culinary team they had a roof on the top where they were growing all the vegetables he had like a giant fridge that was like the size of like a swimming pool you'd walk in and there was cows hanging upside down CU they had their own butcher process they they didn't serve soda they only brewed their own sodas like everything was Soup To Nuts custom and like like just so insanely sophisticated for a cafeteria program I was like man if the food is like like this I don't even want to know what the actual you know like teams that do the work art and I walked into one PM thing and it was like a stock market dude his screen had so many metrics fine-tuned in real time where they were running so many tests at a time and it was like you said SEI like it looked to me from the outside like you know the most data driven operation I had ever really seen you know I knew about what we did but what we did looked like you know caveman compared to what what they were doing in terms of sophistication of data the the the food thing reminds me like I was the person who did aition for us to serve real bacon and after a few months we finally started sering real bacon because we never had real bacon it was only turkey bacon because you know Mark Pinkus didn't like to kill pigs but yeah like one of the things that people did at uh zinga in the product org is we had pm on call and I've never seen this on any other oration the PM on call for every game would daily send an analysis of what changed day over day and so if there's a drop then you would segment it and so oh my God there's like anous like 50% drop uh in Mexico uh for Farmville and we are not sure why because usually on Wednesdays at 2 it shouldn't be like this and it last a 3 hours long and they would have to explain oh it's because the World Cup is happening what comes what what comes first we were with Mr Beast a few weeks ago and I had the same question but he wasn't able to articulate or answer it what comes first when you're that data or analytic oriented does it are you that way and scale comes because of that or uh are you can you only behave that way because you have scale so it depends an environment for if if it's a data friendly environment like Facebook is then like Facebook platform is where virality lets you grow from zero to a billion then data is all that matters um but you can see in the his in the experience of Zinga that that didn't translate to the mobile industry mobile was less about virality it was just difficult to redistribution a lot more about creativity and that's why supercell had such a create Advantage because they actually built very fun new games um so I think it's completely depend environment if it's hard to get early distribution then scale makes it makes data more important but if it's quite difficult to get early distribution then you want to be creative Innovative and brand and creativity matters a lot more do you remember any uh like random game change like color red to blue or flashing lights or whatever that just generated like $10 million overnight I I always remember thinking that like the best way to generate $30 million overnight it's just to like say hey you it's going to take you $10 just to unlock the game today like we could just like make a and people pay one of the more interesting ideas is this idea of crew so we had this idea of collecting materials and you ASP materials uh one of the mechanics that we invented at Zinga is this idea of crew where you for whatever thing you want to unlock you have to get at least like 20 people to help you unique people uh because what that did is what we saw in the data is that when you do materials you ask same two people over and over again but if we have a unique spread then that increases its distribution and that end up being like a pretty large boost in Theus um another thing that we saw is like just the power segmentation and so there was this one day where our our numbers went down anonymously and I had to figure out what is it like this Channel or that channel transad was a one particular typo bug in the Dr rate of this particular treasure that was creating a lot of opportunities for people to share and so you just spend all day doing things like that uh and so it's rarely something like huge but it's all all the details added together that makes a difference isn't it what were the other uh business ideas or opportunities that you think are exciting right now yeah I mean I was I actually uh asked Sam mman to make this but uh I don't know how long they're going to take but um I'm doing a lot of medical research what what did you say sam to make this product he's saying Oh I thought I thought you were like oh say may make a list for you to talk about I was like no oh no no we're not that tight uh but no um I was doing a bunch of medical research and uh I noticed that you can't access um pay walled articles and so I really wish someone would make a version of Deep research that lets you enter my your your pay wall credentials so you get full T access uh and this goes further I think there's just so much data behind uh off walls pay walls that you can't get to and you can only search on open web and the more private data you can get access to the more useful these ages become so that's like probably number one thing I've been thinking about what's the name of the company uh that starts with an R it's based in England Sean we've talked to him about him a bunch it's like an acronym anyway it's a uh an academic publishing company in England and it's like really controversial because I think it has like the second highest profit margin of all publicly traded companies the World Behind public storage and the shtick behind it and why everyone hates it is because researchers at universities don't get paid anything for this in fact oftentimes they have to pay tuition in order to even go to these places but they take your research and they put it behind like a $30,000 a year pay wall uh and so it's a very frustrating industry yeah it's the that's the whole industry right elier I think is the biggest one and there's a bunch of controversy around that and yeah all of these are extremely our merging businesses they charge an arm in laay for access the researchers get paid nothing the peer reviewers get paid nothing all they're doing is just like taking the test and copy and paste it and putting somewhere and maybe like printing it into a journal um so so how would this work you're talking about like you told Sam Alman to say hey can I just give chat GPT my credentials and then it can go log in for me and use that information when I ask it questions so that's would have to do it how could a founder what how would a Founder get around that or how would they do this yeah I mean you would need access to 03 the full model first because that's what open research is based on but I mean it's not terribly difficult to create something like a deep research um there was a company called there is a company called Jens spark so I'm friends with the founder Jens spark he used to a VPS search at BYU which is the Google of China and they made a version of Deep research just using a different model and so that's relatively easy to build I think the storage of the credentials and logging in is a little bit more tricky right it also just seems like somebody could just create like science pal or something like that it's like specifically for researchers and it's a chat GPT like interface but it's specifically trained on or going to access all of the journals all of the all of the academic research out there for you um and just do like a vertical thing isn't there like a Google for doctors that's like this like lumos or something like that it is so there's uh so I'm deep in this space there's a company called elicit there's company called uh SI space and what they allow you to do is they let you search abstracts were available and also you can upload individual PDFs too which also chat GP allows you to do but there's nothing I seen that is lets you this indexes the full text of all these journals uh with your credentials and why are you so interested in why what's all this research for is it for uh I I is it your daughter and if it is what's the story behind that yeah so my daughter was diagnosed with the rare of rain tumer last September um and we've been doing everything we can to find new treatments for this because it's so rare and you really get uh deep insight into the sentence and the structure of the of the medical uh community and one of the big learnings is that what is available as standard of care meaning that's what's available if you go to a hospital or you talk to a doctor and what is available at the frontier there's a huge gap already um and then further when you have a rare disease just amount of research and data and treatments available is also just fit because you need to have like enough critical mass for for the research to be worth it so they can recoup the uh research costs and the other interesting thing that we've learned is that uh the IP issues are really weird so for example there's this uh drug that is FDA approved nonprescription that's been out since the 70s to treat ped worms and over the past 20 years there's a huge amount of compelling data this might be a pretty good treatment for different kinds of cancer and there's been no clinical trials for it because there's no money for it because you can't patent a pin drug um and so all the money hundreds of millions billions of dollars are going to new molecules are pedable even if things are already available and so once again into you this you're like wow this is super super broken um and so yeah I'm doing a lot of primary research in order to find repurpose all draws that might already exist that could treat a stly r bra tumor it's you know uh there's um obviously this is super serious and I'm sorry you're going through everything uh but also there's like an interesting like um there's like an like like an interesting like logistical thing of like wait so you are able just to just research potential cures or or or ways to help your daughter on your own and come up with a solution I mean is that like what you hope the outcome like yeah I mean so there's I'm not the first uh founder type who been in the situation right so the co-founder of Clubhouse Rohan his daughter has a red diseased her name is Lydia and he runs the lydian foundation and he's going so far as manufacturing his own drugs right for very rare diseases you can do a lot um there's other people that have done similar things like end of one cures exist and so you can go this is what I mean like if you're sufficiently motivated and there's no one more motivated than a dad with a sick kid uh you could do you can go so much further than what is available standard a standard of care and so even the last time we met with our uh Primary Care team they were proposing like two particular paths one involving like pretty aggressive surgery and radiation another involving this like drug I propose a third path and they were discussing it and this is like neurosurgeons and clinicians they came back a week later it's like actually your path things were sets and the reason I was able to do that is like because this disease is so rare I am like more knowledge about disease than anyone in the room because they have to like study 50 different cancers yeah right wow that's that's pretty incredible also my experience has been that the doctors once you get off of the kind of standard of care and this is maybe I'm I'm projecting just from like you know I just had a knee injury and I was asking the doctor I was like Hey like would PRP or stem cells like is there anything is should I take what's a peptide can I put a peptide in there and he's like you know there's not a lot of evidence you know that's not part of the protocol we don't have great evidence and he was sort of like my hands are tied he's an orthopedic surgeon he's just like you know my hands are I can only recommend what I can recommend you could do those things H I don't know and so then I felt like you know I'm on my own here have you once you do this path are you just outside of the medical system basically are you outside of your standard chain of of command with your doctors and you have to get your own system set up that's great question and I've had an almost similar conversation in the last me I was just describing and so I saw it play out in real time so the neurosurgeon said hey when we this operation we did it for this reason do it for some other reason is not part of standard care but our primary clinician she is like she runs he's a principal investigator of one of the clinical trials uh the only one of two that treats his disease and she was like yeah you're right we don't have a lot of evidence because there hasn't been a lot of research into the tumor and so sometimes you have to argue for first principles and if it's a fairly rare disease they're more open to being more creative and in our case our clinician was able to convince the neurosurgeon this was the right path or at least it's worth trying and she told us she was excited to have a partner who seems well informed is willing to think outside of the box and I straight up said I do not care what the standard of care is I think the standard of care is crap and she basically said yeah I think so too I just can't say that right dude and pretty cool that that you're in San Francisco too where hopefully you think that like uh the open-mindedness or the early adopter mindset like even uh trickles out to like the doctors and things like that uh that's pretty cool that you're around a Doctor Who's like willing to try some crazy stuff or what seem crazy to a lot of people so to answer Sean's question like if you do find your own drug you do have to like show enough research and be well informed enough that someone is willing to prescribe it off label on a compassionate use basis and so you just need to convince a do a one doctor and so if you can't find one you can find others who's willing to do that and then you're in you're in the clear and it's a lot easier if it's like a fairly serious rare disease can you tell the story about you tweeted out about your daughter's condition and then this crazy crypto turn of events happened where someone created a coin and then Millions maybe tens of millions I don't even know how much money was raised and then people got mad at you people were speculating on this thing I don't even understand it can you explain what was going on on and also just explain is this just was there just degenerate gambling or did you maybe stumble upon a novel way that people might fund research in the future I don't know which one of the two it is yeah I think I have a better idea which one it is after some reflection on it so okay so explain what happen Bally yeah uh Christmas uh I was going to Japan uh to ski with some friends and the family and I was on a flight and I had a plan to start a gof for this lab uh the h lab in the University of Colorado so we were donating money to to them once this happened because they're the only lab in North America that researches this particular tumor called the crano foma and the treatment that were on they found so I thought okay for Christmas I thought it'd be great to do a GoFundMe use my network and raise some money for this lap uh so I tweeted This Thread with this GoFundMe link and that we ended up rais about4 million to lab which is like I think the biggest donation up to that point uh but what happened is some people started asking about hey can I donate crypto and so I said okay uh I I posted my ens right my um ethereum name system address and people started donating a little bit of e and then some other people said hey do you have a soul address cuz it we're on salana and I didn't have a soul address I was aware what salana is but I never touched it and so the next day once I landed I created my first salana wallet I created his address and I tweeted out and basically by the way are you big in the crypto World why were all the crypto guys doing this for you just because what's the motivation other than so I I it didn't occur to me I thought it was people I had like 77,000 followers at a time uh and I'm not big in a crypto world I've like been on and off active in crypto to miss 2017 but never in a major way um I I I'm not a crypto account that people follow uh but I found out why people did this uh later um and this answers the question of Sean like is this gambling or is this something else uh but anyway I posted a soulle address and basically an hour later I looked at my wallet and the wallet at $400,000 and it was zero an hour before uh so I'm looking on like what is going on and it turns out so someone created a coin called pump on pump. fund which is a platform where you can create a coin in literally like 30 seconds and I was on right and have an active in crypto this wasn't a thing fory a new token on ethereum was like a whole process now they short 30 seconds pump. fun is that pump. fun yeah it's CRA have you seen this business by the way no that like these guys made like $500 million of profit last year like more than that I think more than that yeah and and and so you click a button and you make your own coin and obviously in the name there's no hiding that the point of this is that it's a pump scheme pump and D scheme right they made $500 million at least at least a loty specifically this is like the majority of the traffic on salana and so people are basically uh trading these new coins and trading them trying to ride it and it's basically uh musical shares right have you guys gone to this website it's crazy it looks like a geoc City website like there's like flashing banners this is insane it's all real time like yesterday during the Super Bowl uh somebody created inste for for Dave pner instead of jail stoil and jail stool ran up to like $100 million or something like that but like he said it's it's musical chair so you're buying trying to catch one of these thousand X waves but it's going to dump and you just got to know when you're going to get off the train and then if you wait too long or you're the one who comes in late you lose so it is a it's like being at a roulette table or whatever where you're you're just throwing chips at the table trying to trying to hit oh my God yeah it's like the Trump coin except you can create it in like 10 seconds 30 seconds but anyway that's why people uh created this coin is because you were looking for these new narratives to gamble on right and the more interesting the more viral seeming new narrative is the more valuable becomes if you're in art early it could really pump so anyway it was $400,000 and I tweeted a screenshot there there's a whole tweet sort of thread where I was like what is going on and I kept on adding this to the Tweet thread with screenshots on my wallet and so it was $400,000 I was like what is happening and people were trying to explain someone for to this coin called Meera and there's a billion tokens and they sent me someone bought half the supply and just sent it to my wallet so I had 500 million tokens and once I tweeted then I check again and it's now $4 million and I'm like what uh and an hour later it's eight a couple hours later it became 15 and a one point was $20 million just like the same day and I got and the market cap of the whole thing that means was 80 million uh correct okay no no I think Peak market cap was around $60 million okay and you had 40 million of it yeah because I I sold 10% immediately just to like capture something and I sold a bit more in the liquidity pool so you know I got around a million dollars out uh but I still owned 30% of it and immediately I was I said okay I don't know what I'm gonna do with it but every dollar in my wallet is going to charity this is nonprofit it's not for me not just charity going to the research lab resarch researching the potential C to your daughter's thing okay correct so um I I said hey I'm not going to move anything without 24 hours notice um I'm going to try to like be very transparent about this and I thought about it and I said I'm G to start selling $1,000 every 10 minutes until like we're done because I just don't have time to run a crypto project and you know like I want everyone to know where this is going so that happened and the price started going down but once we get to got to a million uh what happened in between is because it was such a big story um a bunch of rare disease organization started reaching out to me and they're like wow this happened to you can we how do we get out get in on this because they're on the phone they're like did you say pump. fun okay uhhuh average budget annual budget for one of these organizations is like $100,000 $150,000 just like not a whole lot of money this is like more money than the community's ever seen it's a lot of excitement there so I thought well I was siging some crypto friends and I thought okay how do we make this like a thing and maybe we can make this more sustainable long lasting and this idea turning Mira into a Launchpad for other rear disease tokens where Mir is a liquidity pair token uh was talked about and so I thought well okay that seems interesting uh before I do that I should probably figure out how a coin works and how you launch one of these so I went on H fun and I thought okay let's find out how one of these works so I created a coin called zero and I entered a description for the coin because you could do that I said hey don't buy this coin it literally says don't buy this coin it'll never be worth anything I'm never going to do anything with it it'll be worth 0 so I press the button and what I didn't realize is because I was on ethereum for a long time but I never had a watch wallet what happened is I was in the background the most watch wallet in crypto So within about 100 to 200 seconds the market cap of this coin that I told people to not buy watch wallet does a watch wallet mean that you are someone that should be monitored because you're a potential whale yeah like people people start tracking like oh what is vitalic doing with his wallet what is what is doing with their wallet people want to copy what you're you're and they think you're the man because your wallet is old or you have a lot in it because I was for the main character of like crypto Twitter for like a few days right got it okay understood so there were copy there were Bots like just monitoring what I was doing and doing buying whatever I was buying and so they saw this new token and So within 100 200 seconds the market cap of this token was three and a half million [Laughter] dollar so I was just sitting there like panicking and I said okay I don't this is bad I don't want to have anything to do with this so I had half of the entire Supply and I sold it and that was my main mistake I should have burned it which everyone would have been happy about right but because I sold I crashed the price of this token and people got very upset because it was considered a rug so now like oh my God everyone's and and when I sold I I made like $80,000 cuz even though it's $3 and5 million in market cap there was only about $100,000 or so in liquidity um and yeah I I started a threat explaining oh my God I didn't expect this to happen I got on Spaces over video just like I'm really sorry I I I'm like still trying to figure out how this works and you know people don't did a care um and what I realized it's just a different Community than it was when was really active on Twitter 2017 like people AR on ethereum they're like very DET tech people right they're like nerdy and with a salon uh in 2024 I didn't realize like it's so much more mainstream a lot of people maybe have like $50 $100 and they're just trying to turn into $1,000 and so the amount of emotion there is like very very different crypto transitioned from neck beards to like everybody who looks like Jack Carlo in like four years the community the salana community all has like the line etched into the into like the side of their haircut or like multiple the it's very different than like the people that got me into ethereum in the first place today I learned or this month I learned so anyway the mark Out 3 and a half million before I sold it dumped at 300,000 and as I started talking about my mistake the maret cat came back and at one point it was like five and a half six million dollars uh just because I was like talking about it and people were just the more upset people word the more the coin pump the more money people made from the coin so they were trying to make it like even more dramatic um which I didn't really understand the time I just thought I messed up and people were really upset at me so anyway so then that was like the main villain turn on Twitter and everyone was super upset at me because they saw me as a scammer so I thought about what am I going to do with this so first of all like the $80,000 within a minute I I realized this is a mistake so I bought back in into the coin and I burned it all right so it already was like neutral and explained that no one cared because of the anonymity of crypto they thought I had like a hundred other wallets that was like that I pumped and dumped on a any profit there and I can't prove otherwise so I decided like this is really shitty and I don't want any part of it so what I decided to do is um I got some help uh from you know friend us or coinbase and other people who didn't want to be named um to do onch analysis so what I set on Spaces is I'm actually just going to pay everyone back the lost money on this out of my own pocket um and I have even touched a charity wallet so what we ended up doing is everyone who held in the first 200 seconds who owned any coins then up until the point 43 minutes later where the market cap fully recovered back to the same value if you sold then you realize loss I'm just going to airdrop you soul and it end up being like a $450,000 out of my own pocket uh and I just paid everyone back which has never happened on any pump fund coin before uh and maybe like 10% of the people have heard about this I I tweeted about it I had to like keep on responding because every time I tweet for the next like month someone say oh you're a scammer what are you still doing here and I had to say no I paid everyone back and they would just like not say anything right this is like uh a crypto Larry David like thing like it's like this is like you're walking through Time Square and one of those fake monks put like a bracelet on your wrist and then like it now expects you to give him like $20 it says even though we called it a free gift like this is just this is insane so how much did you end up giving to the charity yeah so between GoFundMe so it was a million dollars from crypto um and there's like I locked a bunch of the miror coin into a liquidity pool so it's sort of still perpetually generating so so you bought a million dollars of charity for $150,000 basically that's correct yeah and then we his total was like a one .4 million um we donated more uh to match like the mistake and we added a gof to it so and it' be and the lab actually like triple leveraged it up into the coin they they got hooked on pump pumped off fun would you Sean put give back to 150 like he did I wouldn't [ __ ] that um I would not have for that situation personally I get why you did it's almost just like dude this is cra all of this was unintentional uh people are really mad okay what's the sort of like how can I just like clear up any possible confusion but I don't think you needed to in this situation right you created a coin called zero that you said is don't buy this this is going to zero it's a test coin and if somebody went and randomly speculated on it using their like their sniper Bots that are trying to track your wallet you know like I wouldn't have given a [ __ ] personally but then again these this community is so like crazy that they'll just like make life hell on Twitter for like the next 5 years it might be might be worth it you know just to clear your own conscious go to sleep at night you know exactly I couldn't it was for me so I could sleep all at night because a lot of these people are fairly low income and the money is fairly meaningful it was one reason but another reason is like people just don't read like I explained this I mean the coin stes don't buy it I explained this like a couple different times and what I realized is like you just don't read on the internet and as far as anyone else knows because makes little noise like I the if you don't don't read what it sounds like is I created a scam coin using my own daughter's name to scam people out of right right right it's crazy did you um in the end of this is there anything here that's interesting for fundraising for research or this is just straight like I accidentally got into a gambling pool and kind of got some money for research but this is not a sustainable thing for anybody I'm still trying to figure it out so what I'm hoping to make NRA into is so the way this works is you're this is like sort of game theer around okay you own a bunch of this coin because this coin's narrative is attached to you right in the case of you know they Port poro is doing something similar with jail stool and in order to turn it into real world impact you have to sell there's no way around that and so when you sell then you're just like playing zero some game against the community and they're all going to be upset for you for sure no matter what um and so that's a very difficult Dynamic and I think my idea here is like the only sustainable way to do this is to lock a bunch of the token into a liquidity pool and so that when people buy in or out of it you get to exchange you get the fees and that's not really like selling into your community I think imagine a version of Dogecoin where every time someone you know it's like Dogecoin is like a couple tens of billions dollars market cap but every time someone sells or buys it it creates like up to could be hundreds of a day of fees and which you can then use to donate I think that might be relatively sustainable this is insane I don't even know what to say sounds like a great weekend uh no it was a month it was the last it was Christmas up until like maybe you know now and it ruined my vacation and it's been by far the most stressful time I've ever had in my life can we do a quick uh a quick detour we were at a dinner once and you talked about some I think it was a Stanford class you took called touchy feely or that's the code name for it I don't know and it's something about communication and relationships and I remember you said this really great thing at the dinner but this was now many years ago and I don't remember it exactly but can you say that bit again I want to hear it again and I think a lot of people might benefit from it so by the way siki how old are you uh I'm 41 I think you you look like you could be 22 or 41 I have no idea yeah Asian no raisin let's go um um yeah so I I took um actually now twice I took I took class again as we talked um this class uh that was based on the Stanford Business School class called interpersonal Dynamics which is the highly praded and most popular class in stford business school it's taught by a professor called Carol Robbins and it's generally known as T FY and it's name as for every participant at some point will like cry in the class but uh Carol Robbins is now a co-founder of a uh a group called leaders in Tech which revises the thing class for Tech leaders so one of the things that you get taught in this class is so the purpose of class is to teach you how to relate to people and build connection with other people because people work with other people and one of the most useful Frameworks I got from that class is how to think about your connection with other people and how to develop that connection and so the two Frameworks to connect is one is the two tracks of of of interpersonal communication and the five levels of it so when you're talking with anyone else um there is two tracks there's a Content track and there's a relationship track so the content track is filled with facts and a relationship track is filled with emotion and a relationship track is what uh is filled and what has to be filled for a relationship to get become closer and for trust to increase and the way you fill each of these tracks is through the five levels of communication and the idea is when you are talking to someone there's five levels at which you communicate um of increasing vulnerability and death so level one is what's called ritual and that is hey how's it going hey right where it doesn't really say anything or just it's just ritualized greeting um level two is extended ritual so that is how's the weather how is the gang right you're you're you're it's it's a longer version of hey how's it going level three is content so these are facts how's the project is it late what are we going to do uh with this particular idea level four is emotional self-disclosure so that is when you say something uh that discloses how you are feeling emotionally at the time I feel sad I feel angry and there's a lot of talk about level four because people think they're doing level four but they're not and that's a very common thing that's unique to the English language which we talk about that was a fairly interesting Insight so level five five is the deepest one and level five is mutual emotional self-disclosure and it is when you are ex uh expressing emotion that you have about the other person I feel angry at you I feel proud of you I feel disappointed by you that's the deepest level of communication you can have with another person and the content track is only filled by things from Level 1 to three and the relationship track is only filled by level four and five and we are um taught and uh we are taught to really not use level four and five in professional settings but if you want to build a relationship level four and five is kind of the only way you can do it and so a lot of the training is about breaking past the barrier the uncomfortableness of engaging level four and level five communication uh and you basically sit in a circle with 12 people for four days straight um until you like so you can observe the impact of doing level four or five and not doing level four or five and how you are able to be closer to someone or further away from someone in emotional distance has this made your running a company better I mean I would say this is the most impactful thing I've ever done in my entire life like out of any class um I always like as a Founder so much see the company in some kind of machine and I didn't find it I'm like you know mildly as fory so I found it difficult to relate to people uh but completely transformed my all my relationships including my relationship with my wife and so one of the ways this was even just last week we had an onsite and I was able to do a mini version of this with our customer sucess team we just sat or you know I did a very condensed version of this lecture and then we sat and we just talked for about four hours and the amount of closeness people God inside of evil God was transformative and you wouldn't normally you know sit around for a couple hours in a work setting talk about your feelings and it's very com uncomfortable to do so um and it's intentionally so like it's very uncomfortable for the first couple of uh in the in the case of a real life Workshop it's half a day um in the case of us we had it like sort of speedrunning and it was uncomfortable about an hour but then people uh were really into it and it's weird but everyone at some point was crying about uh some disclosure that they heard or or they've experienced and and as a result the team got so much closer and it trust increased that's wild do you so how do you do this in practice right cuz when you talk about like um you know I feel angry at you about X or I'm disappointed about y I could see myself not having the skills or finesse to be able to do that and let the end result be a positive one versus we start talking you're upset by this well the other person gets defensive or they push back back and say well you did you know blah blah blah and so can you give me an example of a conversation that you had that like maybe here's what I would love a conversation that typically would have gone like this or maybe been avoided altogether and instead here's how the actual conversation went that was useful for you as a as a you know CEO leader friend whatever husband whatever whichever example you want to choose yeah so the the first one is easy actually so in most people just don't have the conversation right so the conversation wouldn't say I'm angry you would just be angry and you wouldn't say anything right and people can tell is the thing like when when you feel a certain way about someone it it it it gets it leaks right like there's a level of even you're not intending to passive aggressive you're just kind of ignoring the person or it comes off like you're say like oh my God it's late again right right or he didn't do this and so that's the default and that's when you have this negative feedback cycle of well okay you already felt a certain way then you expressed it unknowingly and now the other person thinks you're angry at them and now they dislike you more and and then they do things that you dislike more because they dislike you more and it just gets worse that's all relationships get worse and that's like the default and so if you know that it leaks anyway then it becomes easier to say I'm going to express that and you're going to express it no matter what your choice is do you express it with words or do you express it with not words but just like passive AG behavior and so and then you combine that with everyone is entitled to know the things that they know but they're not entitled to make things up about what other people are thinking so you are entitled to seeing the same facts as everyone else see the same behavior you're not entitled to uh uh read the minds of some other person and how they're thinking how they're feeling but you're 100% entitled to share what you're feeling because those are facts to you that's reality and so the mental model isn't and this is kind of like typical because people aren't used to expressing this the mental model is like oh if I am expressing this emotion that means I'm attacking someone and that is true if you don't express an emotion and you're just acting it out but if I were to say you know when I see you do this the story I tell myself is that you don't respect me and I don't know if that's true but this is like what I'm thinking my head and because of that I feel angry and I just want you to know that because I don't I don't know if you know that you I know that you probably don't because you can't read my mind but I'm guessing you probably aren't intending to make me feel that way and I thought it would be helpful for you to share for me to share that to you so that you are aware of it um I just learned that technique and therapy last week amazing I seriously did nonviolent nonviolent communication framework right it is yeah it's it's very connected to that I literally just learned that yeah you're you're you're you're you're sharing information right so it's not an attack like if you are genuinely doing it because you understand that you can't read their mind but other person can't read your mind either and so by sharing it is you're offering them a gift of information one question see you said something about the English language making it harder what did you mean by that so what you start seeing when you're in this class with these tall people and you start realizing that oh like I really only feel closer and I get to know someone better when they say I feel emotion I feel sad I feel angry when this happened and I feel distance when they're expressing that emotion but not saying it you can tell on their faces that they're pissed off and it becomes scarier so then you start learning that oh I need to say I feel the thing about the English language is that we say I feel often without expressing any emotion at all and that's some sort of a quirk that's kind of unique to English So when you say I feel that or I feel like there it is actually grammatically impossible for the that s to be an emotion I feel that you're an [ __ ] is not an emotion I feel like this is [ __ ] is not an emotion I feel sad is an emotion I feel happy is an emotion and we're not used to saying that because the word feel is used uh is is has been you know disused misused for other purposes and so we just often is unconsciously you once you see it you can't see it people I ask people Str emotion and they say I feel like I feel that and it's never an emotion and it's very very hard to change to have it do you guys do this where like Sean in particular I'm curious if you do this but do you guys do this where you like uh you get into this type of [ __ ] whatever you want to call it the touchy Fey stuff and you're like this is the way and then like I get into it and then half the time I execute that poorly and all and then like the business sucks and I'm like I got to have more patience with this person or I got to like let them get away with [ __ ] more or whatever and then I just go right back to the total opposite end where it's like um what what what do they call this Doge where I'm like everyone has 15 minutes to fight for their job like you know like like it's like I get influenced by I either side and I but there is no middle ground and I'm kind of like you that the first sign of resistance I crumble sometimes so the but the version of it that happens for me is let's say I I hear this and I'm like ah siki just taught me something this is great two content tracks five levels I'm in I got this I'm going level five baby I don't even need one through four and then I'll go have the next conversation with my wife tonight and I'll give her like I feel that no no I feel upset and I know you didn't mean that and I tried to do the whole thing and she's like what and then she doesn't she doesn't know all of this she didn't cuz she didn't go to the seminar and she didn't have the the skills and the tools be a mad Sean shut up it's on the front of her mind and so she doesn't play back like the roleplay that I had heard was and then I'm like well I don't really know the next move okay revert revert back to my old [ __ ] self yeah I mean that's not a bad response honestly because I think I think you have to do whatever works and the reality is to get good at this you know it took me I I did this 4 Day program twice and every day was like 12 hours a day and you're were just sitting in the circle practic hours with you uh the first time she actually did to I kind of no I kind of smed her into into the the hotel room so she didn't go to the class but I will say like the second night when I went home she was like who are you cuz I was like oh my God I feel so bad I've been such an [ __ ] dude this sounds like have you guys heard of the Hoffman Institute have you heard but I haven't been yeah like I've contemplated going to it but I think they it's like uh they have a variety of locations they have one in Connecticut near me and then they have a Boston one but you go for it's like not expensive it's like $2,000 and you go for four days and you can't bring your cell phone you can't you're got to be completely disconnected or maybe it's even five days it's kind of a lot uh but they like everyone who I go who goes to it they won't tell me what happens there but they all say that it's lifechanging and they can now develop relationships and connections with other people it's one of these really strange things that I'm so tempted to do but the amount of time to be disconnected is very like nerve-wracking or or you know just like scary this sounds very similar it does it's not the time to be disconnected that's the scary part there well yeah it is dude could it might even be seven days could you go s days without a phone away from your family away from family is a little harder yeah that's hard like in a hotel like it's like crazy to be disconnected but yeah I don't want to like also I don't want to like cry with a bunch of strangers why don't I'm like I don't want to go to Tony Robins I don't want to see anyone I don't want anyone to see me dancing and singing like you know what I mean yeah what's great about leaders in Tuck is like is they're all like you know well-known ish Founders it's like not cheap to go so oh even worse be around awesome people God I want to be my my most vulnerable self around cool people no actually it's really helpful because you realize that all the people that some people that you look up to like we're kind of all the same like there's very similar insecurities whenever I hear whenever I I hear about this stuff I think of the Tony Soprano quote where he's like whatever happened to the strong silent type like Gary Cooper that's that's like I get I go all down the track and I'm like can I just say like hey chief like hi bub and just know that person only at that amount and just say yes or no yeah but then he goes and kills about a dozen people um siki you have this uh interview question that I like you said my favorite interview question after 20 years of doing interviews with people is what is your greatest strength that you are most worried about not coming across in an interview setting why that question I think uh I enjoy breaking the fourth wall and interviews tends to be so standardized or formalized that what my greatest anxiety when I'm interviewing is like I'm actually really good at a thing and you're asking me to you know you know reverse a uh a leak list or something and it's just not coming across what I find is that it breaks down this the formality and lets people gets people excited to talk about something that they're really really good at tell me great great stories um and you get it you get to know the person just a little bit better and I think the particular thing is like if you just ask what your trins it sounds really formal but what is the insecurity that you're bringing in that you're hoping to that you're worried about not coming across interview setting it changes the tone quite a bit it's a great question I'm stealing yeah that's a good one you know what's interesting is so you you're you're you founded Runway which is like uh a very serious business like you're going to have to hire Enterprise people I would imagine um Enterprise sales people uh like it's like a I'm basing like the future of my company off of some of the output that I'm going to learn from your software but you have the vibe of like an artist to me where like you you have a variety of like really intriguing projects you're like this thinker almost like a philosopher is this new to be doing like is this like a new challenge for you to be doing something so serious and regimented like and or can you still be like Goofy and an artist in this B2B world so yeah funny enough he the serious business that was the name of my first company and we built fun games I feel like if you call it serious it isn't you know yeah because we're a games company serious business fun games um but uh yeah I mean I think it's actually a pretty huge advantage particularly for these things we consider serious so I mean people have The Stereotype of business and finances being super serious and super rigid but Finance at its best is really about creating value it's without looking forward and thinking about new ideas about how we can push the business forward and grow faster and all these things and in order for us to be creative we have to be in flow and things that are fun keeps you in flow and what we actually hear from our customers that the thing that we quite often we love hearing is this software feels fun and that's not a luxury that is a fund that creates flow that creates your creativity that creates value uh and when you use something that isn't Fun something that feels slow or confusing that you're not creative uh and you're making worse decisions so I don't think they're intentional with each other I think they're quite complimentary and that is like very deeply part of our philosophy I saw have you ever seen this yes that's that's what made me think of that question what's the what's the story of this II this happened last week our marketing uh Team uh is run by Kel freeze who was a YC founder of a company called taica he was a CEO there and we also have this woman named Julie uh fritas uh who was at Shopify and uh I was in the office and I just saw them come out in a meeting kind of giggling and they got out this piece of cardboard and started like writing this I'm like what is this oh you know how like you know you you didn't want to do a billboard we decided just like create a bill for ourselves and just hold on to freeway and I'm like that is such a cracked idea of course that's going to go viral and uh I said I'll do it it's like you will I'm like yeah I I'll do it so they're like okay so we walked outside we found a freeway entrance uh and I was just holding the sign um what does it say by the way it says hate your Finance platform get Runway [Laughter] are you um are you the only founder uh I have a I had a co-founder uh Arya awesome onar and he left the company about a year and a half ago almost two years because that's like pretty rare I mean you're I I don't know when you launch but I feel like you're very very very very early in the period because I remember seeing you guys go on Twitter like get get popular on Twitter uh that's going to be pretty uh different to be a kind of a the only founder running a company that'd be kind of exciting right you get to do whatever the hell you want or is it you're going to be lonely I think the reason why we parted ways is things were just slower to make decisions and neither of us were having as much fun as we wanted to so um and actually I didn't want him to leave like he is I mean I he's still on the board I love him um he's just the most wise and high intered person on perat uh he was one of parag's peers at Twitter and he I hired him out of school my first company and he know he works for Brett tayor uh at sier but he we if things were like going slower than he wanted and he identified that it was him slow or our relationship slowing us down he decided to fire himself uh and I didn't think he he was right about that but he was he us usually is right about just about everything and it totally transformed the company he also must have attended interpersonal Dynamics he did not you talked about character Ai and chai like some of these AI companies that are crushing it just printing money right now are there any other companies that just have blown your mind in terms of how well they're doing or how fast they're growing right now like uh maybe AI maybe not AI uh a love Labs um in that company but it's it's they do like basically all of the audio translation generation sometimes def fakes um and when I met them they were like less than 10 people they were just they were ex Google they're working on the foundation mod technology and they are now I don't know what they last announced but they're in the hundreds of millions AR in like a year or two a year and a half or so um and what what blew my mind is I never seen a group of very good technologists that were also so good at commercializing the technology so rapidly they're at hundreds of millions and hundreds hundreds I feel like this just came out year and a half right they uh they dubbed our podcast remember that clip where they were like Sam you're speaking Hindi now and it was and and were likey this is like soid of us not to have pursued that more yeah there's that graph right for wi and the fastest growing SAS companies and I think cser is up there I'm fairly convinced that aabs is actually like faster than all of them um but yeah I think they announced the some Revenue Milestone but well when we were tinkering with them it was borderline this is cool this is cute to I need I can use this right now it was like it was like just there so I guess they crossed it and people are actually using it like to actually who are they selling to is it so so Apple has audiobooks oh so not podcast Apple audiobooks right like so previously did have audiobooks and you know you would know that a lot of this um um AI generated is Power by 11 laps oh so they and they also they also do AI agents for customer service and support agents and things like that so they're the back end of maybe potentially other software tools as well yeah yeah so so they have all kinds of product lines they sell the book publishers the power agents they do a whole why are they better than like what open AI you know like the risk with all these AI companies is that the the general the base models a open Ai and and anthropic Etc can just offer those capabilities you know as part of the main Suite do they do something different are they fine-tuning it in some way what's no it's their own found foundational models um and a quality and expressiveness is just better and uh the form factor is better so you can use it for all these different use cases and the The Voice API of open AI is actually like not as good or as easily usable dude you're super fun to talk to I just like hearing all these like uh I feel like you're like a like a treasure box so I just like pick like I just grab something out of the toy chest like tell me the story behind this you know what I mean I think that's awesome yeah thanks for coming on dude and uh give people a shout out for your company and where to follow you for more yeah runway.com you can follow me at blader Blade with an r or Runway Co um and if you are a CFO you should use our software how much did you have to pay for that domain a quar million dollar uh Fun N robon named a company and suggested that we use it on.com I think that was smart quarter million is not a lot I feel like for that wait what do you mean Nal named the company like you went to him being like hey what should we name this or he just suggested so when Clubhouse only have one room in April 2020 um it was in the nval app right I think you were on it quite a bit too and so uh when I was thinking about what I want to do for next company I said I want to do a finance company and I got a great name for it in Nal cf. he's like no don't call it AI it's going to be dated in like two years everything's call AI you should just call it Runway and you should get the doom and he wrote the first truck into Runway and that's why we got the doop it's so funny that you said it was the Nal app at the time it totally was yeah it was amazing it wased all rob it was it was amazing by the way I was using uh air chat like pretty iously uh like for like two months yeah um even though I knew air chat's not going to work I was like oh it doesn't matter this is naval's app he's going to be on 247 cool this is like I I like to hang out with the fall I'm not going to email him like a million other people and say hey can can we get a coffee just a thousand dollars a month and you can talk to n whenever you want right yeah exactly I was like I'm gonna be on this I'm gonna be on this for two months I'm gonna be a power user for exactly two months and I'm gonna hang out in the vault and I that's exactly what happened I was very proud of myself for that it was the most fun way to use that app yep dude thank you for doing this you're the man and uh we're thinking of you and your daughter and hopefully too all right see you thank you that's it that's the PA [Music]

dude this Vault this giant filing cabinet is worth more than Snapchat it's worth more than Pinterest it's worth more than Twitter as a company isn't that [Music] crazy all right we're going to get a little current eventy which we don't often but I love current events so I want to talk about a current event so was it last night Elon did this thing where he was like in Trump's office with like kid like crawling all over him climbing up on him which is kind of funny and he told this story about uh a mine where all the government files were did you hear what he said I didn't hear what he said I saw a photo of this place like underground somebody said uh oh it's the bureaucratic gring gots from Harry Potter it's like this underground bank vault so Elon said something that I feel like it was like an off-handed comment but it actually led me down the Rabbit Hole basically they were asking him about how he was like getting rid of all these jobs and he was like yeah I want to like actually retire more people but I was told that I can only retire 10,000 people a month and I was asking well why is that and he said well because all the retirement paperwork is manual meaning it's literally on paper and it's written down on a piece of paper and then it goes down a mine there's literally a limestone mine where all the paperwork for retire people who want to retire is where it's stored and so in in order to actually make this work the speed that we can move the limiting factor is the speed at which the line shaft elevator can actually move down like go and and you hear this story and you're like what the hell are you talking about man and so I went down a rabbit hole and I had to figure this out so can I tell you a little story about not just this mine but this whole company that operates yes around this so basically in the 1920s there is this guy who grew mushrooms and and in I guess in order to grow mushrooms in the part of America where he was growing mushrooms he had to grow them in a cave and so he was uh the Mushroom King of America at one point he was the largest Creator or grower of mushrooms in America he was this German immigrant and he was kind of like this like funny guy where like his advertisements he called himself the Mushroom King whatever and he had to rent a cave and grow mushrooms and eventually he bought a cave and that's where he grew mushrooms and this cave that he bought was massive it was a huge cave and for some reason starting in the 1950s post World War II those damn Europeans started undercutting them and started selling cheaper mushrooms and he was like my mushroom business is going to go under I this is not going to work I got to figure out what to do and so he bought a bank vault door that was $20,000 in 1950 and he installed it in his cave he took out the mushrooms and he installed this bank vault door and he went to a local bank and was like hey you guys have a lot of paperwork you've got a lot of files that you have to store I have the safest place on Earth to store the this paperwork you want to like make a make a business deal and so he changed his business and he started this thing called Iron Mountain and it was called Iron Mountain because it was literally in like a uh a mine that was like they would use the I don't know how this all works but they would use like the the rocks to make like iron and he grew this thing like crazy and so basically this company it's called Iron Mountain Google Iron Mountain Market cap Iron Mountain Inc is a $30 billion company wow all right so I have this notebook here and the reason I have here is I take notes whenever we have a guest not because it's my job and I'm a podcast host but because a lot of times what the guests are talking about it's just so interesting to me as a human I just want to go and like implement it in my business or my life and the person I took the most notes for was Jesse ller if you haven't heard that podcast it's the best like it legitimately changed my life and so I thought let's share our notes and so with the help of the team at HubSpot we went and took all of the notes from that episode and we turned it into a 10 page document you can download it for free it changed my life that episode I think it might change yours so check it out the link is below in the description again notes with Jesse ller down below so this company I looked it up since the year 2000 they have created a billion dollars at least or roughly per year in free cash flow and they now own something like I think it was something like 80 million square feet of storage and so they have everything so it could be like Princess Diana's will is in there but it's like uh Sony the the Music Company Sony the record label Sony has all of their masters recordings like literally like the the tape stored in Iron Mountain but their biggest customers is like uh it's like an insurance company in Connecticut who been in business for 100 years they for some reason legal reasons they have to keep their paper files they have to save them for something like 75 years this is nuts dude so so they're just a giant they're just like a physical Vault for documents it says inter Enterprise Information Management Services founded in 1951 so it's just a giant Vault and they're like we will protect your files we'll protect your paperwork exactly but it's huge so literally they have caves and he like would joke that it's an atomic bomb shelter but that wasn't really a joke they actually have a whole bunch of decommissioned atomic bomb structures as their vaults and so and they do this because if you um uh if you are like for example WWE is one of their customers and they have every single time they've literally like physically filmed a fight like a like a an event match the match they store it and they have all these tapes which is like sounds like okay that's just like a small example but they have other examp examples where 8-year-old me would have broke in there so excited to just go to the Vault of all WWE matches ever yeah but they also have like billions of dollars worth of art so if you're a a museum and you have extra art that you need to store you're going to go to Iron Mountain because you know it's like real like safe it's one place or they have a bunch of these they have dozens and dozens of places so I think they have why caves like don't caves literally like cave in like why why not just a building what's wrong like building with guys with guns why not because it uh uh it has a low moisture so it's like it's like it's good for paper and a bunch of reasons like that but it's also like literally safe so like a cave is actually uh you know I don't know how this works but it's actually safer in terms of like they being an earthquake or there being an atomic bomb when someone just gives me one scientific fact like just like a a minor if you were just like yeah the humidity coefficient is is lower I all right all right I don't need to hear more like I'm just like so STIs as long as I know there's any scientific basis for something I'll just accept it the argument in full it's the uh there was a Harvard study uh that's it has the same effect on me exactly it's and I was reading this and it was by the New Yorker and there was like all like it it it was hard to comprehend how like epic this thing is now so this is the thing that stores the government stuff or no separate business yes so let's get to the government stuff so he said there's I think he said uh there's he goes there's a limestone mine where this is all stored so he kind of like dismissed it because it was a mine but that's actually important but the federal government is a customer of Iron Mountain and so here's how this works this part is absolutely insane so starting in the 1950s of the 1960s uh the federal government became a customer of Iron Mountain and to this day it basically operates the exact same way and so right now the federal government is retiring around 100,000 people a year and when let's say you work for the FBI or some agency Federal agency the the Postal Service whatever and you need to retire because of 100 plus years of laws there's a lot of complications and so when you retire you're supposed to get a pension let's round numbers of $100,000 a year but some people might get 98,000 some people might get 108,000 and the reason they will is because let's say this federal employee was a cafeteria worker uh for a federal agency that requires a different set of rules let's say this person was a retired vet let's say this person was uh an amputee there's like a million rules about what what you are going to be earning after you retire however this is all done on paperwork so every single federal employee they and not just the current ones but the past ones they have a manila envelope in this mine in Pennsylvania that Iron Mountain runs and so when you want to retire you have to file a piece of paperwork like you literally write up on a piece of paperwork you give it to your boss at your federal agency the federal agency has to mail it to the mountain or to the mine in PA and it takes roughly 60 days because one of the 600 employees at this mine needs to physically have the file in hand needs to walk to your file in the mountain which this mountain is 200 football fields or 200 Acres they have to literally hand like by hand go and get that file and they got to look at your file and they got to say all right Sean um looks like 65 it looks like oh he actually retired at 59 years old then he came back so that gets a different thing uh turns out he served in the Iraq War so he gets a this thing this thing this thing and then they close the file and they put it back and they send paperwork back to your agency to let them know here's what Shawn is going to be paid for his pension fund and that process takes something like 90 days to do that whole thing and since uh since the 1980s they have spent hundreds of millions it's approaching billions of dollars to digitize this it's failed every time and The New Yorker in 2004 wrote this amazing article they're like we tried it in 1980 we trying it now we tried it in 1995 why does fail what what why why can't they digitize too much or it gets rejected what it's a huge it's a huge task but this mountain it's in rural Pennsylvania and these Pennsylvania folks they they were literally Mine Workers like that that that's what they were this mine when it was an active mine so it's like generations of miners who are now doing this thing so it's not like these 600 employees aren't exactly like computer experts they're like physical laborers so they don't exactly have like the labor there to do it but also just the bureaucracy the same thing that happened with uh when Obama launched uh was it healthcare.com or whatever like it's just really hard within a government within the four years that a president is President to make this massive change and so this mind and nobody and you're not going to get huge pat on the back for like digitizing this process you know what I mean and the people who work at the M they interviewed a couple of them they were like it's a pretty Miser miserable place to work in the winter time when we arrive at work we're there when it's dark uh and then when we come home at night it's still dark and you can't have a flame in the mind so all of the food has to be delivered for us every day and it's like fried food or pizza that's like our two vendors um but they let you have unlimited overtime if you if you want and it's an 8 to five uh n or 8 to five job and uh no one leaves like the retention is 100% they're like it's just a good stable job these guys need a podcast I need I want to be listening to Iron Mountain pod where they're just just these miners just talking about about paperwork and eating pizza it's like an ASMR channel of the Limestone mine and The New Yorker did an article and they like were talking to these people and they were like if you guys want to see taxpayer waste you should see what happens when a federal worker retires goes back to work and then retires again he goes uh one guy they interviewed they go I'm working on a case now that's taking me 120 days to figure out how much uh pension this worker is owed and it's just a nightmare and so it's like literally a physical labor job to walk around and find all these this mining company is this this Vault this this giant filing cabinet is worth more than Snapchat it's worth more than Pinterest it's worth more than Twitter as a company isn't that crazy the $3 billion company and the retention might be better and here's why it might be better here so so it is better I guarantee listen workday workday is a piece of software I've never I don't think maybe I've used it but like the thing about work workday is considered like a dinosaur software company right it's like or let's say ADP like these payroll softwares that a lot of huge companies have and they they're regarded as a sticky product but the issue with that is that you a worker as well as management you interact with that product every day so you're like this [ __ ] sucks So eventually you might get pissed off and want to change it with Iron Mountain a a bank by law has to keep these files on on and say they go hey we're going to give this to you guys and they'll never talk to him again for the next 50 years dude should we open up a drawer like should we just go havies on a single drawer in Iron Mountain and just start saving like hateful YouTube comments in there just have one one little one little station they told a story about this mine they said there was some rich Anonymous person this old lady who had like $100 million worth of Art and she once a year would go down to the mine and bring a blanket and cheese and wine and would just sit and look at her art I just be like this is awesome and uh that was in the article that she did that um crazy company right this freaking Iron Mountain really really fun find I'm glad you found that um also hilarious that you started with let's start with current events and then you started talking about this old file storage system from like the 1950s and that's where you went with this uh this information did you see photos of it yeah I saw I saw the one photo now I'm looking at more and it's pretty um pretty wild dude it's just like I mean it makes sense now that you say it now that you explain it it makes sense it's just who knew who knew that this is how this is how it all works now there's like digital versions of this um I forget what one some of the guys in the space are but uh like they were like Iron Mountain was like hey are you guys nervous about digital and they like dismiss it they're like dude you don't know how much like crap people need to store like we're going to be fine uh like it's going good and so if you look at their financials it's just like consistently like a billion dollar Plus a free cash flow just every year dud this is how my wife treats my kids art she like created her own Iron Mountain in our house it's just disgusting all right so um you brought up current events and then you said something that was totally not a current event but there was other current events that are actually I'm just curious give me your 1 to 10 level of interest in these you may you may I I have a feeling you might not be interested in these Elon offering $97 billion to buy open AI did that tickle you eight out of 10 the El stuffff is is like inherently incredibly interesting at the moment right okay eight out of 10 uh let's rank this one um Elon doing crashing the press conference in Donald Trump's o Donald Trump's Oval Office that was that a 10 that's and by the way I bet it's not even for the content just for the uh social Dynamic of him standing behind Trump and just just overtaking the press conference is that right that's my guess is that what you want to talk about well there's there's one other I want to get your read on Doge as a whole uh nine nine or 10 yeah let's go in that order okay okay so start at 10 yeah so you sent me a text last night and you sent uh you said uh rule number one never outshine the master Elon Musk and you're referring to the 48 Laws of Power uh how to be powerful you never outshine your master Elon Musk 100% outshined Donald there that was so emasculating to have Donald just sitting there and elon's standing up sort of behind him like he was going to come and put his arm like his hands on his shoulders you know what I mean yeah yeah yeah D he hijacked the press conference and just started giving his own speech a wordy speech while his kid is there rambling also and Trump is just sitting there like a goon uh at the table and it was just so interesting I never seen anyone who's not the president give their own press conference from the Oval Office while the president sits there forget what they were even talking about just that was like whoa hold on this is like uh you know like if you watch The Bachelor sometimes they do a two-on-one date it's like whoa hold on it's that a one-on-one it's a two-on-one oh there's going to be some drama here that's how it felt it felt like a bachelor 2on one goes going on when Elon told the story of Iron Mountain uh Trump like looked back at him and he goes huh no [ __ ] really like he was like like he was learning like he was being entertained at that moment as well do you know what I mean I also love how Trump sometimes just like well we're going to send Elon in elon's going to go in he's going to he's going to do great things he does great things and he's just like that'll be the plan but honestly that's actually not a bad plan it's like if I was going to say one thing it's like we're going to send Michael Jordan on the court and he's going to shoot he's a great shooter it's like that's kind of what he does with things he's like we're gonna send Elon in there he's going to take care of things that was a actually a really good Trump impression I mean I didn't fully commit I do I do regret that I didn't fully commit because it kind of started off pretty hot and if I had really gone for it I maybe I would have surprised myself but I'll never know and I'll live with that regret till I die I thought it was pretty good I it was a very that had a lot of promise there uh what about the Doge stuff in general I have a I have a very opinionated take do you I have a big picture take and then I have just like small things that I wish wish more stuff would come out from so here's my big picture take I cannot believe we're on this timeline so if you just rewind the clock like a couple years ago here's what was going on I was reading this right doio book did you ever read the Rio like I forgot what it's called rise and fall of Nations or something like that it's basically how Empires like fall right no Empire the the title scared me and I was like I just kind of want to be ignorant but I read his first one principles and I know that he comes off historically is a pessimist right no no no he's a realist I don't know he's he's just an observer of of how things are so if you're going to watch one thing by the way watch he's got this thing called the the economic machine works it's a 20 or 30 minute YouTube video which sounds long but it's amazing um it's an animated video where he just explains how the economy Works in a way that even a you know boo like me could understand and it's it's it's amazing go watch that like you should just pause this podcast and go watch that think it's called how the economic Machine Works the Bridgewater office by the way is literally 1.5 miles from my house if you want to go and just talk to him sure we just walk right in yeah we absolutely should so he wrote the book about the rise and fall of Nations and he basically talks about like he studied all the empires the Dutch Empire the Roman Empire the Chinese Empire and basically why do the empires end why don't they just keep going they have all the advantages they got the power they got the best military they got the best economy they have the growing population like where do things go wrong and he saw that over time things go wrong in a very predictable cyclical fashion and um and then because he studied history he could see that okay even if it's not going to be the same it's probably going to rhyme I should look out for some of these signs and you know one of the signs that he talks about is around um uh uh the big debt cycle so there's like a short-term debt cycle there's a long-term debt cycle which like 80 to 100e debt cycle and what happens is you know the uh countries or Empires will end up going into um too much debt which the US is in right now like $35 trillion of debt like just an absurd number and then the interest payments are really high then because people lose faith in their ability to pay off that debt um you know they lose at some point their status is the global Reserve currency blah blah blah okay so Ray Dalia makes this argument it's a interesting book you should read it now does he mention uh mukbang where on the timeline is do you know what mukbang is listening to people eat right watching and listening to people eat incred fat people just stuff their face with Ramen yeah it's like a governmental mukbang is what he describes does he mention uh when the decline is when uh mukbang gets popular there were signs so so as he's talking about this it's like oh okay [ __ ] you look at the kind of the current world you're like oh [ __ ] uh we got inflation but then you know to fight inflation they got to raise rates when they raise rates that slows down the economy which slows down spending which creates this other problem then you get stagflation you get like all these oh man this could go poorly right oh they're printing too much money that could hurt the the dollars you know they're debasing the currency that's what he says that they do this is what's going to happen and it just seemed inevitable the problem was you looked at you like but who's going to go and fix this right it's not like a company because a company has to Face Reality so what a company has to do is ultimately the company needs profits and needs the the shareholders are going to demand that the company stop this excess spending but the problem with the the government is the government can sort of go infinitely in debt until it can't it could just print money right like imagine if you or I just had a a little machine in the closet it's like well I could solve this problem with hard work cutting back tightening the belt you know or I could just go in the closet push this button I'll just do it this one time just this one time okay and like that's what just kept keeps happening you go and you push the button you print the money and so um so that's the problem okay and it just seemed like there was no solution to this because anybody who wanted to get elected right the leader first the leaders were not business people right so problem number one the people who run the country were lifelong politicians typically and they were not CEOs or Executives who had that as their core skill set the second thing is they didn't have the incentive right cuz when you want to get elected it's like Middle School all over again you're got to go promise we're going to have free pizza every Friday it's like where's who's going to pay for that I don't care I just got to say it and promise it we'll deal with the consequences because that's what gets me elected so the presidency is is never about hey I'm going to cut back all your favorite programs it was always going to be we're going to do more for you we're going to cut your taxes okay so less revenue for the government how's that going to work we're already in debt we we're going to cut your taxes and uh you know what we're going to we're going to spend more on this we're going to invest in education that sounds great we're going to give you free health care we're going to pay off your student loans it's like wow we're just going to where's the money coming from and the money was coming from that magic money printer in in the closet okay so it just seemed like dude there's no way there's no way out and somehow this insane situation has occurred I'm not saying that it's going to work and I'm not saying I agree with everything about these people I don't agree with everything Trump says I don't even I didn't even vote okay look you can't even hate me okay I didn't vote for the guy I didn't vote for anybody so so you can hate me for other reasons I don't agree with everything that Elan does but he's an impressive ultimately impressive uh entrepreneur I think he's the greatest entrepreneur of all time okay so but I also yeah don't think he I agree with I don't agree with everything he says great my caveats out of the way I cannot believe we ended up on this timeline where Trump gets elected Elon Musk the greatest entrepreneur of all time and if even if you disagree okay he's second right like he's close um what when did Trump was it January 20th is that wait when or four was it 20th is inauguration yeah so less than a month ago okay three weeks ago and he brings Elon Musk in and basically like like he's still doing onboard if you just said what's the only way America can get out of this I'd be like dude we got to get like someone as smart as Elon Musk in there with a mandate and somehow have a free mandate to actually go and cut all the bloat to get us out of this excess spending to cut the deficit to balance the budget to get us even into a surplus that's the only way we got to like somehow do that that sounded impossible two to three years ago like what there was no path where something he's not even an American citizen can't be president he's not going to run the president's not going to just give them free reign well somehow we ended up in this 0.1% probability timeline where Trump gets elected Elon becomes his bestie by backing him and giving a bunch of money and put throwing his weight behind him Elon stipulation was like I want to create Doge haha Doge uh and he's like I'm going to cut spending and Trump's like okay great and somehow it became cool to cut spending which was never cool before that and now he just took like this Army of his smartest most ruthless people it's not even Army it's 40 or 50 folks who are 20 four more just go get a bunch of 10x type of people and he's he's literally like raing he's like raing buildings and he's taking over payment systems and being like okay you I can't change the laws but I could stop the flow of the money I could audit everything from this payment record system and he's bringing like young hackers in he's bringing some of his smartest people in he's doing this now will this be successful I have no idea I can't tell you is this fascinating absolutely is this one of our only shots to get out of the death spot of excess spending I believe so and I cannot believe it happened end of rant all right let me give you let me give the audience a Counterpoint and I'm going to get flam for this you're going Devil's avocado on me I'm going hardcore Devil's avocado on you no not exactly because I'm on board with like what a lot of the stuff he's doing but listen to this let's just say that you're 45 years old you got two kids in high school you got a mortgage and you're thinking like you know life's pretty good and then all of a sudden you get a message that says look we appreciate you Diane for working for the government for so long but you're done you're you got to get out and you're thinking how the hell am I going to pay my mortgage how am I going to like provide for my kids you want to go to college and then you look online to learn about your situation and you're like wait the guy who just decided to fire me changed his Twitter handle to Twitter to Harry balls and he put in his description that he's offering circumcision for 69 and did he just call ay a [ __ ] on Twitter dude someone yesterday sent me an advanced search you knew your Twitter advanced search it was just like a a single link I could click that was just Elon Musk saying the word [ __ ] and bro you could scroll for days it was it was unbelievable it was an unbelievable link it's sort of like like uh a a really successful entrepreneur CEO doing layoffs because money short from his beautiful Chalet in Aspen with a beautiful view behind him on zoom and for Elon I'm like do what you got to do but can you not be so smug about it and like have some like [ __ ] Grace when you're like doing some of these things even if those things are good and I agree with them I just wish that like the maturity level would go up because at the end of the day it's cool for like these Tech Guys to say like cut them cut them Let's uh make the government smaller whatever but it's at the end of the days it is real people's lives and half of these people they're not like hungry power people they're just [ __ ] guys who are working 9 to5 and they just want to play softball in the weekends you know what I mean and that that that bums me out I wish that he would show a little Grace uh when he's slashing you know what I mean like I think you bring up great points I think his uh it's like I've been told many times you're not wrong but your delivery sucks what do they say in the big laas you're not wrong man you're just an [ __ ] yeah that's that's like what's going on here so I think you're absolutely right on that I will say they did offer 8mth Severance I will also say this wasn't like an optional or flimsy like it's not like somebody's just messing around basically but that's what it seems when you changed it to Harry balls he made it seem like that you're absolutely right it seems like he's messing around the style is bad I think the substance is good the reality is the way that the government works is actually like a financial terror attack on All American citizens and so as much as Diane I I don't like that Diane is is going to possibly lose her job the reality is she shouldn't have had that job probably in the first place or this old maybe not her specifically but the overall system is spending so much it is going to tank the entire economy like you look at all these crazy stats about how much of job growth is just federal jobs how much of spending is just going to federal employees it's like you know a a wormy like the game of snake when you start to eat your own tail it doesn't even make any sense I'll give you I'm going to tell you something I have a friend who was at last year or two years ago they had an unlucky break they wanted this promotion or this job they didn't get it they didn't really know what to do didn't look like they had a had a great you know like upside I thought that they deserved a little bit better said let me see if I can help this person out and around this time I had met some people that were some fat cats who were doing well with government contracts and I'm talking about like you know one company for example they just they a web web dev shop they made websites now they're a fat cat we got to bring that back great usage fat cat yeah exactly and what I mean by that is they were making websites which you can go on Fiverr and get a website for five bucks you can go on upwork and get somebody to do it for a couple hundred bucks you can go on Squarespace and do it yourself you could there's a whole bunch of things you could do they're getting 192 million contracts to build simple websites it was unbelievable and and and there were multi-year contracts to do things that literally I have interns that could do them in three four days it was uh and these aren't like high traffic not complex apps not super sensitive data just like a square informational websites very menu online yeah exactly so um started noticing this so I go to my friend and I say let's get you a government contract and I can't say too much specific stuff we have a we got this friend a government contract to do something that probably takes four hours not even high skilled time you know not not anybody could do it my sister could do it my cousin could do it anybody could have got this contract it's been going for two years and now it's a hilarious game of hide-and seek because I'm like yo doge is GNA find this contract and when Doge finds this contract they're going to publish this thing and be like we paid for this and I'm glad that my friend got like you know a a great lifestyle however it's the what what is that thing called the free rider problem in society it's like uh I forgot there's like some social term for this where it's like you you can abuse public parks and public transport because nobody's kind of like on the hook for it and like well I'll get mine I'll get mine and when everybody tries to get theirs we all get screwed where did your head go where your friend doesn't get the promotion and then the default response is let's get you a government contract baby go to let's go to the government contract store just pick it off the shelf and go check out D there's these side quests that um you know I'd been through this this podcast is great right you do this podcast and you meet people and you hear stories we were talking about we had done a segment on government contract businesses uh I think we had done a bus a thing because somebody I know had pivoted they used to have the episode I remember specifically was they used to be in the business of making vodka bottles with LED lights so if it was like Sam's bachelor party it'd be like Sam last day of Freedom like ating around a vodka bottle that was their business Co hit and they pivoted their entire business to selling masks and got an 80 or 90 million contract yeah and this is somebody who lives less than a m friend who who did that and I was like oh my God can you believe that we talked about it on the podcast and I just had some people email me which is the flywheel of this podcast and they were like yeah dude like have you ever checked this out check this out you can go see what what's up for bid right now hey have you heard about this company have you heard about this company so I started getting curious now I was never going to do it right because I'm at a phase of my life where I am intentionally trying to not make any decisions for money so even when I saw something that I was like oh wow you could go make money doing that I no longer want to be that guy I was that guy for like 15 years I don't want to be that guy anymore if I make a decision it can't be for the for money as the number one reason but I did take note and I was like somebody could do that maybe somebody who's maybe top priority right now is money and so this little side quest was let's go help a friend I don't want to do this for me it wouldn't be worth it for me but it would totally be worth it to to like for the story and to see if I could help my friend out and it's still going it's still going but dude every month and now that doge is out it's literally like a game a hide-and seek and I can hear the footsteps coming I know I know it's coming and it's going to be hilarious when it hits that's insane that is pretty funny what about the um the third thing the um this the so the uh the reasoning behind it like he has a reason for doing this which is that he's trying to explain what it is explain what it is so people don't know so Elon uh so from my understanding uh uh open AI is a nonprofit they're trying to convert to a for-profit in order to do that Sam Alman as well as some of the shareholders have to quote buy the company um and what Elon has done is he's put a competing offer to buy the nonprofit of open AI in order to make Sam Alman as well as the other shareholders to have to pay more is that the summary sort of he's not trying to buy the nonprofit he's trying to buy the assets and same thing so basically open AI today is a nonprofit that how it started that's who you know has a lot of the IP then they created a four profit where the nonprofit owns I think 25% of the for-profit or they're they're trying to own 25% of the for-profit that would be like the the deal and um the for-profit has been raising billions and billions of dollars they just they were just trying to raise from Masa um and soft bank at a $250 billion billion 2lion valuation and so that implied that when they do this conversion um or they sell they convert the ass they get the assets out of the nonprofit into the for-profit right the IP the the Intel the the the all the the code all that stuff uh the assets were valued I think at 40 billion in that that transition and it was going to be like stock basically it's like oh you're going to have 25% ownership in the for-profit and what Elon did was just throw a wrench in that a little bit cuz he's like actually I'll I'll buy the assets for 90 whatever he said 97 billion so couple possibilities here number one he might actually get it it's possible that he could do it and then in that case he would own the assets of open AI merge it with xai and he would be he would go from fourth place to first place overnight that see I'm I'm uneducated on the topic but I know a little bit about stories that just seems too that that won't Game of Thrones they're they're going to die before they do that okay yeah that story won't happen so he's so it's possible possible not probable yes and it's possible not probable only because of the Egos and personalities involved Sam Alman would fight to the death to not have that happen that would be him losing and getting checkmated by Elon and Elon is doing it because he wants to Checkmate Sam because he feels like he got wronged and betrayed because he funded the first 40s something um million dollars into opening ey when it was a nonprofit and he owns nothing of the for-profit today um would you put money on either of them winning you think they're or just like in terms of just like the battle of the wits like a chess match or do you think that it's too hard to you you know when we watch those UFC pay-per-views and it's like sometimes you get the ones where it's just like oh I just want to see kabib do his thing he's gonna win but I just want to watch how and then there's other times where you're like I have no idea who's going to win this fight I have no idea you got the Unstoppable wrestler versus the guy who's amazing at Jiu-Jitsu and striking and like I could totally see it going either way I got to pay $90 pay-per-view I got to watch this that's how this one is because I agree for as many people say you never bet against Elon there's a equal number of smart people who say you never bet against Sam Alman right and and so you don't know which way it's going to fall now and there's also it's the highest Stakes thing like AI is the highest Stakes game and this is the Crown Jewel asset is open Ai and it's going to be a fight to the death okay so the second possibility is he just wants to make it more expensive for open a cuz like I said the implied valuation they were talking about was about $40 billion for the assets non-cash uh contribution U or maybe it was a cash contribution I'm not sure and this would up the price so if nothing else you go to your enemy and they have to pay double for their car but do you think like maybe that's satisfying enough maybe that's in the board meeting can you just imagine all these suits to like well do we do we look at this offer and then everyone just like no it's just Elon he's just being a [ __ ] okay like do you just like do they just like collectively agree that he's just being an [ __ ] or are they like uh guys we got to like look into this they're collectively because I mean that would be a very low price for the for the assets of open AI right like literally on the open market they're raising out of $240 billion valuation so to sell the assets at a $97 billion valuation wouldn't really make a lot of sense right um so at the very least he's upping the price or just slowing it down making life more complicated for his competitors so if I if we're competing in a race but I know I can distract 15% of your mind share right it's like a Honeypot like you know like people used to do this like send in a a pretty looking girl and it's like this is just a nice little distraction for my competitor that I can send in like they will do that so there's there's multiple levels this might be playing at I don't know which this is just like the nerdy uh Kendrick Lamar versus Drake thing because they're now they're going after their personalities they haven't gone after family yet but I honestly would not be surprised if that happens next yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly so I'm not paying a whole lot of attention to it but it I mean it is interesting to watch like a sort of real life you know rap beef or a Game of Thrones battle going on does it Bo does any of this like wear you out because I feel a little excited at the moment but I wonder when but we're only a month in and I'm like how much longer can I like last uh with all these like uh Amazing Stories yeah uh yeah I know what you mean there's definitely a part of it where it just feels like I've just watched too many episodes of Jersey Shore and I'm like I wasted my whole day you know like you know there oh he said this and he did this and they're going to do this and let me look up the Delaware law it's like for what is are you getting anything out of this or are you just gossiping it's say oh I'm gossiping okay cool well there only so much of my energy I really want to put towards gossiping I also just constantly think and I think a lot of other people think this is how does one man have so much energy it's pretty like amazing it's hard for me to imagine like writing a serious email that would require me to make a decision that has long-term impacts because I'm like uh I just can't like turn my brain on right now to get into that imagine never feeling that feeling I think um Jimmy Mr be said something he said something like an off-handed com uh comment I think he was like uh he was like oh no I'm focused like every waking hour or he made like he was like I I don't get distracted like I don't uh like browse like he said something like that he was like but when I do get in that mood which is uh seldom I go all in for like 24 48 hours and I just need like a 2-day recharge and then I'm back in and I don't uh I don't get distracted now imagine being like an Elon and having to like you don't have do you have zone out mode like most people do after 7 o'clock at night you know you know what I mean I read this story about Bill Gates and it was a story about how Bill Gates was building Microsoft and people don't know because Bill Gates is now a philanth philanthropist SL like you know he's got Grandpa energy he's got Grandpa energy exactly he's wearing hisat sweater he's like well you know I read books and blah and I you know got these nets to catch mosquitoes like you he just sounds like you know sort of harmless he was ruthless putting around putting around bill yeah he he's putting around in the mornings he was ruthless when he was building Microsoft and he was insane energy if you don't believe me play the clip of him jumping over the chair all right we're back so on top of that they were like Bill do you uh somebody was like riding in a car with him to do an interview or something like that and they go Bill what happened and they look at his um his car like the tape deck was missing was like pulled out like it almost got stolen and they go did it get stolen he said no I took it out they go why'd you take it out you don't like to listen to music he goes if I'm know the radio he goes if I'm listening to the radio I'm not thinking about Microsoft so I just took it out I don't want to listen to the radio I want to think about Microsoft it it's wild right that's just a little tiny story but there's probably like some epic epic stories and and these are small things like for example let's say you get like um an email saying like you know uh this partnership that we thought about doing or the sale that we're thinking about doing from you it's not for us thank you there's people and this is like kind of small but like it's just an example of this Behavior who they're like they'll just get on a plane and they'll fly to that person's office that next morning and they'll just make it work and you think about doing that with like your young kids you got a few kids I have one kid and I'm like there's not a chance that I'm getting on that plane unless it's like a pretty amazing thing but just to do these like daily these daily these daily items that show how intense you are it it it's really challenging to imagine living that life and I think very few people can actually sustain it and I'm not one of them right dude there's uh so back to your question of like how does he do it this is a legitimate question how does he do it so one of the reasons my my interest in doge is is uh top of mine right now is I just had my most viral tweet ever you did yeah and it was me all I said was I would pay stupid amounts of money for someone to follow around the Doge team for the next six months Hard Knock style like have you ever seen Hard Knocks the show on HBO they follow like an NFL team through training camp I would and it's true I would pay a ridiculous amount of money for that what was the reach on that I mean the Tweet got like 50,000 likes or something crazy oh that's so funny I didn't see that it has just like it went like really viral for some reason um a lot of people felt the same way like there's a Fascination around this and part of it is um I would really want to see like I want to know I want to know what it's like like uh I'll give you two things so one I want to know what elon's like but not because I'm like oh Elon he's the best I just want to see I literally want to understand like so this guy's running six companies at logistically yeah and then there's [ __ ] like where he's like he's also tweeting 10 times more than me so it's not even like oh but he just doesn't waste time on social media like you it's like no actually Wast more time on social media it's like yeah but he doesn't just waste time playing video games like you asshle it's like dude he he's bragging about being a top 100 rank Diablo player and it's like something's cap the Diablo thing I'm certain is Cap like I am certain that dud he's paying how old are you can are you allowed to say that I thought it was pretty fluid was that not it was actually so fluid I was like I was like what did he just say I said it in the mirror the other day and I was like I think that works I think that's I think I can add that to my bag there's another one I can't believe dude you you downplayed having audacity to do Trump did have the audacity to say cap and so fluidly like that was really I've been on the internet for way too long um I thought you make cap like a cap to his energy not cap like no cap that was really good dude I'm going to start saying cap as in a limit that's cap that's the cap that's the maximum cap what I've reached my threshold is what I'm saying what are you saying I didn't say a lied what did I say on MF like earlier this year you like let him let him bake let him bake you were like riing and I was like let him bake I try to be cool they're like wait is it bake or cook or microwave what is the phrase I uh have you met anyone who's worked with them I I haven't uh yeah I have actually I I talked to that one guy who that one time said um uh recently he said um he goes I had a meet with Elon and his assistant gave me the heads up in advance and he goes just so you know elon's companies are making something like $20 million per hour or something like that or 20 million per half hour so if you are going to have a conversation with him it better be a $20 million conversation and that $20 million number by the way that it's more now it's more now if you if you think of Doge so it's just like every can you imagine that actually that's kind of an exhausting way to live because do you ever hear when people say like uh well that's just not worth my time and when I would think about that for a long time I'm like does that mean I should always be doing something that is like of more value and I'm like well how much am I valuing just laying on this couch or how much am I valuing just like mowing my grass because I want to actually mow my grass and I thought that was kind of an exhausting way to look at life it totally is by the way there's a simple simple solution to that which is you only price things that you don't want to do if you want to do it you don't put a you don't put a price on it if you like if you enjoy the if it's therapeutic to you or what what's it called like uh whatever it feels good just doing nothing feels good to do to do the dishes or to like like trim the bushes in your garden or whatever like go do it you know no you have at it you don't need to be like oh this is inefficient use of my time you only price the things you don't want to do to say you know what am I wasting my time on stuff I don't even enjoy well mean we had Rob drick on the Pod he said that he places that number at $1 million per hour yeah dude I watched a Cody Sanchez clip and like I don't mean to knock on Cody she's always been nice to me but she she was on a panel and they go she goes I was talking to my mentor Bill Perkins and he always you know tells me um you are as you are as low as the low like something like that it's like you are as low as the lowest tasks you do and she she's like you know I um she like I was dropping some I I had to I was pumping oh she he goes do you still pump your own gas and she goes at first I thought how pretentious of I still want to be a person who pumps my own gas and then he did the math from about how much I'm wasting how much money I'm wasting pumping my own gas and he said are you still buying this you should not be buying that you should not be going to the store to do that and I just thought like and this video had like whatever tens of thousands of likes and I think that's a totally valid way to think she might be right that might be the right answer for her it's not the right answer dud I went to Whole Foods last night at 9:00 p.m. just to walk around totally totally totally I think there I think underneath a lot of that like oh I got to be so ficient with every second of my day is just some underlying feeling of lack what do you think you lack in your life that you have to optimize every minute of every hour of every day and that you are like above doing certain things and by the way also when you stop doing things you lose touch with reality so there's a price to that too and so I just think like there's a the the my takeaway was not even about Cody or her idea that if it works for you more power to you I just think I just thought to myself you know you know how much bad advice is out there like whether this was bad advice or other like one of the great skills in life is just playing hopscotch and not not stepping on the like landmines of terrible advice that exist on the internet our podcast included by the way we say some dumb [ __ ] and we say some things that don't make sense they don't make sense for you maybe make sense for us or maybe it just doesn't make sense at all but there is a skill to how do you block out the 98% of awful advice that sounds smart you want to hear something funny so I met this guy uh who's a billionaire a multi-billionaire he's probably 65 and I talked to him for like an hour online for something and at the end of the call for some reason he started talking about his family and his kids and how he uh has like I forget five kids and they're each Married with Children and he's like oh I'm always around the grandkids I just love this like and he was explaining his life philosophy and at the end of the call I go hey um you know we don't know each other we only know each other for this hour but do you think I could come over um me and my wife and stay with you and your family and I can just watch how you interact with your family because you seem really happy man and you're successful You've Won and he goes I would love that and so tomorrow at 7:00 a.m. I am flying to Park City to go to this guy's house for 3 days and he was like my whole family's going to be there for this weekend and I was like great can I come and just hang out with you guys and be part of the family for a weekend just to see how you're interacting with everyone because you are awesome and he was like yeah I would love that so I'm going to his house tomorrow uh tomorrow till Sunday uh just to like learn how to be when I met him I was like you are just such a warm person and you're you're rich and successful which is like one attribute that's amazing you seem happy you seem fit you uh have a lovely family and they seem like they love you I gotta I got to download what you're you're doing because you are amazing he letting me come over Dude That's great I've I've always um enjoyed doing that I have a word for it can I throw some jargon at you stalking is that it the word for it is insitu so like what's that wait is this a madeup word I'm a biology major so at one point I did a biotech company and one of the things you learn you do any any biotech company is there's a huge difference between the lab environment which is a sterile controlled environment um and you see this data come out and it says wow This Thing Really Works we produced this many you know uh this many MERS of this or this many grams of this substance or whatever right had this much this much energy uh this many kilowatts generator whatever whatever the thing you're doing in lab and then you're were like oh my God this amazing we're about to change the world and I was like trying to high five and nobody else was excited I was like why aren't you guys excited they're like well like it's the lab I'm like oh does the lab mess up they go no the lab's great so what do you mean what's the problem lab it's a test it's a scientific test how much more proof do you want they go oh Everything Changes in situ in what and like in situ basically was like you take the thing the the the in in our case we were working on these microbes we had this company where microbes would eat coal and basically fart out natural gas so you could get natural gas without burning coal kind of amazing natural microbes real microbes that just exist on the planet right and so uh they were working amazing in the lab they were producing so much natural gas it was it was amazing we're going to we're about to change the energy industry what's that word in situ is like in sit in a situation situ I don't know exactly what it's I don't know what the technical definition but yeah it's kind of like in the situation or in ground and so what we did was you take the bugs then you have to actually go to the field where the coal is buried 200 meters underground or whatever and you're going to pump the microbes in and you got to pump them in with some water and you got to like see what happens and then there's cracks in the ground it's not perfect and then the blah blah blah the weather everything everything is different the temperature is different the the other microbes that are there there interfere right Etc um and always the Inu was you know not only worse but like just dramatically different to the point where it's was like why are we even doing these lab tests and they're like well look if it fails in the lab it's for sure going to fail in situ right but just because it succeeds in lab doesn't mean it works in situ and so there a really long-winded way of saying I have this little word I tell myself which is like go in situ so so for example it's like you might have a theory but go test it you might have an idea go test it you might think your Donald Trump Impressions good you got to say that [ __ ] on the mic and see what happens another version of it is this person might look like they they've got it all together they're happy they're successful God they're saying all the right things on this podcast go in sit you go to their house and you'll know within like 15 minutes you said three days 3 days massive Overkill you'll know within like 90 minutes for sure everything you need to know about this guy um and you'll you'll pick up all these nuances just about like the family Dynamics and the house and their schedule their level of overall like busyness and rushing through their day versus like wow this person really seems at peace or like you know what they just seem like their Baseline mood is really high or you know their um how their kids relate to them shows me that they have a great bond an underlying Bond uh you know versus what they say and so you pick up so much and this is why people are like oh what happened to you and Sam aren't doing this interview together and it's like yeah cuz I actually wanted to go to that dude's house and he lives near me or he lived where I was traveling and Sam was traveling somewhere else at the time or whatever but I pick up so much more not from the interview but the like hours we spend before the interview just hanging out at their house I pick up so much more in terms of lifestyle and I've talked about this before but like we went one person who you hung so well go go ahead I'll give you the example so we go to Austin and we had four interviews scheduled it was Joe Lonsdale a billionaire who started more billion dooll companies than anyone else in America think like a hard hitting uh get after Alpha type of dude exactly I go to and so there was him there was monish PAB an investor so he was a value investor from the the school of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger there's um Tim Ferris Tim Ferris a guy I've admired for many years author experimenter investor Etc um and then the fourth one was somebody else just I'm forgetting this was like a year ago um so we go and we do the four now for each of the four I hung out with them uh Tim less but the others like Joe Londale I went to his house at 8:00 in the morning I did a morning workout with him we had breakfast together we did a cold plunge together we talked and then we did the podcast I saw his family met his wife you know Etc toured his house saw where you know where where does he work where does he play what you know he's got this land Center like literally like a gaming land Center for him and his cousins to just come play video games like six computers oh L okay yeah he's got like a basketball court he's got like you know uh old like artillery gun at the top of his thing right right when we were leaving 10 senators were coming over for lunch and Elon Musk showed up while we were leaving the house it's like whoa okay that's what your day looks like got it you know had like a it was amazing he was so hospitable by the way he's got like he was so nice and generous with his time um did had monish P I go over to his house he's like yeah come over whenever my day is clear I go to his house he doesn't have a staff that answers he opens the dooro he's wearing basketball shorts and his Barefoot and uh he's like yeah what do you want to let's just sit let's have some tea you want tea and we have tea he's got no clock no assistant telling him you got to move the next thing he shows me his nap room he's like I nap every day it's great napping is great my whole job is thinking you know I have to make great decisions napping keeps me fresh it's like having a second day you know I was like whoa and then he's got all these books in his library but it's also kind of alone I was like you don't have a team he's like no like investors make their decisions not as a committee investors make their decisions you know as an independent thinker and so no I don't have a huge team I got like a researcher or two but like you know they don't they don't come over every day so he has how many billions in his fund two I think something like that and it was really just him and a researcher he was the only guy there he didn't have like a but like is a five person staff generously generously yeah uh I could be wrong right like don't don't don't don't quote me on these but that's what it I'm 90% sure um Tim Ferris I was like uh you know he shows up and I was like so like what you been up to and he was like oh I just came back from Europe I was like oh cool like vacation ski what are you doing and he goes no I spent three days with the guy who's the best in the world at making board games and I wanted to understand I wanted to learn about board games so so you pick up like Li lifestyle flexibility um ability to indulge in your hobbies how lonely are you uh you know do you have a team are you do you know somebody tweeted this out there the other day they go the thing that socialists or marks got Carl marks got wrong was how much fun it is to make money with your boys I like I feel that dude like me Ben Diego it's so much fun to just do what we do it would be way less fun if it was just me doing it even if I had owned 100% I got more equity and all that I would never take that trade dude I I completely agree by the way that's why I have co-founders and I moved Diego out here I was like dude I'll pay you more just move out here move within 10 minutes of me and now we hang out every day and I'm like my life just got better right like little things and so you know my kids interrupt me in the middle of the day I have a piano right next to my desk cuz in between working I'll just play piano it's for fun right like if somebody was here in situe with me they would see that I don't have a perfect life but I've built a life that I love and they will know for themselves if that's kind of what they want and so I think this is massively underrated is a very long-winded way of saying I think more people should do this I think you pick up way more when you go to somebody's house and see their you just kind of hang with them for for a day um or even a couple hours I think we need like um like a tobacco pipe or something today's like you know uh philosopher hour on our on our rocking chairs just like riffing on what makes a good life and what doesn't you know what I mean yeah we started at [Laughter] limestones we should go by the way check them out it sounds sick yeah yeah exactly I I would love to go uh go see it I think it' be pretty boring but it would be mind-blowing at the same time you know what I mean I think it would be nothing nothing would be thrilling but the whole thing would be mind-blowing that that's what it that's what it is that's what exist we almost need to do like MFM field trips because I the timing was horrible when you were doing the monish PAB one because I was moving that day and we couldn't make it work because I had like a six-month-old and it was like a huge whatever but I am so envious I'm like [ __ ] I just wanted to like see I just wanted to like get a a feel I wanted to do a field trip of just sitting in his living room and watching him interact totally that's like I get so much joy doing that exact same thing you know what I would want to do so there's like uh your boy Brett who's doing robotics I want to go see that [ __ ] I want to go see humanoid robots and the factory and just be inspired by that um there's another one that I think would be really cool have you ever been to um a Cisco foods like Cisco is the company that like makes the food that goes to all the restaurants like they make sauces and [ __ ] yeah what no I've not been what is that it's I went once cuz we had a restaurant and it's the most wild like huge scale operation you don't realize it you're like oh I guess yeah the company that supplies all of the materials to all of the restaurants and grocery stores I guess they got to be pretty big right bigger than anything you've ever seen and and it was like a tour of that facility and then you see the automation like there's these little like hockey puck look you know those like scooters are like the butt scooters where you just like sit down on this thing like an old PE thing where you sit down on this little four-wheel flat thing and it rolls around that's like little robots like that that that fly around this Warehouse picking up pallets and moving them places and so it's this incredibly sophisticated operation to move like cans of tuna just I'm looking at their factories it looks so large that you could like see the Earth curve you know what I mean it's it's huge another one would be like like probably not allowed but like andil or like one of these companies just making like lasers and like you know like war machines um also just like the crypto house and just go see all these like degenerate 19-year-olds that's actually a good idea it's like you don't know it till you see it till you feel it right like it just leaves an imprint on you in a different way going to hacker houses in San Francisco was amazing and seem like their kitchen and I'm like who cooks what how do you guys know you've seen the bar stool like One Bite Pizza reviews we just do the one sniff Hacker House reviews the odor just dude and they're all in San Francisco they're all in like these uh like warehouses so they all got Walmart feet so everyone's walking around barefooted with like dirty dirty ass bottom of their feet it's like disgusting and I had so much fun doing it I remember I felt that same way walking around Facebook have you walked around Facebook's campus yeah Facebook's one of those I remember walking around I'm like why does a web page need so many employees what are all these [ __ ] people doing there like there's so many people walking around and you're I can't like I would make fun of Facebook constantly because I thought it was a soulless job but you walk around and you're like oh my God this is like a beehive you know what we should do do you remember Tech crunch cribs did you ever see this show yeah it was awesome it was awesome and they discontinued it just like they discontinued cribs uh but I think that needs to come back and okay realistically we're like we should do this and then both of us are going to like look at our kids and then like just not travel sorry I'm going to go to a Cisco Factory yeah I really want to go see the learn how hot fries are made yeah exactly so realistically let's be honest absolutely not going to do this idea but we need a field correspondent every great show's got a field correspondent right so that's actually kind of funny I'm going to throw down the gauntlet right now 100K a year be the MFM field trip correspondent we're going to send you to different uh awesome places you got to film it like the old TechCrunch cribs uh or MTV Cribs episodes and you just got to go to like funny epic places you know cool interesting companies where they got a crazy like office life uh crazy factories and [ __ ] like this um and that could be your job travel around film content we'll put them up on MFM as episodes I want to see these like there's dude these AI we got to talk about this next week but these AI companies that have like 20 employees but 100 million in Revenue I just want to see what they're doing all day abs absolutely um to audition email me Sean shar.com and just email a audition tape so do a do an episode of any business near you uh go to your coffee shop and just film it just so that we can get a sense of how you are on camera that's the best um nice pod I actually enjoyed these you never said that to me that was very nice thank you I enjoy these because I just enjoy hanging out those are my favorite podcasts um all right that's it great pod wonderful pod see you out there

let's go so here we go I have it here this is the Mr be secret I don't know if I should be concerned and I guess you faked going to college oh that that's the juicy one on your 100th video you wrote your stats I did do that I remember that it's not like at 100 you were rich and famous people say it takes $10,000 from master or something I'm I'm like that's when you start but you know like nobody does this right I don't understand why so we want to do an exercise to see if I can come up with a viral idea but with a budget of $1,000 yeah exactly so we're going to do a random or a generator well they're going I think this is great all right so they gave us the word grandmother so what's a viral idea with a grandmother I mean bro if you actually want like a mega [Music] Banger it do what's up how's it going boys hey how you doing let's go what I like about you is that your approach to whether it's YouTube selling chocolate losing weight whatever it is yeah you have a certain mentality I think you were differently I think in 20 years I'm going to be able to look back I'm going to show my kids and be like yeah wait before Jimmy was President you you came on my podcast we said at this little table I honestly think you're wired differently and I want to share those with audience that anybody could use whether you want to be a swimmer you want to be a YouTuber you you want to be a business person whatever I also called your assistant called your your thumbnail guy your girlfriend they didn't even tell me that what and so here we go I have it here this is the Mr B secrets and so I don't know if I should be concerned we're going to go through these These are nine of what I consider to be your rules now you could tell me if if these are [ __ ] oh are you making this a game me here you go so we're gonna play this game and each one of these is to me a rule of Mr Beast it's something we've seen about the way you operate and I want you to kind of talk about these so this is number one okay burn the boats burn so burn the boats your mom wanted you to go to college and I guess you faked going to college you pretended to go what what is the story oh that that's a juicy one so well first off we didn't have the kind of money to go to a real college so it's was just like a free Community College um but yeah my mom because she grew up pretty traditionally they you know military worked her whole life but then 2008 she lost everything when the your real estate collapsed and so lost all her savings and stuff like we we went bankrupt and had to file for bankruptcy like so she's like very paranoid she just wants her her kid to like go get a job and like not [ __ ] up and not do any she's very risk adverse and so that was a constant tug and pull because I'm like I'm going to be YouTuber or homeless and she'd be like but then you could be homeless I'm like okay I mean it is what it is I don't care um I'm going to be a YouTuber and she it just never clicked in her head and to her it's like if he doesn't get a college degree he's like my son's a failure I just wasted 18 years like he's he's not going to be able to provide so for her it was like either college or my life's ruined because that's just how her brain's wired and because she um went through so much and so when I was like I don't want to go she was just like then leave get out of the house like I can't I just can't bear the side of my son just sitting around and in you know just throwing his life away and I didn't have enough money to move out so I was like Frick and luckily the community college is so cheap it's not like she was wasting money on it so I was like okay I'll go to college and then I mean I just flat out lied to her like I was like I'll I'll do it but you know I had no intention of actually doing it and so I went just to see what it was like and I was like well maybe I'm like being a little dramatic and I went to class for like a week horrible it was so boring I mean I swear like the teacher was just reading out of the book and I was like why why do I have to I could just read the book like what are we doing you know and I said that to some of the people around me and they're like yeah that's what education is stop complaining and I'm like I just was my head hurt and so then I was like it is what it is like I have like a six-month time clock where I have to make enough money where I can move out because once my mom knows I'm I'm screwed she's gonna kick me out of the house honestly I would want to leave the house because it's I know it's going to make her depressed and and very sad and so you just didn't go after that yeah so I would go every day go and then I would just sit like this like at a really old like Dodge Durango that was super used with a lot of miles and I would just sit in the Dodge Durango and like edit videos and I film at night and i' would you come back and be like school was great yeah I was just like yeah you know she like how's college and I like you know and then and I just wouldn't tell her that I'd stop going but you burned the boats you're like all right I got six months exactly I got to either make it or [ __ ] somehow I figured it out I don't even remember um but we I had a month where I made 20 grand um right before it was time like the the window was almost up and then I just told my mom I just like I haven't been going I'm failing I found a place down the road it's 700 bucks a month sorry she's like all right hey real quick I'm trying something special for this episode let me know if you like it we were talking to Jimmy and before these episodes I do 30 40 hours of research and prep and I make detailed notes that for me make it super easy to remember all the key takeaways well for the first time I'm actually going to give those notes to you so you can get them for free in the description below it's my notes the key take aways from this episode go ahead and grab it it's down in the description below is this kind of a strategy for you where you're like I don't think it's a strategy it's more my personality I'm a very obsessive person like I If you told me to like do a hundred things I would struggle at it but if you told me to think on this one thing every second of the day for the next 10 years like I can do that pretty easily so I like to just obsess over something I like to dream about it wake up think about it think about it think about it think about it think about it more work on it work on it work on it think about it think about it dream about it and just do that every single day like that to me comes very naturally so what was your observation we just went to Walmart with Jimmy did jimy your we we haven't talked about this most your audience probably does know I sell chocolate we have a febles it's a chocolate company and um I'm sure we'll go into that at some point yeah Fe this episode is brought to you by feal so I took him to a Walmart just because it's my favorite thing to do in my free time I go walk up and down chocolate aisles and different retailers and so I brought him alone he was telling us everything about merchandising everything not just about Feasta bles but about competitive chocolate companies he was showing us like talking numbers sales dude I thought like influencers it's just like you give them a product they're like oh this okay guys hey buy this you know the chocolate game inside and out he was in the aisles like reconfiguring the SKS making everything straight I like landed in DC for a layover to them fly to North Carolina and then I got off the plane to go to my connecting flight and I was like wait a minute and I just opened up like Google Maps and I searched Walmarts and I was like I could just drive there and hit 25 Walmarts on the way home and so then I it was like 10:00 a.m. and then I just skipped my connecting I just rented a car and I drove from DC visited every Walmart on the way to North Carolina I didn't get home till like 900 p.m. and I just like it was like I the CE Hershey's has uh has done that ibly not I wonder if he's doing it and then the guy your friend who was like have you gone to Walmart with him they're like he's like yeah I don't know Jimmy has like a badge like if something's out of stock he just goes in the back and restocks it himself did they give you like do you have some way of like well it's a it's a vendor license so a lot of people have vendor license like beverage like Coca-Cola they so they have a xes Network you can fit like theoretically 10,000 chocolate bars in a pallet you can only fit 500 Cod cans so it's like a lot harder to store 10,000 cans of coke than has 10,000 chocolate bars so for that they have Coke trucks that some Walmarts they go to every single day and they'll just take the product and go put it in the back for the Walmart employes and then they'll go stock to shelves and everything so they Walmart's pretty transparent about that which I was when I first got into the cpg game I was like no shot like they're just going to let us do it but yeah if your product's out stock on the shelf and you have a vendor license you can go in the back scan hand it in and put it on the Shelf smart yeah I mean you could argue it's not a good use of your time and I don't know why I do it it's kind of therapeutic I just love going to Walmarts and fixing the product and I like just observing it like what it looks like on the Shelf seeing what the competition is doing just seeing who's grabbing it and buying it it's like those memes like men won't go to therapy but they'll do this this is your thing organize a chocolate Island Target or Walmart so let's do uh rule number two this one uh go ahead you can we can reveal this I think you know what this one is Rule of 100 I I gave it a name so this is I'm going to quote you on this so this was somebody you know I'm sure you could ask this a million times okay how do I you what advice do you have for me as a YouTuber how do I be successful on YouTube and you said this thing that to me was like every Creator should print this and put it on their Wallies everything you go look your First videos not going to get views period your make 100 videos improve something every time on the 100th one then ask questions to me that's the rule of 100 is before you come ask for advice it's like have you made 100 videos and every time try to make one thing better and that that's like also very achievable too it's not like some insurmountable thing to do it's like all right I'm going to make my intro better I'm going to make my editing better whatever it is and that and the the beauty of what you said was I think the way you said it you were like if you do that a 100 times and I say come talk to me after you've done the 100 people 99% of people just don't do it and then the 1% of people who do they don't need me after that like you figure it out which is it's more of a metaphorical mindset because that's the thing it's uh most people who like like need advice is just go do it and learn through failure I'm a big fan of just trial by fire go do it [ __ ] up a bunch of times and like get Point 1% better and then do that for a couple years I have a couple other pictures to show you so this is one this is one of your thumbnails oh God during your ride that's still on my channel so I went and I looked at your your your first 100 I was like all right let me see he said the rule of 100 let me go look at his first hund and I saw this and like today you're probably known as like one of the best smartest thumbnail people in the world right Black Ops 2 shotgun gaml with commentary PS4 or Xbox just I suck at making thumbnails which is honestly dope because most people if they feel like they're bad at something they just don't do it they they they shy away yeah uh and then you have this other one which is like your 100th video on your 100th video you wrote your stats you go oh my God subscribers I did do that I remember that 730 subscribers so on your rule of 100 it's not like at 100 you were rich and famous yeah right and honestly yeah probably 150 of them are me asking people on Xbox LIVE to subscribe like when playing Call of Duty and like a game chat I like yo subscribe to my channel so what do you see people get wrong about the rule of 100 most people just aren't as obsessed with improving things they get like pigeon hold in the box and they're like oh I just need to improve I mean this applies to everything but I guess specifically content they'll be like oh I just need to write better jokes or I need to have better camera or this and then it's it's not it's just a mindset like every single every single thing can be improved there's no such thing as a perfect video you know from I mean you can go as low as you want to like the coloring to what you're wearing to you how you speak to how long the video is to I mean there's nothing that you can't improve and so like just having that mindset where you're always trying to get better um and like applying that to everything across the board not just narrowing on on this one little thing um but also with this honestly a lot of people are mentors they just don't listen and so they they'll ask me for advice and like the ones who will listen they will take their revenue from like 30k to 400k a month or their goal subs or whatever it is I can show them how to hit it but a lot of times if people ask for advice I'll say it and it'll be like in one year and out the other and like so those are the worst I used this because I was studying um Seinfeld recently and I don't know if you know Seinfeld has this daily Seinfeld's now like 70 years old he's still like in the standup comedy game he's the only standup billionaire like ever so he's the only comedian who's a billionaire it's pretty crazy and so I was like all right what can I learn from Seinfeld and one of the things he did was he was like every day for like the last 45 years I wake up and my first two hours of the day I write he's like I write jokes he's like guess what if you want to get good at jokes you write jokes every day and he's like every day I just try to make it one better than the other they talk about writer block he's like that's nonsense he goes my rule is I sit down I don't have to write I just can't do anything else and he's like and then that makes me right and I've been doing that and he has this yellow legal pad of all the pages he ever did and he he literally laid him out on a road and he like paved the whole Road it became like a yellow brick road basically it's an incredible you know how many hours that is two hours a day for 45 years 30 30,000 hours right yeah that's you know that's the thing people say it takes 10,000 hours to master or something I'm I'm like 10,000 hours that's that's when you start you know first like that like that's the mindset you need with like the RO of 100 it's not um because 10,000 hours what is that it's only like eight hours a day every for four years yeah exactly it's not that they got crazy but to a lot of people 10 you know that's the saying 10,000 hours in your master I think it should be 100,000 hours to be honest I think 10's too easy so if Seinfeld is like locking himself in a room and saying I can't do anything but write jokes do you ever have to do that or is it no this is just what I live for yeah so I mean I just I wake up I walk in the studio and normally this whiteboard over here we erased it I guess it wouldn't be leaked but it'd have all the businesses all the prils all the bottlenecks anything I could do to push things forward and it's all listed out and there'd be probably three or 4 hundred things and then we'd go through at the start of each week and we just pick what needs to be done to what should we prioritize etc etc so it' be like Feast tables it's like you know ethical sourcing here's three things that need to be done here's all the major bottlenecks that if you stepped in you can push it Forward content toys lunch Le whatever um so that's more how I structure my days is like because we just have a lot going on and it's just like making sure what I'm working on is the most efficient thing because if there's like 10 people sitting around waiting on me to make a decision to go work that shouldn't be a Friday thing that should be a [ __ ] Monday at 9:01 a.m. thing you know what I mean so it's very even just just figure out what I need to accomplish in a week and then even the order of what we do is very important you want to do the third one yeah you want to Jimmy let's let's see this bad boy you can make anything viral so in your can we talk about your weak yeah of course the docent yeah you did a podcast on it so we want to do an exercise exercise is it a challenge challeng challenge just see uh if I can come up with a viral idea yeah exactly the problem here I'm I'm down for this the only the ironic thing is the only one here who will actually know if it's viral or not is me you're grading yourself here right it's that Meme where Obama's putting the medal on himself exactly CU you guys could be like I don't think that'll get 100 million views and I'll just go no but but here's the stipulation take a normal thing yeah make it an interesting viral idea but with a budget of a thousand because it's EAS oh Mr would just put a million on line 10 grand 10 grand okay and you you said you used to use random word generator so we gave you a random word generator if you hit uh I don't random words you can pick you can flip through a few until you find a word actual them like so to give a little context to your viewers the thing is like you could spend seven days this is something I've said on other podcast I think this drives it home I spent seven days buried alive right that got hundreds of millions of views me laying in a coffin it's like like holy [ __ ] put a coffin 10t on the ground cover with 20,000 PBS of dirt I'm literally in a coffin for a week that's that's cool that's viral that was seven days of me laying down I theoretically could have instead of doing that laid in just a bathtub for seven days no one would have gave a [ __ ] like that video would have but in theory it's the same amount of time at least from a filming perspective logistically maybe not but in theory both are me just laying down for seven days but one is super [ __ ] viral the other no one cares about and so that's like the power of ideas like an idea with the right idea you can do the exact same amount of work as a different idea but get 50 extra return so that's that's why I'm so adamant about generating good ideas all right so I just hit random create random words chocolate Chate easy they're going to think this is it's chocolate this is a random word generator BR they're not gonna they're gonna think this whole thing uh grandmother all right they gave us the word grandmother so what's a viral idea with the grandmother um that could be done for $10,000 I mean bro if you actually want like a mega Banger I would do um I uh completing a 100y old's bucket list oh so you meet a grandma Yeah I'd find a grandma I mean if you really wanted I wouldn't say I would do this but if you wanted like a viral viral video I'd find a grandmother who's like terminally ill and I'd take her and her grandkids and come you know do everything in the bucket list for him like bro idea like don't do this title but she will die in 30 days so I fulfilled all her wishes that you CL that's so good hold on we got to do another one that's okay you passed you passed the test I justo this is a lifestyle I I can make I like the magic trick drawing you want to do that one yeah drawing okay the next one he hit was drawing um I mean well so you want it for 10 grand because the first thing I thought of is for drawing is drawing the world's largest picture but that would be more than 10 grand actually weirdly enough a lot of videos go viral on YouTube where people are just like customizing phones or things like that I depends is if if I'm like a really good artist I would do like Tik toks go super viral where they like find two like a guy a couple on a street and they like sketch them but but but they they sketch them like really ugly but they like stop really beautiful people and then they they turn the artwork around they're like what the [ __ ] and those those do really well like it'll be like a very handsome guy but then it they'll do their face like really round and like with buck teeth and it's always those do really well on Tik Tok like I've seen some get 100 million views so that would be one way you could do drawing I mean even it just if you're good enough artist like and if you're not just get good and study and be good um I would like you could design like a hospital floor or something for like make a witch kids and like do like cool artwork or something um if there's like some film you could put up over draw it and like do a design that they just peel off a couple days later like that wouldn't be that expensive and that would be cool like I surprise make a wish kids with uh you know their favorite characters or something um yeah I mean the how many do you want when you're brainstorming are you usually just kind of by yourself are you like what's C like if I said you got to come up with something what would you do to set yourself up to come up with great ideas yeah CU in transparency I have teams now and so I don't I'm not as like I used to do this all myself now I pay a lot of people to do it uh and I just like work with them on the back 10% but I mean yeah I the the if you really want to come with like great ideas you need to surround yourself with other very creative people I mean I I'm not going to say their names but I have at least five people that I if I really needed to solve something I would call I'd fly them down it would be boom boom boom boom me in the middle and we we we could solve anything like creatively in terms of virality or anything like that they're just like really really good like one's good with thumbnails one's like the smartest guy I've ever met when it comes to titles another he's just a [ __ ] freak and he says the craziest stuff but it's very like inspirational and so you need like that like shotgun that's constantly shooting out stuff and then like another guy we would describe him more as like a sniper like he's not going to say much but when he says it you're like dang that's good um so yeah I just have like my go-to people who are like very creative and like yeah they just pull the best out of me it's very important you have that like I think didn't Steve Jobs call it in like creative Inc like his Think Tank yeah and they had a thing where they were like at Pixar they have a book called creativity Inc I creativity Inc yeah and he said it's not people think oh we just come up with the best ideas right away he goes no he goes the creative process is taking something that sucks and removing suck and so he's like yeah we sit there we watch the first version and it sucks and then we we trust each other enough to be like yeah that kind of sucks but here's what sucks about it go back try again try again try again he's by The End by the 10th thing we've just removed all the suck and all that's left is the good bits yeah I was just you buy that is that yeah I was just at Pixar is at the Steve Jobs building and I was just with some of the employees out there working and just seeing how they go about and like they're doing daily reviews over there which is like you know every day like what they work on they're showing to like the director and stuff and getting like real-time feedback and they're very like eess and it was very cool to like see their culture and how they go about it like CU they I mean in terms of animated films there was second to right I remember a couple years ago when we talked to you you said that coming up with ideas was still the thing that you felt like you had the most trouble handing off to anyone else it was like the thing that you still just like excelled most at and couldn't trained so many great people at that now okay yeah I mean I I have enough ideas for the next five years so that's not a ball neck at all like I have too many like uh I I would just start listing them off but then the problem is everyone would steal them so yeah yeah okay great let's go to the next all right so we have that's three of the rules number four I'll flip this one cloning yes all right so the backstory of this one is last year when we were doing our camper event it's basically a room full of business people billionaires all whatever and you started describing how you run your company and you you were 25 years old at the time you're not now you're 26 with these people double my age in 20 times the experience of me correct and so there we're listening and we're like so who is this guy why this guy's been following you around all day who is this and how do you run this how do you train people and you were like you described this process of cloning and I swear I saw like five billionaires make a note to themselves so can you describe what is your cloning principle what does that mean yeah well the thing is like as a Founder because I assume a lot of your viewers run yeah like you're constantly having to put off fires you're constantly having to do things and that's a flaw you're always going to be putting like having to work on stuff but you should view anytime you have to work on things as a flaw and it's like how do you what's the fastest way to stop working on something every time you work on it have someone on your hip and have them learn how to do it essentially clone you to do that task and so anytime I I don't ever work alone anymore because anytime I'm doing something that's a problem and like someone should be doing this in six months and so that's that's just like the cheat code to doing it um and it's cloning not training why well we would call now that I have hundreds of employees now I think we're probably closing on 500 so it's a lot more training but CL like clones are more like the all-in people who are going to like run your company one day and make high like and have the upside to like live with you and and you know cuz like someone who's making $40,000 a year they're not going to live with you and fall you around 15 hours a day and right you know but early on you had that you had people literally I still have people like that but it's like that's that's just a small subset of it so yeah of the on the core team yeah 100% it's just like the thing is the more you know about everything going on the better because a lot of what you do in one part of a one vertical business in finance or and this or that affects other parts and so the more you understand the whole business the more you understand the ripples you create across things the better efficiently and better you can do these kinds of things and so just having a clone who knows everything about the whole business as opposed to just one section just makes it where they can just make decisions so much faster and they can cut through red tape and it just makes it so much easier for you to just like because like when you're in hyper growth scale you don't know like what the next fire is going to be or the next things is to fix and so if you just have a couple versions of yourself which is so nice because it's like oh this thing over here in editing is falling apart all right clone that you followed me around for the last three years you know what I would do just go fix it you know what I mean so I don't have to go fix it every part of a company is not like it's not like you look at a thing you're like editing editing is its own thing no EDI edting is people editing right everything is people and so what I liked about the way you were doing it was I think on the outside people hear this are like follow you around all the time live with you that's crazy I would you know that's that's harsh I met the people doing it and they were like this is the greatest opportunity exact I came here for this I wanted to I want to be great he's given me the opportunity to be great not everybody wants this I want this you can either go to college for like not even four years go to college for three years or you can follow Sean around for three years and like just all day every day and the version of you that follows Shan around for 3 years will make way more money you'll be way more experienced way more valuable to him or you could just go to any one of his competitors and you'll make 10 times more than if you guys have you ever heard the Warren Buffett cloning story no so Warren Buffett when he was young he wanted to learn investing right so he goes to the guy who wrote the book on investing Benjamin Graham and he's like uh Mr Graham I wanna I'm I'm Warren Buffett I'm a big fan of your work I want to work for you I will work harder than anyone you know and you know what I'm willing to work for you for free because I this matters so much I want to learn from you and Ben Graham goeson your price is too high and he was waren was like surprised and later he's like he was to so right I got so much more out of working every day at Ben Graham's hip than him getting my free labor actually the value exchange was like completely he was correct and I that always stuck with me because it's so true like dude how do you if you want to learn that's the best way you could possibly learn and as a Founder you know ultimately you you want judgment to scale so it's like if people in your company can think think what would Jimmy do and get the right answer now you got two jimmies right you know like for the most part they make decision and then other times it should be like what would Jimmy do okay Jimmy's not always right in this instance he's an idiot let's go call him out on it what will he say when I tell him what I'm actually gonna do yeah and then they think even one step further which is like my like long-term clones are great they'll be like okay well Jimmy's gonna want data back he's not going to care about an opinion so I'm going to just go do all the research and grab the data and then they'll they'll ask me something and they'll say blah blah and they'll be like I knew you were going to say that and they'll hand me things I'll be like well what about this over there I knew you were going to say that I'll be like oh great and by the way it's not just you even other there was like a guy he was also cloning people he's like yeah I'm the I'm the main guy for this part of the business so I need to be training people so this is how I'm doing it Zer to one is so difficult but then one to three you know like is is so much easier so that's like the hard part is like training that for like downloading I'll pick thing like writing the videos right like obviously I used to write all the videos myself taking all that and getting where someone else could do it without all keeping the essence of like what makes it viral makes it good and not feeling too corporate and scripted because we're not scripted Etc like going from 0 to one that took like five years but then you know him training the next two people's great because I don't have to do it and he trains those two and those two train the next and so it's just like that first clone is so imperative and then they could do the rest that's great you want to do the next one all right sure possible is possible [ __ ] yeah impossible is possible all right so this is I asked your uh I'm friends with Rohan the guy who runs your Tik Tok yeah I go tell me the thing where you realize like this guy's built different this guy thinks differently than than a normal person would I was like that's the story I want he goes he goes I don't know how to explain it this is the quote Jimmy will give you an impossible mission but he'll say it in a way that makes it seem totally possible and then he leaves the room and you're like God damn this is impossible he goes for example Jimmy came to me and said I need 10 million Tik Tok followers a month Ron he goes and every month I told Jimmy it's impossible like a hundred times and he told me do it 500 times he told me to do it 500 times I think we had two months where you million that's what he told me he goes he goes I he goes I didn't do it most months but I did do it like you know two months and we got way further than we ever would have got had he not laid down like kind of this impossible Gauntlet so yeah that's one story I'm sure there's like a thousand of these but like do you live by this I guess how would you how would you talk about that U well I don't try to just give people kpis that I think aren't possible just to torture them I just like I think most people they're when you ask them to do something like very incredibly difficult like what I first did I want to bury myself alive for a week like People's First inclination is just that's not possible and like technically almost anything is possible it's so it's just like so my first thing is just like why do you say that like let's go through the Gambit and then they'll always be like well it's just not possible and then you just have to be like go do the [ __ ] research and then they'll come back and it's like is it too expensive because we can figure out ways is it too unsafe or we can navigate safety or whatever it is and so it's like I hate when people tell me something can't be done just tell me the cost and like what the problems are Bott yeah and then if like then let's look at those and objectively if it's too expensive or something that's not worth investing time into or what then that's fine then I'll kill it but just tell me something because like half the stuff I did if I just listened to people and they told me it wasn't POS like I wanted Eiffel Tower for a video not possible why why why is that not possible go get the [ __ ] Eiffel Tower like until the head of the president of France tells you no it's possible like I don't then when he says no ask his kids see if they have some sway to give him while you're on the phone like we just filmed a video where we had the three pyramids of Egypt and we were like um you know spending like we were there for 100 hours this crazy video we explored the pyramids like my favorite video ever same thing like you can't just have the three pyramids I'm like did did Egypt tell you that like what do you mean go make some phone calls you know what I mean and it's just constantly even today when I'm not with my core group that I've trained very well it's just always like you can't do that or no or they'll go make a phone call or okay fine Jimmy we'll go try to get the pyramids they'll go away they'll come back a day later can't have the pyramids I'm like who' you call this tourist guy who like works at the pyramids I'm like okay call the head of Tourism like how do you get their number okay well that's different you didn't ask me how to get the head of tourism's number you asked me you just told me it was not possible like so now like please don't do that again like we got to figure out what the problems are let's figure it out and then we make calls and you figure it out and next thing you know it's and so it's just like that's a big thing that you have to like if you really in my opinion want to innovate and do things that are you know have never been done before in push boundaries you have to like have a mindset amongst your people that it's not nothing is impossible it's just how much does it cost how do you do it and then you just make an objective decision it seems to me like when you solve these impossible problems you have to think on like a lower level rather than a higher level have you heard the story of Elon getting his Rockets from Texas to Florida where they launch them no the so the normal way everyone gets their Rockets to Florida is on a barge right but it takes like 3 months and cost a bunch of money did he fly it there he drove it there he's like no we're going to drive it instead and they're like well it's way too big like first answer was it's impossible can't do it yeah he said let's go and he has a great line which is uh physics are the only laws everything else is a suggestion and he's like is it physically impossible to get it to Florida no okay we agree on that great now let's continue to figure out where the bottleneck is and it's like oh the boat too long too expensive whatever and and so you know oh well it's impossible to get it through overpasses and so they he's like what would be the shortest way to get there without encountering a single overpass so they go they do this like extremely circuitous all on back roads and they're like but even if we do that there's still a problem with power lines and telephone wires and so they have like some of the smartest people on Earth driving in a van in front of these Rockets with big poles and they just push up the telephone wires go under and then they go to the next telephone and it's just like you just have to like approach it like a caveman almost to like beat the impossible do you find that's the case a lot yeah quite a bit and a lot of it is just a willingness to it's just people who have love what they do and and people who really love problem solving we we you know figure these things out and so it's just having the right person in the right seat at the right time who like actually wants to go deep and like people there are certain people where you give them something that seems impossible and they will be Giddy and they'll like [ __ ] yeah I can't wait like I have people like that where I could call and be like what's something they don't wake up until it's until it's hard uh well it's like uh I guess if I wanted a different world wonder if I was like I want the Taj Mahal for a week right there like people I com I called and said that like I promise you they would smile be like okay like they' see that as a challenge they'd go to war to figure it out and then not in my company but just there are other people that you would say that and oh my God you know and so you just got to get the right people who just deeply enjoy solving problems and like see it as a challenge and like like there there are people built that way and those are the people that really succeed in that environment and even a different example that's not getting the Taj Mahal or the Eiffel Tower one of my favorite videos of yours where I the first time I was like all right respect before I met you I was like okay respect was uh Ben was telling me about you and he go he he made a video said I'm going to cut through this table with a plastic knife oh my gosh I remember this weirdly very well I was sitting in uh high school and I just like I had a I don't know after lunch I just had a I put the uh plastic knife in my pocket for some reason I don't remember why and then I just put my hand in pocket I was like oh plasting knife and then I just started like scraping against the desk and I was like oh well I'm like kind of like I could cut this desk in half like just like your stupid little high school desk I just did this for like 5 minutes till like the teacher was like what the [ __ ] are you doing stop and then I just was like looking at the little indention I was doing the calculations in my head I was like it would take me like 10 hours to cut through this according to my math I was like [ __ ] it I think that would be like a video where people would be interested so I went to the store on the way home and I bought like uh a thousand plastic like the cheapest plastic knives I could find and then I just got this like $20 foldout table and I just went in my room hit recording the camera and I just went it down cuz the plastic knives would get dull after like a minute and I was just cutting through it and I think that I think that took 12 hours to cut through the table of plastic night or something but that's what I'm saying it was no money it was no money it wasn't Taj Mahal it was like creativity or well first boredom boredom is the key this like how Einstein well and it's like so dumb it's just like like that how many laks does it take to get to a center of tisi how many plastic knives does it take to cut a table have just like people were like what a [ __ ] you do with one by the way or probably thousands gotta that's insane um by the way that's a spoiler I think that one we kind of copied number eight which is no no doesn't mean no way and there's a big difference between no possible is possible and no doesn't mean no exact same thing yeah and I like the clarification you had which was like you're not just like the [ __ ] boss that's like I need this impossible thing done you know whatever it's more like hey I want to do this impossible thing or I want to do this great thing no okay let's get curious before we just like make a decision here why well let's try to understand it and if it truly is no which it rarely is fine but it's usually not and then the cool thing is if you do that in the company do it once people are like oh wow that interesting do it twice by the third time you do it people like all right like that's the way right it's contagious of time it's like a religion people start to believe when they when they see it right you're emplo for me it tends to take a couple dozen times for well I'll keep pointing at it I'm like you guys remember what we said and then what happened let's like yeah let's again let's take that in that's a rally cry for us now like we can do all these things right let's let's that all right we got three more to go here we go Consultants or she code yeah and honestly because I wrote this there referencing my thing I wrote a couple years ago I would update that just say like experienced people or cheat codes the right ones like because it doesn't because like my uh H handbook I guess if that's what you would call it leaked on Twitter and like you Go's Your Hand by production Bible uh so many people were like consultants and even Consultants are like putting this on their website like even Mr endorsed on LinkedIn like so many consultant tweets are like yes he validated our industry and I'm like well I wasn't specifically talking about McKenzie you know um it's just more like you know especially with us because we do so many random weird things I mean d what did I say in here Consultants are literally cheat cods need to make the world's largest slice of cake start off by calling the person who has made the previous world's largest slice of cake LOL he's already done countless tests and can save you weeks worth of work I really want to drill this point home because I'm a massive believer in Consultants because I've spent almost a decade of my life hyper obsessing over YouTube I can show a brand new Creator how to go from 100 subscribers to 10,000 in a month on their own it would take them years to do it consults are a gift from God please take advantage of them in every single freaking task assigned to you always always always ask yourself first if you can find a consultant to help you exactly because we do so many weird different things like oh we're GNA Bury Me Alive called David Blaine he buried himself alive you know what I mean like uh because how's that phone call go uh great they're usually like well we don't have David bl's phone number and I'm like okay I'll DM on Instagram and I'm like here's his phone over call him figure out how he didn't die you know but you do these things like uh one night I was just hanging out at my house get a call North Carolina number pick up oh yeah it's us I go on walks and then I just like I will literally just close my eyes and like flip through my contacts and I'll like stop and you know when it's on S you'll be there and I'll just be like H I'll just tap a random name and I'll be teach me something sometimes the calls are one minute other times they 20 and um yeah it's like you got to always be learning I feel like you're saying that almost like it's a normal thing you know like nobody does this right like that's like I don't understand why that's I kind of started to steal it because I was like why not I'm also like I'm obsessed with learning yeah and oh sometime like maybe the mechanics of it I was confused I was like so I call these people then I just say like hey teach me something stop yeah teach me something what's what's something what's funny is the more you do it the more people come to expect it too so like I'll call someone they won't answer and then they'll be like let me guess you're on a walk sorry I'm busy and then I'm like I don't even have to respond to just get it like you know cuz at the start you'll you know you'll go on a walk and you'll call 20 people and you have conversations with 10 cuz you know these High Caliber people are always busy and the other 10 will call you throughout the next 24 hours and it's like a nuisance because you gotta be like I I was just born on a walk I was just born on walk so but now they everyone just gets it protocol yeah yeah they're just like yeah so it's like so funny that I become known for that and like people will answer and like sometimes I won't even say anything they'll be like all right here's what I've learned and it's like great because then I just like these are people who are you know some of them running companies are doing billions of dollars a year in revenue and they're learning tons of things are always experimenting and I just get this F minute brain dump of everything they learn suck it out of them and then I'm like here's what I learned cuz I always a big part of this if you wanted to go well is you have to add as much value ideally more than what they're giving to you so I try to help them in any way I can and then um and then you hang up you go to the next one another one that is in the kind of Consultants art cheat codes is we do these talks at our event so at our basketball event it's kind of like play ball all day till we're like dead tired and then at night it's like we're hanging out and the first year we did it I remember cuz I I created the events I was kind of the host I was like I don't want to be like forcing like a conference Vibe I was like really like tiptoeing around I was like I don't want this to be awkward but it was actually more Awkward cuz nobody knew who anyone else was and you did this great thing you like grabbed the chair you put it in the middle of the room you're like hey sit down real quick you go all right uh who are you what's your story and then they would like start to tell like a long-winded story but what I liked was you would have questions so like we had a real estate guy and instead of being like all right teach me about real estate which the guy doesn't know how to start you were like if I had $10 million what would be the best best way to turn it into a 100 through real estate yeah and then he talked for like 5 minutes you're like cool God it I should just give it to somebody like you makes sense on to the next and I was like I love the power of kind of like the right question the right person and honestly in group settings like that another thing too is just not being afraid to cut people off because some people are just so not aware that like there's 20 people and you've been rambling for 30 minutes and I'm like I feel like they got another 15 in them and three of those people are on their phone those two are checked out those five are too nice to anything I'll be the one who like hey we get it all right I got the next one block out the Noise Okay block out you want to do block out the noise sure so here's the quote when you're small people say you're too obsessed you're a weirdo get a life be realistic this is from you people will try to convince you that you're out of your mind for wanting to do this then when it works yo your drive your tenacity that was great yep everything you guys have uh been flattering me with throughout this podcast are the exact same things I got lowkey bullied for in high school it's like hilarious that now these grown men are like yo this is [ __ ] awesome you're like all in impossible is not possible no doesn't mean no and you just like love this [ __ ] and like and in high school that'ss what a [ __ ] nerd get a life like Loser yeah that's why that's why you call it block out the noise right because the same things that people admire when you're successful are the are the things that people are even trying to tell you to stop if you had listened you wouldn't be Mr Beast right we wouldn't be here right now everyone else and yeah just normal job but the thing is it's like it's the big takeaway is it just means you're not around the right people right cuz like obviously if I was around you guys when you were younger I'm sure you guys wouldn't have been like oh what a weird upsets nerd you would have been like yo this is sick let's grow together or we would you know maybe when we were 18 we would have that much emotional intelligence but we would have like flocked together so it's it's also just finding the right people to be around and if you're having to block out a lot of noise then you're just like you have a serious problem it's a signal yeah like you really got to change who you are because that's really yeah I mean if you're the smartest person you're hanging around make you know the the one with the most ambition and everyone else is just bringing you down like you're literally just going through your entrepreneurial life with like a 10 PB weight Shackled to your leg Yeah last one let's go into reinvest everything yes sir can I give you my my version of this I think people know you reinvest a lot of money to almost e comical extents like we made 100 Grand last month great we're investing 101 this next month like Jimmy where'd you get the extra thousand I got the largest unscripted streaming deal in history and somehow lost a ton of money on it these games you talk about yeah when we were the first time somebody was like you know what he thinks his kind of like his Edge I go his Edge is that he takes all the money he makes and then he reinvests it he takes all the hours he has and he invests it into the channel then he gets the best people and he like gets them to believe that they should invest it and he doesn't ever want to quit I don't think this guy's gonna like get rich and retire like every other YouTuber I was like that's like a kamakazi level of commitment like I I don't think that's used to call it a kamakazi commment like because how do you what do you do what do you do with somebody who's willing to just like allow it all back in like that's a that's not the person I would want to compete against um so that's kind of I guess that's why to me this is a I mean you just described it perfectly I don't even have to say anything like yeah I mean ideally you find the passion that you love and you're all in and it's um you know you shouldn't have to like force yourself to go get up and WR it should just be what you love to do you know what's the uh CFO telling you as you Des at the beginning now now it's kind of known but at the beginning when you were describing your approach so you felt was like your mom at the beginning right uh yeah well I mean at the beginning it was me and my mom and a couple friends were high school so she was 10 jobs I was 20 jobs um I mean now they just start I mean people kind of normalize to your weird craziness so they're more that's now what at the beginning what was that like I mean everyone thought it was deranged you know like oh why why do you like because I mean I everyone you know a big budget YouTube video used to be 10 grand I was the first one to ever spend a million dollars on a video in two million this is uh this is probably the best example right like yeah I got a brand deal for $10,000 bro you keep saying CFO like I had a CFO back like you know what this was this was me and like paying a guy I went to high school with like 10 bucks an hour to help me um but I like m going mom what taxes help I didn't make money do I pay taxes and she's like yes and I'm like [ __ ] um but uh yeah we I got a brand deal for $10,000 and then I just went outside like this I used to live like two minutes like the $700 a month apartment I was telling you about or duplex was like literally 2 minutes down the road from this and so I just got the 10 grand I was like wire me the money they wired it withd drew it and gave it to the Suess guy inside the street were you not tempted to like have money for the first time pocket five give away five so I pocket five spend on a different video what else do what else do you do with the money it's like uh there's a story of Zuck when he got offered a billion dollars for Facebook early on and they were like Mark we should talk about this and he's like oh if I got this money I would just start a new social media platform and I like the one I had I like the one I had this is like legendary yeah and it's the same thing here it's like I could pocket it but I just make different videos and I just want to film this one I mean it's literally the same thing it reminds me a lot reading about Walt Disney this is what he was famous for because his brother Roy podcast on it thank you was like the business a Roy would like pull his hair out of like Walt can we please just like save some money and he had like a compulsion almost to take all the money he he like felt bad keeping any money he's like no it has to go into making better shows do you feel that like does it it has nothing to do with like wanting to keep it really has nothing to do with money itself it's just I want to make the best product possible and so it's like here's the product I want to make and I'm always having to settle because we can't spend 10 billion dollars on a YouTube video you know what I mean like because there I would love to go buy everything in every single store in this entire city and donate it all to charity you know that'd be $200 million so I can but so it's just like it's more you know like this is what I want to make but I have to dial back and it's like well now we have a little bit more money so I just diad back less there's not I don't really care you know what I mean like so by the way you just came up with that number yeah I was like he's done the math this you look at this well I know it cost $15 million to BU everything in Walmart but yeah 15 million have you have you done that is that one of the things nice I think that's a [ __ ] Banger and we're donate all to charity so it's cool what what's your like ambition right so it's like Ben in 40 years is doing the pod on don't ask me 40 ask like 10 40 too far you're going to give me anxiety okay what's like the what's the dream dream right now I can't do 40 because but but for the like next five the big thing I'm focusing on which I was telling you guys about in the car is just febles why people what can you explain about your business Empire can specifically what chocolate might seem so Random why is the largest YouTube in the world selling chocolate well right now 70% of the world's Coco comes from West Africa kotar and Ghana and majority of the uh people who work on those Farms are actually kids or like child labor so it's like 46% of Labor so I guess it's not majority so I should correct this statement 46% of Labor is illegal child labor yeah I'll this while you talk so um when I got into selling chocolate I just learned about that and I talked to like exact big chocolate company as I was like so what I hear like this child labor thing like is this just like we're just cool with this and like well it's just tell's always been and there's not really anything you can do about it I'm like that's the way things have always been I literally I said to one I think I don't remember the exact I'm g a butcher but I was like elon's putting like gonna put people on Mars and you're telling me we can't not have little kids farming or chocolate we can't just find people over the age of 18 or whatever and they're like well it's not that simple and I'm like what the [ __ ] so that kind of like pissed me off and Rule Number Eight yeah set me down I'm like yeah what you mean to say is that would hurt the billions of dollars in free cash flow you're spitting off in your margins but anyways um so I was like I went down that path like two years ago I was like okay well I don't you actually went to West Africa oh yeah the but before even that it's just like so then I was we're going to start referencing our piece of paper here so then Consultants are cheat code so I was like what is the largest ethically storage Chocolate Company in the world who the ones doing it right so have you heard of Tony shalone yeah yeah yeah so they're they're great it's it's a Europe opinan brand but they're like a reporter used to call out CH big chocolate and be like there's a lot of child labor you guys aren't ethical and like they would just ignore him and so then he's like [ __ ] it he started it right yeah and he started a chocolate company um and that's Tony's chocol because like the lonely and it became like a $200 million business it's doing pretty well and um so I was like let me get in contact with these people and I just started talking to them I flew them here to Greenville like the next week we were just like I was like teach me everything about child labor how we can remediate it what should we be doing on our Farms Etc and like I just had like phone calls with them every single day studied and then the next five companies that are also doing ethical things I just absorbed everything they're all doing into my brain and I was like cool all right I know what we need to do step one like the main reason why there's child labor is just poverty like you like most these farmers are making a dollar less a day so like if you're getting paid a dollar how can you hire someone that's over the age of 18 to work on your farm so you end up just using kits cuz they're cheap or free free so uh step one is you you just have to pay them a living income so 100% of our farmers are paid a living income so I can go super deep I'm gonna keep this Mile High because I know not everyone is as passionate about the chops and Industry as me but this is what I live and breathe but uh to so what is a living income right because obviously a living income in America is completely different than in West Africa so there's a living income reference price where they look at the cost of like bread and living and inflation and it's like you know if a farmer sells you like a metric tons of cocoa they need to make this for them to be able to live roughly and be able to so we pay 100% of our Farmers living income reference right so there could be an instance where you're a farmer and you give us a shipping container of cocoa and you're like you know we want $1,100 I'm like no you want $1,300 it's $1,300 now make sure there's no kids on your Farms you know what I mean like uh or kids in illegal child labor um and so that's uh I mean I'm oversimplifying everything none of the this is a very complex thing and there's these we're talking about tens of thousands of farms there's millions of farms there and this is none none of this is as simple as I'm portraying it but I'm just doing my best to generalize it all so you pay your Farmers living income all our beans are fair trade certified and then we work with clrm which is the child labor reiation system and then they routinely audit the Farms interview the parents interview the kids see if the kids are going to school working on the farm Etc and then if you know they identify cases of child labor following up and getting the kids out of the child labor and stuff like that which all the and then we also just little things because it's since it's all a root of poverty the more money you help them make the easier it is for them to you know stop using a little child they run the farm so you have coaches that will like represent 200 farms and they'll help them get more yield and like educate them on things they could be doing to grow more for trees or have more trees or we you know occasionally give them wheelbarrows or things like that so they can just I mean a little something as simple as a wheelbarrow I mean it's a big difference between carrying 10 caca pods theoretically again generalizing everything or being able to carry 40 and a will like that's technically makes you four times more efficient um it's not again making up numbers yeah so like goal is just to make feals the largest ethically sour CH company world and you know if we can do a billion dollars a year in chocolate sales ethically while being profitable then I can use that as a model to you know on my videos talk about big chocolate and all the unethical things they're doing and just be like look it's possible to be profitable to not do it at scale there's no excuse besides they just don't care and then you know we'll see what happens when I get to that point last year when I was here uh I asked I think your your right-hand guy at that time I was like what's what y'all's Focus for the year and most people don't have an answer at the tip of your tongue his his was like instantaneous goes um I think you had a number of the number of YouTube videos 22 or something 26 make 26 bangers sell a lot of chocolate get jacked and he said it like that fast every day all three and you got in great shape from the last time can you uh yeah I was it was I still fat last year or was that the first year no first first year was I mean I fat but like you know a [ __ ] W that was 240 lbs yeah I'm right now I'm 190 so I probably you had started LIF at the last one we did and in this year you're like like so year one I was 240 lb year two I was probably 215 220 lb and now I'm 190 so yeah I'm like probably 25 pounds lighter I can't wait to ball how did you what did you do like what was your approach to get injected or like how did you approach it just I I'm very heavily influenced by the people around me like if I spent too much time with you I'll start speaking like you acting like you thinking like you so I'm very cautious of that so I just put a lot of Jack people around me and then like my my metric of success was like how frequently are random people just handing me chicken breasts or like you know high in protein like you know cuz like there you know all all the like my old friend group you know all the time they'd be like oh we just ordered pizza or this or that and it's like it just makes accomplishing my goals so much harder and it's like the the ratio of people ordering pizza to the ratio of people ordering protein was just way off I mean this is just how I analyze my life because I I like I'm so all in on business like I don't think about this kind of stuff so I need an environment that just makes being jacked very naturally like the weightlifting is pretty easy you just go to the gym 45 minutes 5 days a week but it's the yes the food that that is a that's not a thing you turn on and off that's a thing that you have to be consistent on for a very long period if you want to achieve results and like I just I can't think about like that every single day and I just and it's like there are just times where I'm at low points and it's just a lot harder to be disciplined and I just know if like you know I always have people who are just eating healthy it's just it it takes something that feels hard and kind of makes it fun like when you're doing it together and like like you know and it's just so just surround myself with other people trying to accomplish the same thing just like anything in life this is I was living in Australia and I literally bought a plane ticket with no plan one way to San Francisco because I was I at this Tony Robbins event and he said proximity Is Power dang love it did you like hire anyone too to help you do you have like a trainer around or a coach or he follows me around all day every day he's a jack dude sitting downstairs you'll notice he's he's the one who looks like he could be on a bodybuilding stage yeah usually in a tank top you somebody just sent me this you posted Tik Tok an hour ago yeah I just got out of a meeting with a bunch of billionaires Tik Tok we mean business this is my lawyer right here we have an offer ready for you we want to buy the platform America deserves Tik Tok give me a seat at the table let me save this platform Tik Tok yeah are you gonna buy Tik Tok I tweeted out yesterday that uh I was thinking about buying Tik Tok and honestly kind of as a joke and then I had you a lot of people coming to this event so many billionaires text me I mean I'm probably up to like 35 who have like unironically reached out like I want to put money and I want to do it and then like two separate groups that have like very serious bids together for it also are like yo get involved in this and I'm like my phone just blew up ever since that tweet so then I made that Tik Tok because it's like yeah I was joking but now it's like oh okay I'll predict it right now this I think this is going to happen because I think it should happen it'd be smart right any ownership group that's doing this would be smart to have you involv as long as Tik tok's will to sell yeah everyone interested in buying it once they get us involved yeah I don't know the political side like how what's how that's all going to to be forced to divest but if they are yeah that's gonna it's gonna be banned if they don't it's just a question of like is Tik Tok in the sell or not yeah what would you do oh God bro we just we're rinding the podcast down are you really about to start another five hour talk um truthfully I would have to surround myself with like the 10 greatest algorithmic people in the world and I'd have to spend like a week with them and just like absorb like I have no idea what I would do right now Jimmy this has been a pleasure it's fun thanks for doing it man uh excited to hoop I basketball camp five we'll do another one every two years we do we like the Olympic Cycles every two years Elon mus Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg in the other room we got a uh you got to crank out this podcast I'm going ball with them all right boys we did it all right out of here than thanks [Music] boys e

okay I have an amazing story if you're if you're entrepreneurial Sam if you have a pulse in your body if there is a blood single blood vessel in your body you are going to be fired the [ __ ] up after this I don't know what you got what do you have scheduled after this cancel [Music] it all right let's hear it what is it all right so you probably heard of this company boom Super Sonic yes yeah uh I had the opportunity to invest in this company years ago and I didn't have any money then but also I even if I did I would have passed on this it's it's a it's a ridiculous proposition I didn't have any courage then either that was the real problem well like a guy said that a guy Silicon Valley said he's going to build a commercial airline uh he's going to build a jet that can be a supersonic commercial airplane right that sounds ridiculous exactly so the the thing that's going viral right now is former like Groupon product manager cuz he worked at Groupon is LinkedIn literally goes Groupon product manager then created the first supersonic jet in like you know whatever 56 years so it's this insane jump on LinkedIn and that's kind of going viral right now got me curious because I remember back in the day this was 2016 did you see the deal I I wasn't it didn't it's not like somebody sent it to me to invest I could have if I chased it down and then actually several times since then I could have invested but I didn't um maybe not too late maybe now's the time but I remember watching demo day do you remember this story do you remember his demo day pitch at ycy demo day I didn't know he went through YC I didn't pay that close attention to it so he went through y combinator exactly went through white combinator now I remember at the time it stood out now YC does a lot more like moonshot type of companies back then it was all apps it was all software you're making an iPhone app you're making like a B2B SAS tool and this is 16 16 and there was this one guy there who was like we're creating supersonic air travel uh you're going to be able to fly from New York to London in three and a half hours that's what we're doing remember the Concord we're going to do that again and um he gets on stage and I remember thinking while he's pitching I'm like how is he going to have traction because every YC pitch ends the same where they show their user growth we're growing 30% week over week but it's like going from like you know 3 to 6 to 9 right like it's like they have some crazy growth rate but it's on a small customer base but that's always the pitch so I remember wondering what's this guy going to do and at the very end of his pitch he whips out a piece of paper and he goes and as of last night we have five billion in pre-orders thanks to Virgin thanks to Richard Branson and virgin and we were like what 5 billion and it was like an L he had an Loi it wasn't actually a purchase order which basically just says uh one day if you can actually build a safe supersonic jet we will definitely buy it we will maybe buy it is what it means right like when somebody invites me to like a party I don't want to go to I'm going to start sending Lois because an Loi just means I'm generally interested but I'm probably not going to do it right but still it was impressive five billion still to this day nobody's walked into YC demo day with5 billion dollar worth of letters letter of intet so okay I remember seeing that then he disappeared for a while then he actually had to go do the work all right so imagine Landing a call with Richard Branson from a cold email one founder one of our listeners they did that and the HubSpot for startups team just launched a Playbook sharing exactly how it was done and not only that but also a killer report on fundraising for Founders so you could steal Ava's cold email Playbook you can get the insight into what investors want and the top Tech stack across Founders and so much more I can't stress this enough how crucial this is if you're looking to get into networking and to raise money right now now get the link in the description below now back to the show so let me tell you this guy's story because right now in Silicon Valley there is a buzzword actually I would say it's kind of like an early buzzword like I would be buying stock in this buzzword because it's about to go mainstream and that word is high agency you've seen High agency floating around no but that is is high agency the new contrarian oh it is I mean it shits on cont contan dude where contrarian walked we have to sell democratize democrati is done that was my grandfather we have the short contrarian we're going all in on high agency wait long high agency the man in the arena has that just plummeted had a moment had a moment uh but chamoff just butchered that one so that one's done so all right so check this out so high agency is this word and there's uh our buddy George Mack by the way is like all in on high agency like he I think he's writing book High agency right now I he by the way he bought the domain high agency.com and I was like how'd you get that he goes the guy let it expire after 10 years and I sniped it right away I was like very low agency move High agency by him low agency by the other right the it's like in football the low man wins no no in business the high agency man wins and so um the classic meme which we should put on the screen on YouTube is guy is the cartoon guy is trapped on an island and he has these like pieces of bark or wood or whatever and he he spells out help he's waiting for someone to come save him that's the low agency guy and the high agency guy takes the wood and makes a boat and rows away um right so that that's like the the gist of this okay but this guy this dude from boom supersonic what's his name Blake he is just absolutely dripping with agency all right so take this out he's guy is soaked this guy is a yeah he's a buffalo wing and he is tossed hand tossed hi all right so here we go story starts he drops out of high school his parents sent him to a good high school like a nice private school and he doesn't feel like he fits in he doesn't really look like uh get that interested in class he drops out and um so now he's high school dropout Blake parents are kind of concerned he ends up finding something that he's really into like science and math like he in this like after school program or there's some [ __ ] like that but forget that first High agency move once he started getting interested in science math engineering he's like actually I think I do like school I just didn't know what I I just didn't like my high school the way I was doing it but now I found I actually do like to learn I want to go to college well how do you go to college you don't have a high school degree or a high school dropout he finds that at Carnegie melon they have a special program for high school dropouts who want to go to Carnegie melon so he applies it he applies as a junior and he writes an essay about why you have to write an essay why you didn't finish high school and he writes High School had nothing left to teach me he gets in not only does he get in he gets the merit scholarship and he graduates with a know bachelor in computer science okay so what does he do next his next move is that he's like I want to be an entrepreneur but I don't know what idea I want to start yet so why don't I go and work for who I think is the greatest entrepreneur right now and that was Jeff Bezos in 2001 so Amazon is out the do crash just happened Amazon's stock is in the tank I that's what I'm betting you're looking that up right now 2001 it was I mean it was [ __ ] it was uh uh a dollar now it's $273 great so he joins Amazon in 2001 and his goal is to learn as much as he can from basa so he's like all right I got to build something that's of interest to basos and at the time Bezos had an idea which was like hey we need to we need Amazon products to show up number one in Google search results so Blake builds this automated system where he is um buying Google ads for every single product on Amazon like the entire catalog he builds an auto bidder so that Amazon will bid not too much but bid enough to be the top result on Amazon which is one of the reasons by the way that like the you know there's like stories of like there's a story that a company wants you to know and then there's a story that actually happened and I've read a lot about Amazon and one of the one of the make or break moments was the fact that they were one of Google's biggest Spenders and they crushed it and knocked it out the park because Google was under and they were able to get big fast because people think all these companies are competitors they're also co-conspirators right Google pays Apple buil tens of billions of dollars to be the default search engine Apple in uh Microsoft invested in apple when they were big competitors Bill Gates basically kind of Saved Apple at at a time when Steve Jobs needed investment and in this case Amazon is the biggest spender on Google like you know that oh what I thought these guys were competitors and Bezos was one of the Angel Investors of Google or something like that exactly so he builds this system by 24 now he's 24 years old three years in and he was basically working under direct view of basos so he goes every three months I had to give Bezos a report on how we were doing and by the age of 24 he's running a $300 million p&l in inside of Amazon he's the he's the GM of that business but even though he's learned a bunch and he uh kind of you know cut his cut his teeth here he wanted to be an entrepreneur so he quits even though he's like a rising star at Amazon and he knows Amazon is like a Amazon's a winner right Amazon was a winner if he had done nothing else but just stay at Amazon get promoted as an exact keep getting stock options every year he would have made hundreds of millions of dollars essentially risk-free at that point yeah but he quits and him and some guy uh decide to create a start so they create a startup it kind of fails they create another startup eventually they sell that startup to Groupon and this is where the LinkedIn part of Groupon comes in is like this hilarious quote on on hisp on his group on LinkedIn description so he says what he does like you know senior whatever manager of this thing and then his description goes nothing like working on internet coupons to make you year for doing something that you truly love so he after two years at Groupon he quits and he decides you know what I want to do a company I don't know what I want to do it in and his whole life he had been interested in Flight he talks about like when he was a kid he was always interested in model airplanes his parents took him to a museum he was always obsessed with flight one of his things on his bucket list was that you know in his 20s he wanted to go Mack 2 like he got his pilot's license he always just was interested in flight but it was a hobby and he's trying to think of what startup ideas to do and his method for figuring this out is I'm going to write a list of all the ideas starting with what would be the most awesome if I did it down from there and then I'll just probably cross out the first five because they're unrealistic or impractical and I'll probably do number five on the list was his plan but number one was create a supersonic jet because like Elon um the way Elon started SpaceX you've heard the story where he went into it like it thinking this is not going to work well but even before that he s you know he sell uh PayPal sells Elan now has $180 million he leaves and he's just curious like what okay what else and he's curious um what's the latest with NASA's Mars mission like I haven't heard about our Mars mission like are we is it in progress and I just missed it is it launching soon I can't wait to go see it maybe I'll fly there and go see it I want to see the launch I love rockets and goes on the NASA website and there's no mention of Mars and he's like what we went to the moon like in whatever 73 like how are we not where's the next mission and it wasn't even on the website and he's like what and he got so upset by that that the start of SpaceX was actually that he was going to privately fund a mission to send like a plant to Mars and then it became like a turtle or jelly or something there was like you know some living some technically living thing and it was like I'm going to spend $25 million doing this was just like a stunt and uh just to kind of like reinvigorate the interest in this same way this guy Blake puts on a Google alert for supersonic jet he's like I I just can't wait till there's a supersonic flight I'll be the first guy to buy it and he's waiting and he's waiting he's like is nobody working on this and he's like oh it must be that it just doesn't the numbers don't the math ain't math it like that's got to be the problem so he creates a spreadsheet and in it he writes down the assumptions he's like basically like the engineering assumptions and he gives himself like a few months to work on this where he's like all right let me just dig into this so I think it was two weeks where he does like he goes and buys a book cuz he's like I I don't know anything about how airplanes fly but he goes and buys a book and he creates an Excel spreadsheet on one tab was the cost model he's like is it an economic problem because the the brief history is is we had this thing called the Concord back in the day have you ever seen the Concord like a have you ever looked at photos of it it looked great photos yeah slick and it was like inspiring and everybody loved it and it was the same idea you could get from you know here to London New York to London in three and a half hours is yeah it was like three and a half hours or 3 hours and 45 minutes was the fastest time ever which double the speed so it's 8 hours normal flight so it was twice you could fly twice as fast and the idea was the Concord was like this luxury item in a way it was priced really expensive so this is you know almost 50 years ago that it was invented but you know it was priced at like $155,000 a ticket and if you look at the inside of it the photos I think it was only like three seats by three so it was like a it was like two or three seats 80 something passengers I think yeah so there it wasn't a lot of people at all so it when do you think about it's hard to make a lot of money high price low volume not a lot of routes only limited number of routes uh but it had all these problems like if you go look up like the problems with the Concord right like it was like yes it was expensive it also like got really hot like there's this famous thing where when they first launched it to do like a PR Blitz or like to sponsor it they had Pepsi sponsor the conquer and so they painted it light blue and the before that was a this white reflective material to reflect heat uh to not store heat but the light blue thing made it where it got so hot inside the cabin that you know the hour flight they could only do for 20 minutes cuz it was like cooking everything inside so like heat was a problem noise was a problem price was the problem um you know duration was a problem I also think there was a really famous crash too where it was like that was the and I don't remember if I don't you know this was years I was a kid or I don't even think I was alive actually but I remember reading about it and the what I read was the reality is that it could have worked or it could have been great but the perception was that this thing is dangerous and it's too radical and it crashed I'm never getting on that is that right exactly so the the last the thing that kind of killed the Conqueror was they had this flight where during takeoff the tire hit something on the runway and it ruptured the tire and then the plane basically exploded and killed everybody on board and that was like all right we're done with this thing too dangerous so it had safety problems price problems heat problems um you know like noise problems because it would like you know shatter Windows when it would do it Sonic Boom so it was like whatever so I think in like 2003 was the last flight so in about 20 years there's been no no no flight sense nobody was even working on it so he he has this spreadsheet and he's like look am I just nuts because the way I'm penciling this out you know we only need like a 30% Improvement in like fuel efficiency a 30% Improvement in this one other thing and he's like dude it's been 50 years like our TVs got better our phones got better our computers got like dramatically better not 30% better they got like 3,000% better he's like I'm pretty sure we could make the plane 30% more efficient and then this would work so he goes to this like you can buy a t you I can get a TCL 75 in TV for literally $600 and it's delivered to my door the next day exactly if I can do that we can make a we can make a chat so he goes to the Stanford professor and he's like he's like hey like you know this we need a 30% I my calculations show we need a 30% fuel efficiency and by the way that conquer was designed at a time where like they use slide rulers and like you know wind tunnels to test things like I think we could do this and the professor was like yeah I think you can uh the math is correct he's like so you know you might have engineering problems but like the physics are fine and so he gets encouraged he's like I just thought I must not know something and that's why this hasn't been done but it's one of these classic things where like The Beginner's mind goes in and they don't see the problems and therefore they do it whereas all the experts just assume that's we tried that it doesn't work and so he goes and he he decides to create an airplane company okay so what's the next move how's he going to fund this thing now's he going to build it because again this dude just bought a textbook about flight he doesn't know anything about this stuff so he's like all right I need to recruit a great team and we got a we need some money so he decides he takes half of all of his life savings and decides to fund the company bank account with it and he hires up something like 6 to 10 people one of which he poaches the former chief engineer of Gulf Stream and he's like I thought it would be hard to get talent because here I am I'm this [ __ ] Groupon kid saying I'm going to build a you know a supersonic jet it's never been hasn't been done in you know 50 years like the last American new American Airlines company that worked was like you know 80 years ago or something so the business plan is a little crazy it's probably going to you know it I think it cost the conquer like a billion dollars to make the conquered like it was like a billion dollar project they thought it was 20 million and they ended up spending a billion he's like I think we I think we'll need 200 million but I don't know where I'm going to get all that so let me just start by funding it myself did you did he say how much he hasn't said the the amount but he at one point he's like I realized like I'm playing chicken with my own bank account here he's like I want to go raise money he ends up raising like a million bucks still almost nothing but he gets like a few early Believers in I one of my really close friends Chris was in that round oh wow did he say what he saw or why he's been telling me about it for years and that's originally how I heard about this and he was like this guy's just magical and I I I just couldn't get I'm like a Silicon Valley software person starting a jet company that just that's really dumb which is evidenced by dumb ideas being potentially amazing and how that's actually quite common and by the way the airline airplane Market is super fragmented oh wait no it's not there's two companies one owns 51% the other one owns 49% it's just Aus and Boeing that's the whole market right so you know he's trying to go to basically break up this duopoly in in theory okay so let's go back to the to so he hires this guy so he hires a team and he's like actually one of the the surprising things was it was way easier to hire great talent because the bigger the mission the better the pitch so he's like I have had a super exciting Mission I didn't have a lot of other things I didn't have a lot of traction I didn't have a lot of funding but I had a great Mission I had an exciting project that was basically like nerd porn so he's like any nerdy you know engineer who worked on airplanes you could either go work at Boeing or Airbus and your job is to like you know make sure that the cabin temperature goes down by two degrees so that we could sell more you know VOD konics like that was they weren't trying to innovate at all so if you were somebody who wanted to innovate this was like the only option so he recruits your R team then he goes in into YC and he was skeptical he goes into YC combinator he's like isn't it just for software companies but Sam alman's like no no no we like heart heart stuff um Sam's like I don't know if you're you're going to get in but you should go talk to these four other guys who had Hardware companies that kind of failed in YC but they'll tell you that like they would have failed much worse had they not had YC so he go talk them they're like yeah it was great let's do it so he joins and he's like I realized something pretty quickly he goes YC is architected in this three-month program on demo day three months you're going to stand on stage in front of all the investors you're going to make your pitch you got to raise money that's the whole point and so he's like what the hell am I going to do in 3 months so he goes I realized that during YC if I went to them and I was like hey we reduced the drag coefficient by 30% and this engine design is really awesome and like that's our progress update we're cooked and so he's like I got to figure out something that I'm going to do so he comes up with two plans he's like the number one I got to sell the dream so he spends a good chunk of his time and money just building like a model airplane that looks sick he's like all right this is not going to actually help us make the plane but uh it's going to help people see that we're making a plane and it's going to look awesome how much does YC give you like 125 Grand yeah something like at the time probably just spent all like $100,000 hiring some firm making like a really great model so he had like a model like he had like a model but then he also had a like a a gnarly looking engine and he's like we just want to stand there with a big ass engine and then people walk by be like whoa is that a jet engine he's like yeah that's the jet engine we're going to use on our supersonic jet would you like to hear more so he's like I need that I candy he needed a booth babe and for him the booth babe was the model and the engine so smart right because like one of the commonalities Elon and these other guys is it's you can't just be an engineer in your in your little engineering hole you got to know just enough about the rest about the marketing the capital raising all the other things to to survive so he did the second thing was he was like I need these like purchase orders so he makes a list and he's like all right how can I go get Lois and he's like he makes this list and so he's like uh here's his quote he goes I realized I couldn't show up to demo day with no sales otherwise my Goose was pretty cooked so I looked at my sales Pipeline and it was United Delta Lanza Air China and we only had eight or nine weeks before demo day and I thought to myself there's no way I'm closing withan leanza Airlines by demo day it's not going to happen I'll be lucky if I close them in 9 years let alone 9 weeks so I realized I actually only had two options a startup air or virgin he goes so we I went all in and focused all of my ER my sales efforts on startups and virgin he goes I went to the startups who are currently operating and I got one of them to do an Loi but it was a company you've never heard of but it was the best I could do and her I was 24 hours before demo day and the lucky break we got was that demo day was split into two days if it was demo day one he would have stood on age and said we have a small Loi from this company you've never heard of luckily we got randomly assigned to demo day 2 so he had bought an extra 24 hours in that extra 24 hours he ends up getting an email from Virgin the night before demo day that says you're allowed to announce we'll take the first 10 planes we've got options on them and through Virgin Galactic will even help you build it it goes I fell off my chair I almost screamed I had to read the things three times I couldn't believe it we went from have we went from being the biggest laughing stock on demo day to the company that showed up with5 Billion worth of an Loi worth of Lois a record that won't be broken soon dude that's so sick wa what is this what year is this 2016 so yeah I was reading um I I was looking up my email to try to figure out did I ever talk to this person how do I know him and the earliest thing I could only find was I think in 2020 it says uh the hustle actually wrote about him said United Airline wants to buy 15 supersonic airliners from boom sonic so it took him an additional two years to get the United Airlines the next so okay so then how did he get Branson High agency baby I told you he's dripping an agency all right so what does he do so he's like all right if I want to get Richard Branson I got to go through somebody I trust he goes I'm also not just going to try one path to Branson we got to try multiple paths to Branson so he's like if I get blocked over here I got this other long shot going so he's like I had this guy on our board who was an astronaut this guy Mark Kelly you probably heard of him so that guy was on his Advisory Board he's like he knows Branson he's like so I'm thinking all right we got we got to find a way to to get to Richard and so he goes um we asked we asked Mark what's the best way to get to Richard Branson how do we make that happen he and he told me goes hey you you can't get him interested in you but go where he's interested in his own thing so what do you mean he goes Virgin Galactic has this big roll out for their spaceship Richard's got to be there so you just got to get there go where he is and they're like okay and so they get in he's like could you make could you email him and say hey these guys I'm advising from boom supersonic are going to be in Mojave when you're doing your roll out you should meet with them when you're there and then he's like um and then he reaches out to the Virgin guys and he's like hey we're going to be in town uh to see Richard can we come to the roll out and like you know so basically they get invited to the roll out they get there he's super busy they end up getting 15 minutes with him when he's at brunch with his mom and they go up to him and they go he goes um uh Richard they show them what they're doing they like we're building the first Super Sonic Jets since the Concord we fixed these problems uh we're making that happen and he goes look we're not asking you for your money all we want to know is this when this thing flies do you want a virgin logo on it and he go I think that was the key you got to ask for the right thing when you do a deal you it's probably going to be hard to close you got to ask for what's really going to help you so we told Richard look if you're our customer we will get money elsewhere we don't need money from you and that was crucial uh basically like the first few babies of these that are in the air do you want them with a virgin logo or not and so that was the thing that got Richard Branson across the line was making the intelligent ass and hustling their way this is a movie this is a movie if it works if it ends well it's a movie well they just did their flight so they just did their first demo flight where but it wasn't a uh I think what the test was if I remember correctly was it the engine that they were testing they got the engine cuz the plane is like a it's a small plane right this was a smaller plane than the real plane that they're going to have and I don't think it was the full speed that they're going to have but they did achieve I believe they achieved Super Sonic flight you could check me on that but I they they achieved the right they crossed the threshold they did it safe they landed it and is they like whatever xb1 or whatever they're calling that thing okay he's got some great startup advice so here's here's the way he described his startup I like the way he phrased this so he goes here's my advice for startups um pick something that's going to be worth it to you personally that is what's that is how you stack the deck in your favor stack to the deck so that you will be motivated and when you look at what you're creating versus if you went to Google or Facebook or Amazon it should be a no contest um if you haven't found that just don't even start a startup I did that my first time I just started a startup just for just because and it was a horrible idea you you should start a startup when you're like I must make this happen and um something I've come to believe is that the bigger the idea the easier it becomes because it motivates you and the people around you and your track better people to come work on it when we were brainstorming this most of the ideas we came up with were like no one's going to really appreciate this blah blah blah blah but for us it was like the most exciting thing we could ever do and so that's all that mattered was like you know stacking the deck in your favor doing it as a must rather than a we could do this um and so that that I thought one really great takeaway I was reading this quote by the guy I don't know how to say his last name but the guy who wrote Crime in punishment you know like this famous novel and he said um your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself for nothing and I was reading I I just read that like an hour ago and it's sat with me and what you've described is exactly that yeah I love this guy uh so I don't know him but I'm rooting for them I want to invest now cuz you know why not let's let's get on the team this and there's been a lot of I think there's been well there definitely has been but there's been I think he's wrote publicly about a lot of the downsides of all this which is that it's this has not been clear I think he had to take a huge down round and he tweeted out about it I believe and I think his most recent valuation was $2 billion um which was down from the other amount but didn't he tweet about the down round and how like they basically almost ran out of money and how it's almost failed a bunch of different times I don't know I didn't see that I also I'm different than you I feel like you love to know the downsides of things like even when a guest comes on that's one of the questions you tend to ask which is interesting to me because I never really think about it but you're always like what are the honest like it's not all peaches and cream like what what are the downsides of your approach which is obviously an intelligent question but I think there's something good about being delusional about it too and just be like I have a convenient hole in my memory and in my brain to not even really pay attention or remember those things the reason I ask that is because I have been a victim of this many times where I go and say well this guy did it why can't I do it and then I start doing it and I think to myself this is way harder than it than it than it looked why is this so hard and and so I always look for those I always ask those questions not to say that someone shouldn't do something but just to say that it is much more challenging than it appears and that is okay and normal because I remember thinking on my journey this sucks you know this person he never felt that way why do I feel that way like I'm I'm full of [ __ ] what the hell I'm not I'm not good enough and then I want to like be reminded that like this is a normal feeling this is a normal problem I'm having you got to keep going that's why I asked those questions uh yeah to I think it's totally helpful to have that the one that helps me is um Tony Robins does his thing he talks about dabblers versus stressor Achievers versus Masters and I've talked about this I won't do the whole thing but like one of the things he says at the end is that anybody who's pursuing anything no matter what if you are in it you're going to hit plateaus so forget even downs but like just plateaus where it feels like it's not working the progress is not happening it's not happening as fast as you want it's not growing it's not working everyone's saying no we don't have that investor whatever it is right and the one thing that Tony said that just always stuck in my mind almost like as a it's like a it's like a a jingle in a song or like a commercial where he goes when that Plateau comes the dabbler quits the stressor stresses and the master says Ah I thought I'd be seeing you soon hello my old friend you're here I I was expecting you which is like we have this one company we started uh just a little over a year ago that's just been like up and to the right like this company is I haven't announced it yet but it's like almost a $10 million run rate already profitable bootstrapped in one year it's like insanely insanely successful but we just hit like our you know our first plateau and I feel like when we called it out it was almost like this kind of like embarrassing down feeling of like oh man like we didn't have ridiculous growth this month and we're out where was I was like dude I've been expecting you where is the plateau I I know it's coming I almost don't even trust that it's happening until that this is real until we start to face some of these and so yeah that's why I ask those questions is I don't want us as a media or whatever we are to be the ones who who I I want to be realistic the biggest business influencers on iTunes well yeah as spotify's 13th biggest business influencer I just want to say that it is a [ __ ] pain in the ass and it's still worth it do you know what I mean yeah yeah yeah you're right speaking of insane agency speaking of insane down on the way to a huge up Have you listened to this episode I did with Nick M it came out this morning and I hadn't listened to it yet but I went and like saw I saw it pop up this morning and I went and Googled his company and I own a ton of the toys that he makes like like not my kid me so like he owns uh he owns Mini Brands you bathe with the rubber fish well I've we have a r fish actually for my daughter does but you know I told you about mini toys right uh and how like I is mini Brands he owns Mini Brands and so like my wife is [ __ ] weird and when she was pregnant and like not feeling well I would go and surprise her by buying these mini toys which is the stupidest thing ever it's just like a miniature it's a ball full of miniature things like a miniature can of Coke a miniature Kit Kat a miniature notebook the weirdest [ __ ] and people love it and the other loves this dude I don't know why my wife like loves 32-year-old loves those huh dude you know what I did was I I went and bought like literally $300 worth and I hid them in my drawer and whenever like she had a bad pregnancy day when she was like up uh sick or something I would go and get one and be like I got something for you it was like I was like you know I had like a secret stash and then also he makes these electric water guns that I went and bought uh last summer that I would shoot at my daughter like messing around have you seen the electric water guns do I think it's hilarious how into the toys you are right now uh could I tell you the biggest oh holy [ __ ] moment from the whole thing well you got to tell the background it's from what I know it's two brothers in New Zealand that have a to company that does like three or four or five more than that more than that so let's just let me start with this we have interviewed I don't know how many 200 guests on this podcast 250 maybe hundreds billionaires millionaires Young Old Man Woman whatever criminals not criminals criminals non-criminals guys you don't want to hang out with guys that you don't want to hang out with right there's a lot of people we we've had on this podcast he is at the top of the mountain number one is my number one most impressive entrepreneur of all of them I was blown away he is the he has the scrappiest hustle story and like the like his bottom was like the bond literally living on a dollar a day for years literally this is how funny this guy is so he okay so now I'll zoom out now I'll give you the context that you wanted but like I just needed to say that that out of every guest I've ever had on this podcast ever he is the number one most impressive founder that I've ever had on the podcast okay and we've had some cool people uh no offense everybody else all right so um but sort of story yeah but know your place um with all due respect you [ __ ] suck okay Robins I found Batman um this guy I say he's the wealthiest man in New Zealand he's got a company that him and his brother started family-owned bootstrap self-made billionaire they do a few billion dollars a year in Revenue they do a billion dollars a year in just profit I like that and they've been doing that um they never had outside investors he has dominated the toy industry so he built the most profitable toy company in the world he then built the fastest growing diaper company in the world you ever heard of Rascals diapers or million moon at Target so he's got the fastest growing diaper company in the world doing hundreds of millions and by the way he made that while he was on sick leave he got his intestine removed cuz he got Crohn's disease and while he was on his sick bed laying there he's like oh I guess I'll just dominate diapers now like he didn't say need a diaper that's what happened so he he creates the fast growing diaper company creates the fastest growing hair care company on Tik Tok now wait what he's Monday hair hair care or whatever he owns Monday um not only all that he now is building the largest Factory in the world bigger than the Tesla Factory bigger than all that where robots are going to build houses autonomously and that's what he's doing he's building houses with robots now um self funding the whole thing by the way problem I I asked I was like is that just got to be hundreds of millions of dollars of self funding and he just laughed um so so take that for what it's worth let me now tell you okay so that's that's what the guy does can I tell you some of the just holy [ __ ] stories from this thing yeah all right so the dude's 18 years old and he like after selling door Todo in New Zealand where they live trying to sell his brother like invented this hot air balloon toy at a science fair and his brother his older brother and put him to work and was like yo you need to go sell this door to door um the dude the day they're like you know what we need a factory and they're like oh all the manufacturing is in China so they moved to China but the hilarious thing is at 19 at 18 I think 18 19 something like that he they go to China that's the story where they sleep in the bush outside the airport cuz the airport lights were too bright so they leave the airport sleep in a bush get bit by mosquitoes they have no money so they're like they're just on their own so he I was like oh so you found a manufacturer in China that you scaled up he goes what have you found a manufacturer we went to China and then built a factory on the side of a river like we just went with like wood and like a hammer and we built a factory and I was like what was the point of going to China you know you go to China to their factories are already there he's like yeah we didn't understand that like we we just went there and we just built our own Factory on the side of a river and we found this like Mom to make us food for two R&B a day 30 cents a day and then she had some people that could come work in the factory and then we just had we had our own production line and it sounds like a it sounds like a shed yeah they literally built a shed and then they just kept scaling up the shed and he's like my brother didn't come back home for like eight or nine years he just slept on the floor of the factory and I I slept on the floor too then except for when I had to go sell all right so how did they whn he's like and our product sucked by the way this is one of my favorite things is like everybody who makes it they're like the key is just to have a great product and and then if you're a Founder you're like dude what like okay I've made a great product now what nothing's happening um and you know they don't like people tend to leave out the like the manual work it took the lucky breaks it took to like get get the thing to start working what product it was a hot it was like a plastic hot air balloon toy or what um even worse so starts with a hot air balloon quickly re he's like did again we didn't know anything about anything so we go we build a shed by the river in China we're making our hot air balloons then we've learned you can't even export a hot air balloon he's like literally it's a fire in a tiny can like we can't sell that so he's like we realized that was a waste so we got to come up with a new toy and again everybody everybody tries to say we're so Innovative so we innovated Innovation is great and then we made a great product he is the opposite he's like so we found that this other toy was selling so we copied it uh we ruthlessly copied that toy and we made a shitty version of it cuz we didn't know anything about manufacturing dude so this like white guy moved to China in out Chinese the Chinese exactly exactly he was like dude we lived on a dollar day I was like so you I was like I heard the story you at McDonald's every day and he's like every day that I wish McDonald's was our Christmas treat we would go to McDonald's and he's like I for years I just remember saying like merry Christmas bro he's like merry Christmas bro we would cheers our fries he's like I used to eat half the fries and take it back and be like hey there's only half the fries in here you guys DP me and get like a second serving of fries and he's like that was the treat dud I used to do that all the time at bars I would order an iced tea and be like you made the Long Island Iced Tea wrong you forgot the liquor and by the way he was not saying Pride he was like I I was almost like a therapist because this guy's never done a podcast by the way this was the first podcast I think he's ever done and there's no stories you can find of this guy like I went to do the research there's no like oh him you know normally we do research you you go watch the three most watched podcasts that they've done and you pick up a bu of stuff he has zero he had to download Google Chrome to do the interview he's like it's not letting me do this every we're like what and we're like just open Chrome he's like what's Chrome and I was like you're a billionaire you don't know what Google what are you you he's like oh I think I have Chrome hold on he's like oh I got Chrome okay got it got it let me switch to my laptop this is going to work okay like just to get [ __ ] with you no he was that serious and so uh I was like dude why don't you do any podcast I tell your story he's like I don't know I just never did what motivates this guy he's just a maniac dude he uh he's like is he was he was he calm was he calm very calm I felt like it was almost like a therapy session cuz I'm asking him about these times back in the day and he's almost like yeah I don't know what we were doing and why we were thinking like he just doesn't think about and he was like not he's like yeah we you know we we were super Scrappy but he's like we were also a little mentally ill like we just were he goes we were so naive that naive is not even the right word so he's like for example we got sued for millions of dollars because again we like copied someone's toy and so it's like a $2 million lawsuit it's either going to bankrupt the company cuz we don't have $2 million or we have to fight it but the lawyer that we talked to were like it's going to cost you a million dollars to fight this he's like dude we had like a few thousand he's like so I go to Colorado and I find this lawyer he's like this guy eventually got disbarred but I find this guy Chad and I tell him hey I'm going to do all the legal work you put your name on this and we're GNA fight this this way and I paid him $50 to put his name on it and I did the all the lawsuit stuff myself just like Googling and we fought the lawsuit that way and then Chad got disbarred like later for other reasons what he told a story of he's like dude we got this we got this he goes I used to I was like so how did you sell the thing like how did you sell these toys you send the products up and you were copying somebody else so why would anybody buy this he goes I emailed because I made a list of every retail buyer of every store in every region of the world and I emailed her called them every single day he remembered the name of every buyer this is from like 15 years ago cuz he would call or email them every day he goes the Walmart buyer he's like I would call her or email her every day he's like I never forget her and he's like one day she emailed me being like Nick I do not need your daily email about your product and he goes well listen Jen I'm sorry it's just a great product and I just had to tell you about it because we've really got some exciting things to the PIP it's like I just didn't let up finally he goes she just sent me the two most beautiful words in the in the English language send sample he's like we're in and he gets this like Walmart order and by the way actually before that uh somebody's like hey do you have your showroom in Hong Kong I'll send one of my buyers he goes of course of course showroom in Hong Kong yeah yeah we got one of those it's like what's a showroom in Hong Kong so he goes to Hong Kong he rents this little cubicle where they put like escorts in you know it's like the red light district and like it's enough for one human body and he just sleeps in there because he doesn't have enough money for a hotel sleeps in there and then when a buyer shows up he just pops out he's like hey it's me whatever you would like to see our showroom and they're like yeah we what is what is this this is a dressing room for like one person to change clothes in he's like yeah yeah toys are inside here you go and he ends up getting this order from Walmart for uh 2 million units and he's like oh my God that's $30 million he's like this is amazing at that time the revenue was like 150k a year and stre tells this story about how he's like first he's like I go and he goes I learned two words of Chinese too slow and go faster because our Factory our little old factory by the river had never produced 2 million units of anything and he's like so we had to produce 2 million units of this thing I come home I take over the factory because I'm just like my brother's like not working fast enough and then he's like and then Walmart basically cancels the order after he's like super deep in it and he like took a loan from the like from a contract manufacturer to like help him build the 2 million units and then he like goes and harasses the Walmart buyer to like hold up to the end of the bargain uh and he's like by the way product doesn't sell not a single one he's like it's retails at $30 discount to 25 discount to 20 discount to 15 he goes it ends end up selling for 50 cents he's like he's like it was like concrete on the Shelf how' you find this guy I don't know I I read something I I I must have heard something or read something CU about a few years ago we talked about him on the podcast and then yeah I remember that like three years ago Ben has emailed him no joke he showed me 17 times over the next 18 months um to get him to come on the podcast dude theidea this guy sounds awesome I need to go and watch this got to listen to this episode not like you know he's not like Mr like super Storyteller Mr Suave or he's a I mean he's a great guy but like he just tells it like it is but if you listen to this thing I don't know how long it is like 90 minutes or something like that I mean it is one of the most incredible entrepreneurial stories I've ever heard by the way all right so I I let me tell you a story now because we this is Chinese related but we're just telling stories about interesting people I got to tell you about someone I just read about have you ever have you even been to New York have you ever been to York like Manhattan yes I am yeah okay when you were here did you see these crazy guys on electric they're like they're called electric bikes but they're basically motorcycles they're like the Uber Eats and door Dash drivers no I don't think that was happening then dude so in New York like four years ago it just popped up that all of these Uber so there's 70,000 Uber Eats and door Dash people in New York City in like the Manhattan and Brooklyn area it's like and they're all riding these electric bikes that fly they look like they're normal bicycles but these things literally go 60 MPH and I ride my bike everywhere when I'm in New York City and like I've these [ __ ] have almost killed me tons of times and they're and they're dangerous they're really dangerous and what you'll notice is that they all have like these gloves on their bikes have you ever seen these like door Dash drivers in the winter I've seen that well they keep them there in the win in the summertime too and the reason they do that is because underneath those gloves they have like a motorcycle style acceleration like a twisty thing on the grip which is illegal you can't have that because that like you know at what point are you go from being a bicycle to being a motorcycle where you there has to be rules and so there's there was this weird thing where I'd be walking around and I'm like I even would ask these guys what is this bike and they don't speak English so like like they couldn't tell me but I was like I want to know what this bike is that goes 60 M an hour and has like a twisty throttle thing because this is sick I want one and so I started doing research around it and I think I talked about it in the podcast I couldn't find out what it was well two or 3 days ago an article came out and it told the story about what this thing was and it's pretty ridiculous and so basically there's a guy who comes from China he's got a too hard of a name to pronounce but his American name is Andy he comes in 2011 and when he comes he uh basically admits that he goes I paid a guy 45 Grand and he smuggled Me In from Mexico I came illegally and then in this article they even linked to a rap video that he did when he was broke and poor and he was like I decided to come to America to make it rich that was like the Chinese lyrics of this video Well turns out the first thing that he did was he noticed that there was all these Uber Eats like bike riders and they get punished if they don't bring or if they don't show up in time like if you don't deliver quickly you get like docked like you don't get the full rate and so he starts importing he I think he borrowed 12 Grand from someone and he starts importing these electric bikes from China and he opens up a shop and one of these shops was right by my house right to stay in Brooklyn years ago and i' would always see these guys like like they would kind of hang out outside the shop well what I didn't realize was that he scaled this thing so fast to where he started having um like literally 30 different stores all around Manhattan to where he's selling these things it's called fly ebikes he's selling these ebikes that go like 40 50 m an hour and they're only $1,000 it's incredible and they're incredibly illegal like uh like they they literally just don't follow any of the law but if you look at the under there's like a when you order these bikes there's like says something in the plate it says like there's literally like a metal plate and it says like you know this uh meets this USA standard this and that and like in the article someone was like nobody checks that it's just basically an honor System and that we hope that you do it but there's no one actually checking these things but the guy ends up Andy selling 70,000 bikes in four years and a few months ago uh I think it was in September he had the audacity to take the company public and so it go it goes public on the NASDAQ and it's uh I think the ticker is f l y and you can see the ticker uh I think that uh the and you can see I put all their financials in this document but the year before they went public they were doing like 30 million in revenue and like2 or3 million in profit but they're getting sued like crazy because one of their bikes catch on fire cuz they follow no rules he basically admit that he's like yeah we're Cowboys we uh build first and we ask questions later and so like homes have built down people have actually died from the batteries being B uh catching on fire in someone's apartment and burning the [ __ ] apartment down and they're getting sued and one of the lawyers suing them he's got this quote where he's like dude six years ago these guys were bus boys serving dishes or cleaning dishes in restaurants now they're running a publicly traded company they know nothing about building bikes they're just like getting the cheapest [ __ ] they can over here and it's all true by the way they're insane but I cannot believe they went public and in like the the one of the I went and watch listen to this I I listen to one of their um their reports or like when they were inter like investors were interviewing the CEO Andy before he took it public and they're like why' you go decide to take it public and he says he was inspired by the movie Wolf of Wall Street and that's why he decided to take the company public he says that in a YouTube video in a YouTube video he says I decided to take it public because I saw Wolf of Wall Street and so now because of all these lawsuits and because the company is just like [ __ ] like it's just like they're breaking so many laws they just do whatever the hell they want the the stock has crashed we need a spin-off pod of just absolutely Renegade Chinese Founders just doing doing things that that we would never dream of I would subscribe to that instantaneously well he's like the real life jinyang from uh Silicon Valley where like he's just sitting there smoking cigar sigs and like someone's like you know you really need safety stuff and he's like who says like you know what I mean like like the Deep founder right right now the Deep seek founder is going to get lot of Pub for this same reason it's just this guy's hilarious but it is actually inspiring that like all these dorks are like we got to do this we got to we got to like have this process we got to do this and meanwhile you got this guy Nick moving to China and not knowing [ __ ] and then we got this Chinese guy moving to New York yor and not knowing [ __ ] and like it's and it still works and his company by the way he started a electric bike company it does 30 million in revenue and 3 million in income so like it's not nothing uh so and he started with $112,000 uh pretty badass though besides the fact that it's um you know like incredibly illegal and dangerous and people are dying but besides that it's like kind of an interesting story because I've always wondered where these freaking bikes have come from I got to give a shout out to curb they have um an article and it's called the moped King how an ex delivery worker upended the streets of New York City for better and For Worse um and it's called fly EB ebike yeah yeah yeah I just need the spin-off somebody needs to make the uh not not the right way to do it but still impressive a version of my million uh yeah we went from like we went from like um inspiring who cares about money we're going to like make travel better to um hardcore shark does whatever it takes but still ethical but like I'm gonna get rich and just conquer the world to uh [ __ ] everyone get paid the full Journey exactly yeah all right that's it that's the Pod is that it that's it that's the Pod all [Music] right for

this was the biggest greatest Edge in the history of gambling edges I can promise you but I've never uttered this in public to anyone ever before you want to Nuke it let nuke [Music] it all right so so we got to tell your story because your story is you basically did what me and probably 50% of other young guys wanted to do in their life it's like oh what if I could take a few thousand dollars find an edge beat the house in Vegas and turn a few thousand dollars into millions of dollars tens of millions of dollars and ultimately I believe over hundreds of millions of dollars not by counting cards in blackjack first by uh you know sports betting and then you get recruited by Mark cubin to go work for an NBA team at one point you now own your own soccer club so you've had this like really cool life and career you're like a comic book character yeah you're like your man cave came to life you know like it worked um so that's dope but you know of course no story is perfect up you know there's ups and downs and it's not all not like you planned it out this way but what we like most on this podcast this podcast is mostly a business podcast so somebody comes on and they tell us about their company or their Investments or whatever and um but we what we like most is people who play their own game what I like about you is you play your own game um you're pretty independent thinker and so I want to kind of walk through the story so you know what I'll call chapter one is stumbling into gambling and and and find figuring out how to have that edge can you tell a little bit about that story cuz S I think I know a little bit of it but I know Sam you don't know any of that story right like how he how he first got and made a name for himself doing this no yeah I mean I grew up around gambling my dad was I use the term unsuccessful Gambler some people might refer to as degenerate uh he was he was he was someone who gambled a lot unsuccessfully and um you know had a lot of it caused a lot of problems in our family uh not the triger Cod it was bad but I grew up around their horse RAC trck and I grew up around watching football NFL football on Sunday basically trying to like help my dad make picks what city I grew up in Winnipeg Manitoba Canada so I was at the cin booya DS racetrack um from I guess it was every Saturday Sunday Wednesday for most of my uh teenage years I would say 12 to 16 17 18 um and so yeah I just kind of was around that's how I kind and I I always I always thought it was rather interesting and I also saw like first thing I didn't realize when I was younger was just how it it was near impossible to beat the horses just because of the takeout the vi is so high it's like 30 36% they got to pay for everything The Stables the horse pools you know all of it um but I just thought well these people don't know what they're doing like they're you know like they they have no process they don't know what's happening there's um they're very emotional like I grew up I'm a Greek family so you would hear these people like they just were not in control of their emotions in any way they would be upset when they win they be upset when they lose they would be arguing with each other other they' having I'm very lowkey so to me um it was very different for me hey let's take a quick break to talk about our sponsor today HubSpot has put together a list of 200 AI business ideas these are business ideas that you could create using Ai and it's a list of 200 they did a huge brainstorm so you could check it out if you just click the link below you

brainstorm of 200 possible AI ideas brought to you by HubSpot you can get it for free in the link below so that's how I got started and then at some point um after I after I uh graduated from high school uh I went to Vegas with my dad he was there and um I went there for like a month or so he was there gambling like uh like yeah he my dad was if it was daylight hours and he had money in his pocket he was gambling was what was his occupation he was he came he was a first generate he moved to Canada when he was he's got a great you should have him on the show uh he had a great story he moved to Canada when he was like 20 years old didn't speak the lick of English became a dishwasher at Kentucky Fried Chicken and just worked his ass off and so he moved his way up from dishwasher to restaurant to finally uh getting involved in real estate somehow by some way owning a commercial de he was a p strip malls all over Winnipeg so he's an entrepreneur Big Time entrepreneur yes wow and when you go to Vegas you're not 21 right you just graduated from high school so what do you do with your dad you're in a casino you can't really do much par I parked myself in the sports book and hope that because they don't ID you in the sports book yeah you supposed to you but they don't like you're just in the sports book so you're just sitting there you know you're and I just watched basketball the first time I really ever watched NBA basketball to that extent I was previously I was watching a lot of hockey and and Canadian football and um yeah my dad would give me a little bit of money not a lot and I would watch basketball and I would sit there from 400 p.m. Pacific to 10: p.m. 11:00 p.m. Pacific and just watch the games on these giant TVs and then I started to really enjoy the routine of watching the West Coast games so I started to like kind of pay attention more to the West Coast teams I was like Chris Weber's rookie year when he played for uh Golden State um and they had a Run TMC I think it was before that um and so yeah that's what I did were you were you losing money at first what was going on when did you start making money I didn't I didn't really win I wasn't losing a lot though like I I I wasn't I had an okay opinion by the end but yeah I was losing of course like I was probably flipping coins and paying big so I was like probably probably 50/50 roughly but needed you know but was paying I needed to win 11 to 10 11 out of every 10 so it wasn't bad it wasn't like I was getting my ass handed to me or anything um but then I realized I really like this and I want to get good at it and I just thought about what what what does that me tail what do I have to do to get good at it and so I just went to work and just started taping games to start reading a lot of newspaper uh articles on the internet when you're when you're saying you're learning to get good at it um how much of it is a human side where you're like learning human emotions of like the players and Leadership and things like that like the story versus uh statistics yeah back then there was not a lot of good statistics there was just the there's just something called The Box Score which is just not very it's not very illustrative of the game so it was almost that and a little bit of database work in terms of like just getting Aggregates from teams in certain situations um I also tried to like really also understand the market more I think the in other words the opening lines with o i what I got to be really when I was in Vegas around that time was seeing the sharps that would line up at the Stardust Casino in the morning they had something called the lottery so the Lions would be posted in the morning and then every sharp would be able to get make a full limit bet down in the morning and they'd have to do a lottery to see who could go first and then they make a bet and then the book would decide to adjust so I start just like looking to see like okay who are the actual Sharps who are the guys who seem like they're moving money for other people what are they betting so you're treating it like a job you must have been getting there early then what time is that yeah I mean I mean it's not a lot of work it's not manual labor I'm not like laying bricks or like riding off the back of a brontosaurus like Fred Flintstone breaking rocks but yeah and so did you go ask them to learn from them or you just watching them from afar and figuring out yourself I just was wanted to see like okay this guy made a bet the line didn't move that's interesting then you see him back like the next day and the next day and then and then you see the by the way it wouldn't just be won you'd see like at now at 4:00 post time the lines would move even more so it's like okay this this line moved a lot there wasn't an injury that guy bet it early so it's just like little things just P like I think if I had one skill in life aside from being um uh not not really caring what other people who I don't know think about me I think and just being confident that I think it's like maybe like a little bit of pattern recognition I think I'm decent at that I think I I can see patterns and I'm also able to identify like oh was that an actual pattern or was I just fooling myself with Randomness there did you have a role model like was there uh you know as um as like a as like an 18 or 19yearold are you thinking to yourself uh you know there are other people who have gotten Super Rich doing this I think I can do it or were you like there's some people who make an okay living doing this I think I can do it or you're like I don't think about next year just this is what I'm enjoying today when you're 19 you don't really think like that I don't like in terms of like oh I want to make a I've always been someone who's always like been very confident that I was going to be successful I would recite things in my head when I was a kid like I'm going to be millionaire I'm I just I would just do that and so um at that age I think I was just kind of I wasn't sure how I was going to make it I just knew I was going to make it like I kind of went through life with this like irrational confidence I think was there a definition of making it was it like $10 million by the time I'm 25 yeah I think when I was tree planting I um I would had like I was listening to like Tony Robbins books and reading them like listening to them at night and then reading them in the morning and I think yeah I had like 10 things that I wanted and I and yeah I think it was 10 million before the age of of 30 I think um back then I was money now you can just spin up a meme coin and and you're make it by that by noon but back then what was the first profitable pattern you figured out the one that really really kind of work Canadian football was first profitable my first my first bit of money was Canadian football not like soccer but actual like football three down football um there's a lot of things going on then there was um they expanded into America at that time and so you had some interest for whatever reason in Las Vegas to book Canadian Football League games or like AAR markets and so uh and the Canadian teams had to abide by different rules in the American teams so that was part of it you had to have certain amount of Canadians on your roster that were starting American teams didn't didn't have that uh the Canadian stadiums were all compliant to Canadian football league rules American stadiums did not so some of the end zones Like thean rules are like the endzones are 20 yards deep but in some stadiums in America they didn't have that luxury so they were like squared off at the back and so those games are lower scoring um that was a big part of it and I just got to be really good at knowing a lot about Canadian football and which teams were sharp were doing Innovative things um so Canadian football so can you give us a sense of the the kind of the journey so you start with a rough roughly what bank role and then how long did it take you to get to your first million and then at one point I think you were betting like million dollars a day or maybe even more than that somebody said 10 million a day I mean I was betting a lot I mean I think like so it's a long story so I think the most it got to be I was a skyc cap at the Winnipeg International Airport that's when things really took off for me I don't think anyone's ever said that before in their life that what is the skycat the dudes are I was like the first White skyc Cap hired at the Wier it's like they do do sit Court uh sit curbside and carry people's Luggage in and check their luggage in in in the US they check the luggage in but in in Canada that's not allowed because transport can so you would just carry people's luggage and so I would like boy uh we don't like being called Bag Boys uh yeah basic yeah she's carrying people's luggage or like or or in Canada a big thing in the winter was snowbirds who are fleeing Winnipeg to go move to Florida for the winter and they're in wheelchairs and you're just like Wheeling them through customs and immigration making sure they're bag you're making what like what per hour roughly I was making a lot so I started out as a sky cap in the summertime I was printing money and I was making I started out as a skyc cap I realized the Saturday Sunday ships were very profitable because we had American Fishing travel that where people would come in on these boats and theyd have to take a charter plane to go fishing somewhere in Northern Canada um and those days you're making $400 or $500 in an8 hour shift easy wow and so I basically went to the boss of the Comey like hey I really want to work the Saturday and Sunday shifts what do I got to do to make it happen he's like no we got to spread those around it's not fair and the other dudes weren't making any money they would make like 80 so I just started paying them for their Saturday started paying them like 80 bucks to work Saturday Sunday and then he got the owner got R to that and he got upset and so then he started working The Saturdays and Sundays and couldn't figure out why he wasn't making money that I was but I was you doing you're like complimenting these folks and just getting tipped I was just like you know I was doing things like getting them limos to go to the strip clubs when the four hours that they're they're getting them Cuban cigars because Cuban cigars are legal and and when they land and like making sure they had like Cuban cigars and charging them like three times the value for just like little things like that just being attentive I was being attentive I was like a concierge of the wi International Airport um but then anyways I ended up taking over the company from him I just undercut his contracts and so there was actually at the F National Airport I was making so much Mone that's a that's an easy leap right Bag Boy to taking it's like walking his office and you're like hey guy move I was like I was like I went to them and I was like yo like I've already got North it was Northwest Airlines Now Delta I guess but it was Northwest I was like Hey I've already got them to agree to the contract everyone wants to work for me um you can just I can give you some money and you can just move on or I can just undercut you the money I'm going to give you I'm going to say you we it's a win-win and he was like nope don't want to do that whatever so I ended up doing that I ended up undercutting him so how old are you I was 22 2 time um there's actually a crazy story so I was making so much money at the Winnipeg International proza skyc cap and gambling that mostly skyc cap that um at the time Eric there was actually like a bunch of there was there was some cocaine I was found in Air Canada I had like a pass to go everywhere as a sky cap and there was like a situation where some drugs were found like big amount of drugs from like and one of the US Customs and immigration uh employees who I became friends with said like hey you got they think you're like we know what you're doing here as a skyc cap and I know you but you're like suspect number one like just so you know like like you they don't understand why you have us like a brand new Cadillac what not brand new but like you're driving a Cadillac like some gangster and you're walking around with wads of cash like I had L lots of cash from the saw tips and so I was like what and he's like yeah like it's they were laughing they thought it was funny they realized of course it had nothing to do with it but you can Google this so it's it actually happened there's like some kind of thing that happened in Winnipeg at the time where they found something so what was your what was your income at the age of 22 23 24 doing all this um like 50 or 60,000 a summer easily um I was I know I was living with my my mom and my my older brother we were like paying my parents rent for a while after after my dad kind of had like a down slope on you know during the 1987 whatever the interest rates went up strip mall business wasn't so good anymore um especially when you're borrowing money to at at at at floating rates to build these strip malls um so yeah that was about what I I had was making at the time so you're you've been Rich since you were 23 years old oh I don't think so because I've been spending you know like I wasn't exactly saving like money was going I was like going off for dinner every night I was like spending the money I was coming taking trips to Vegas I was doing stuff but yeah I was I had to pay for my school also I had to pay for my University so I was paying from my University I was supporting my parents so I wasn't Rich I just worked hard I also I also while I was working as Sky I o worked as a video store at Rogers video I was working 40 hours a week at Rogers video in the summer skycap in the morning and Rogers video uh which is like a Canadian Blockbuster in the so had a work ethic I guess you're more of a hustler than I I thought because you I guess like I don't know the public perception is you're like kind of just a sharp you're it's all it's all mental you sit in your room you have your models and then you make bets and the money comes in I I didn't know at least some of these stories about you kind of hustling as the the sky cap and figuring out how to like run your own operation down there so that's pretty cool when did uh like I don't know Sam if you've heard these stories but I guess a couple of your famous uh betting stories are I guess you went all in at one point on the Lakers to win the championship and at like 6 to1 odds yeah six and a half to one roughly what how much is all in and what and what age in the timeline it was like 87,000 Canadian give or take and and that was all your money yeah but you could go buy you know I looked at it like okay my money now it's like October fishing you know fishing season just ended at winipeg International Airport I've already paid for my tuition at the University of Manitoba to get my useless uh Philosophy degree um I'm leing my brother's basement worst case I lose this bet and I just go back to Sky capping and just make half of that or two-thirds of that back again so but yeah I made the vet it wasn't a sharp V by any stretch like I looking back it wasn't sharp but it felt sharp to me at the time I'm you you don't have a your your risk model hasn't developed you're amigdala or whatever hasn't fully developed you're that age to really understand if you're making good decisions so did he win yeah W yeah Sam have you heard the bill bur quote about risk no what's he say the the comedian he has this great line about risk because you know being a comedian is like it's risky at many levels right you're probably not going to be a successful famous millionaire traveling touring comedian but on top of that just stepping on the stage is a risk you're going to get humiliated most of the time when you you're not that funny and he goes they were like somebody asked him they were like you know did you how was it taking that risk the take taking taking on that risk taking that leap of faith and he goes I didn't see it as a risk it was the best thing that ever happened to me he was like I'm kind of dumb but you know the one smart thing I realized early on was the risk was waking up uh in a in a king-sized bed when I'm 40 years old turning over to a woman that I don't love anymore that I married because I thought it was the right thing to do dreading this job I have to go to in 6 hours and he's like that became the risk in my head was waking up like that and in compar he goes chasing your dream there's no risk at all he goes yeah he goes there's no there's no risk in chasing your dream because you're doing the thing you want to do and versus living this life that you don't want to live just to play it safe that seemed like a bigger risk definitely relate to that I mean I don't know if any of you guys had the pleasure of spending a winter in Winnipeg but it's not pleasant so uh one of the other stories then that's pretty sweet is he uh I guess at one point uh like in Vegas you can bet on the the full game which is what most people do like me I'm a casual I go in I just bet on the over under maybe on the the the final score and what he realized was like the that you could also bet on the first half only which was like not as common of a bet but the way that Vegas is doing is it would take the full score which they're pretty accurate at predicting and then for the halftime score they were just cut in half divide by two roughly make the first half a little bit higher scoring in general I could tell you guys my look I haven't told this I tell this story in a way that makes it so the edge still lives on for the people that are still betting but I nuk you guys caught me on okay this is this will maybe go viral I don't know probably [ __ ] up a lot of people's money but I think I think most people have figured it out by now but I've never uttered this in public to anyone ever before true story um okay the awaya team gets to choose which basket it wants to shoot on oriented so you have teams who play back then I would say 30 teams in the ND a 28 of them 27 of them when they're on the road would always want their offense shooting in front of their own bench and they would want their defense shooting in front of their bench in the second half therefore the first halfs are higher scoring the second halfs are lower scoring you've got the bench in front of you you can bark out instructions this and that three coaches God bless them I wouldn't be here without them uh decided that uh they wanted to flip it and they wanted to have the defense in front of them in the first half and the second half they want to randomize the game and make the second half's higher scoring so you would liter like Eddie Jordan it was Jerry SLO was the king of this he was the first original guy from Utah and so this was the biggest greatest Edge in the history of gambling edges I can promise you you would have situations where the total would be higher in the first half lower in the second half and the team would literally score on average 106 points in the first half in 87 or something like this or 90 whatever it was back then in the second half you also have the advantage of fouling at the end of games which will also make the score in the second half higher scoring and overtime which is a nice little bonus too working in your favor so the second half over was like you'd have teams playing doing this 41 times a year and they would go nine overs in the first half 30 whatever 32 33 with some pushes in the second half and you could just print money making this bet and that's what I did and I figured that out very very quick actually didn't figure out that quickly to be honest I'm not as bright as I think I am because it took me a long time to figure out what the [ __ ] was happening I just knew these teams had situations where on the road their games were much lower scoring in the first half than they were when they played at home and I thought well they're they're trying to slow the game down it's this and that but really it's just you're more efficient when your offense is in front of your bench because the other team's defense can't get set and you can bark out in that seems like a clear pattern right like you'd only need a season of games to understand that pattern well you don't know that teams are doing this not like they say hey the Mavericks are shooting in front of their like they're the one team nobody's paying attention to this nobody knows that a team that that that that back then it was it was a perfect situation because it was three to four teams a year they were all [ __ ] teams it was in my Heyday it was the Utah Jazz who was a [ __ ] team the Washington Wizards with Eddie Jordan [ __ ] team Byron Scott New Jersey Nets [ __ ] team and then you had a few teams like um the Minnesota timberos did it some games not other games which is the dream scenario nowadays that's probably screwing these gamblers because when that happens you so um so that was it that was the edge that's why I made all my a lot of my money and you could I I if I had a bankroll of this is not responsible please don't follow this but if I had a bankroll of like 250k because I was betting on credit you settle at the end of the week I'd have a situation where if I somehow lost all my bets I'd be like2 or $3 million in debt but it didn't matter because I knew my Edge was so big that I was betting and I somehow partnered up with some big book big big bookmaker slash uh alleged mafia guy in Montreal which is another story who was able to get me down for a lot of money and he just basically I gave him the bets I told him what I wanted to bet he would go bet them for me he'd collect he'd give me the money I'd win and that was that so that's the edge that's the whole edge of a nut show this is insane I have so many questions but it it you know I'm a new I want I've had like friends who I've told this to are like oh can you please share that on my podcast with me I'm like I feel bad for the people who are still grinding a living doing this but you know what it's a new day tariffs are here this is my tariff to the gambling Community I'm um I'm a I'm a new fan of yours you know Sean was like we got to talk to this guy so I'm a new fan so I went and read everything I could in the past week can you give some type of can you can you give me a noob some type of scale as to your winnings like are we talking like hundreds of millions of dollars in winnings or whatever you're comfortable with yeah I know I mean look I I made between $10 to 12 million a year gambling for 10 to 15 years minimum so we're talking nine nine figures and I spent a lot like I didn't just always that that was like my net win you know I'm not talking about local I won but I lost I mean like I lived a pretty good life like I took care of my parents I did other things but yeah I profited a lot gambling on basketball for sure like a bad year for me on the NBAA I think was like six or seven million average year is probably eight and in the early Heyday I made more money then I um yeah then I but I was also I made some mistakes afterwards but yeah your personal life are you living a life of a 28-year-old rich guy of like I mean are you spending seven figures a year in personal like that crazy but I did other bu I tried like other business things I like you know I helped out some family I bought like a profit in in Montreal I bought you know some stuff from my yeah I mean so you're not you're not you kind of overplay you're doesn't seem like you're being irresponsible no I was just like I just think life is short and what's the point have money if you can spend it so but I don't spend it I spend on experience I spend on experiences like I'm not a flashy guy I don't drive a fancy car I don't wear jewelry I've never had a watch I've never had any expensive you know I'm pretty basic in my clothing just like a lot of NBA players like end up going broke or NFL players end up going broke in their like later career one of the crazy things about like I grew up idolizing Phil Ivy and a lot of Poker guys basically and once I got into the world of business and investing it's like okay this was kind of like what real wealth looks like and I realized that a lot of the guys who were really great poker players really great gamblers that you thought were really great gamblers like I don't think they were as successful like businessmen as I thought like you know I don't I don't think they made as much in their Peak and I think they lost a lot along the way or they had huge down swing somewhere along the way as far as you know are you the most s like did you do the best are you the most successful Sports better that you know or were there people better than you that they made more than you um Billy Walters is very I mean Billy Walters had the biggest like my Edge was I scrap for my Edge because Billy Walters had the first computer program when like they were using giant like this old westing house machines to feed the information on those giant cards for computer programming to and they had like a computer program when the Vegas oddsmakers would just sit there and like sit around a tailor I think the line should be seven and a half what do you think Jack I think it should be around eight and a half and then like Billy Walter's computer guys like no it's like 4.3 is the right price in this game so they had like the best Edge ever he made a lot of money he's super successful and Billy Walters he I think I saw a 60-minute special on him is he the uh he's a he's a southern guy wait yeah I I read I read about him you know I saw the 60 minutes and he was exactly like I thought he was going to be like he seemed like a fast talking wheeling and dealing no no no not a fast talker he opposite Bill the number one thing Billy Walters had going for him is he's from the south and if you're a gambler one of the greatest things you can have going for you is people thinking you're not as intelligent as I don't mean I guess I should have said fast talking I guess I mean like um Charming Charming uh oh yeah yeah I know but he'd like well I like to bake a bed if I could I mean game but the thing about Billy is like people underestimated how sharp he was early on but he's as sharp as they come did you have any uh you know like in the movies where it's like at some point the casino's like facial recognition like don't let this guy bet anymore you know take you in the back and Bruise you up a little bit like did you ever run into problems with winning too much so the way sports betting Works you're not usually betting in the casino you're betting with like back then when I was at my Heyday you were betting with literal like Street people so that had like Corner bookmaking operations the casinos are for losers and people who can't win and if you win they'll just not let you bet anymore and so so you need to find a way to bet on credit through like you need to find someone who's going to play a game of telephone with you who's going to take your bets and then maybe bet more later or thinks you're a loser like or or you find a so like my big business like nobody nobody knew who I was nobody knew I was winning money betting because I was never the guy making the bets I'd always find what's called a beard who would make my bets for me and so I've had numbers of like numerous beards throughout the years who were making my bets for me and they were the you know either they were really successful business people or degenerate gamblers or like Hollywood people or like Floyd Mayweather who's a beard for like half an afternoon for me um how did how did that go um yeah he just wasn't he wasn't it was too he was too difficult to work with I mean he's so much money and he's not like impulsive no I been hit in the head for like most of his life like you know he's how much how much I could just piggy back off your bets right he's a huge Bank girl couldn't he have just piggybacked off your bet you're telling him go back he was moving I think Floyd was already moving for someone else whether it was Billy Walters or someone like for sure someone got into Floyd and Floyd making those bets like nobody posts their bets on Instagram for millions and millions of dollars unless there's an angle whether they're sponsored by the casino or they're so yeah I think he was moving money for someone but someone introd I I sat next to him at a Miami Heat playoff game and he liked my friend who was sitting next to me got like took a liking to her and so they became friends and so we somehow had a situation where for an afternoon him and the guy his his business guy and I were talking and Floyd was going to make the bets but it just didn't work like I told them I won to bet one game and they said no we like the other side and I was like that's cool but can you please go bet this one for me and they're like no we don't want to do that like you know we want to bet the other side and I was like okay well then just we'll just bet against each other you bet that side I'll bet this side and they're like no but you always win we can't do that and I was just like okay I'm out I can't deal with this anymore so that was it is the motivation on all this getting rich or is it getting a rush is it an intellectual challenge what's the uh like what's what's the motivation not a rush no the rush is like I'm not a rush guy it's um I think it's the intellectual challenge also I I've realized as I've gotten older that I I take pride in putting myself in really really stressful situations and seeing how well I perform like that's like my probably a weakness of M is I'll put myself in these really stressful situations without knowing it but I'll do that what what's an example of that like being all in Bitcoin since 2013 like for 60 to 170% of your net worth at various different points in time 160 so you borrowed yeah so betting on sports um and making money was challenging and in terms of you're winning money like I was living in Canada at the time um I was uh betting all over the world and having to receive money from people all over the world and so my bank accounts were constantly getting closed even in Canada I was like I'm a professional Gambler this is what I do I pay my taxes as a professional Gambler it's one of the few dummies in Canada who actually because in Canada tax gambling is considered non- taxable so I like one of the few people who actually paid tax on their gambling winnings in Canada because I was considered an expert um but I didn't have to but I did that probably stupid on my part um but um but yeah so just that and then seeing how easy it was to move money with Bitcoin and then and then the other part of it was later on in life I left Canada after I got tired of paying taxes um in Canada and I moved to Monaco and that entire principality is built on minimizing your tax EXP exposure it's it's you know you're looking at flats that are like the current places in Monaco now that just got built are 859 million for a 3,000 foot condo it's the most expensive real estate in the world and the only reason it's that expensive is because there's a limited amount of land and everyone lives there because a tax is zero zero tax and so my point is is that that whole that's like a Swiss bank account move people are willing but whereas there's a lot of people whether they're whereas Bitcoin you can you can you don't have to invest in mono real estate to hedge you can have your money in your pocket you don't have to worry about a bank you can move money intermediate without any intermediates any permission even the bank accounts I had whether they'd be in Monaco or Canada they'd always been like why you sending this money where is it going why you get it and now it's even worse so that was part of it I like the I like the math behind it it made sense to me as a math guy um yeah I just and I'm an independent guy to begin with and so I didn't really click for me until later on I heard about it maybe five or six times Port finally clicked it finally clicked because I was betting with someone in China who had Ed who had had a really difficult time in paying me money also I was living in Vancouver before I moved to and my entire apartment building was owned by Chinese expats who are literally laundering their money in Canadian real estate none of them lived in my building the entire building was empty except for six people but the entire building was sold and all of Vancouver you ever been to Vancouver Canada it's an it's an entire money launder ing sit operation the real estate is all owned by foreign people trying to escape regimes that are you they're just Capital flight so Bitcoin just made sense okay I'm gonna go buy a a condo in Canada or I'm gonna buy some Bitcoin and put it in my wallet to escape some total some regime some Capital so were you taking the 10 million uh gross earnings and just going straight to bitcoin no then I was I was trying to get paid by people who owed me money and so this the first person the first time I ever acquired Bitcoin I had a a gentleman in in um fellow that I met playing poker who got me a bunch of accounts in China to bet on NBA basketball or Asia let's say I don't know where it was exactly but somewhere and he was like uh it was 2013 is and I was like Hey like how are you going to send me money at some point we had like an H an HSBC account in Hong Kong and he's like I can send you Bitcoin and I was like Bitcoin really you guys like Bitcoin I think the price was around $180 at the time he's like yeah everyone in China loves Bitcoin and I was just like like if everyone in China loves Bitcoin maybe I should love Bitcoin too like what is why do they love it in China and he's like explaining to why everyone loves it and how great it is and so that was it so I I I bought it then it very quickly went to 600 then a th000 like very after and then it and then it slowly went down to about 150 after I think bit finex got hacked after that the next summer but that's when I got involved and it clicked for me instantly when I was all the situations moving to Monaco for taxes seeing my all of the real estate in Canada being super expensive for Native Canadians especially in Vancouver because of especially people from Asia buying real estate and just holding it and not doing anything with it and I just like why would you like Michael sailor now has a really good view on it's like why would you ever own real estate you're at the mercy of the government who can change the rules and change the taxes or you can just buy Bitcoin so that was it basically what what when you're dealing with um you know I'm not saying that you're shady or you do ever do anything illegal but when gambling as an out well as an outsider when I hear about gambling I I you know I watched the movie Casino and I like I know like I think of ma Mafia and whatever when you're owed money and I and I had read stories how you're you were owed money and you talked about it what what's up with the gambling culture do people actually pay their debts just on a handshake agreement um yeah yeah I mean I think I had an advantage I mean just to be clear like I lived in Canada gambling was legal I paid my taxes I wasn't doing any illegal um some of the people who I'm my my my customers are all Breaking the Law because they're bookmakers so that I'm not the customer I'm the sharp they're the sucker I'm winning the money they you know they think they may think they're they're that I'm the customer but really I'm not so so um so for me the hard part was like okay Revenue Canada wants 57% of my money as my partner but they're putting all my customers out of business by making it so that that was part of it to answer your question is it hard to get paid yeah people lose money um because I'm betting through intermediaries for the most part I think like part of the deal is you have to guarantee the money when you're making the bets and people would go out of their way to guarantee me not because they're afraid of me because why would they be I'm not I've never ever done anything to get money other than be like annoying um but like if you knew that I was always going to win and if you didn't pay me you knew you were not going to get my bets anymore you might go out of pocket to make sure your relationship with me was good knowing that eventually you're going to make the money back if you're smart enough if you're smart enough you'd realize why would I step her albos Heros is going to win we're going to win it back next year I'll go out of pocket we'll figure out a solution that's generally what happened with me that's a good threat though you look I'm going to call you like at least five or six times to get paid I know I didn't even I was pretty bad at it to be honest like the way to get paid is to be the most annoying person in that person's life so so I had a I had a famous poker player who's like a really good dude but he was for sure a degenerate and he owed me money and um not not the like this guy Eric lingren he talk like he he you know that's what I was referring to yeah yeah and I would just like I would just like he would I if he won a tournament I would like get on a plane and just like be there when they paid him I would just like hand out and just like you just gota you know but you also have to be like kind of like understanding that this guy needs to live his life and also have some money but you know he was a guy who who at the time owned a piece of Full Tilt so they had all this individ all this imaginary money that they thought they were all going to be so rich and so he didn't really worry you know he didn't really worry about getting paid cuz he thought eventually they'd get paid by Full Tilt Poker but then Full Tilt Poker got shut down so these guys yeah anyways yeah that's what you do you just be annoying what what inspired you to buy the soccer team so like where like how long had you had that idea before you end up doing it I wanted to buy an NBA team and then I worked I saw like the sausage was made and I was like yeah the NBA is not for me um what do you do by that why not I mean for for one the the franchise valuations are going up and up and up and up it's a very very very um difficult business to buy because you're competing with the richest people in the world to want these assets so it's very difficult and then I just found I started finding the sport not that interesting anymore after seeing like how everything was all I didn't I didn't like I think the the bubble for me kind of ended it because it was during that time when the the league became like which is cool because the league was primarily it became like almost like a social cause versus and I thought that's good for society in some ways if you believe that and but for me it just became too much I just wanted I just wanted sport I just like sport so around that time I didn't want to you know I didn't want to I think people I think where the NBA maybe missed things is I think a lot of people wanted to escape during Corona virus into sport I want I okay forget about other people I wanted to escape the shitty the the whatever the riots the burn the whatever I want to escape all that into Sport and I'm watching the NBA and it's and maybe maybe the answer isn't maybe the answer isn't Escape for for people who are I'm not American but maybe for Americans who are living through it and they really believe that that whatever that's cool but for me I was just like yeah I don't want to watch this like I just want I just want to I want to watch a basketball game I don't want to have like a message so yeah it just became it became too much I think in some ways became overwhelming and then also you I was working for the Mavericks at the same time and they were in the bubble and I'm hearing the stories from them and you have like african- American coaches who are like really upset with what's happening as they should be the players are upset it just became like really draining emotionally in a way that made me really kind of sad and um I started watching football more because soccer was the first sport to start up after Co and so I just got really into it and we already building models to begin with before then I thought you know what I want to this is new it's exciting uh it's more mathematical in the sense of it's unsolved it's a lot more there's a lot the game tree is bigger it's more nuanced basketball is pretty simple you get a top five player you put him on the court you surround him with other players but he's the guy like hel it's called heliocentrism and then you profit and then you trade him for Anthony Davis and one first I don't know but that's it you just find a guy like Luca or LeBron or jokic or whatever um and off you go but it's not that difficult you said we you said we're we're we are building models I think Sean and I were talking and he was like this guy's like a lone wolf uh and no and I don't know the truth and I want you to tell me the truth do you um I think you don't have a family I think you're you're uh and I think that like from an outside perspective it doesn't seem like you have this massive company like I'm a lone wolf yeah okay this now I am a lone wolf when you put it that way yeah like I've always been very um yeah so I but I have people who work for me I have people can you explain that what what's your what's the organization what your team look like it so I have had now my organization not counting the football team which is completely separate just like 250 people or something worked for me I don't know how many it is it's a lot um maybe less I don't know account Academy players um but no I just have like I still do my basketball betting I spend zero time on it it's an automated program but when I first started betting on basketball programmatically with a model when I decided that my method works but it only works if my mindset is good if I want to have a life and have like emotional relationships with females and have a partnership whatever and I'm I'm making bad decisions when I'm gambling it's harder to be like a perfect Arbiter of what's right and what's wrong and what's the right information when you're the input so I wanted to automate me basically and so um so yeah I I I hired a couple different quants unsuccessfully they weren't great um kept trying and then a friend of mine a poker player by the name of well he played poker this guy named Brandon Adams was teaching at Harvard at the time and I was playing poker with him him really really smart guy and he said I have this student that I need you need to talk to he's a genius and he'd be perfect and I met him and that was the guy who basically together we built our simulation models that really took me to the next level which was not the little the halftime thing which I made a lot of money on um this was now full game bets on you know sides totals everything and so him and I together built and our operation was myself this individual um and then one person who basically was two people who were putting the bets in and also making the lineups um and then me and my the P the the we call him leiz because he doesn't want to be nobody wants to know who he is but um he's out there what's up um and we had a we had a falling out he doesn't not a falling out but he when I went to go work for the Mavs I basically turned over the business to them and he ran it for a while didn't enjoy it they didn't do that well and he left and then when I quit the Mavs we started back up again and um that was it so I basically did the gambling again not for myself but for the people who worked for me to allow them to make continue to make a lot of money because I've had guys who worked for me now for over 12 or 13 years with a gap with a gap appeared in the Mavericks and so um they run everything and they do everything dude you're basically running it like a like a small little seed fund Sean you know what I mean like a hedge fund algorithmic hedge fund like jump minus you know so you know those guys they measure their success on you know irr or you know annual returns and if if they could get 20% 30% returns what's a good return annual return for you what's a bad annual return for you where do you land you know I know what multif family can get you I know what private Equity can get you I know what Venture can get you it's hard to really quantify because I've never able to bet my entire network like I can't take in outside capital and so like we're I I don't look at it as more like an annual AR or it's more of a return on investment on every bet you're making and so every bet we make um a bad year for us was four and a half four four to four and a half percent on every bet we're making a good year is like in the eights and nines and now of course you want to have as many bets as possible and the most profit as possible so you're you want your Roi to go down a little bit as your bets go up so it's like you're threading the needle um but the game has changed so much now that now we've got like two models that are that are going at all times and we use like a mix between two of them and it's when I say it's automated it's completely automated like zero last four or five years since even before I you know even when these guys are running it themselves like nobody's saying I don't I think the models wrong like it gets teams wrong for sure and we have a guy who says like yeah we're really off on these Oklahoma City totals like we we we think they should be higher scoring but they're not we do be lower score we think they're higher scoring but they're going under and I'm just like cool we're not making any changes like and has you know now I we've said this before I don't pay attention to too much of sports I think it's [ __ ] insane though that like every sport is basically a gambling thing now like it's like gross like it's I think it's weird um but not weird it's gross it's messed up I think it's wrong and but does that make you richer then because you have more uh retail investors yeah this the amount of I don't even look like last night like I probably lost more money on fcoin yesterday uh my fcoin holding uh on paper that I would rate to make in an entire year betting NBA so I don't I I don't care what we make in the NBA I just do it because it's meaningful for the people who work for me and they have a massive profit share in it so that's why we do it so well let me just recap a couple things you said uh if every bet you know blow in four or 5% good 9 10% that means you need to bet like $100 million of total betting volume tot total dollars bet to make 10 million is that right correct yeah well you don't need 100 million to do that because you're doing it every day multiple times over and so yeah so yeah like that's exactly right yeah so couldn't you have just applied your brain to like buying HVAC companies as like private equity and gotten better returns right like you know like I always think about this with like if I hear somebody's a pro blackjack player I'm like first of all I don't even know if that's technically a thing I don't know if Blackjack is like a game you can get an edge in anymore but secondly if you're that good and that smart like couldn't you just applied it to a easier game and made more money like don't you think about that for yourself yeah if my dad was raay do I probably would have went a different path but unfortunately my dad was my dad was a Greek Gambler who spent his time at the racetrack so this is what I knew you know I don't know what else to say but you have done it you have done it right you're buying a team that seems like it could be a great business move and you did crypto yeah the crypto thing is really the part I think that uh is because I don't have an edge in finance these people have bigger they're smarter like maybe I could have honed in on one specific category that I knew very well but again like I try to like I I'm a gambler in the sense that I like gambling games but like the number one Edge and poker is playing with players who are worse than you that's just it and so I try to apply that also to my businesses I try to stay away from people that are smarter than me where there's plenty of them in terms of that I'm competing against um and so yeah I mean am I going to compete with like no I don't think so I mean maybe but at this point I think I'm good at what I'm doing I like my quality of life well what do you do with your money now do you um like your income or your Investments do you do do you do any boring stuff I mean I mostly do boring stuff uh index funds I do super Bor I do super boring stuff every dollar I earn goes directly into Bitcoin that's my boring stuff is that so that's still how how you roll then um correct yeah wow every dollar I make betting Sports goes into Bitcoin has forever I just so you've made more money off Bitcoin than you have have sports betting yeah for sure I've done very well with Bitcoin I've done very well but you know what's what's your endgame with Bitcoin is it hold forever is it Bitcoin becomes Global you know Reserve currency like what where does it there's no exit with Bitcoin right for you I don't know I wish I could do better Michael sailor in person na but I don't know this guy I like this guy I feel like his endgame is crazy as this guy is I feel like he's kind of he's a savant like he's kind of figured what is your endgame I don't know dollars what am I going to do with dollars like sorry I'm not they're printing more of it like it's not it doesn't seem like it works for me I remember like being in Co living in Malibu during Co and the houses that I rented had gone up in value like triple like rich people's stuff was going becoming more and more expensive as more and more money entered the system so what's my end game I don't know protect my wealth I guess uh maintain my sovereignty that's my end game I don't know like I just to be clear I don't have it in I like Bitcoin but it's it's still I'm not like the pure Bitcoin guys like the guys who are like have their own seed and they have it memorized in their head like that's not me my money is in ibit it's in the bank it's with a third party it's not smart but I like my quality of life I I I don't want to have I don't want to be my own bank like being my own bank was cool before people knew what crypto was now being your own bank is not cool like for me just to be clear like I love Bitcoin I love the self- sovereignty of it that's the ethos but my money is custody with instit tions unfortunately do you own anything like do you own any real estate and cars and uh like items or do you live light yeah dude this I feel like a l of this guy thinks I'm like some kind of like I'm like an alien who just dropped into the world that has nothing Bitcoin and watches Sports all day sh and I actually both rent homes and I don't I I actually don't own a lot of stuff I I like live in light sea does too uh and we don't actually own houses you like to so recently I I was with you guys I I didn't own any real like I bought real estate when I was younger um yeah I didn't I didn't before that I was I just thought like the better move is Bitcoin than like I'm why am I going to buy this house in Malu when I can rent and buy Bitcoin I sold I also sold all of my assets during the 2017 dump I own property uh outside of I own property in Mexico I some vacation property I some property in Europe I had a plane sold it all uh actually had some friends try to schedule an intervention for me because they thought I'd lost my mind when I sold everything to buy more Bitcoin at 3,300 uh wow you you sold all your [ __ ] to buy the dip that's incredible that's amazing I gotta ask you a different question what are you into now like we asked you a bunch about the past but like what's the future [ __ ] you're really like somebody said you're into biohacking or your mention something interesting about like owning things and and and I'm just kidding I'm just kidding uh what am I inight I'm into biohacking I'm into um yeah I don't know like I think like I'm into it's interesting because I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm really into like analog things like Records books all I'm I'm you know old games old like pinball machines yeah um being in I'm in are you like detoxing from phone like are you phone phone goes away for hours days I'm getting this new oh I forgot what it's called but this new thing that's black and white I'm trying to I'm into that um I think oox is is the new one that that just came out Palma Palma 2 I think is what it is it's supposed to be getting shipped um but that looks really cool we love those things I used to Brick all the time um and then there's like daylight which is like another like dumb phones basically daylight is nice I've used daylight yeah yeah I'm into that I'm into like to be honest like uh during covid I I started getting into like Western life like this is going to sound crazy but like I want a ranch yeah bought a ranch bought a ranch my friend do you want do you want to be buddies like I would love I I bought a yacht before was like on the Mediterranean cruising and now I'm like no I want a ranch I want courses I want simple um so that's what I'm into what are you doing for biohacking like what what what's your kind of like what's I guess maybe what do you finding valuable or helpful or or you're see the best thing yeah I do I do a lot of peptide stuff um I kind of grew up in like I spent a lot of time I should say in like rich guy La circles for a minute playing poker and all these guys were on like trt and HGH and all this other stuff and they looked great but they weren't necessarily optimizing for living longer so HGH is great you feel awesome on it but you're definitely not living longer taking it trt I think can be good for some people it didn't work for me I tried it it made me um irritable so I I do other things to raise my testosterone like I take some rodia whatever and fedia artisis and I do a lot of squats and kettle bell stuff and so I do quite well with that um but what am I taking I'm taking peptides for the most part I think the best thing I've ever done I do a lot of sauna um red light there be I would say the best that Brian Johnson regimen I mean yeah I I I admire what he's doing I just think like what's the I mean he's doing it for science I guess but for me it's yeah not for me um not that bad but I do have you know I do take about 20 supplements a day for sure I inject myself with some peptides when I'm diligent about it but I think the best thing I've ever done with stem cells are are you doing peptides and stem cells per injury recovery or you're doing pep I thought peptides is like for injury recovery do you use it for other stuff a peptide's like a protein like or an amino acid I guess that which is a precursor to protein yeah it's a pre it's a precursor you can find a pepti it's a precursor for whatever you want to solve for so like some is for injury recovery like DPC 157 that's what I took I took that on my achilles it was great yeah but it also by the way that also helps with your gut which then your gut connects to your brain which helps your brain it helps you there's a lot of benefits to it I take ham morand epam Morland Hein um with a doctor I get tested very regularly my blood tested very very regularly but the the best thing I've ever done and the thing I could recommend to anyone who can afford it is aside from sauna five times a day or five times a week excuse me um is is stem cells getting actual stem cells that are meenal which is through the umbilical cord do you do that if you have an injury or like I feel great like do you did you were you in you look great so you're probably yeah I mean I I yeah no you look great both you guys look like I'm not sure how but you guys look like they're doing great stuff for your health but I think yeah do you do people do it for I did it because I wanted to feel better and um I found this place in Panama that I went to Stem Cell Institute and um they were kind of the one of the Pioneers behind it Dr reordan I think that's like I think I think Mel Gibson's dad may have talked about this on The Joe Rogan i' already gone there but I think there's like an episode where Mel Gibson talks about his dad going there to get stem cells I've seen similar things like it's unbelievable is this the one where it's like its own Sovereign land no I don't know what that is but this is just Panama you're at likey state of Hilton last time I don't think it was Sovereign um oh I know what you're talking about I do know what you're talking about no it's nothing like that aren't they doing genetic uh they're doing genetic uh what Chris what's it called were you uh yeah they're doing that right it's like a Peter teal thing editing they're doing genome editing yeah that's yeah I don't want none of that I just want I want building blocks into my body to make me young so if you can give me the stuff that little baby has to grow a [ __ ] actual human wait but what are these guys doing it's like their own little Sovereign area and they're like building like the future Yao Ming super baby or something you know like the network State stuff right where it's basically like oh if we can get like you know I invested in practice it's like people who want to create create new lands where they can have like you know let's say uh more they can have different rules right for themselves like it's like a land where like an ran is the president you know like it's like Li it's like libertarian uh land you you got to watch the documentary it's hilarious cuz Brian goes there I think he goes there for like a full plasma like swap with his son and his dad or something like that I I don't remember exact procedure he did but he goes and it's like The two scientists who created this institute and they show the guy and the guy's clearly like 22 years old he's so young and but he has this mustache and he has glasses with like a rope as if like bro we can see through the disguise you're 22 years old and and the narrator was he standing on another kid's shoulders with a trench coat on exactly literally looked like that and he's like you know I think these guys hearts are the right place but you know they're not like 20year phds if you know what I mean it's like yeah cuz he's 20 uh it was it was so funny you got to watch that part yeah I actually did watch it and I know what you're talking about now and I remember like I had my finger this is where I need my digital whatever but I had my finger on the fast board the entire time like because you can't watch it all the way through it's just like what is this is not that interesting um but yeah I do know what you're talking about now yet it's nothing like that this is more for you have a rotator top uh injury um some parents were there with some kids who were um were autistic and they were doing that therapy there people with Ms a lot of different stuff that they were doing and I had the most I've done it maybe seven times um the the injuries you have Will Repair permanent that's permanent the Superman feeling you have for three to four months uh afterwards is fleeting but it feels amazing for that two or three month period and the there's a lot of physiological effects that you know that you got a good batch sometimes you don't get a good batch doesn't take but if you had a good batch you'll know it and it's yeah it's great I haven't done it in a while but it is amazing do you do any drugs or drink alcohol do you get like [ __ ] up at all so are You're Sober yeah I've just never I I think the last time I ever got I mean I was betting on NFL football and canadi football and University and waking up with a hangover and I was like yeah this doesn't work so you've been in like this like Vice this world a world of Vice but not substances and like you're you're like I'm too much of a control I'm a control I I like to be in control of myself I like to be control my emotions I like to be making good decisions I don't like to be not unable to think rationally so alcohol doesn't do it for me dude this is great thanks for uh thanks for doing this man where should people follow you is Twitter still the best place or X yeah I mean follow the football club I'm not looking to promote myself but I I would love for the football club to get more you know we were doing some great things this year at the football club and then um you guys won right you won the like we were recently promoted to La Liga 2 we had an amazing first start of the season and then we had had a game we had a a stretch where we played 22 games in 6 days and I failed the culture and that I wasn't able to demand that we do things that were proper for rest and health for the players and we ran our players into the ground during that period because I didn't have you know that was something that the coaches wanted to do and then we suffered some injuries and we've been basically we we're in the midst of a six-game losing streak right now which is sad um and we're paying for it from what we did in November which was a cultural failure on my part so I are you able to like apply the biohacking [ __ ] that you're learning to uh your sports psychology not the medicine part of it but like there's lots of studies on how to optimize health and and what the your risk of muscle injury goes up 25% if you a football player plays more than one game every six days there's plenty of research that can make you come to good decisions but like uh sleep and recovery and trying to we're going to do a better job when I bought the team we didn't even have a training facility so we're building a brand new training facility uh we hope to announce the land that we've acquired soon um and yeah we'll do we'll do stuff like that mostly think that you were going to go from like doing these bets and hanging out with your dad in Vegas to owning a team and uh implementing like what youever you want to implement that's pretty wild right that's a good uh that's a good ending so far or it's not the end but it's a good part of the story you did think that you thought that I did I was very delusional in when I was younger I was very like I'm a very I'm really I'm really a big fan of that sort of stuff like speaking things not speaking but just like having the belief and why not why not I mean I don't know the universe is kind of there if you do it like you you can craft your own path just keep trying until you get there dude you're insane you're the man you're the man you thanks for coming on dude you uh yeah you're welcome well thank you man that's it that's a pod [Music]

it seems like it was an insane decision to go to China with no money no plan no relationships no language skills slept in a bush and literally build your own Factory that was a disaster when I say we were naive I feel like that is even an understatement but to be fair success is a bad teach and in our business now I'm a huge believer in firing bullets and failing fast and then the bullet works it's a cannonball and we invest and we build the recipe around that how big is the the Empire Today little over two out of a billion US and in Revenue and it's public or it's not a not a public company are you are you ready are you ready are you ready let's [Music] go so here's what's fascinating to me so I I have like a love language when it comes to business and my love language is self-made dropped out of college family business multi-billion dollar company with no outside Capital like you hit all of the things on my little bingo card there which is what got me interested I want to start with the the origin story so here's the bullet points grew up on a dairy farm um started selling door-to-door hot air balloons was in law school then quit because he didn't like walking up a big hill every day and then made a crazy rash decision moved to China with no money no plan no relationships no language skills slept in a bush somehow turned that into a billion dollar company so that's the that's the the bullet points can you unpack that a little bit that's quite accurate that's quite a good way to summarize it quite quickly if I was to frame up our probably first 10 years it's that famous saying that success is going from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm I think that actually really does sum us up grew up more or less on a farm and then we moved North for our schooling and my brother won the New Zealand science fair with a model hot earb and then we decided or he decided he was 12 that we should make these kit set balloons and sell them door to door on the festivals when we're at school and I'm slightly younger than him so he kind of hired me as the when I say hire I was the free labor to help make the hot ear bores and yeah we used to make these model for the air balloons and sell them door to door I used to when I was quite young get my friends together and backpack around New Zealand and sell daugh door and I can tell you that learning how to sell daugh door is a great life lesson because you never know who's behind that door and you never know what response we're getting and on top of that selling a flying burning plastic bag is particularly hard to sell so it really HS your skills early on what was the uh what was your Technique so knock knock yeah I used to be like we're just a small company trying to get off the ground wink wink like no pun intended we were young kids so that always helped and uh you know we' often like would sort of build thesises around which neighborhoods were more likely to buy it was usually not the the richest neighborhoods they were all maybe a little too smart and so it was sort of somewhere in between would always looked for you know signs of children in the backyards um of houses and I always remember that one of my good friends still one of my very good friends today Fraser he us to always out sell me I don't think there was a day where I outsold him and I always thought I was a much B salesperson than him when the door opened but he just did not care about being rejected he'd go from each house he'd get yelled and shouted at and sweared at and he'd come out laughing and it'd be knocking on the next door within seconds and I always had to build myself up after getting rejected which was most of the time to to knock on another door and it it it just kind of taught me um I guess the power of just persistence right and you kind of keep going and if you keep going and have that level of of grit and perseverance then your chances are winning or your chances of success are much higher so I was certainly learning that at a very I guess young age all right my friends so a lot of you guys who listen to the show you listen because you want to start a company but you're not sure what idea to choose or you may not even have an idea and you like our podcast my first million because we've done a lot of the work for you on researching all these business ideas well my friends we've made life a lot easier for you because HubSpot they just put together an entire list of all the resources that you can use to find a market opport opportunity to validate for your next business idea so if you're looking for a market size calculator or tools to identify market trends or a huge list of ideas to get started so if you're interested there's a link below click it and you can have access to the whole thing it's completely free now back to the show yeah from there we we we kind of Matt Matt went to University as well and then he dropped that after a year to set up and make or develop this hot balloon through to a little bit more of a professional level and Matt say why don't we start why don't we explore going to India or China to try and manufacture our hot blue and given I was making them I thought that was a great idea and so Matt actually went off to India and China did a little scaling trip came back and he said China let's go to China and by let's go to China he said you go to China so I tapped up didn't go in my second year law found the most entrepreneurial guy from my first year at University a guy called Joe dragged Joe to China and we had no money really no contacts we went to a little place called shanto was the middle of nowhere there were no other westerners and we had an apartment I think it was like probably the equivalent of $8 a month to rent it was the eight floor no lift so whenever you were thirsty had to get water you had to like walk down eight flights of stairs to go and get water and come back up and that's where we started but we we ended up getting ourselves into all sorts of trouble and strife and there's a lot of funny stories the story I had heard was you guys like first night you like slept in a bush what happened there and but basically what was the plan were you just going to kind of go try to find a manufacturer walk around like what were you thinking of doing we were so naive and on reflection I look back on it's almost like we built a toy company from first principles cuz we did everything different to everyone else without even knowing it so we didn't know that you could go and contract manufacture your product we were planning on setting up our own little Factory and that's essentially what we did but me and Joe got into some trouble and Joe had to fly home to New Zealand so my brother came over we ended up trying to see if we could get a hotel but everything was way too expensive so we decided just to sleep in the bushes at Hong Kong airport I remember just getting completely attacked by mosquitoes all night and we didn't want to sleep in the airport cuz the floor of lights were so bright and so yeah we ended up sleeping in the bushes and getting attacked by mosquitoes all night it was not fun and then we fit it up to China and we set up a little Factory on the side of a river it was a small kind of shed more or less in China and my cousin Simon came up at that time as well he was an engineer to help us and he welded a production line and we bought we pretty much spent all of the money we had on an injection molding machine we employed a few people um on the production line we had a little old lady who used to cook for us every day I think the budget was 2 R&B per meal which was about 30 cents and and we started making our first product and then we started making our second product out of there as well which was a night frisbee which we got sued on and we had no money to defend ourselves so so stupid question but like why not like it seems like it was an insane decision just to go to China and literally like build your own Factory like literally like create a structure on the side of a river and like weld it yourself together why' you feel like you needed to be in China instead of just doing it where you were well we understood that most of the toys in the world were made in China but when I say we were naive I feel like that is even an understatement like we were trying to make our hot ear balloon but we didn't even realize that we couldn't sell it to any toy chains or large retailers around the world because of course didn't meet any of the regot Tre standards I mean it had a burning can under it so we were super naive so then we started looking up products that we could maybe make in our little Factory and we saw this company in America making uh light up of Frisbee with LEDs and it could be thrown at night we thought oh that's cool so we made this night at frisbee in our Factory and I started hustling to try and sell this thing as in like I would email every buyer in the world of every major retailer in every country I possibly could and I remember I sold it to a distributor called Schilling in the US and we spent what was a lot of money at the time and I went to New York toy fair and we made this m crispy and we also made this other product or copied this other product called a money gobler which was a money Bank in the shape of an animal and you'd feed the coins into its mouth it would go down the throat into the stomach so we started making these two products Matt decided he wanted to set up a wooden wooding toy factory for this money God blow we had our production loan for making this frisbee so I sold them to this company called Shilling I so I go to New York toy fair to to be on their birth to start selling these two products and I start selling these products and this guy comes flying onto the booth and starts yelling out a distributor so he's obviously got when that we made a product that's identical to his and he had multiple patents for how the LED connected to the fiber optic and how this all worked and of course we again we were naive we didn't even really know what IP was so he comes and so Dave comes up to me off the booth the the owner of the Distributors te we need to pull that frisbee off the booth this is probably an hour into New York Toy Show starting so I'm pretty disappointed because it's one of our products is gone but I'm like that's okay I'll I'll sell the money but gobl if I thought the first guy was crazy about 3 hours later this lady she has a whole business she's built over 25 years building these money animal Banks and she has this big booth on the ground floor of jits and she comes up and she screams onto the booth and she's yelling and screaming and swearing at bve and Dave sort of I can see this from where I am and Dave sort of wanders over to me sheep and says that you need to take the money Goblin off the booth as well so within the first morning of New York Toy Fair both our products have been taken off the booth of the distributor I flew back to China I said to my brother I said have you ever heard of this whole you know IP thing this whole patent thing I think we need to start innovating and coming out without own ideas and then we ended up getting into a lawsuit on the night F they sued us we had no money to defend ourselves I remember going to Colorado cuz that's where they sued us to try and find a law firm to defend us and I was going to all these firms and I was saying well that'll be a million or $2 million we had like maybe a few thous between us at that stage I was saying how are we going to defend ourselves I ended up actually hiring a lawyer convincing him his name was Chad he later get got disbarred that we would write the whole suit he just had to put his name to it and and Chad did the whole case for us but didn't really do it we did it ourselves we learned how to become War so we did it incredibly cheaply but he did he ended up getting disbarred um later on but that was our only way because again we had no money and I was so enthusiastic we had no other choice that we had to sell this prodct and I remember selling the night frisbee to the department store chain in the US Kohl's with the K I know we have Kohl's down here in Australia with a c never forget the buyer's name I actually still work with her today this is you know 19 years ago name was Jin s she was The Bu in Coal's and I would email her every single day and one day I got an email reply from her it was all in capitals it said Nick I do not have time for your daily email communication please stop emailing me every single day and I always wrote back oh so sorry Jim but you know I just think our product is really great and at this stage we knew we were in a little legal trouble but we had to sell something to survive so I I was like pushing and pushing and then eventually I get this email back from her it was just two words something El and said send the sample so we send the sample to her and she ends up ordering a full container I think it was 20,000 units of this night frisbee so we're we're pretty happy at this stage it was a big celebration we never had a full container order of any product and so we ship this full container of night frisbees uh and of course uh she gets enjoined in the lawsuit as well um at koh's and didn't speak to me again for a long time the irony is today she's the director of Family Dollar stores in the us and we're their second biggest toy supplier after B so that's the funny thing tra bonded correct but we have so many of these stories that is one of many many many in those early days so we really were just scrapping every day to try and survive and sell something and just like live somehow but we were living on less than a dollar a day okay I have two things one let's do a detour to the dollar day thing because U my guy Diego who helps me with research he goes you got to ask as him about the MC MC broke diet and the MC broke diet I said what's that he goes he goes apparently they were just eating off the dollar menu at McDonald's in China every day and he had some trick about the french fries to get free French fries so what what is the MC broke diet as far as it was we didn't eat McDonald's McDonald's was a treat so me and that were in China and for Christmas of course I think my brother didn't come back to New Zealand for 8 years he lived in a factory for 10 years he had a tiny little room at a factory for 10 years which is is crazy in itself um but for Christmas we would celebrate by going to McDonald's and probably the equivalent of a combo is probably $250 in China at that time so that's how Frugal we were we wouldn't even go to McDonald's so but we'd go and we' celebrate Christmas and I always remember going Merry Christmas Brad to me Merry Christmas Broan you know finally eat some good food I look like you know I was so skinny at this point but I'd always play a trick in order to get extra fries is I always eat half of them and then i' take them up to the counter and say hey you only filled my fries you know half full and then give me another one so I could get more for free but we were so we were like even you know when we'd go on the train we'd use a concessionary or children's pass and hope we wouldn't get caught CU it was half the price but I looked back on it it was like you know a fear would only be 12 R&B or a couple dollars and we'd be saving a dollar so about getting a concessionary fear and we did that for years so what what was driving this because like you lived in New Zealand New Zealand's a beautiful place I assume you could have just had like a normal life that was like com more comfortable and I love like I'm a Founder I've been a Founder but I didn't do what you did I didn't sleep in the factory on like a mat on the floor for 8 10 years I didn't live off of the less than dollar a day like were you guys just like was it you're having so much fun or you just felt there was no other choice or what was the what was the mindset that kept you going because it was like mult like many many years just scrapping I reflect back on us and it's it is a little bit hard to understand in all honesty when you reflect back on it but I think when you're in it together you kind of hold each other accountable and you push each other because you don't want to fail and I would say me and my brother are equally as competitive and so I don't think you want to let the other person uh down in a sense and so you just keep fighting because if one of you gave up you're kind of admitting defeat and so in a sense you hold each other accountable to continue to to fight and push forward and as well as that I think we didn't really have another option we didn't understand like back then that there was even such a thing as going and raising money to build a company or you know again I look back at the extreme naivity I used to write emails to my mom from China and she was beside s that you know I was up there I was so young 18 and I read these emails and to understand how little we understood even about the world but just about business and how things worked it's quite scary and so I just think we didn't know any better we just thought we'll just keep fighting and try and get these little wins and little wins and little wins and you know we started to get you know a little win after little win and then we started to get a little bit more momentum and then you started to learn but one of my favorite sayings is you win or you learn you never lose you never fail so and so connect the dots so now you're you've painted the picture beautifully of the extreme naive approach the scrapping and then somehow you know fast forward the tape and the movie and you end up with this super successful toy company I think you know the third most profitable toy company in the world doing over a billion dollars a year of Sales Plus like forget the other stuff you've even done after that but I'm just saying just the toy part so connect the dots where did you start to really get the momentum or what were the breakthroughs the epiphanies the key key breaks that got you to to actually getting to that success well there are a few stories along the way and I remember just sitting there every day harassing and thinking really big early so thinking just got to get Walmart I've just got to get kman at that time or I've just got to get these big retailers and you know one story I remember ringing Walmart every single day and because of the time zones it was late at night and to month after month after month after month and I always remember all the early names because I just see it in my memory and I remember one night my brother was basically telling me to give up he was like you're not going to get warmups and eventually the buyer Ryan hord answered and I was on the phone to the warm up buyer from China and again I was up with this young company we're just in chanted we're trying to get off the ground we got these products and he said do you have a showroom in Hong Kong and I said didn't I didn't know what a showroom in Hong Kong was but of course I said yes I'll get back to you at the address we started to Le learned that the toy industry at the time revolved around these showrooms in a place called Tim Chui in Hong Kong all B companies had showrooms there and all the buyers from around the world congregated in Hong Kong twice a year to come to these showrooms so I got on a train the next day to Hong Kong and had research where these toy companies were and start of knocking on toy company doors and trying to do a deal with them I said I'll bring the warm up buyer and if you just give me some space to use and your address and then you know hopefully you could sell your products to them as well and every company denied me and denied me and denied me so I thought okay we need to rent a showroom and at the time it was a lot of money but we found these little glass cubicles in a place called South SE centa and they were just a few meters by a few meters like tiny little cubicals but I think they would have been like I don't know or $3,000 a month to rent because H home was so expensive and so at the time we didn't have that money it was we were so poor but I thought we don't have an option we've got this chance to get the warm up byy coming in and so we we we we just said we have to do it so we rent this little tiny cubicle and it kind of had cursons on the inside of it and we I I found some shelving that someone was throwing out from another showroom so I put this little shelving in there we bought like a table and then I had a little roll up mattress and I sleep in the showroom under the table each night cuz there's no other room to sleep so I'd unroll the mattress under the table sleep in that and then I'd wash in the little bathroom in the in saly Center in the morning but I had the showroom and I start kind of realizing that the buyers come to Hong Kong in January and October every year so that was good cuz now I have this kind of like base to like invite people to so I get you know I get Walmart to come in I actually got a guy called Frank Deo who is from Walmart Canada and I'll never forget because he came in and I think he was so shocked that he given me a meeting when he saw this 2 m x 2 me showroom and he came with this two merchandizes I went to shake his head didn't shake my hand he didn't even sit down and he just yelled at me he goes quotes across the table and I'd filled the quotes for two or three products at the stage he kind reads the quotes and I'd filled something out wrong and he just throws the quotes down on the table and just walks out at Lees two Hong Kong merchandises standing there staring at me I think that was my second ever meeting and I'm just like in shock I'm like wow where it's going to be and he just storms out and then I contacted his boss and said hey I had this really like bad experience guy Frank and I genuinely think he was really rude and like I didn't and as boss Madam meet me again in their procurement in Walmart's procurement Center in chins in so I was like screw this I'm going to go up and meet him again me him for a second time and he ended up ordering and at the stage we had a night ball along with that night of Frisby but I think he ordered about $70,000 of this this night Ball but it was another good example of of of persistence and then I remember one day I had a in came out of Australia but I was sleeping under my table and the door is only about a meter from my head cuz this is such a little small showroom and the buyer came an hour early and I was still asleep under the table and she was knocking on the door and I'm sort of like there like looking her feet under the door thinking [ __ ] I'm still in beard under my table so I had to wait for her to go away and then mess her afterwards and say hey you didn't sh up about 10:00 minut she say Oh I thought it was 9:00 a.m. and so I had all sorts of experiences but I used to Crash by as hotels they used to post samples under their you know under their hotel roof doors but really we did what it what it would take and then I'd say the first break we got is and this was a crazy story is there was a I was in the UK at a company called Recreation and they were selling our night Sports balls at the time so we developed this other product it was instead of our night frisbee we made a Night Football a little up at night and a night at soccer ball so it sold for this company called Recreation I met a guy called sha on their booth and he developed a soccer tamaguchi and so it was it was kind of like a tamaguchi but you trained your player and then through infrared you could play against each other and he had like the Manchester United license and it was selling reasonably okay in the UK but he was having troubles with manufacturing and I was like can make that for you like no problem and he was like great great great you guys can help me make it cuz we were really you know in a was sort of wink at the time we were trying to find a way to win anywhere so we're like Sean we can make this and then we started talking maybe you know David bickham he's moving to the US to play in the US what we get the David Beckham license and we can try and sell this in the US and he thought this was a great idea so we went and pitched at the time I think it was Simon uh Simon Fuller who started American Idol had the David bickham um writers at the time and I'm like a I'm a super young kid right and they said well we'll give you the day bam license but it'll cost you a million half dollars because we don't have a million half but then we go to Walmart and Walmart the buyer her name Danielle prel never forget it she loved David bickham and he was moving to the US and she was just obsessed by David bickham and we probably blew a few bubbles but anyway as it turned out Walmart turned around and ordered 2.2 million units of this David tamaguchi which I think they were like 14 bucks 50 or something it was almost $3 million so keep in mind we probably never had an order more than $70,000 at this point and our total revenue is like in the hundreds of thousands suddenly we get this order for almost 30 million us and then we're like holy [ __ ] we thought we were going to make a lot of money CU we had huge margin we were making this thing for $3 and we were going to make this thing for $3 or $320 or whatever it was and sell it for $1450 so we were sort of count our pennies and super excited we didn't even understand that sell through was a big thing but then we were like oh no we have to look out how to make this product like you know we've got our tiny little Factory with you know 20 people in it there's no chance we can make 2.2 million units so when I'd first gone to China i' been on a tour of with he's one of the wealthiest guys in Hong Kong like Francis Choy owns Bly light International they the contract manufacturer for Hasbro and mattal and all the toy companies one of the first factories I ever toured I somehow got in touch with his 2 I guy called Wilson and he' taken me on a tour as an 18-year-old of their Factory and you could imagine me coming from New Zealand and then going to these factories with hundreds of thousands of people and just being like H what this is like insane so I still had this contact with Wilson from early light so I got a meeting with Wilson I said hey we've got this huge order 2.2 million pieces can you help us make it he said yep and then I said oh and by the way can you also pay for as well he said let me check with Francis come back to came back to me said yeah if you transfer the little of credit to us you know will help you pay for it as well great so we start making this product 2.2 million ic's 2.2 million LCD screens to so they all the components and then Walmart turns around and cancels uh they cancel it from 2.2 million pieces down to eight no 1.2 million pieces and I was like no no no no they can't do that we've got a little of credit they've made it all and then I'm flying back and forth at this point shm's kind of like in the background on this like I don't know 20 year old and I'm thinking there's no way but I was thinking well it's still fine 1.2 million pieces we' got so much margin in this we we can still make like good money out of it but then they turned around and canceled it all the way down to 300,000 pieces yet Francis was making all of this product and I was just like or I'm going back and forward it reads like some kind of soap op because Danielle got fired obviously part of this was part of it and with Francis I was like there's no way I can tell Francis that you know that they've cancelled this many pieces and he's paying for it all so I'm going back and forth to Walmart and I calculated that if I get the order back to 800,000 pieces we could still pay Francis off because we had so much margin and still make like a million and a half dollars and eventually I commit Walmart to to get the order back to $800,000 that's $800,000 or 900,000 pieces whatever it was and we shipped this prolite and it was a disaster like it hit the shelf and it was culate on the Shelf like no one would buy it I think they tablet at $30 they discounted it to 25 then 20 then 15 no one would still buy it then $10 no one bought it then $5 no one bought it and then they eventually sold it to the dollar in discount channels for like 50 cents on it like 50 cents a piece and then of course Walmart came back to us and said you have to fund all the markdown money from $30 to you know 50 and we were like what's markdown money and we were determined to keep our little bit of margin and refus to give them any money back and so we had to S like no but you cancel these pieces and like this huge thing anyway we got black ball from Walmart for like 5 years we never did business with Walmart after that and it was not to years later that I met Danielle's boss at New York toy for dear Laura Phillips and I wrote this big long email of everything that happened and like and we started to work together again but that was sort of our as crazy as it was that crazy story was our first break to actually make a little bit of money and then from there I started Ed doing deals with us companies that only sold product in the US but didn't sell internationally so I started doing deals with them because we were really bad at designing in vcon toys is terrible in fact so we needed good product so I could open up these channels so I do these deals with American companies like Zing or zard to deal with a Australian company called Yoho to take their products and sell them internationally and that kind of and I tell a big story that I could get their products in everywhere that I have to go out and hustle so we had a product called zies which became really successful and product called schnooks which was out of Australia that became really successful so we started kind of taking other people's products how did you figure out that model because you know did you see somebody else doing that and you're like oh that's much simpler than what we're trying to do or did you fall into it like it seems like you didn't use a lot of like mentors you did a lot of running around with the fork sticking it into Outlets trying to figure out you know where the where which ones are working that is that is a great analogy that's exactly what we did we just to be honest we were making these products and our the second product line we made with these night balls but the product was so bad Matt had would no Factory by this stage and the engineering of them was so bad that they had these sort of foam Eva Pates glued into this Frame but the production I I actually was getting quite a few orders I was hustling around and getting orders but Matt couldn't produce them because the production was so hard to do and I get so mad at him that at one point I said I'm coming back from home Hall I was living in my showroom and then from there I upgraded I was living in a dorm room with 18 people over place with Tung mansions in Hong Kong so I wasn't exactly living the life in Hong Kong I was getting these orders my brother could produce them so I was like I'm coming back to like to China to take over the factory and I learned two words of Chinese one was timeon too slow and one was qu let's go faster and we ended up like prod I was like on the production line pushing to get these balls out the door and I remember they were coming off the end of the production line Half mangled and I was just like ship them just ship them ship the balls we've got ship them but I remember years later like you'd see these things on sh and all the ear had gone out of them all Eva patches had peel off them and now these Shri up little prunes and it come to your health I love that you're honest about it because there's so many people because it's a very sexy thing to be like you know all all that mattered was product and we really just built a great product and then everything worked because we built a great product and like I know I know I've been there it's like dude the first version of all my products sucked in fact the 10th version still kind of sucked and I I love you're kind of unabashed and honest about like look we weren't super Innovative we saw [ __ ] working and then we were like cool we could do lights on a frisbee lights on a ball like that okay let's copy what works and that your product kind of sucked and you were just like basically you just kept doing door to-door sales even like at a global level you just started doing Glo like door sales and you literally it sounds like it was like distribution and salesmanship and marketing that was keeping you afloat at the time yeah well we would sell I would sell a product to someone and and we we wouldn't get a reorder we didn't know what a reorder was because the product would sell through and then we just sell a new product to a new customer and we wouldn't get and I just held another customer and we didn't know for probably seven or eight years what a reorder was like when a product actually sold off the shelf and the customer came back to buy more of them but we could like continually hustle to all these different customers but we did crazy things like we like I little back on it and it was kind of nuts like we sold this product the night ball we got a distributor in the us called Spin Master they one of the biggest toy companies in the world now very similar story to our own free Canadians built uh this this this this toy company very similar to us and Spin Master had agreed to take our night Sports Falls for distribution in the US and I'd kind of hustled a few retailers and so it was this it was this should we sell the r to retail should we use Spin Master they'll really put lots of TV marketing on TV marketing at the time was the thing and they said we what we'll run this test in Cincinnati so we'll put your night balls into all the Walmarts in cincin and we'll run media in that in that City and then we'll decide whether to roll this thing out and whether or not it was dishonest I think it was more desperation at the time but of course I flew to where the test was I got to New York and I couldn't get a fight to Cincinnati well I could but it was too expensive it was summer holidays I went down to the bus station I remember the bus station in New York at the start of summer holidays it's like nothing I've ever seen it was absolutely chaos but I got a Greyhound Cincinnati I think took like 30 hours and broke down stopped different places Go Greyhound to Cincinnati stayed in this absolute like horrific place but every day and yes this is a little bit dishonest but we were desperate back then I would bus I'd get the bus schedule I'd bus to each Walmart I'd give people cash to go buy a ball I'd go on and buy them on different credit cards myself I was so paranoid that we' get caught just to help our test sales go up a little bit and I would buy all these night Sports balls but it was a long day because the Walmarts were all so far apart and I was taking this bus schedule to get to each one I stayed there for a month and I almost got killed in a place called over the r if you look it up it was the most dangerous neighborhood in America at the time over the r it's like wild it was over these railway tracks and I managed to walk down there in the middle of the day and it was the scariest thing in my life and I had a guy come up to me and he said what the [ __ ] are you doing here white boy and and I was like I'm just a tourist and I hadn't realized I was in this like area and then I managed to somehow like Weeks Later walk into it I was walking back from downtown there's no such thing as Uber back there on Taxi so I was trying to walk back to where I was staying which was very close to over the rine and I walked in the wrong direction I walked in there in the middle of the night and I got chased um and had to hide it was very funny but um yeah we were doing this to to get our test results up which we had a good test and then Spin Master rolled the product out of course it wasn't it wasn't a great product in terms of its construction it was the same thing but my god do we have to hustle we had to strap and fight so hard to to like literally just to survive but we got to a point where we were we were selling enough to each new customer of each new product and we weren't getting reorders but we were profitable and it was actually funny because after the David bickin thing we made like that million and a half dollars or whatever it was we got a little bit fat and happy and we had a month where we lost $200,000 and I remember sitting we sat down and we were like oh my God we lost money this month and we were like from this day on we will never have a day a month a week a year will we lose money like if we're losing money in a month we will sit down we will like eat nothing or we will like get rid of people or we will like live on nothing just to ensure that we're like profitable cuz people wonder how do we get to you know a few billion re in in a few billion dollars a year in sales now and we've built it completely organically and the truth is we just cuz we like were so Frugal and we start building our business got more and more and more profitable just every year for 20 years so it was almost this cognitive process to how do we remain profitable and then that's just compounded over 20 years and we've just got more and more and more profitable to the point where um percentage wise by far the most profitable company in the world where we run it like 40% net profits which is unheard of in any industry in the world the Product Industry in the world let alone in software companies so so we just built a very very different model that's why I reflect on it now was almost like we built something from first principles the way we set up factories the way now we automate all of our production the way we don't do domestic uh shipping we do all fob the way we centralize all of our content and Data Systems on marketing globally we've almost built this company from a first principal's approach cuz it's so different to how everyone else does it but we did that more through navity then through planning so you're starting this kind of like 18 years old when you go to China do you remember how many years it took you to get to your first you where you made 100 Grand or when you made a million dollars like how many years was that well it was probably a couple of years where we started to make money but we still lived the same way because we needed that money to fund out growth effectively you can't grow to billions of dollars a year in sales organically without borrowing money or going to a bank unless you're super profitable to continue funding that growth and so we started to make money but we never SP it we still lived the same way I still lived in a dorm room in Hong Hong and so for years for probably eight years and as I said Matt had as we slowly moved and built bigger factories Matt would always have a tiny little room like a tiny little room in the factory and that's where he lived in China with no other like no interaction really with anyone else and we were going crazy in those first years in China like I'm I looked def at it I'm like we had some serious problems and so you um you take it all the way at some point you start figuring out toys that are new novel good products like I've bought your a bunch of balloon products where you fill up I don't know if it's like a 100 or 500 now like 100 water balloons at once you can fill up and like takes like 15 seconds to fill them all up so you eventually start making good products how did that happen so it was s on a parallel path we were taking other people's poies and that was helping us really open up distribution I would hustle and get them into all big retailers across all the countries there's an email that I've sent internally that I had from like 20 years ago and it kind of lists every country in the world and all the retailers and Distributors I was working with at the time trying to sell the products to so we're really like pushing out to everyone and at the same time we were starting to learn how to make better products ourselves we're sort of building a team in China and engineers and like some designers and we're starting to sort of parallel path building our own products as well but I think our a big break after zbi came when we did Robo Fish and Robo Fish is still we still sell about 8 million of them a year today and this was a Chinese and we ended up getting suit for this as well we're a 5year lawsuit but a Chinese and called xia ping and I met a guy in Hong Kong a french guy he had a factory in China was running a factory in China and he was doing some brokering so some for some inventions and he showed me this Rob F I actually didn't I thought that's cool didn't think too much of it then he showed my brother and my brother loved it like we've got to make this Rober fish promite and part of the deal was we had to make it in their Factory if we licensed it from from them so we licensed this fish and it was like it's got little carbon sinks it's very very clever design has electromed coil in it so it touches water it's all micro it swims and looks like a like a real fish swims in all directions and it's water activated so we start making this fish and then the guy who was the inventor had worked in a US company before and he had tried to sell as a mention to them that said no he decided a release on the invention saying no problem you can go sell it to anyone else of course roou blew up came one of the best selling toys in the world and then he decided that actually the inventor had designed some schematics or diagrams why who was underemployment and he would sue us because they were still on his computer systems and so we're were in this long long warsuit but even worse we finally had like this Massa pet it was like the number one selling in lots of countries around the world it was it took us to I think we did like1 million so this was like a big break for us but unfortunately there's always a curveball the factory that we were bound to make it with we bankrupt in the middle of production but we had to design so much specialist production not just the tools but all of these fish were tested underwater for precious they didn't leak and there was just a ton of like specialized equipment that had been built to produce a robo fish that were all slightly that weights had to be perfect so this whole Factory gets shut down and of course the wars in China mean that the factory workers are the first creditors essentially so they send the Army in to like stop anything or any assets being taken from this Factory so we're like Peak robber Fish Production Peak demand finally we've got price that are selling and everyone's scrambling there were retailers that wouldn't talk to me for like seven years actually one of my good friends today it's one of the biggest independent retail chers in the in the UK called the Entertainer and the of the owner Stu one of my closest close friends today he wouldn't even he didn't even talk to me for 8 years like I couldn't even get an appointment with him but suddenly when Robo Fish took off suddenly all these buyers were coming to us and hey like yeah like that Robo Fish so you got to imagine we finally had this momentum and then this tab to the factory and we lied we were like [ __ ] and it was crazy we could not get into the factory so my brother we had to do and this again there's so many of these stories but we were like we have no other option we have to get our tooling we have to get all our equipment we have to get everything out of that factory relocate it to another Factory but the Army was there everyone was there he couldn't get in so in the middle of the night my brother got like eight trucks got all of our team from one of our little factories filled these trucks with people and at like 2: 3:00 a.m. in the morning when there were less people like camped out at the factory pulled up to the factory paid a bunch of bribes to go in took all the trucks into the factory all our people went in picked up all of the tooling and all the equipment loaded up all the trucks in the middle of the night left and we went and relocated to a new Factory so we could continue production so it was uh it was crazy but that was like a game like nothing ever happens without a hiccup right like it was sort of like we finally felt like we had momentum and then this happened so how how old are you now 39 okay you're 39 do you still go as hard or like are you still as nuts as the early version of you like do you still have the same drive or are you human and you're like you know yeah I used to really be super you know super driven super resilient going going really really balls to the wall and now I'm you know tired and whatever you know I'm I'm an old guy now like do you still have it I we still have it I think we still are just as motivated today if not more motivated than we have ever been we see a pretty pretty cool road map ahead of where we want to get to the next Contin years particular Z take and building houses or production lines and Z so let's talk about that so can you just summarize how big is the how big is the the Empire today so little over two out of a billion US in in Revenue but uh we're drawing in about 25 to 30% year on year so that's compounding but I think the thing with us is is our revenue is one thing it's just how profitable with built the business and it's public or it's not a not a public company not public no okay so privately held super profitable company that's like a billion dollars a year of profit basically out of the toy business but then you have this diaper company it's you started you started buying other companies right not so much buying I I actually got chromes so I got sick in China and Hong Kong and I had to have my bow my large intestine removed this probably has something to do with living in China for all those years eating incredibly poorly I'm not sure but I had to move home to New Zealand to get surgery um about 6 years ago and it ended up being a great thing so I was in Hong Kong I I came home for the surgery I was meant to rest for a while and I was sitting at home and I was getting restless trying to rest as I had my bow my large bowel moved and I had a friend who had started a small D business and he was doing like 50 Grand a year at DDC in New Zealand so really really small who' be met me away it for 3 years and I thought well I might as well help with this but I'd always thought like toys is this industry where there really is a sealing the size of the business you can grow just because of the the you know the addressable Market the size of the market also you've got Brands like Hot Wheels which are super hard to disrupt and I was looking at fmcg and I started to realize that there's like nine companies that dominate 80% of it globally and when you build a toy business you work in every material form you work at speed like speed of innovation is your DNA you build this muscle for Speed and work fast and innovating because you reinvent 40 50% of your entire product life every single year but because you havent so much from your product line every year it becomes really hard to keep growing right CU to reinvent to to catch up every year and so I sted to form this thesis about 6 years ago I thought man we're so good at automating and we we sort of I would classify zuru today as more an automation company than anything else like the pr is almost secondary we build incredbly sophisticated automation we had a huge automation team so whether that's building a house on production lines with robots or a Dart Blaster with robots it's um you know a big part of what we do so you know I was like we we've built this automation muscle and the speed of innovation muscle and I feel like these big fcg companies they one they don't innovate two they have a lot of duopolies so if you look at pet food it's Mars and nay if you look at baby it's K clar and Brer and gamble if you look at beauty of person here it's La Royale and B and gamble little so there's a lot of if you look at laundry it's pretty much just B and gble T so all these duopolies and monopolies across the board and through that they were delivering much margin to their Retail Partners they really held the the power and I mapped I remember mathing out Walmart's revenue and I mapped it against the top eight fmcg companies in the world so Walmart did more Revenue than all of them combined but then what's that what's that acronym you're you're saying what MCG what is that or fmcg fast moving consumer goods so fmcg cpg consumer package Goods so so if I looked at prop gamble nesle Mars all the biggest fmcg companies collectively their revenue is less than Walmart who does 611 billion but then Walmart makes only a fraction of the profit they're all public companies and the big fmcg companies make the Lion Share 75% of the profits so I thought is there a world on which we can be disruptive in fmcg fast moving consumer goods can we deliver more margin to our Retail Partners can we innovate faster bring our speed of innovation mindset to to these categories and can we reach customer in a far more efficient way way and can we move at the speed of culture and obviously at the time digital and data driven advertising was you know starting to become a bigger thing and you know targeted advertising and I was still looking at baby I was thinking well you've really got a m a mom who's an incredibly targeted audience or parent who's incredibly targeted audience how can we serve them in ad every single day in a targeted way rather than just like waking media so that's super efficient way to reach our customer what if we build a better product deliverable margin and position it at a better price and that was kind of my overall thesis can we do this and can we run our same kind of first principal toy model like fob so we don't hold products to Bine large advertising dollar spent but in a really centralized um controll way and I thought okay I can do this so I worked with my with my friend and I said okay let's launch this diaper brand in New Zealand as a test market and within one year I think we're taking 40% market share in New Zealand launching a diaper and I remember meeting Greg foren who was CEO of Walmart at the time and he's a New Zealander and I met him in of and I was like Greg you know toys is great and it's been this it's this incredible University for us cuz it really allows us to you know it's you would build skill sets that is very hard to build in any other industry and I said we're going to take on diether and he turned to me and he said nit ever heard of Coke and Pepsi like you were saying that it was going to be that hard to crack like Pampers and Huggies are going to be that hard to go disrupt and I said I get you but I think we can do this I'm going to give it a go so we launched in New Zealand the second biggest brand in in New Zealand was Treasures Huggies was number one Treasures was a local brand their Shar just plummeted they ended up going out of business and having to sell the brand for for the Pennies on the dollar and you're spending a ton on Facebook ads or what are you doing to Facebook and then it progressed to Instagram now it's progressed to Tik Tok like it's sort of always progresses right like so you've got to move at the speed of platforms but you've also got to move at the speed of culture so how do you move at the speed of Trends to build content to move at the speed of culture was that a new newish skill set for you because it seems like the toy company was retail driven yeah well YouTube was kind of thing that it was mainly TV advertising for toys at that time so it was still TV was predominant and then it kind of switched to to to to YouTube so today we don't speak any money on TV and toys it's all YouTube it's all Tik Tok it's all YouTube shorts so it really like the platforms change and how you reach people but so I had this thesis but we just quickly took all this market share in New Zealand and I was like holy [ __ ] we can make an incredible fight but to be fair success is a bad teacher like we just got the success out the gate RS just we launched SP it just took off and so I packaged up that case study went to Australia went to Kohl's and I said hey look at what we've achieved in New Zealand look at all the margin we're delivering look at the category share were driven we helped food stuffs reverse their category sheare decline like they were getting hammered by the competitor ww worth here we inverted that we took them the other way with him one year so Kohl's was like love it launch with Kohl's same thing we won Kohl's non food supplier of the Year award in the first year and just help them like take heaps of category Shear so I was like wow this really works took that model went to the US went to Walmart was like Hey Walmart we could help you disrupt you know your two big suppliers here and they gave us a Dallas test same thing we became actually last year Walmart's fastest growing brand total ball all categories with Rascals which to Target did the same thing with our brand Milly Moon Milly Moon actually just over to private label and Huggies a second biggest sub brand in Target in under or about three and a half years which is incredible so it was sort of this like wake up moment that wow and I think last year we produced 2 billion diapers and this is all in under this is all in about 5 and a half years we would would build this business so well over a billion dollars of retail sales last year in diapers in you know five years so from St to to to go a billion dollars a year should I say and growing incredibly fast like this year let them grow 30% um game so this was sort of an eye for me and I thought wow we can do this in all FMC categories so I started testing in New Zealand and losing like we tested infant formula didn't work we tried F care failed we tried like oat milk fail I did all these old things I started fa and I was like oh but my partner of the time Jamie had a background of luxury PR and and and beauty and was huge beauty of this here so I said hey don't do that let's start a beauty brand and we started Monday here here and which is the little pink bottle Forbes called it last year the most famous shampoo and conditioner bottle in the world but we launched that PE Co and that was the second one it just took off we I think in Australia um we won product launch of the year and we had five of the top 10 in total hair care we over took pen in sales what what do you think is the difference between the ones that worked and the ones that didn't is it category some categories were just more ripe was it you nailed the packaging and the positioning and that's actually the thing that matters most is it luck diapers was is driven by price and performance and we were the first one in the world to take a China diaper to the world and China is making the best diapers in the world so in China there's like a thousand domestic Brands all competing to the technology and nonwovens and substrates and sap and machine technology has just gone like that because of all domestic competition so we took the best product in the world to Market at the this price and category which is price and performance driven so it's either you got to be price and performance driven in a performance driven category or you've got to be Innovation driven so we launched dummy yum which is super Innovative to pictur product like really Innovative and that was just pure Innovation that made that like takeoff so Innovation or it's got to be design and creative so Monday was you know still a bottle of shampoo but incredible design and creative and then we just owned Tik Tok as in it is the number one here care brand in the world on Tik Tok and by a long way um and it was just the right design creative positioning branding marketing and it just took off and I think last year in the US it was second only in total growth in hereare to proor and Gamble's total hereare portfolio just the Monday brand and so then I started to learned kind of which categories would work for us and we've gone super deep in those categories and we' applied our same model so building all the factories and diapers we built a factory I think took us 9 months to reduce and we're doubling the size of it right now so we have 4 billion diaper capacity by next year in Beauty we built the whole Factory Everything Under One Roof ejection Ming rotor mulling filling mixing all of that we built all the lab and shangai we got L'Oreal formulation specialist over un Le formulation specialist so as soon as we found something that was working so was outpour sourcing to begin with then we do the zuru thing which is go super deep automate everything we possibly can put all AGS in so every little part of it we want to like autate as much as possible and then pet food I started at the same time I bought a young guy who won M on High School entrepreneurial program out a guy called Alistar he's incredible I said let's start a pet food business together actually we were at the supermarket and we said let's do pet food and so now we're getting huge momentum there um one of our Brands I think Bonkers was drove 30% of all cat treat growth in America last year and then we experimented in supplements which has been a little bit hard I built a brand with the Kardashians called dosen Co we ended up selling that last year it just it work everywhere house in the world it failed in the US and so as soon as we don't have to scale the US that sort of let's exit it um and supplements we're sort of struggling with our brand habit which is s of ticking away and then very much um home care we're building a bunch of Brands as well so sort of and convi so we've built this what I call our five vertical strategy um and we're going very very deep within all of these um verticals and I think all of them individually can be bigger than our toy company within you know two or three years and what's what's the dream like so why why go so hard why do so many right like you could just off the toy company you could be sitting on a boat you own looking at an island you own with a you know a beautiful drink in your hand is that just you you love the game you have some dream you want to be a 100 billionaire what's the what's driving doing more more and more I think we love it number one love having a thesis love competing for me it's it's sport right like it is Sport having a thesis going into something working it out and as we build these things you know toys business The Edge business fmcg business you know as you become more successful you think how can I solve bigger problems and the same person G for and always said you got to wrap your business in a bigger purpose as well and I thought we thought how do we solve bigger problems because we're almost in a privileged position now right how do we go on and actually solve bigger problems which is why we've studied building zuru tick over the last what it's actually been eight or nine years can can you explain what that is so it's a crazy moonshot idea I think you have you either have or are building the largest Factory in the world period um what do you what is the what is that idea what is zurch so zuru the thesis really was if you look at the construction industry it's been done the same for hundreds of years it's also the biggest segment or Market in the world construction property development and the idea was how do we build the first factory in the world that has a customized input so the design of a building and a fully automated output so how do we build buildings for small fraction of the cost of what you build a building for today and and we're now we we started off so we built our software which is called dreamcatcher which is built on Unreal Engine it has an incredibly simple UI sort of user interface but the logic layer or the coding layer below that is incredibly incredibly complex we've cataloged every building code in the world so you can drop a pin on any location in the world it Maps the terrain it does the building code and then you can design your house or building or whatever building you want in our dream catcher software we've also built our own AI assistant or on our own large language model um called quira which is basically training it's training our model on all the great Architects so you can talk to your building and it builds it in front of you you can put a 2d plan in you can decide on this room I want it to be Stockholm style and furniture and it maps all the furniture and does it for you so it's incredibly intuitive software but basically a 10-year-old can design on dream catcher and then it does all the structural side it does all the me the mechanical the electrical the plumbing it does it all in a super intelligent way wherever you've dropped the pin where you're building the building it works out the orientation of the building for the sun it works out how many HVAC units you need it works out how many solar panels you need so basically then the software translates every part into our Factory our Factory builds every single part and it's completely automated and the factory is designed from start to finish so originally we built a 1th scale Factory so that's to test the software with the hardware and how that all integrates together so it builds these mini houses that 1/ in every Dimension and then we once we had got that working we built a it's about a three hectare Factory and it's a test production line and that right now is producing that's we're testing the software at full scale with full scale houses and we're building a house about every 2 weeks right now which is test and then we have like 100 little changes and we go and software changing here and then we bought bought a factory or or a building that's 25 acres in size which is our first commercial Factory for producing commercial houses and in phase four will be building um one of the biggest factories in in in the world I think 60 to Boeing is is the plan so that's all um planned out now but we are building a house for $500 a square meter and it's the best quality in the world irated concrete ceramic tile but we've innovated every single part of the process so we have the wall module the tile module the window module the lighting module the smart home module and every single team I think is the best in the world of what they're doing so it is a huge project it is a massive undertaking I think we have about 700 software and Hardware Engineers working on it are you self-funding this or did you raise money for this correct yeah no we self fund it and so we're getting very close now to a final product we think we're five test houses away from getting it very close to to perfect and then it should be um transformational in in terms of how the world builds and anyone can use dream tach the software so you could go on to dreamcatcher and there might be a million different two-bedroom houses that have been designed by people on the platform and you can look through them you can put a price on selling your own design you can go through them in real time you can stage Furniture we'll have a Marketplace Ikea could digitally scan all of their Furniture into our Marketplace artists could digitally stand all their AR in so you can put it in your house you can go around in real time and see it and so the software is really uh the software is really incredible um you know what what what what we've built so super exciting that we're we're so close out and the the houses that we're producing um each couple of weeks are are really incredible I mean this is a insanely cool idea uh just to basically it's like like if you go to the website it looks like you're looking at the Sims the video game like like you can just kind of like Zoom around the house you can like move things whatever but you're saying there's a button where you just basically click print and then the house gets built in an automated Factory which is just a a kind of mind-blowing idea how much are you going to put into this funding wise like you must be push this must be in like you must be putting hundreds of millions of dollars is that is that right or am I overestimating it's any a lot for sure so the software so we have three offices in India on the software side pun kakata and underband and we have two in Italy Milan and mon the reason in Italy is we actually acquired years ago the software part of it it was two guys Martin Aliso the PB Architects that decided that architectural software was built on incredibly old um software stacks and so they were like well gaming engines are like going like this and so they decided to build software or architectural software on Unreal Engine and so we acquired them and that's sort of the reason I think we have about 160 160 or so people sitting in Italy on the on the software side and then they work with India on the software side and then in China we built all the hardware side out so we have three sites where we're doing all of the hardware and automation um development but we kind of parallel our automation team is sort of growing a parallel we you know they automate for example we produce 57 million D and water blasters a year but we produce a d Blaster from a plastic granal through the finish product with no people our competitors like Hasbro they outsourced factories who still produce with drills on production lines we're now building out automation 2.0 where we're using vision and machine learning so we can actually change out any model of blaster on the same production line it can see the mold and it can see the shape and where all the screw holes are and it adapts completely so we've kind of paralleled like paralleled our automation with building in a housing project but also taking all our expertise and building across our Zoo Edge and and Toys business which makes us um so uh so disruptive but the big difference is is when we automated product in fmcg or toys you're making the same product over and over and over again with robots this is incredibly complex cuz you're building a tailored product for every building site in the world and every building code of the world and it's different every time and so having that fully automated output with a fully customized input is never really been or has never been done before in the world dude you're a Madman um do you even like who are your peers like who do you relate to um do you just read like an Elon Musk biography and you're like oh that's the only other guy in the world who I I have something in common with like is that somebody you admire what what we have a huge admiration for Elon with the big Tesla backis and fans for a very long time in fact I'm say you know uh I had a chance to meet him and then I had to fight home for an emergency and so actually don't know him um but my brother my brother was very similar to Y so my brother was sort of the the driver behind zuru and our building project he's very similar in his way of of thinking I think likeon calls it the idiot index for example right and the idiot index is when you look at the cost of a rocket well he looked at the cost of what a rocket used to cost to build and then he looked at the cost of the materials and it's like you know hundreds of times the cost of materials to build a rocket and he's like well then he takes a first principles approach he breaks it down and he works out effectively you know how to build a rocket at a price that makes sense based on the cost of the raw materials I mean we're having a similar approach to how we build a building whether it's one story or 100 stories it's look at the cost of materials out of the ground and look at the final host of the building the Ida index is really high and so same or similar type of thinking so how do you go back your first principal approach and do it from the ground up in a completely different way did you see um the other day I think yesterday or two days ago boom supersonic did their first supersonic flight I don't know if you followed this startup it did yeah he he kind of had a similar story where he worked at Groupon basically and he's like you know a product manager at Groupon selling coupons on the Internet and then you know for fun was basically having a you know a hobby of flying and then gave himself a year to from a first principal's point of view you uh understand how planes work and figure out if there was some business he could build in the pl you know around planes cuz he just loved planes and while he was building his spreadsheet he was just like I don't get it there's no reason we shouldn't be flying supersonic speeds right now and then he took it to like professors and others he's like where where is the error in my calculations cuz this is telling me we should be doing Supersonic and they were like no there's no theoretical errors uh just no one's doing it like there's no courage is the limit not like there's not a materials problem a courage problem there's a entrepreneurship problem and seeing that go you know yesterday to doing their first supersonic flight was super inspiring incredible So you you're doing all this stuff do you like have hobbies do you do stuff outside of this what's like what is fun for your is this is like my cup is full with this sport definitely sport we love just love competing really so anything that has a competition element is something that I get a lot of enjoyment out of so yeah certainly uh tennis golf just sport in general is is is something that enjoy doing but um yeah as you get older like obviously we don't I used to think you wake up every day with that pit in your stomach cuz you're wondering what's going to go wrong today and what do we have to solve today so you know obviously we don't have that that issue any longer and and definitely get to spend more time with family I finally had my first child last year so that's uh congrats a big change it definitely changes your despective on things I think which is which has been really good I always sort of Kick the Can delayed it as long as possible think would slow me doubt but it's definitely been one of the best things so do you um when you start these new companies cuz I always I always find this interesting whenever you have like a Serial entrepreneur uh people have different approaches so some people they you know they have their main thing and they leave and they say I'm going to go on a sabatical basically for a year figure out my next thing other people they take some percentage of their time they're devoting it to new ideas and they go they roll up their sleeves and they're super like on the ground figuring out the new idea other people they recruit a operator and they just give the operator kind of like the idea maybe a little bit of a plan and then let the operator run and they kind of are there as more of a chairman or a board member from afar when you did like the diaper brand and these other ones were you like boots on the ground like every day figuring it out or did you do the operator model what what did you do definitely boots on the ground what I would say is in our business there's a through line through it all right we're essentially making a product where there was a house of bow shampoo a laundry pod or a Dart Blaster I mean it's essentially still making product building factories selling it into to retail so we've built such a big flywheel like if you look at our chins in office we have 3 and a half thousand people L right and it's such a big flywheel that it just becomes easier and easier to plug into that flywheel regardless of you know what category in yes they're all different Industries but we're still effectively trying to make the best product in the world at the best price we set ourselves the goal of making a product to $0 I know that's impossible but that's our goal how do we make to product to and how we make it the best in the world so there's a through line through it all so very much boots on the ground I believe you know leadership has to be on the dance FL have to have your hands dirty that's where you get most insights and in our business now I'm you know I'm a huge believer in firing bullets and failing fast so I always say get an actionable Insight where's an Insight find an Insight somewhere in the world and an Insight forms a bullet and a bullet is a minimal viable investment into testing something and then if the bullet works it's a cannonball and we invest and we build the recip around that and once the recipe is working you can pull a lot more things into that recipe and build that recipe out so our mindset around fast fail we actually have what we call fast Starts Now in fmcg so we're trying to build minimal viable products to test quickly as fast as possible and so we can really speed like speed of innovation is is probably the biggest thing for us and we're trying to test more things in these categories faster and learn what works and what doesn't cuz in my experience things either just like hit the ground and start working or they don't don't and then we have a mindset around continuous Improvement so we call it 2% Improvement a week the power of compounding I know 2% Improvement a week is nothing you can measure but that's the mindset that's what we put into our DNA and we always say to the team we suck now compared to where we'll be in the future so we have this Relentless mindset and being able to look back on ourselves a year ago and be like we weren't even good then and I think that compounding Improvement is such a a big part of of what we do and then from you know when I look at team members I'm trying to people say they're try and build Talent density in their business yes we try and build Talent density but for us we're trying to build like grit density and I say when we hire we're looking for grp smarts and someone with a B action like real doers right people that just like we fast fail we go in we do it we are the winner we learn if it doesn't work we're getting Hicks of insights out of that on how to improve next time so our mindset or our DNA in the business Works across any of those verticals or categories or we have the same mindset and the same approach and the same DNA as to how we approach them if you were interviewing me how would you figure out if I have any grip I I think actually like looking back at your history is is kind like we often find like people at really great competitive Sports people and they really love to win and we're highly competitive like I want to understand how competitive you are how much you really want something and to be honest it came me really hard like we've built this Loop process in our business similar to the Amazon Loop so where you know half we're hiring and looking at you know whether you fit and can do the actual job but the other half is really do you aligned to our DNA and so we have a loop we have you know eight people you know half of those people will interview on questions around you know our DNA and really trying to go deep on understanding if that person fits our DNA and so we're really trying to build our you know not our talent density but our grit density but certainly it's something that I find is really important all our best people have just incredible grit and incredible bias for Action sure that's smart but they just get [ __ ] done and you know we decide something going a meeting and they're already kind of actioning it in that very moment and that's kind of our our our culture well it's that it's kind of that saying as well right that lazy people work a little bit and expect to be winning whereas winners work as hard as they possibly can and worry that they're being too lazy and I feel like that's super true right like people that like work hard they're always worrying that they're not doing enough or they're being too lazy and it's kind of those people that's kind of the mindset we're we're we're looking for yeah I think Elon has a good question he uses in interviews he says uh uh tell me about he just start sits down he just says tell me about the hardest problem you solved and how you did it and you know you could get so much from one question because what what's the hardest problem they solved you know it will show you the the scope and the trust they had in Prior roles like were they just nibbling on tiny little issues or were they actually like biting into really meaty things yeah and like yeah can they talk about the details the paths that didn't work the paths that did work because that's the person who was actually doing the work there's so much like resume lying where somebody says oh yeah we did this like cool tell me how you did it they don't know because they weren't the one doing those parts of it correct correct Nick this was awesome man I really appreciate you coming on you don't do a lot of podcast but your story is is honestly incredible I think as much as you're building in the factories I think you can you doing it a podcast like this can build 10,000 new entrepreneurs with more grit with more resilience just by sharing the story because you're showing you know what's possible you're showing what you did how it all turned out and how you approached it and so I think you know a simple hour like this can do a lot for a lot of people so I really thank you for doing it it was a lot of fun and yeah I don't often share our story let of but yeah I totally agree if it can help inspire people and I always say it right it it's not really how capable you are it's how willing you are and I think it's the Willing people that stick at it for a long consistent period of time and continually improve that actually are the most successful it's not necessarily about how smart you are it really is just grit and perseverance and and you end up getting there so I think that's the big lesson for any entrepreneurs out there really right on all right thank you so much that's a wrap [Music]

all right today's episode is special we've got Matt molwig Matt founded a company called WordPress which is used by something like 45% of all websites on the internet so it's just huge thing and we talked to Matt about a bunch of interesting things Sean what did we talk to him about he had an offer to sell his company for $200 million when he was 24 years old he turned it down we asked him what that was like we talked to him about some of the recent drama that they've had we talked about how they've been acquiring companies they bought this small company in South Africa and how it turned out to be a huge thing for their business like you know Billion Dollar Plus win and he's just a student of the game he's been doing it for like 20 years this guy started this company when he was 19 years old and is still doing it and it's become this absolute Juggernaut so enjoy this episode with Matt melon wi tell me if this is right cuz this sounded like almost too good to be true but IID read that in 2008 you had an acquisition offer I think you're only 24 years old for $200 million at that point I think you'd only raised a million dollar and I think you raised a million doll at 3 million valuation something like relatively uh like you're you're 24 you're going to be worth nine figures something crazy like that you turn it down but then you talk about how you didn't have control of the company because you were young and uh you maybe just like made some mistakes with funding something like that what's the conversation like with yourself when you're like I'm turning down something that might make me worth over $100 million at the age of 24 yeah you talked about and you're you know your name the first million it's kind of funny like I guess technically on paper my first million was that first funding round right in theory I owned like half the company that was now worth $4 million but as you know like that's paper money like I was still you know eating Ramen and and Mountain doing Pizza like living you know a very broke San Francisco uh sort of college kid life um but it was in in 2008 that uh we had this acquisition offer and you're right it was uh about two two and a half years in this company someone tried to buy us for 200 million and the investors at the time um did something which now is quite common but at the time was was pretty forward-looking which is a secondary so they said uh said wow you know we're 20 people we've been doing this for two and a half years a $200 million exit would be pretty amazing like I said I would walk away personally with a lot of money um but you know we think this could be actually way bigger so let's let's build that and so we took that acquisition made an evaluation and you know took um you know turn that into a funding round where we put a lot more Capital than the company so we could you know really build things out and uh and I sold some stock myself so I that was my first that was my first million liquid uh was kind of in 2008 I think I was 24 and um and that was a step change you know I was able to like you know pay off my credit cards and buy my mama house and like you know all that sort of stuff that you you want to do that you dream of and it sort of removed some of those um sort of early economic things and I was really able to focus on just the business and Swinging for the fences which is what they wanted me to do you know I hear these stories like Zuck turns down a billion dollars from Yahoo or whatever this story about you at such a young age turning down you know the opportunity to exit and have this huge payday um I think you're a better man than me I don't think I would have been able to resist that uh was that an easy decision for you was that a hard decision like what and like you're like I think this could be bigger let's go for is that just like blind not Blind Faith but just like an extreme amount of self-confidence and Faith like how do you even or did you even want to do it and the investors were like no it's too bad no it wasn't easy decision at all of course like you have to uh you have to really seriously consider these things also as a fiduciary you know like you have a responsibility to shareholders um to consider every acquisition and we've had other acquisition offers and people trying to buy automatic you know as recently as this year I think you have to ask yourself when any acquisition like will the mission that we're doing be accelerated by this transaction or will it be hampered hey let's take a quick break to talk about our sponsor today HubSpot has put together a list of 200 AI business bu ideas these are business ideas that you could create using Ai and it's a list of 200 they did a huge brainstorm so you could check it out if

more buyers so check it out it's a brainstorm of 200 possible AI ideas brought to you by HubSpot you can get it for free in the link below like we acquire a lot of companies like wo Commerce I think did a lot better because we acquired it um than they would have on their own um but there's probably other things that we try to buy that that we didn't buy that did really well on their own um uh Reddit was one actually we we looked at Reddit at one point did you look at them in their uh Kai Nest like yeah like $10 million valuation days I actually really wanted to buy Reddit I couldn't convince my board um they thought it was like too outside of our like kind of uh early stuff so we never got that far on the discussions or anything but yeah there was a point when there were like four employees and for sale and kind of in the wired offices on Third Street in San Francisco and um yeah I I I just thought it was really cool so obviously they they took very very well but when you created WordPress it seemed like it took off like within a year um I I forget which year uh you started it but like like I said earlier I think I was using it starting in like 10 or 11 2010 2011 like pretty early on and I at the time was like a Tennessee college kid so if I had heard about it then a lot of people had heard about it what was the first version of Wordpress like 2003 oh wow okay I wrote a blog post on this because basically like what people see as overnight success is often a thousand days of ir relevance or people haven't heard of you you know at one point there was a joke that WordPress had more developers than users the first few blogs were just ones I set up for my friends in high school you know because no one was using software so I just kind of like would manually set it up for people and um you know early we used to do these upgrade parties where just I'd say like you know a new version of Wordpress would come out I just open up my apartment you know go to Costco bought some booze order some pizza and said hey just come to my apartment and I'll upgrade your site for you so really you know the early days were very much bootstrapped and um yeah just doing the work you know just doing everything so it it looks like overnight sucess later uh we had some breakout points you know when moov will type changed our license and other things I think fortune favors to prepared it was because we had put in a lot of grind and a lot of work a lot of community building a lot of contributions a lot of code a lot of everything um in the you know many many days before that but what's crazy to me is uh like I remember like four or six years ago something I was looking at like it said that WordPress was used by something like 30 or 20% of all the websites on the internet then recently I went and looked at it now it's like 40% are you guys and like the thing that struck me I was like are you the most under monetized business on earth like how like how are you not like the big biggest company on Earth because I used WordPress and I used woocommerce which you also own at my old company my woo Commerce license Sean I think it was a $300 lifetime or $300 a year and the product that I was using it was making many millions of dollars and I've Got a Friend Sean you and I both have a friend who made a100 million off of the $300 a year license or whatever it was it was like nothing you guys have to be like the least monetized company there is I think the way I put it is WordPress is almost like kind of the dark matter of the web so you know when you build like a list of like what's the top website you know we're not going to show up NE I mean wordpress.com will be in the top 100 or whatever but like uh uh the beauty of it is that you know the ecosystem of Wordpress is probably like 10 billion doar a year at least you know um of Revenue now my company automatic is you know 5% of that uh but if you add up all the companies and all the people I'm not even counting like all the stuff that you talked about like people selling things on woocommerce which we know is like a I think last year was over 30 billion of goods and services sold through wo Commerce but actually more than half of automatics Revenue comes from things that aren't just WordPress um so we have a variety of different businesses U some really cool mobile apps like day one or pocketcast uh a new one called beeper what were like the top two Acquisitions right like even Buffett for example if you study Buffett's portfolio it's like a huge amount of the gains came from like a couple of like really key Acquisitions at Key time right CES candy at a specific time has given them over a billion dollars I think of free cash flow over the years and what's the what what's the revenue number that you could say the whole company does we've public to save we're we're over half a billion in Revenue now okay got it all right so yeah to answer CH question what brings it or what what's been the surprising thing what are like the Crown Jewel like best Acquisitions that you feel proud of our most successful is probably woocommerce and so this came a lot from you WordPress is a platform and so I did a lot of study of platforms and so that led me to do a lot of deep reading on Microsoft actually and it was funny like if you look at some of the press around Windows 95 coming out they talked about how for every dollar that Microsoft made from Windows there was $20 made by the word Windows ecosystem by the way that ratio is similar to what I talked about earlier where automatic makes about 5% of the money the word ecosystem um so I sort of found that platforms often do this they create a lot more value a true platform have you heard that story of Bill Gates talking about the uh when he meets Mark Zuckerberg he talks about the Facebook platform have you heard this there's like a quote I remember reading which was like Gates was like this is not a platform he was a platform is when the companies built on top of it generate far more value than the the the host platform whereas the Facebook platform at the time was like Facebook was this gargant thing all the small on top and Facebook was just sucking a lot of the value back in and he he kind of famously was like that's not what a platform is I would agree with that assessment and um and also that's not a platform which now a lot of businesses are built on and there were some that sort of came up in the early days like Zen or whatever but like um or Spotify even but it it's now not something that like every business is built on because you can get rug pulled right like a not true platform they might give you some distribution early on when you align with their interest but then they can easily pull the rug on you um which I think Facebook ended up doing to a number of companies so yeah I wanted to build a true platform um but of course Microsoft famously um had Microsoft Office so they had an application built on top of Windows which ended up being very lucrative so it was like what's going to be you know I have this platform WordPress which is now becoming like an operating system for the web we were obsessed about backwards compatibility and auto updates and things like that learning a lot from successful operating systems in the past what's our Microsoft Office and that ended up being woocommerce which was a we a small company like I think 40 people based out of South Africa a plugin for WordPress it actually started as a theme company it's called woo themes they developed this uh actually a fork of another open source e-commerce thing and they they started doing it just to sell more themes because themes were kind of the big business for WordPress at the time and this e-commerce plugin took off a bit actually we looked at buying it years prior uh but the you know candate the code was really crappy and so we were like oh this is like really crappy code we're we're you know Automax is very much like an engineering Le like technology R&D company so we're like a this is but it just kept taking off because they did such a good job like building something people want so even though the code wasn't scalable well organized you know they built something they they were really great to that product Market fit so woocommerce was taking off and um so we that was an early acquisition that we did funnily enough the com uh the competitor there was there were there's some private Equity that was trying to buy this plugin um so we kind of won over the private Equity because they wanted to join like our culture and everything like that and woo you know like I said at the time it was 40 people pretty small they only had like four Engineers by the way so a lot of those people were like customer support or other things um we were able to take what we were really great at which is like engineering scalability all that sort of stuff and um and apply it to what they had done really brilliantly which is like great this thing that people uh love to use and that's like I said I think last year did over 30 billion of goods and services sold so that's that's definitely one of our our best Acquisitions that we've done but I will say that e-commerce is is uh an incredibly competitive space and you know we're we're blessed to have an incredible competitor in Shopify which is a company I have a ton of respect for you know the the founders and entrepreneurs and the whole thing they they they're actually a really really great company so um you know Toby and I think have a lot of mutual respect for each other and uh you know Drive each other be better so do you look at that this is again like we're kind of giving you a compliment and an insult at the same time so the backhanded compliment is in full effect here so on one hand we're saying oh my God there's 43% of the internet uses WordPress or you know y'all's products there's 500 million websites using Wordpress like that is just such a mindboggling number and so on one hand that's in absolutely incredible and on the other and Sam was saying are you the most like under moneti given that are you the most under monetized because you look at like a Shopify Shopify alone right now market cap is 150 billion so one could say the ruthless capitalist could say Matt you're doing all this work your whole company including woocommerce and all this stuff is going to be worth several billion dollars but the closed Source Shopify like variant of of of the of the e-commerce side is worth 150 billion like what what what should I take away from that and what do you what do you take away from that what's what meaning do you put on that there's definitely some things that are easier in a proprietary sort of closed ecosystem software model um you know it's easier to you know Shopify is really great at forcing people to use their payments for example and in woocommerce you know you can use ours but you can also use a lot of other stuff um I think there sort of average revenue per subscribers is like 10x what who Converses is how I think about it is is very much sort of short-term versus longterm so one we have this philosophy of Open Source which is um you know I I want all the work I do all of my creative output to increase the amount of freedom and liberty in the world I is something I I believe very morally so that's why I've dedicated my life to open source um because open source software you know you sort of have a Bill of Rights attached to it right the freedom to use this software for any purpose to see how it works modify it to redistribute those modifications the Four Freedoms of the GPL and um to me that's that's a moral decision you know that is uh the software I create I want uh not to have a proprietary license you know shopy is amazing if Shopify change your policies tomorrow their customers are stuck with it you know they have no recourse or their proprietary license uh where with open source you know we could change our policies tomorrow I could become evil or whatever and automatic could be you know sell or be a terrible company you would still own all the code you know WordPress and W Commerce Etc belong just as much to you as they do to me and that sort of freedom and liberty is I think better in the long term so I say open source has a slow burn so it often is kind of slower to start up but then over time it builds sort of this compounding momentum that um is a bit Unstoppable and does two things one it could be very successful in a zone right as WordPress has you know it's 10x the number two in the market um but two one great thing it does is it forces the proprietary folks to be a bit more open so I I use proprietary stuff myself and a lot of Apple things are proprietary and I you know I really love their products I think apple is probably a bit more open than they would be otherwise because Android exist right there's there's an open competitor and which is by the way open source and um so that that it kind of influences the market so even if uh we don't have make as much money as Shopify or don't have the market share of Shopify in the e-commerce space yet although you know check in in 10 20 years let's see where we are uh that we force the proprietary folks to to be a bit more open with how they do things the the short answer there is basically I do it because that's what I believe I believe in open source I just believe that the moral decision comes first and secondly in the long run let's see uh in the long run uh we'll see is that is that a good good summary proprietary it's just as easy to have a failure of a proprietary company as it is an Open Source One like so I think you know being proprietary open source is a little bit of thogal uh or not causal to like uh whether you're a successful product or not and so uh people get really attached to it but um I would say in the short term it's definitely usually a bit easier to monetize uh a purely proprietary stack but over the long term you can create a much much bigger thing if you have this kind like flywheel of an open source a community adoption Etc Innovation you know a ton of innovation happens with Open Source by the way Sam isn't it nuts that so Matt is clearly like this thoughtful almost like Soulful entrepreneur who is who's been building this thing since he was literally like a kid 19 19 years old like a guy you'd call Wise when he was 21 yeah exactly like oh he's an old soul type of thing uh works on open- Source software like you said it's widely used it's like almost free it's so so cost so affordable it's so like only good all I hear is like only good and then you had this like random villain Arc that people tried to paint on you in the last you know year with this like drama that's going on I couldn't believe it I was like if I was going to put money on who's like the least drama attracting founder it might have been you um so I thought that was nuts Sam quick your reaction to that real quick and then I want to hear Matt's thoughts on it so I didn't follow it too much I'm a WordPress user but I just and I'm friends with Jason Cohen of WP engine you guys had a a fight but I was actually shocked Matt I thought that some of the stuff that you said I was shock you like in you you were people were insulting you and you felt like insulted them back and I didn't I was like I was like I've read a lot about Matt's work I don't know Matt and I've listened to him he doesn't seem like someone who would ever like insult someone and I was actually surprised that you were going as hard as you were and I guess your perspective is like they're coming after everything I made or they don't contribute whatever but I was actually surprised that you were you you were pissed off and I didn't think that you would be the type of guy that would come off pissed off you know a failure mode and I think that can kill many open source projects is when they get taken advantage of and so just like a schoolyard bully like you kind of have to stand up for yourself and um so it's kind of fun because you say you don't think of me of doing this but actually if you look at the history of Wordpress there has been maybe four or five times in the history where I had this kind of villain Arc people were like we had a fight to protect like our principles and and like the sustainability and like the future of Wordpress can you give the one minute summary of what happened because I even have followed it and I'm sure there's a bunch of people listening that that don't even know what we're talking about could you give like the one minute and try to be objective with this like like not not just the your side of the story but just what what happen happened can you explain you know it's an ongoing legal battle so I can only say so much but uh basically there's a a company called WP engine started off like very positive in the community Jason Cohen I think is Awesome by the way um but in 2019 they were bought by a private Equity Firm called Silver Lake and sort of in the subsequent five years uh started um becoming I would say more parasitic of WordPress also creating with uh how they were marketing themselves and branding themselves a lot of confusion in the marketplace um in a way that was threatening our trademark you the WordPress trademark so people would sort of say oh it's WordPress engine and they wouldn't correct them and they they would think it was official I even had very close friends who were WP engine customers who thought that was my company and I would frequently get support requests for w benine like my sight's down and things like that and um you know know for a long period of time and you know two years prior to this fight started um you know was doing our best to partner with them and resolve all these things and resolve the trademark stuff and um they just weren't responding and basically WP engine is a web hosting service mostly or maybe only for WordPress sites and uh the accusation I believe was that you felt they weren't contributing to the project as much as they should have been given that they make like a lot of money and also there was a trademark uh people confused the two companies on the contribution thing is that like is like I guess like what's your leg to stand on on that you know for example you know like does somebody have to contribute is that like a rule or is that suggestion right is this like uh you're at church you should put something in the tray but you don't have to technically but you're it's frowned upon like what what is the take there so in WordPress we do have this program we call five for the future um by the way this is all voluntary open source license you don't have to do anything do whatever you want um but we say that if you're building a business on WordPress um if you can allocate you know somewhere between Z one and 5% profit or Revenue it doesn't matter however you want to Define it could be time could be hours could be whatever but and put that back into what we call Core um core WordPress which is something that uh belongs in the open source project so it's accessible to everyone doesn't just benefit your company um that's part of what's made us so sustainable and allowed us to be a open source project which has really thrived more than you know some of you know other great cses that were open source that came up at the same time like jumla or Drupal or something like that which haven't has as much assesses Us by the way I think this is great self-interest as well and um WP is fairly unique in that pretty much every other company in the WordPress ecosystem does this quite a bit and in fact if you look at old versions of w engine's website they were you know very supportive of this and actually even say on their website they would dedicate you know two or four full-time people and everything like that you know fast forward to 2024 um they were had less than that on core so I think that's that's a whole like U sustainability uh health of the ecosystem health of the product issue um it's not a legal issue at all the trademark abuse of not just a word press also the woocommerce trademark so you could argue that WordPress WP whatever but like they're also using the woocommerce trademark which is fully owned by automatic um you have to protect that if you don't protect your trademarks you lose them and so um we're having discussions around that we have trademark licenses with other web hosts great relations with every other and they they are just a web host they're not a tech company they don't really create a lot of Ip um and they a web host which uh people think is the largest but actually you know probably the sixth or seventh largest WordPress web post there's a lot of bigger ones and uh they're a single- digit percentage of all the word presses in the world you they probably have like 700,000 800,000 or something so people have made this into a bigger de it is I you know some of these previous controversies that got mainstream media coverage I was you know CNN I had this hot nacho scandal in the first couple years of Wordpress or the thesis fight or the Easter Massacre of themes like all these things I'm mentioning you probably haven't heard of it used to be like half my Wikipedia page now it's not today if you go to my Wikipedia page you their PR firm has a whole paragraph about this I think in 5 years maybe it'll be a sentence or not even on there at all so it's not my first rodeo sometimes you have to fight to protect your open source ideals and the community and and your trademark by the way um but uh you know I expect this to resolve in the next few months and um and yeah they're the sort of although it's easy to find like if you go on redit or Twitter um I get a lot of hate a lot of people were pissed at you I I tweeted out that you were coming on to uh to the Pod yesterday and there was a lot of angry people and I was I was a little surprised by that to be honest yeah and you know some of the people are uncomfortable with you know us having to to fight protect ourselves um you know WP engine uh took some a very aggressive legal action so it turned out when we thought we were sort of good face negotiating they were preparing a legal case to attack us because you know 3 days after I give this presentation they launched this huge lawsuit with Quinn Emanuel it's kind of like the one of the biggest nastiest law firms and you know private Equity is so famously like goes in Hollows out businesses extracts all the value kind of kills it there's this crazy story I don't know if you saw it recently where like one of the reason there was like shortages of fire trucks in La was like the firetruck manufacturers have been like rolled up by private equity and they've been like jacking the prices and that was like huge waiting list for like fire new fire trucks and fire truck repairs and um you know there's lots of examples and not all private Equity is bad there's good investors and bad investors in every asset class look I I didn't follow the story in depth I didn't need to I'm not a lawyer don't need to be it's common sense to me uh who whose side am I going to be on the the private Equity backed company that that you know sounds almost like it's made by the by you guys but it's not or the founder who's been working on this for like you know 20 plus years of his life open sourced it is you know used by everybody it's kind of like a staple of the internet and you know captures like a tiny bit of the value along the way um it was it's pretty obvious to me uh you know which side I was going to going to come down on so I think it was it was actually a common sense test I think for most people and I can't believe how many people are like you know on the PE side it actually reminds me a little bit of like the AI stuff right now wait Sean we did a whole podcast about the founder of this PE firm though and how like uh Fascinate fascinated we were with them we do profiles on ruthless killers and then we're at the end we're like isn't that awesome like yeah do you want to be that way hell no like that's not me but like I'm glad that these people exist like you need all these people in an ecosystem like it's not they're not all bad and there's impressive things about how I think his name what Egan deran or whatever like I think that's the guy that we talked about you know it's impressive in the same way that David Goggins is impressive but I'm not going to go out there and run until my toenails bleed like I like that he exists that doesn't mean I want to be like him or even that I think that's the right thing for most people to do I think it was on uh uh on your blog it could have been on the Tim Ferris podcast you wrote about how um I think WordPress or automatic has like roughly 2,000 people uh and I think you wrote about how you tried a bunch of different ways to hire people you like did all these tests like Google does like these like brain teasers and you tried a bunch of other stuff and you said two interesting things that stood out you said um uh what I found is that uh the people who are the best writers oftentimes are the best people who we hire uh not phds not master degrees it was a correlation between your ability to write and commun communicate via the written word and then the second thing you said that was pretty wild you said uh you now or you used to hire people just by like emailing or texting like it was like just through chat not ever face to face not phone calls things like that do you still hire people strictly through text communication you for some roles we might do a zoom if it's a sales Ro or something like that you know obviously it's important to see how someone uh interacts um but basically you know for a lot of our roles you know written communication is going to be the primary thing uh but also like people want to talk to someone like we're not going to be like no you can't but uh yeah a lot of uh our hiring process can be completely asynchronous and completely text based and for the first thousand or so hires I did a final chat for every single person is your chat like slacking or g- chatting or something yeah it ended up being on slack when when slack was invented you know before that I think it was on like Skype or aim or something you know in the early days or or IRC I think the way you said it was uh we do auditions not interviews so what what does that mean how do you how do you do auditions well we do a trial project so we actually hire people on a standard sort of 25 an hour contract and so we pay them uh to do and we have screens with you know resumes and a little interview and stuff but then we say like let's do some work together and um and there's various versions of this for different roles we've done sandbox versions we've also done it where they were actually talking to real customers you know like a support person was actually like answering real tickets we've always been smaller than a lot of the big Tech but we compete with them and so we need to have like the same caliber or better of talent so um part of I think automatics Advantage is we've created an environment and also sort of a way of hiring that finds people who who might be overlooked by sort of a a meta or Google or something like that um and we give them an opportunity not just to be hired but also to participate in a company in a way that they can still be just as influential and have as much impact because even like you know there's there's other companies that might have remote workers but if you're not at headquarters you're not going to be you know close to the Sun you're not going to be next to the CEO you're not going to be able to grow or or have an impact but we've tried to create it where our center of gravity our headquarters is really on the internet and you know I have colleagues in 90 countries 90 even though we're only you know 750 people so um and another sort of innovative thing we do we didn't do this in the beginning but we moved to it probably like 2012 2013 is uh we pay people the same salaries regardless of location so it's kind of funny because with all like the equality de stuff whatever so much of I feel like is virtue signaling because if you ask these companies and say like hey you know I'm not going to call anyone out by name let's say big tech company do you pay someone in Pakistan the same that you pay them in California usually the answer is no if they're doing the same job you the same like code Wrangler engineer whatever like that and uh they usually say no and they usually have some reason like cost of living or local markets or whatever but we sort of moved to where we said he same work same pay you know it's kind of a something that you know the past hundred years that wasn't always true for men and women even you know or or racial things or something like that so I think the same moral reasons why you say like same work for same pay of you know people of different skin colors or something like that uh within a country I think you should do that globally and I think that's the future of work actually because um to extent that you can be equally as valuable and generate as much value for a customer wherever you are um you should receive the equal pay for equal work have you guys read um American Kingpin the story of Ross alright the Silk Road uh have you read that Matt uh I think I've read some of the long form wild articles but I've never read the whole book yeah oh you got to read this book man I'm rereading it now because he just got released and it's like the best book I've ever read it's like total page Turner the story of it for the listeners basically Ross Albright was accused and I think he did it where he started Silk Road which was eBay for drugs and two years it did like two billion in sales gross sales something like that but what's crazy is like it kind of sucks because this whole business was documented be because he chatted with everyone like he had 12 co-workers and he did two things that were interesting that I actually think are going to be common the first thing is that he obviously because it was an illegal Enterprise he never they didn't they didn't know the identity of the workers it was just like their username like one guy's name was like chronic pain that was his username so he just he didn't know this guy's real name he just knew chronic pain as like the guy Ross knew everybody's name they didn't know each other's names or his he he made them send a license so that he could basically have that like you know uh always have that in his back pocket Le have leverage but chronic pain didn't know Ross's uh yeah sorry I forgot that was actually important detail that's actually very similar to like early hacker culture you know everyone was sort of known by their username there's like interesting merits to that and then the other thing was that they only communicated via messaging and I was reading this book I'm rereading it now and I was like those two attributes are kind of interesting for a company which is like uh like Anonymous workers and but you're still oddly friends like he be he developed Rel relationships with his co-workers this is a great LinkedIn post for you Sam like 13 management lessons I learned from the Silk Road here you go I believe that he did murder For Hire four times he did a lot of bad [ __ ] but he was actually an inspiring leader like when you read like some of his like like stuff well he was very idealistic right like he he had certain beliefs that drove him right he he didn't intend like he didn't necessarily um intend like for example he wasn't super interested in selling guns on the platform but he believed that people should be to sell what they want and therefore and it and and his team was like no no you shouldn't do this this is going to increase the Target on our back like you're cool with the drug side but you don't care about this so let's just ban it it's going to cause problems and he was like well no that's not the ethos of what we're doing like we wrote a Creed of what we stand for and why we're doing this and therefore we got to stand by it and they called him Captain you know it was very much just like uh like uh we are revolutionizing thing and that's like an really interesting thing Matt has a you you don't get called Captain but what is your like a benevolent dictator for life right uh B bdfl it's a term in open source that's applied to like less lenx or Guido at python or something like that David hmer Hansen at rails um but it's it's sort of a joking thing and one that I think none of us like really attach ourselves to U just kind of like an internet lower thing well you do a couple other interesting things right because you got this like multi-billion dollar company used by most of the internet but you run your company these interesting ways where remote work I think it's you're famously we're early and heavy into remote work and and you've talked a lot about that but you do a couple other interesting things so we talked about auditions instead of interviews but you also do um Everybody in the company including yourself Works customer support I think one or two weeks out of the Year could you talk about that one yeah part of our hiring process is your first two weeks are doing customer support for every single hire whether you're like our new CFO or chief legal officer or um or whatever role it is um so and then once a week a year you rotate back into doing customer support um gosh uh by the way lots of companies have versions of this um so it's definitely not you know we're the first to do this or anything like that why should a company do that if you look at every successful business um the closer they are to customers generally the more successful they are and so it's very easy especially when you're running something on the Internet and distributed for you know people to become numbers or stats or something on your looker dashboard or something like that and so you know getting back to like every individual you know every every number of your signups you might have like 5,000 signups in a day but each one of those people is like has a story you just learned a lot about your product and it's um I think the best way to sort of do iterative customer developments um I think Eric ree talked about this or Steve blank you know they kind of like get out of the office and go meet the customers and I'm very inspired by like leaders at Salesforce talk to Marb off or something like that they'll typically spend a quarter to a third of their time with customers even at that scale is there a story or any Epiphany you had from doing this you've probably done this now you know for for decades so is there like an Insight that came from this just other day a few days ago I spent like uh 30 45 minutes with uh the gentleman who kind of checks expenses at the company you know CU we have like these ramp cards and people expense things and stuff like that you know sometimes we like say you need a receipt for this or we you question at Spence and I just want to understand more about this and also make sure that the way we were doing this was the most hated man at the company by the way like well I had gotten some feedback from folks they felt um you know some of the questions they were getting felt a little aggressive and so you know we we want to talk about um one I just kind of want to see like the tools he used and how the work did and stuff like that so some of that was just shadowing so I was like okay because I want to understand the interfaces um this was also really helpful like going through support I realize that some of our internal tools like don't represent know best practices in design or usability some you know sometimes you know some of the internal stuff doesn't get the love that your external stuff does um but then also you know we just sort of talked about like the culture of automatic you know bedside manner if you will like how how can we like you know hold these principles like we need to uh really enforce our policies and make sure we do you know we get audited and everything so like uh we we need to have these things from like a good accounting principles point of view um but also doing it a way that like when we have these conversations we're talking about the principles of it you know the reason why so it's not just like I'm giving you Sean a hard time because you didn't have a receipt but like hey if we don't have this receipt you know our our you know interal art firm might question this and then you know that might create an issue for XYZ or something like that when I first moved to Silicon Valley I I came to work with this guy Michael Burch and he was he represented everything I wanted he had already built like successful tech companies and he had made it and I was a 23-year-old kid who wanted to make it and so I'm super excited to go into work the first day and I'm like I'm going to learn so much from this guy because he not just done it one time he's built like four successful companies and so I I'm ready for him to teach me kind of like the dark arts I'm like What's the strategies the grow hacks what this like super like highlevel strategic thinking and the very first week he puts me on um not the new [ __ ] like the oldest company that he had started something had started back in 2001 was like birthday calendar or something or yeah birthday alarm is that still going birthday alarm still going and so I as like 25-year-old company now so I at the time I was like oh man like I got to do this like whatever and he tells me the story so I actually learned this really valuable lesson in it I go so what's the I got curious because instead of just like being bored at doing like birthday alarm which you know seemed like this old outdated product at the time got a little curious so I started asking him like where did this come from like how did you even come up with this idea why did you build this product and what he told me was he goes my very first startup I had quit my job I wanted to like build a successful tech company like do an internet company internet was like the new thing back in 99 200000 and he quit a high-paying insurance job while his wife was pregnant and was like I'm going to make it so he tried to create something really fancy so he's like oh with the internet he tried to create something that many people have tried like Shawn Parker tried to create this a self-updating address book which is like you know I have your information I have your name your address but you moved Matt now I don't know that you moved so wouldn't it be cool if you could just update your info in one place and it updated in all your friends address books so we now have your latest and greatest address so that's what he wanted to build and he's spending like nine months heads down like doesn't leave the bedroom coding this thing and it's not really going anywhere but because he was a oneman show he was also doing you know he was the designer he was the developer he was the Ops guy he was the customer service guy like he did all of it and he was like it's the customer service that was actually the key because he was answering support tickets and he's like over and over again he's like I spent like you know 7even hours a day banging my head against the wall trying to figure out why nobody wants to use our product I think it's so cool but nobody wants it and then in the hour I was doing customer support he's like I noticed that a bunch of people kept thanking me for the birthday reminder feature I had built in like just the one feature which was like a throwaway idea which was just if if you know forget the address if it was someone's birthday I would just tell you you know hey it's their birthday today remember that this is before Facebook existed right so you didn't have Facebook or a bunch of other ways that people could do this so he just threw away the whole product and renamed the company birthdayalarm.com and he's like I expected to go nowhere and that was the thing that took off and you know at that time birthday alarm had generated for him and his wife personally like probably $20 million of pure profit by that time because it was just every year was just generating a few million dollars of profit and it's still to this day generating a few million dollars a year of profit like it's this incredible business that's just a gift that keeps on giving that only came because he was answering the support tickets and he got curious like huh like why are they keep talking about this birthday reminder thing is that is that actually maybe I should do that and he did it on a on a whim and then in two days had built the product that actually people wanted you know that's awesome I have one last question for you and it's on AI so uh there's a lot of stuff you could talk about with a ey but I just am curious uh on your quick take about deep seek um because it's also you know they came out with this open source thing that there's a lot of people on either side of of you know how much they believe about the story but like what's your quick reaction to what you saw with deep seek deep seek is a really cool model so you know every model has like kind of a Vibe and the way it's tuned and everything like that and and so it's a really fun one to play with and I would say you know the thing I I tell people um with all this a stuff just like use it play with it you know because it's such early days and there's kind of a you know the way to prompt it the way to interact with it there's there's a uh a skill there um that you'll learn and The Vibes of of the deeps model are very cool um I think what's I'm most excited about as an open source guy is that they actually open source the model wrote really amazing papers about how they built it and it open weights so um like for example at my company I would say don't use like deep seek.com you know for various reasons uh that's hosted in China and stuff like that but like we can run the model ourselves you know locally and that's pretty cool or you can get it through perplexity which hosted in the US so like there's there's lots of ways to access it and um it's a it's a really fun model so all these models have are like good at different things they have a coding version they just released a cool image thing and so um like think of these as like little entities that you can interact with and run and spin up and boots and uh you should just learn the nuances and kind of flavors of each one Matt do you guys actually believe that they've only taken the amount of funding that they've said didn't they say something like five or10 million they said that's what it cost to run the final training that might be true for like some something but obviously like I'm sure they spent invested a ton in in in other things so and I know there's kind of this theory that maybe that's like a a PR scop or whatever like that when I started reading about them I got fearful it was pretty insane right that the market reacted the way it did that you know it wiped out uh a trillion dollars uh of of value in 24 hours it was pretty wild how big that announcement was I didn't think I didn't think that was going to happen and I think you called it Matt didn't you like tweet about this during Christmas time well Andre Kathy you know so full credit like tweeted about this like the day after Christmas and I I saw his tweet and retweeted it uh so that's when I first learned about deep seek and started playing with it but um yeah I think that with all these things um there there's some you can verify all the things they they made some amazing advancements and like how they train things and how they run things and how they did memory interconnects and working within constraints there are some really cool during breakthroughs and they shared it and this is stuff that I think open AI had also figured out but they hadn't like shared it publicly and so what I love about the deepsea guys is they uh they're open sourcing it all so uh and it's all available under like a true open source license it's not like the Llama license where it's free and you have 700 million users or something or or I think Quinn Alibaba one which is also a really great model that people are sleeping on so check out Quinn and some of these other models coming out of China they're really really good but it's it's a true open source license so that's awesome Matt thanks for coming on mant it's good to see you again and uh thanks for thanks for sharing everything you did about about WordPress it's been a pleasure yeah we appreciate you man all right that's the pod

all right Sam we just had an insane weekend together we got to talk about [Music] it we just lived in a house for a weekend with 25 other founder entrepreneur types probably five to 10 of them were billionaires a bunch of others were close and we didn't just like talk or hang out we literally like slept under one roof uh sat in saas together played basketball together went to Walmart together a bunch of times my Airbnb had bug beds so we we bunked we bunk bed together it's as close as two men can get so so we had an experience and I have in front of me several sticky notes of golden Lessons Learned and I phrased each of them I don't know if you do this but I phrased D to them to make it fun because nobody wants to hear your vacation story that's one of the great rules of story Stelling is just never tell a vacation story cuz it's so fun for you but they weren't there nobody cares but I think we should tell the the biggest Lessons Learned with the story that backs them up so it's real not just a generic lesson and I phrased all of mine like it's confucious like you know Bruce Lee whispered this into your ear yeah I dig that and to give the background basically I think like three years ago you tweeted out I want to play basketball with interesting people I think Mr Beast like dm'd you and you're like wait is this real you ended up phoning him and he was like yeah come to my place I want to meet interesting people the first year it was like you and Ben organized it it was like 19 of us in an Airbnb and we were like what are we going to do so we played basketball the second year you organized it a little bit more and you had like an itinerary this year you guys killed it it was awesome it it was an amazing event I I do like meeting interesting people when I go to conferences or events I just hate conferences or events like I get a pit in my stomach when I have to go and I know it's good for me and I know in the end I'll meet some cool people I just hate the format I hate the structure so I was like well what's a you know instead of just complaining about it what's a structure I would like it's like well I don't know what if it was just doing the thing I love was playing basketball with those people we basically play ball all day and then we talk at night and that was the the core idea is to use basketball as the Icebreaker and you broke your knee in the first two hours yeah yeah so this was an event where uh you could tear you could tear up your knee and be done in the first hour and I still had a good time that means it must have been a good event cuz normally that's pretty brutal I I did have a little pity party for myself but I feel better now are we allowed to say who is there yeah I think we could say some of the people that were there yeah let's go for it so Mr Beast who uh like you know everyone knows him as the guy on YouTube with hundreds of million sub subscribers I think he's a paper billionaire I think that's public yeah he's one of the youngest billionaires in the world I think he's 26 years old and he's worth a few billion dollars he's one of the most famous people also in the world one of the most most recognized entertainers in the world and when you hang out with him he's also one of the like most intense yeah fun to be around you know just wants to play Allin like somebody said this once about Elon they go he's playing he's playing life as if the as if the simulation theory is true you know Elon has a simulation Theory not just be one of many simulations and so he therefore just goes all in because okay whatever let let's make this the most entertaining version of that simulation I think that's how Jimmy plays plays life too so we are with him was uh the one of the founders of Airbnb who like on paper like according to Forbes is like the H 100th or 90th richest person in the world it was uh another billionaire who was one of the First Investors in Tesla and SpaceX it was uh the founder of Reddit it was Jesse ller who's on the podcast you me Al Don who runs like a quilting company that does nine figures a year tons of people David Pell Nick Huber it was awesome all right all right so a lot of people watch and listen to the show because they want to hear us just tell them exactly what to do when it comes to starting or growing a business and really a lot of people who are listening they have a full-time job and they want to start something on the side a side hustle now a lot of people message Sean and I and they say all right I want to start something on the side is this a good idea is that a good idea and again what they're really just saying is just give me the ideas well my friends you're in luck so my old company the hustle they put together a hundred different side hustle ideas and they have appropriately called it the side hustle idea database it's a list of 100 pretty good ideas frankly I went through them they're awesome and it gives you how to start them how to grow them things like that gives you a little bit of inspiration so check it out it's called the side hustle idea database it's in the description below you'll see the link click it check it out let me know in the comments what you think you want to start first yeah let's do it all right I got one for you here's one of the lessons I I picked up and this is about the business ideas that these guys were thinking about so if you're out there and you're wondering kind of like where's the opportunity what should I be working on here's what I picked up from some of the most successful people in America and it says fish were the fish swim not where the fishermen stand confucious aka me did you just make that up you saw me rting these five minutes before we we I thought you had heard that did you hear that somewhere else there's a scratch out on it right but did you get like Chinese food last week and that was like a fortune cookie dude I've had my share of kung F chicken all let me just tell you some of the ideas that I heard from people who were in um at this event so you me you mentioned Jesse ller and I think one of the public things that he's done is he got really into racing like running running endurance races so he just followed his curiosity 100 mile races 100 mile races he started doing 100 mile races while he's doing 100 mile races he notices that the runners that are trying to do these amazing physical Feats are drinking coconut water and coconut water was a big like a big part of that Niche super Niche community and he became a Believer and spent time hunting down down what he thought would be the best coconut water company ends up finding ziko coconut water partners with them and ziko now is a a big success they ended up selling I think to Coke and you know they're they're in Whole Food they're they're you know it's one of the big coconut water brands and he found it when he was small and just like just exploring these Uncharted territories so here's some other ones that I heard there was somebody there who's making hundreds of millions of dollars a year selling board games I never even had that on my bingo card I didn't even know that was an option I not even know that you could do that there was somebody there that was investing millions of dollars into women's sports like you know uh and not even just women's sports like they're trying to do things now where you just buy a piece of a college program I don't even know you could do that like that's for sale what the what is what is that for sale where is this listed I uh I went to a talk recently with this billionaire who owned like the Timberwolves Mark glassri or something and he was talking about the Bucks and he was talking about how he's trying Buy College do you buy the rights they're going to like the University of Alabama or whatever and they're just like cool we'll give you $500 million for the Alabama sports program and we want to own 51% trying to do do they buy the future earnings is that what it is they're basically I think what's going to happen is again it's Uncharted Territory you don't know exactly how this going to play out but this I think the short version is the college will spin out the program their their Athletics program as its own business entity they'll sell equity in it they'll use that Equity to finance all of their sports like women's lacrosse like things that aren't going to be the big Revenue generators so they use it to to fund all their programs and maybe even school stuff and then those and then and the costs now are are borne by the the private Equity person but now it's this asset that didn't even exist before like these college programs can make a lot of money media rights and all the stuff but they weren't even for sale but somebody was doing that there was some somebody there that was like yeah 7 years ago I just got really obsessed with water like yeah me too I thought my whole life he's like no no no like I got really obsessed like do you know what kind of water you're drinking and I was like uh no like is this bad microplastics what's going on and he was just like yeah like I got obsessed and so I just started studying where's the cleanest water from where's the healthiest water from and I realized that water was going to become like oil that people were going to more and more be drinking not tap water but they wanted they're going to want basically bottled water canned water things like that and that water's going to have to come from somewhere and I wanted to find the best sources of water and so I went to West Virginia and I bought this aquafer this this spring I brought this giant water source what and he was like you see that drink you're drinking right there it's like some brand like popular brand and he's like that's our water in they use our water so that's good water and I was like what this was just a side quest that he went on and again it was curiosity driven was this one of the billionaires yeah basic I mean not not billionaire but yeah like whatever close close enough there's a guy there Al who started a quilting company with his mom a Missouri Star Quilt Company and they sell fabrics for people who want to make quilts his co-founder is his mom I have a planned vacation to so he owns this thing the the company it's called Missouri quilting company and he basically bought he did a podcast three years ago with us where he explained where he bought a is it H Hamilton missoury he bought like an 1800 person town where they own every building and they're building the Disneyland for quilting dude just the thought of that so first to go into quilting smart guy like you know could could have done any business goes into quilting like what are you doing man you're throwing it all the way on quilting yeah does a business with his mom right like again independent thinking not just following the herd so then starts the business her his mom does the YouTube channel he does the business side of it business keeps growing and then it's like you know what we could do we could create the Disneyland for quilting and he literally goes and buys a town again who's is that for sale can you do that how do you do that and that that just kept happening which was like people who were playing games that didn't even seem uh popular another lesson there there was a person there who had sold a piece of their company to chernin and churnin is now kind of known I first heard about it maybe like 10 years ago and churnin is this really interesting they're most famous for uhg yeah they they're you know the Peter Turnin was the CEO of Fox so he's like a big swinging dick he's been a baller for years but they're most famous amongst like normal people because they bought bar stool when it was nothing and helped make it something correct and they just had this again independ in thinking where they were like hey I think these things that other people see as small kind of toys things that aren't going to make a lot of money you know media Brands blogs YouTube channels I think these things are going to be big I think basically and they had this thesis which was uh content to Commerce it's like I think if you're kicking ass at content you're going to be able to instead of just making your money through ad revenue and sponsorships you're going to be able to sell stuff to those people and they had this content to Commerce thesis and they go and they buy bar stool content and ends up being juggernaut with Commerce they buy um uh they bought exploding kittens and they bought uh meat eater and they bought surf line all these Niche content rants we had a guy on the Pod the plant Daddy I met with them uh a couple times there was like early discussions well you know three meetings with the that I had with that the hustle and I was like what the [ __ ] do you guys know didn't get that one right turns out they know a lot they they know a lot did he just like slide a p&l across the table and he's like I'll leave you 3 Minutes Alone like they told me this story and I was like you're full of [ __ ] you don't know what you're talking about like do you you you're talking about my company right it's like you know like like but they were right I think what the the premise was correct uh but I yeah I I I didn't have that confidence that we're talking about now and dude they're made a fortune because the market overlooked these Brands these Brands were not valued like highflying tech companies but they became you know multi- hundred million billion dollar Brands I really admire what TCG did because they're the best there's so many investors that all love to sound like they're smart and contrarian and they're all just what's your thesis AI the you know AI is going to be the future of everything right it's like okay you're not wrong in that but like there's something really impressive about somebody who looked at just like this magazine or this blog or thisor who was on our pod we've had a bunch we've actually probably had three or four people who sold their companies on the Pod to to those guys right right and and they've been right and they've been right in a very very big way um so I'm very impressed by them so to me that that's the principle fish where the fish swim so fish where the real opportunity is not where the fishermen are standing not where everybody all the entrepreneurs are are huddled up this this forche cookie says man does not sell chocolate he must become chocolate okay so what is this mean three years ago when we did the first version of this event Jimmy aka Mr Beast had launched his chocolate brand febles and it was like okay selling chocolate to little kids I had the opportunity to invest I think at a $40 million valuation was like the the series a and I passed in uh in like the Beast Empire or chocolate in Feasta itself so um kind of thought about it I was like I don't really get I didn't really know much about the chocolate industry I thought his involvement was going to be like this normal influencer brand is I'm doing my thing I create my cont oh my manager hands me this hey uh buy this smile ding yeah put it down move on with life so I thought he's just going to influence it I thought he was just going to hold it up and buy it I didn't what I didn't realize is that this guy was going to go so deep into the world of chocolate and end up knowing everything about chocolate and end up running this company like an absolute Maniac founder if I had known that if I had known he was going to bring his int his full intensity at this I probably would have thought about it differently I thought he was just going to hold up the chocolate bar and see how many people click the link um I was dead wrong so I want to tell a quick story you were there for for one of the Walmart runs right no but I have a bunch of Walmart stories so we're sitting there we're about to record he walks in he's like hey before we do this you guys want to go to Walmart which I realized like at the time sounded like a sort of a strange request nobody's ever asked me on a on a mandate to Walmart we walk in and um he takes us to the chocolate aisle and basically gives a like 10-minute master class on the chocolate industry right there in the aisle and while he's doing it he's not just like explaining like well this is how it works this is how we do this is our revenues this whatever he's also simultaneously restocking the entire aisle like he pulled the cartons up to the front cuz they were like 3 Ines recessed they were pushed back too far some of the bars had fallen over they were crooked he straightens every single one of them out he puts the right flavors in the right spots if a bar was crinkly or broken he's like he throw it to his chief of staff like hey can you buy this I want to have like we should only have good bars no broken bars up front and he would basically restock the thing but his hands were moving at a speed which showed you this is not the first time this guy's done this so he he restocks it one of the popular flavors was out and so he takes out his phone and he's like oh I have a badge and so he just badges into the back of Walmart and goes and gets the Box himself and restocks it and I was like does any vendor get to do that he's like no not not exactly but they know like I like I just do this I care I really care and it kind of two things stood out to me the first was obvious which was when high-intensity obsessive people want to win they do the same things that the rest of us do with the knob dialed up to 12 like they just they just take the knob and they just crank it past even where you think it can go and and for example he was like I think you were there he was telling the story about like missing a flight or something like this he like told a story about how apparently he flew to DC and had a connecting flight to North Carolina or something wherever he lived and he was like you know what screw it I'm driving from DC to Greenville North Carolina it's normally like I don't know a 3-hour drive or something but I noticed that there's 14 Walmarts in between on that route I'm going to stop at every single one of them to learn and it turned like a 3-hour drive into like you know a 20-hour drive and he told me at one point he goes I have scanned I guess he's got some app where you scan things in Walmart and it teaches you about each skew he said he scanned every single product in Walmart and I don't know if he was like if someone said oh no I've scanned all of them you'd be like oh so it's like saying it's a th000 degrees outside you're just exaggerating but with him I was like oh I bet you you literally have scanned every single one of them in the podcast we did he was like yeah yeah like you know we want to do a thing where you buy every item in Walmart for somebody in a video and he's like you know but it's $16.2 million it's like he knew the actual cost of the total total inventory if you bought one of everything in Walmart like what it cost I forgot what the number was but so but I don't want to make this just a Jimmy Love Fest because there was another guy who was a top seller in Target yeah man I heard him nerding out it was wild he took us to the shelf and he was like this shelf right here he's G us a tour of Target and it shows you how the store Works he's like this shelf right here here is the high most profitable shelf in Target is the highest profit per square inch which is how Target measures you know success and he's giving us this Target Master Class and we were like are you also in Walmart he's like yeah we're in Walmart but we're not doing so well and uh I asked him what's exciting for you coming up and this guy runs a billion dollar plus company I assumed he was just going to say I've got some board meetings to line up I'm going I'm taking the family to to Aspen and he goes actually I'm working the next three weeks um as a Walmart associate I was like what and he goes yeah I'm going to be uh he our sales in Walmart are not the same as in Target and I've been trying to figure out why what I found remarkable is that you expect the people who are the most busy the most accomplished the most high net worth to be above these tasks Jimmy restocking the SKS himself this other guy going to be a Walmart associate for three weeks you know they don't have to do any of this but they're going to do it anyways they're not just doing it now now that they're success that's how they got here and so that was the first first really big takeaway from this whole thing was the intensity with which certain people play the game of business and how that leads to success that guy who you're referring to was the quietest person there or one of and there was a point where I was hanging out with them he goes can I get your guys' opinion you know I thinking I'm thinking about potentially like making some type of business move which would value us at this valuation and we were like what valuation and it was like in the billions and we were like do do you know who we are why are you asking us this question like what like what are you what are you talking about man like you I don't know who you asked this question to but not like he was the most uh like humble person there and he was crazy successful it was pretty wild uh that that guy who you're talking about all right I have one confidence beats IQ so you know there are a lot of like really successful people out there like when I read Warren Buffett's biography he he does the opposite where he was like oh you know I'm just this guy it's like dude you're you're a b a a Shucks downplaying them you're a Baby Genius like he was like when he was like four he was like making 10 grand a month selling Pepsi um but in general the group of people who we had there there were some people for sure who are genius uh I think Jimmy's one of them actually I think when you talk to him you know he's like uh brilliant but and like Mario from Oscar was one of them Mario uh co-found founded a company called Oscar which is a health insurance company which is one of the hardest things ever to do it's worth publicly traded $4 billion so he's like the man and he doesn't even speak English or or he does that's a second language so like you know he's from Germany so imagine genius dude imagine going to Germany and revolutionizing the German Healthcare bar you know what I mean like it's it's pretty wild extra degree of difficulty just go to someone else's motherland and fix their [ __ ] yeah which is wild but you know he was a genius but in general dude the wealthiest people there I know we're not even close to the smartest and here's an example one of the billionaire guys was there he goes man AI is just going to change the world you guys I don't think you guys get it like I use it every day and I was like how do you how do you use it he goes I can show you right now and he pulls out his phone and he talks to chat gbt and he goes hey chat gbt you know I have a question and he like starts like reading a question to it and then he's like now watch how amazing it is and he like it repeats the answer and I'm like oh so you're saying that you just use chat gbt like all the time like yeah and I was like well like have you like trained it he goes train you can trade it like like he didn't know that you could do these things and this particular guy r a company doing billions a year in Revenue I guess what I mean is like this the the the percentage of intelligence greater than me or you or someone else there versus impact or net worth was not like that it it wasn't totally totally totally agree with that which is that when you sit in a room like this two things happen one you just get to sample like it's Costco and it's no at Costco and you're just getting to sample different LIF oh what do you do oh wow you seem kind of stressed out gotcha like not interested in going down that aisle yeah hey you seem like you're having a lot of fun what do you do how do you think about this uh you got kids too how are you doing both right and you get to sample people's lifestyle when you hang out with them like this for like you know 48 hours straight um on top of that you also get to do the measuring stick thing which kind of sucks cuz you're measuring yourself again like some of the most creative successful ambitious people in the world but a big part of it is you're trying to figure out the diff right it's like those those little children's games these two pictures what's the difference between these two pictures and on one side is me and the other side is them and I'm always looking at what's the difference and sometimes if it's like a Mario or whatever it's like oh cool like his brain has an extra library in it there's an extra Wing that somebody donated to that brain all right cool like I can I can live with that I can sleep easy but there were other people where it was like oh it just seems like they didn't limit themselves that's what I mean they just kind of went for it or they have their courage was just a little bit higher Supply than mine and you're right that when you look at the diff very very rarely was the diff these people are smarter than me or they had some advantages I didn't have coming up right like in fact it was usually the opposite it's like damn they had this huge chip on their shoulder CU their dad wasn't around and because of this happened and they were dyslexic there's a bunch of people that were there that were dyslexic I wish I was dyslexic autic was the goal is dude dyslexic dude every dyslexic guy there somehow was a good freestyle rapper did you not that like not only rich but also cool in a group of of men huddled around together right like yeah I wish I was charismatic like a dyslexic guy like that's crazy it's like if you're if you're it's like if you're blind you're a good like piano player and if you're dyslexic you're like the most charismatic guy on Earth yeah exactly I have a related point which is I just wrote These two words I don't know if you can read this I am I am so my trainer has a like a clothing brand that he created it's called superconscious C so one of the shirts he gave me that from superconscious Cod my favorite shirt it just on the side it just says I am and then it's after and underneath it says the two most important words in the English language for whatever comes after them will Define your life if you think you are destined for greatness if you think you belong at that table you will make different decisions along the way and then it becomes sort of self-fulfilling right you'll work at a different speed you'll take different risks you will you will go for it in a different way several conversations I had at this event where I realize damn a lot of the a lot of the downstream decisions start with the little voice in your head the little director of your movie who's deciding like what kind of movie is this is this like an indie budget is this a tragedy is this a comedy are you a joke or is this a hero is this a Marvel movie are you the hero saving the world right and like I'm not saying one is better than the other but you get to decide what that little voice in your head is going to tell you cuz the director says you you know what happens in the story where you stand where what you say all of those things and I thought damn a lot of what I'm seeing in how people are living their lives and what they're doing differently comes from the little voice in their head just has a different script in mind for that what their life is all about the I am statement or like here's a small example how about Jesse bringing his sauna Jesse Isler brought his sauna and he had two guys and I was like what do you guys do he's like oh we bring these saas like whenever he wants to go keep sauna hot yeah he's like whenever we go when he wants to go to like a conference or something thing like the sauna is like a really cool way to like create a bonding experience which it was by the way just chilling in the sauna it was freaking awesome and I was like wait Jesse you got these two guys whose just like job is to like Trail around this like sauna like across the country to Brak to events that's the coolest thing I've ever heard of he's like yeah isn't it great we get to hang in the S I was like yes and that's like another example of like intensity but like on a more relatable scale right all right I have one you could take your billions and shove it up your ass a SI put yeah put that on a on one of those inspirational posters that you see in your office there is this one guy who was one of the First Investors in a variety of Elon companies and presumably a a billionaire like you know investing in Tesla at a $60 million valuation I or $100 million valuation you know I don't know what that is that like I is that like a 100,000 times so something like that yeah we don't do public math yeah like a lot it's now is now a trillion dollar company yeah so it's a big deal um you know there was this funny story where this guy was telling a story about working really hard and like he uh was grinding and his kid was sick and he's like I had to take a week off to like go and help my kid and you know that was a big deal because I was working so hard and then this other guy came and he goes you know how you guys are all talking about working 16 hours weeks 16 hours a day on your companies um right now I'm doing that as well but my company is my family and I have retired from business and I work 16 hours a day as the CEO of my family and when he said that I was like this is awesome um and I imagine he was exaggerating a little bit because I imagine he still does some type of uh uh deal making or something like that um you know I don't know him well enough to know but I thought it was so cool when he said that and I thought like you have it figured out same with Jesse it's these two guys who I don't want I can't say the first guy's name but Jesse also had the same energy where I was like this is this is the way and this is all personal preference you know Jimmy wanted to be Elon cool go do that but when I heard this this other way of talking I was like you know after this is easy to say because everyone was wealthy but after some number I don't know what that number is 10 20 30 some millions of numbers not of a lot of it really matters and just like having a good time with your family is something I really admired and I and I thought it was really cool that that guy said that and it made me realize that I was getting sucked in this Vortex of like money money money and achievement achievement whatever but when I saw these guys talk and their energy I was more drawn to that than anyone else there do you agree yeah 100% I think when when I go to events like this my instinct is to figure out oh how do you win oh how do you win how do you win what tactics what techniques what strategies what approach work and instead the better question almost every single time is what game are you even playing and picking the right game matters way more than figuring out how to win the wrong game dude there was people there who were like mini gangas cons where it's like they want to dominate like they get joy out of war and domination they want to build cities they want to dominate Industries they want to do that that's a that's one game you could play and by the way no judgment great do whatever game you want to play I just want to know what the games are so I can pick and other people were like I want to be CEO of my family fulltime and I'm like ah I've done a 4-Hour stretch with my kids like I think I'm more of a 45 minutes a day 45 minutes at a time four times a day that's that's my ideal so okay I'm not going to be CEO of my family because I would actually be miserable if I was a full-time stay- at- home Dad personally but I but okay that's a game I could play then uh I talked to Jesse and I was like Jesse what do you do like what do you do every day now I'm training for races and I'm coaching my kids sports things I do public speaking cuz I I feel like it keeps me sharp and I get excited to get up on stage and say some [ __ ] that lights people up he's like I'm selling calendars he's like it's not going to make he's like I'm not making a fortune like these guys you know they'll do that in a in a day or two a week or we'll do in a year but I I don't know I like doing it I'm doing what I want to be doing and he was very at ease with that he's at peace with that and I think obviously some of that comes from maturity but a lot of it comes from it's easy to be at peace when you're actually doing the thing that puts you at peace when you're doing the thing you like and if you're kind of I don't know like masquerading around trying to just do what you think you should be doing I think that becomes very exhausting and so I'm with you that figuring out what game to play seems like the much much more important question at every phase of your life and the game I wanted to play in my 20s is different than the one I'm I'm playing currently in my 30s it's probably going to be different than what I play in my 40s and 50s and I just got to kind of reinvent myself dude there was one guy there who said he worked with Elon and apparently he had to do a meeting or something with Elon and like the secretary told him like all right you're going to do this meeting but I need you to know that Elon makes his companies make $20 million every one hour so this better be a $20 million meeting I heard a similar thing from a guy who worked with him that he was like uh Elon would have a meeting but he would there would be like 40 or 50 people in the meeting and the reason why was not because that makes for a more effective meeting but because it was like if the right if the person who we need to talk to is not in this room it's such a colossal waste of his time that we'll just fly everybody here and we're going to have this you know 45 minute block and that way everybody's here because all of your time collectively is not worth as much as his his hour which is like such a such an up is that like it's hard to it's hard to Fathom this uh let me tell you a really quick one which is hard work amongst this group not Universal so there was one guy I you weren't there you were Sean like busted his knee in the second hour or something like that and had to St stay at home for like this whole one whole session and there was this guy there who was explaining how hard he grinds and then there was this other guy who was uh one of the more successful guys there he was like I work like 20 hours a week he's like once my companies got to be like some type of like predictable stable like all right if we just keep doing this for 10 years we're going to grow 50% a year hopefully like it's going to whatever he was like I started working 20 hours a week and he's like I wouldn't work Fridays uh and it was really interesting to see that not everyone worked hard did you get that sense from people the thing I pulled from it was some people were basically operating like monopolies and other people were not uh meaning there were some people playing a game where the competition is so vicious like you know like easy example is YouTube if you stop uploading the The Game Stop the Music stop there's literally a million other businesses in that same exact space doing the EXA same exact thing who are ready eat lunch and every idea you put out there in a video somebody else is going to copy and a lot of people do copy the the exact videos that he does and the exact script it's all public information it's all super competitive there's no gatekeeping and then there's other people who were like yeah all we had to do was get to this like we just had to get this shelf space like there was one guy who was showing us a Shelf at Target and he was like basically 7 years of the company was just dedic was just like hard work dedicated to getting on the Shelf but once you're on the Shelf it's almost impossible for anybody else to get on the Shelf all we have to do now is stay on the shelf by the way this shelf right here like this little Rack you're looking at this is $300 million a year and you're just looking at it you're like oh damn like wow one shelf in Walmart One shelf in uh in Target is a is like the entire revenue streams of like these online only companies but you're extremely defensible compared to other businesses where the moment you take a take a break you have the entire internet competing with you on that same thing you know what I mean yeah yeah that that was an interesting thing do you have um I have a quick one Health Is wealth uh in a room full of very wealthy people how many fancy clothes did you see how many fancy watches did you see how many fancy cars did you hear people bragging about everyone but Joe gbia looks schleppy Joe Gia looked great even in fantastic workout gear he was wearing some dice [ __ ] dude he looks like he should be in like a Taylor Sheridan show like if he if he made an if he made an appearance on lman I wouldn't even I wouldn't even blink everyone besides him dude you know he's on the board of Tesla I didn't know that either like he he does a lot of interesting stuff um everyone besides him looked like we're like we were like at a slumber party well we were also yeah but during the day yeah that should be the title of slumber party with billionaires so but the health is well thing was very real there was a lot of flexing on stuff you're doing for your health what you're eating and not eating how much who's your doctor who's your what's your protocol dud no one was like that jacked or ripped or anything were were they other than Joe uh yeah I thought people were in pretty good shape if you go to other Industries non kind of like Tech internet not our bubble right but like go to like a conference with the wealthiest people in finance or oil or whatever like pick any industry their body shape looks a lot different no every they looked like a healthy 55-year-old dude after basically our day was go play basketball for 3 hours like an intense basketball game come home go into a 250 degree sauna then when you're tired of the sauna go into this Pond that was like freezing cold in North Carolina and go plunge for 3 minutes then go back into the sauna then go back into the plunge then there's like a massuse doing Bodywork and myof fasion release for you then you're eating and everybody's eating clean every single person's eating clean while we're there right like it's like dude that was the norm like that is not normal you know if you were drinking something out of a plastic bottle it's like basically doing heroin at this event dude me and Nick Hubert got Taco Bell at midnight we secrecy yeah like we didn't want to tell anyone secrecy dude I took like a feasable bar in my like I like hid it in my hoodie and crutched over to my bedroom and ate it like in shame over there because what am I going to do sit here and eat a chocolate bar in front of these men D hay is 52 years old and ripped I was like wow this guy is you know on the Forbes you know self-made billionaires list and also also just ripped for fun as a side quest dude yeah yeah I mean he looked great uh and then Jesse's 56 and runs 100 100 mile races how many 50y olds are ripped and Run 100 mile races nobody does that [ __ ] especially successful guys Jimmy wanted to do like a taste test he had everyone like gather around to do a taste test of like Hershey's versus his stuff and like I like pretended like oh wow Jimmy you're stuff is great I've never had this before but like at every Airbnb in the kitchen did you see this at every Airbnb it was like literally 100 candy bars and I literally had 2,000 calories per night of his candy I ate so much of I could tell you about all of it like I could I could I did I I didn't need a taste test I can tell I'm already an expert on I can tell you about all all the flavors the peanut butter ones the dark chocolate ones the to lick the rapper for the taste test like no no this is just how I'm thorough like I've already I'm like Jimmy like I already know like I've eaten all of them and I I had M&M's and uh Hershey bars on the plane on the way here like I I could tell you thear thing is when he's when he's like hanging out with like the uh like the the the upper echel lot of the group he's just like just try a piece of this one you don't have to eat the whole thing but like you know it's more for younger people but like whatever that's what he goes he goes it's for kids it's for kids and he's like he he'll give you like the dark chocolate flavor and I'm sitting there with like cookies and cream all over my and I'm like I like it I like the cookies and cream one it's like my daughter just learned my favorite Jimmy you have more of this one yeah my daughter just learned how to say more and but I feel like this more more more M more this one I was doing this all time more more more can I give you some some of the negative ones how about the guy who goes at that point I was broke I think I only had like $20 million yeah he's tell some story well there's there was a hilarious conversation about prenups which is you know nothing more can be said except for there was an incredible conversation about prenups I was about to go outside me and uh me and someone else were going to go outside of the sauna and someone said hey can I ask you guys about prenup and we were like H let's just sit right here I just want to listen let's just listen it was one of the that like next three hours was one of the most entertaining three hours of my life like I I don't think I've laughed that hard in 5 10 years like I was literally like belly laugh crying shocking set setups people have billionaires are not like you and me if you're listening to this billionaires exist and they are not like you they are not like you I would say is the midwit meme was in full effect I'll give you one example so the way we played our basketball tournament was was three teams H and we played and then it was supposed to be the you know the top two teams play for the finals but every but all the teams finished the same record one like we all had one win one loss after everybody played each other so it's like okay well which two teams advance to the finals and so I but everybody's getting tired so I had to make something up so I was like all right we're going to do a like a penalty kick shootout so what's the most exciting you know like thing in sports is in hockey or soccer where they do the shootout um and it's not going to take up a bunch of energy because like we're old guys and people are getting hurt we got to like we can't play an extra game to figure out who's going to go so we said all right everybody step up to pick every each team Pick Five Guys they're going to shoot a free throw and then the team that makes the least like pressure's on everybody's watching you so it's interesting one team my team was like this is a dictatorship like y'all are the five best to the other guys they're they're better than you these five are shooting who was the dictator what I I was a dictator I didn't even think there was another way I was like of course we're just going to pick our five best and do this like honestly I didn't even consider another method and I was the coach of my team because I had gotten injured I'm on crutches I was like doing that the second guy uh the second team did it Merit based and then the third was like kind of like a volunteer voting system or whatever and in the Merit based thing well a funny thing that happened was one of the guys who's probably less good at basketball overall made it in the practice shot and one of the guys who was one of their better players on the team just happened to miss so I was like damn are y'all really gonna not have one of your best players shoot and have this other guy shoot I I was just watching I'm like I just want to see what happens here I want to see what happens with the egos I just need to know I need to see this the guy was like you sure you want to do it he's like no no no you should do it you made it you if you want to I'll do it and then the guy like no I mean I don't know I think I'm gonna do it he's like okay go ahead and do it so so the gu steps up and he shoots and he makes it the guy who's probably like you know the weaker basketball players makes it clutched it up and has this awesome moment and his team advances to the finals and I feel so happy for this guy and I'm like that was amazing I'm like I'm I'm glad that they kind of Honor moment he had his Rudy moment he honored it he made it good for him that was awesome Under Pressure I love I wanted everybody to have like golden moments during the during the event but then after the final and this their team goes on wins the finals happy they're holding the trophy it's all good afterwards we're all like packing up to leave and he's like he goes up to that guy the other guy who sat out he's like hey I want can you and me go shoot free throws I want to know if that was the correct like EV decision statistically and the guy's like oh man you already made it like you you already made it we already won like you're good dude you did it he's like no no no I I need to know I need to know and he's like no like it's like honestly it's done you I'm glad you did it you made it he's like I need to know and he's like all right so they go and they shoot and of course the guy who's played basketball his whole life makes more of the free throws in like the with the larger sample size and then the other guy was like kind of head down for like he was kind of bummed out about it for a second and I was like what a what an intelligently stupid thing to do right like he wanted to know like was this a positive EV decision was this statistically the correct move what is EV mean expected value it's like if you're playing poker you can you bet your chips and even if you lose you're still happy because you made the right decision even if the result didn't pan out so funny there's chances and so I was like way to snatch like way to snatch defeat from the jaws of Victory and there was so many of these little moments where like there's this guy there who's like he's a total catch he's like smart he's good-looking he's ripped he's uh successful all these things and he I I just thought a guy like this could walk into a coffee shop and like the C Barista would want him to talk to her there's a I've always wanted to be that guy like this guy could have been that guy he could it could be so easy for him to just meet someone amazing and instead you want to describe like so all right I think what he did was did he scrape he built a program that scraped LinkedIn he starts with the desired result he's like I want a beautiful intelligent successful woman or something like that I was there the thing someone who fit his like Heritage and so he was like cool so he built the AI bot to crawl LinkedIn to then scrape all the like successful beautiful like trained on images of women that he thought were beautiful like every woman who was like of a certain like look in New York who was between you know whatever 22 and 30 or whatever he had like a data he he had binders of women yeah B full of wom it was hilarious and then he had this like whole system for how he could reach out to them with like it was amazing I I go into all the details but like he had a dedicated iPhone there he goes this is my iPhone and I he goes I have two full-time Engineers who have built this program that auto DM them this particular DM on Instagram let me uh send her a voice note I go you send voice notes he goes I have found that voice notes convert better and like he like showed me the voice not as he told this whole system it's like what's that thing called the rosack test or whatever where you see the blot and it's like you either see like you know a killer or an angel or whatever his it was like some people were like this is the most impressive thing I've ever seen and then some people like the married guys who were like you know 50 40s and 50s were like brother you you're you're it's too much you're doing too much here you got to just like just see a cute girl and go talk to her it's okay let it let it roll organically baby it's going to work better that way and I just thought it was hilarious um I'm really late I gotta go I'm supposed to be speaking at something right now I got I got a jet I just realized I'm way over that's it that's the [Music] pod for

all right we should talk about AI because you used to tweet about like boring steady ye cash flow businesses and I feel like for this one you just ripped off your clothes and you're streaking through the pool right now so what what is your take on [Music] AI dude I am for the first time in a while I'm waking up grinning every single morning just like stoked to get to work um I feel like this is I was saying to a friend I was like this is like somebody just invented a new internet or something like that's how big this feels and he goes no no no no someone just invented fire right like it's it's freaking crazy and the best quote that I've heard on this is it's like we've discovered a new continent with 10 billion people on it and they're all Geniuses and willing to work for free right and so everyone's talking about this know agents right agents is like a meme right now and what we're really talking about is digital employees and digital people and when you shift your mindset like that you go holy crap like not only is this an incredibly exciting time to be an entrepreneur but the implications are going to be absolutely crazy like you know that saying there's decades what is it uh what is it there decades where nothing happens and then there's days where decades happen and I feel like right now decades are happening you know like crazy crazy and here here's the way i' put it so if we just paused AI we shut down all the AI labs and all we focused on was just roll out of what already exists I think probably between self-driving cars and AI agents 20% of all current jobs are gone what can you explain examples of the way that um you're using it now to save and make yourself more productive like both personally and in a business level or is this is mostly uh like theoretical where you're like it's almost there well it's a bit of everything so I'd say like we're in the AOL dialup phase right now but like AOL dialup it's still pretty freaking cool if you've never used the internet um so you know basic stuff that everybody should be doing like I have a I have an agent that preps me for every meeting so 30 minutes before every meeting I get a text and it says hey you're meeting Sean and Sam you were emailing them about this topic you're going to invest in their company and here's two bios on them it goes to LinkedIn and you know just summarizes it so something very basic that otherwise a human would do previously my assistant would do that um I have it monitor my stock portfolio I have it tell me about local events for the first one so how did you set that up how did you what tool are you using to do the uh meeting prep 30 minutes before you get a text saying hey you have this meeting with these people about this so you guys know zapier it's basically zapier for AI agents so zapier it's freaking amazing Andrew you introduced me to someone who worked at Lindy and her name was Lindy and I was like wait you I don't understand this we got 25 minutes into the conversation before I realized it was just a woman named Lindy who worked at this company called Lindy basically they they founded the company and they were like oh like your name is an awesome name for a company let's just call it that but it's also super confusing because she runs the sales team yeah I was like wait so you're like are You Smarter child most people would uh it'd be like a quick like two second thing it's like oh L yeah yeah that's cool how funny and then they move on and get into the sales demo whereas Sam for 25 minutes is like hold on you're Lindy or this is L like would not let it go for 20 hey let's take a quick break to talk about our sponsor today HubSpot has put together a list of 200 AI business ideas these are business ideas that you could create using Ai and it's a list of 200 they did a huge brainstorm so you can check it out if you just click the link below you can get access to these 200 AI ideas uh I'll give you an example of a couple of them one of them is you could build an AI dressing room so let's say you go to an e-commerce site and you want to see what something would look like on you you could use AI to actually take a picture of you and show you what the clothes would look like on you or what the makeup would look like on your face it's pretty cool right um or AI tools for real estate brokers maybe something that takes their listings and makes them more more fancy more more more beautiful and attract more buyers so check it out it's a brainstorm of 200 possible AI ideas brought to you by HubSpot you can get it for free in the link below so yeah like so think about think about Lindy like uh zap here except you can build AI in between so zapier might be um when I when I press this button on my phone go to the internet and do this act action or whatever but it can't think Lindy can add thinking in between so for example you can make a Lindy that looks at your calendar so the way it would work in this instance is look at my calendar an hour before any event starts go on perplexity go to LinkedIn and I want you to write me a bio and then I want you to look in my email inbox and tell me what we're talking about so that's like pretty basic and what we're really talking about at this point is removing admin work right so the agent that I have built is basically um by cobbling it together with duct tape and dental floss it's basically doing a lot of stuff my assistant would otherwise do and my assistant's amazing but the problem with a human is they you'll give them Direction and you'll say I want you to send me these meeting briefings or I want you to write my calendar like this and over time there's drift they get busy you give them more projects and it just doesn't happen and so now all those things that let's be real are not really worthy of her time are now just being totally automated so that's like the basic level and I can name some of the other tools I'm using to do this but that that's where I'm at so I use Lindy to build these things when it's something I want that's custom are you an investor in Lindy no I'm not an investor in lindia I'm just like a power user and I'm obsessed with it like here's an example so uh there's some restaurants in in town where they still require you to call in to make a reservation they're not on Open Table I made a Lindy bot where I can type in hey make me a reso around 5: to 7:00 p.m. tonight at this restaurant and it will call in an AI voice will talk to them book The reso put it on my calendar and invite the people I asked it to invite and if the person says are you AI it'll explain that it yeah it works for me and if it asks for allergies it knows my allergies like it's pretty cool um and so and then other tools so I use this one called hoe. and it's basically like a you CC it and you just say Howe can you find time for me and Sam to go get a coffee and it'll you know book all that stuff I use um fixer fyxer it's this British startup it basically reads every single email that comes into your Gmail it sorts it based on whether you need to respond to it or not and then it drafts responses so let's say Sean said hey do you want to get coffee it'll re it'll draft a rejection or an acceptance of that in my language and it gets better over time so those those are like three tools that I'm using that are awwesome right now and they're really just replacing basic admin this is crazy I'm looking at this right now um Sean where's this land with you do you use any of this stuff and does this make you fearful of uh somewhere uh no not really I think everything just evolves right like ultimately i' you know this diagram that's always stuck with me is this a k like a k-shaped future so what's a k-shaped future so if you imagine the letter K and you say all right this is where we are now that's the first line and then it's basically like there's a fork in the road with the K right it's if you learn how to use these tools you're going to accelerate and go up at a f way faster Pace than you would have otherwise and if you don't if you just stick your head in the sand and pretend that these tools don't exist and that your job is always safe and that um your business can run is going to run with all humans doing all jobs then you're going to go down because you're going to get outcompeted by companies that are not going to do that are going to do something different I personally use it less for my personal and more for my business so basically in my business I almost have like a my own eval so Sam you know what eval is no it's just like when a new model comes out like when llama drops their new model they always post with pride like oh here's how we do on the benchmarking test the evaluation test and it's like some number you don't really know what it's based off of it's just this like abstract like oh we're a 73 and the last model from GPT was a 71 so we're the best model now and is there a standard like is an eval like a a third party standard people build there's a few different evals out there people are trying to build new evals whatever I have my own little eval which is in my businesses I basically picked a few tasks that I'm like today humans in my companies do these tasks and about every sort of three to six months we go back and we run through it again we say take the latest model take the latest product everyone's excited about and see like what's the real deal Holyfield can we actually automate that task can it actually be offloaded from the human being yet and there's basically like a spectrum there's like um can't do it at all there's you can do it but you wouldn't actually do it it's not good enough like the person you know that oh you wanted to use AI photography for your brand but every model has nine fingers and like two you know two mouths it's like all right well I'm not actually going to put that on my website so like cool in theory but not in practice um then there's you could do it if there's a human on top of it so you could train a human to like be in the loop to tweak it to work with it to make it better and then there's oh we don't we just don't need a human doing this anymore and so what I've done is basically figured out all right here's like 10 tasks that are real tests that we do that have a real cost and a real human doing it in my companies and I will know for myself as we get closer to AGI because those all just go from zero out of 10 which is where we started to like three out of 10 six out of 10 eight out of 10 once eight out of those 10 tasks are like yep we just set up an agent and like we don't need to have a person doing those anymore that's when I know oh my God this like we've had like real real breakthroughs because it matter because that's the real test for me versus I don't know exactly how these evals work but it's like a it's like an abstract thing or it'll be like you know they can pass the lsats it's like that's cool but I don't need it to pass the lsats if the opportunity is AI agents in my business then I'm going to test it on what can these AI agents do in my business so what what's an example what's an example of one of these things that you would want to automate the simple example I gave is like uh e-commerce so photography so every month we pay photographers to do shoots a real cost somewhere between let's say $5,000 to $10,000 Allin for uh e-commerce photography and you have basically product photography or you can have models in it whatever right so there's like a little bit of a range there so just product or models and so I want to know like when can I get rid of that 10K a month so when can I basically just show it my product um in on a blank and be like cool put this on models or we have other ones where it's like uh photos and videos so I can where you know you've seen these models where you give it a static image and it turns it into a video and you see the demo on Twitter and it's amazing it's just a girl posing and then she starts like strutting with it turns into AI video it looks awesome cool but then like you do it in practice and yes she starts string but then her face starts morphing like she's like being eaten by lava it's like okay I'm not going to put that on my website like that would be a a bad thing right to do that did you see the uh AI meme of Mark Zuckerberg staring at bezos's wife's boobs where he like he like leads in extra hard to like smell him do you watch that video it's literally his eyes they dart back down from a microsecond yeah and some guys made videos of him like not stopping and just continually going in it was um that's pretty badass what were we saying like another example would be uh you know in e-commerce you have inventory forecasting this seems like a data problem right how much inventory should I order when should I order and let's say let's pretend you have five colors of a product which color should I be ordering well it looks like an AI problem you got a whole bunch of historical data you have real-time sales data that's coming in and then you should be able to forecast and like today we employ two human beings to do that forecasting they're not perfect at it it's very very difficult problem to solve um Can AI make them smarter and like do it better can I go from two humans to one human plus AI or can I replace the two humans that just have ai give us more accurate demand demand plan demand for this is a problem that every every physical products brand in the world has this problem whether it's uh you know Hershey's chocolate bars or it's you know North Face jackets like it doesn't matter everybody's trying to figure this out how do we order the right amount of inventory and not be stuck with too much inventory it feels like we're talking about solar power you remember like five 10 years ago everyone would be like well I mean solar is really cool and all but I mean like it's still not cost competitive but if you look at the graph it just keeps going cost goes goes down down down down down and if you just project it and you look at the rate of progress with these tools like we've been exploring for aor press doing the same thing because we spend a lot of money on big expensive photo shoots and usually it's just an arrow press sitting there really well lit with nice coffee in it so we've been looking at flare and some of these other tools and I've been pretty Blown Away with where I can get to and I agree there's definitely like a Last Mile problem but it'll be there in the next 6 to 12 months I think and when it does I think it it's really cool for your business but it also represents competition because it just becomes infinitely easier to compete in all businesses and we'll talk about this more but like I think that's what's crazy about all this stuff by the way the most solved one of these is meeting meeting minutes like I don't know Andrew if you used to do this but I used to invite my assistant into our meetings and say hey can you take notes jot down any action items or follow-ups that we're going to need to do like that has just been completely that's compl completely gone off her plate which for her it basically freed up you know four hours of time for my assistant a day on average let's say and if now she's got four hours back that she can spend doing the other things um because I'm using fathom and fathom just sits in my meeting records all the notes perfect transcript with highlights with a summary with action items ready to go 247 never misses a beat and um so I'm like this is not only did it replace the it's way better than my my assistant could do it because she'd be trying to keep up and it's just was not going to be good enough the level of accountability you can get too right like I I hate that feeling where it's like oh I did a board meeting with this CEO six months ago and I swear to God I swear to God they promised me this one thing and then they're like no no I don't remember that and being able to pull that up I just did a um really a really cool thing actually me and my girlfriend did a relationship offsite which sounds really lame and nerdy um Patrick Campbell actually was the one that gave me the idea but we basically would talk about hey what are what are like our big strategic goals for the year for our relationship for family for life in general and stuff and we recorded the entire thing with otter which is like similar tool to Fathom and I was blown away like We just chatted for three hours and it was able to spit out here's all the action items here's all the things that need to come out of this then we're able to put it into Claude And it built a plan for us very cool you uh you by the way I was giving you a hard time it does sound nerdy and also I do the exact same thing uh we have relationship meetings as well uh you you have the local news business the the newsletter Sean and I both owned newsletters when I did it AI didn't exist and I felt like um you know hiring writers was actually the hardest part uh like who could write in my voice now I would hate to be in the newsletter business because I see this stuff and I'm like it's like it's almost ready to roll but it's definitely ready to roll as as an editor are you using this uh for your newsletter now for the uh local news newsletter I'm not right now but that's what I'm working on so like the pieces that I'm the more advanced stuff I'm doing are like I've got a social media manager agent I've got a marketer agent I've got a Tax Advisor and investment analyst and I mean these are these are roles I previously would have hired for where I didn't I either didn't renew someone's contract or I didn't make a new hire for them so already replacing people that I would have hired otherwise wait wait C can you explain a couple of these explain the Tax Advisor one and then explain the social media one so social media is very simple it's like I post on X all the time and I'm lazy I don't like crossposting on LinkedIn I often forget I'll tweet about something and then not include it in my newsletter and so what I've done is I built a Lindy b a Lindy bot that looks at my Twitter and all my all my other channels and then once a week it's summarizes all the stuff I've been talking about and asks me hey what do you want to include in the newsletter and then it can give me a first draft and it's trained on my previous writing so it can write B and it's you know it's not perfect but it's like 80% of the way there and if I didn't care about my my personal brand like you know many people just want like a quick and dirty newsletter it would be totally sendable and it's completely engaging if you prompt it right like you can even say like give me a subject line that will force the the person to open the email right and it it's really good what about the accounting thing the accounting thing is freaking like blew my mind so um basically I exported I use zero for all my accounting and for my personal like financials and my personal holding company It's Like A Rat's Nest like I have like 200 300 random Investments all sorts of weird assets and stuff in there and so I exported all all of it as CSV out of zero I trained a Claude project on it and I started asking it questions did you upload Like A Book Like a warm Buffett book or like what did you no no this is like basically to replace like right now so I have I have a woman who runs my family office and I might ask her hey how much should we spend on software last week it'll be let's say it's a Saturday and I'm kind of bored and doing a deep dive I'll email her on Saturday and I've got to wait until Tuesday to get a an answer and so I was like oh I just want to be able to query L and so I was like Hey I want you to rank the top 25 things I spend money on or I want you to look at my structure and I want you to tell me if there's any ways that I could save on tax and so one it was crazy I actually saved $100,000 a year of cash taxes by moving an investment from one hold code to another uh thanks Claude right so it is very quickly becoming Tax Advisor uh investment anal I can get it to write a deal I can get it to draft legal documents like these I mean everyone's doing this but like it is getting it's getting so good that I don't hire people let's put it that way weren't you hiring for like an AI back office person like you have some role I saw that you put up there what was that yeah so um the woman who runs my family office she's got a a a family situation and so she's got a transition out of the role and so me and my president were like okay what do we what do we really want out of this role and when we thought about it we were like we actually just want someone who's like an AI nerd to automate away all the accounting and bookkeeping and stuff that nobody enjoys doing you and go came up with that yeah that's right exactly I hired him right out of office um but anyway yeah we're hiring like an AI first CFO basically somebody where their job is basically just to build automations Financial automations you guys probably have some who works for you who just basically manages zapier and like zapier the problem with zapier is that it's awesome when it works but like for some reason [ __ ] breaks all the time which I don't understand how like I don't understand enough about technology to know like why do this ship break all the time and then the systems were so complicated that if that person left it was like oh [ __ ] what's this stuff that we got to go uncover because they've automated so much [ __ ] where it's like we just rely solely on this one person and it becomes actually an issue where it's kind of all automated but it's sort of duct tape together and the duct tape comes undone and there's so much duct tape that I got to go and fig it's like when your Lego breaks you gota like dude I gota like [ __ ] rebuild this whole [ __ ] I don't know where this one little [ __ ] piece goes totally I've had the same experience like anytime I got really into no code like four years ago or whatever and you know we build all these automations where oh it'll go to this one place and then a zap your automation will move the data into air table and then you manipulate it in XYZ way and I think the difference here is that like Claud will just figure it out right so if you say like hey it's not working it'll just sort it out or tell you how to fix it whereas before I had that exact same problem and totally agree usually the automations just cause problems how are you guys using it at Hampton right now I mean it's basically just like glor it's like glorified zapier basically so like it connects air table to HubSpot to this website uh update these records in HubSpot like it's basically all back-end operational stuff which I think is underutilizing CU like what I would do if I was you is I would get a um Claud has this thing called I forget what it's called Model context protocol or whatever and you can basically build a database of all all your members and then just have a way to query it where you can say hey we need a speaker for this event in La who would be good or or who's got a business in this space and just have like a live database of people in an llm that'd be sweet so so what I'm working on though like the next piece here is actually like Sean I'm basically lining up who are you know what are the roles um that we can you know not need in the future and most of this is not firing people it's actually just not hiring people we otherwise would but if you if you graph this out you can see that we're all going to have virtual employees very very soon and that's what's crazy like I was watching an interview with Dario amade from uh anthropic yesterday at Davos and he basically said in the next 12 months you will have ai co-workers in slack now if you just project that out right now it's text right these are not people but pretty quick it'll be someone on slack that you're messaging hey can you make some new product images hey do you mind checking out the AdSense do you can you write a report and I think that within 24 to 36 months these will be 4K video people that are indistinguishable indistinguishable from a human that you talk to on Zoom now I know that sounds crazy but I really believe that's what's coming and I think if you just think about the the implications in terms of business Moes and businesses that are going going to be disrupted it's just staggering do your guys's parents use it or like your 10-year-old cousins like how how my mom uses it in what way well my mom's you know she her first language was Hindi right so she speaks English she speaks it well but she if she needs to write it's kind of stresses her her out she's like oh I got to write something got to write an email I got to write a letter respond to something write a note to the doctor and she's like kind of slow with writing and she feels a little bit insecure that like her writing is going to be like well formatted well gr you know grammar's correct and uh clear and so she was early on chat GPT to just be like oh great I can just tell it what I wanted to write and then it just writes a beautiful email for me and then I she what she does is she has to like kind of mess it up a little bit to make it back get it back to real um my mom has been using it in that way but that's kind of all she used it but I think what you're getting at is like even though for us a lot of these things we're saying right now seem obvious that you're you're kind of right I think if if I know where you're going with this question which is like you know my sister my mom like how much has it crossed the chasm like my sister uses it in her schools to create curriculums so uh she has it do curriculums and lesson plans and gives that to her teachers to um to work off of which is something like either they would do kind of either procr destinated or or you know half or she would have to do herself and so I think that was a big win for her but you know it's it's kind of like you find your one use case of chat GPT or you know and you go there another one like my mom was giving it like her Kaiser like data test results so like you know you go you get blood work done or you get a you get some procedure done you get this result in your app and you have to wait for this doctor to call you to tell you what the heck this means it's kind of a scary gap of time and we just upload all of the screenshots into chat GPT we're like what does this mean and it gives us beautiful perfect bedside manner explanations more patient more thorough than the doctor you can ask followup questions at your own Leisure I mean that that's been another one that was like pretty it was just like night and day it's like okay I'll never not do this anymore this is so much better I'll never not do this Andrew you had on here that software is going to be a worse business over the next 10 years what's your like premise here of it being a worst business let me zoom out a bit so in a free market the amount of competition basically defines how good a business is right so you know everybody loves to [ __ ] on restaurants but if you own the only restaurant in town let's say that there was one restaurant license given out in every major city and you own that restaurant so you have excess demand you have no competition that would be a phenomenal business you could have 40 50 60% margins um you know basically as long as people don't RI it you can charge whatever you want and the food can be bad right so I think that same thing applies to software businesses and startups right so if I remember um you know 15 years ago I started a a productivity software company and it was a terrible business because every single week new VCB back companies like AA um monday.com Etc would come out and compete with us and drive us into the ground and where there's been a lot of wealth generated in software is in vertical markets so what does that mean like that's like um weird Niche businesses where nobody is competing so for example like funeral home management software golf course management software random like Dam and infrastructure software and these are great businesses because not no like amazing developer wakes up and no amazing designer wakes up and is like I'm going to go and build this software and so basically you're the only game in town you can charge whatever you want and nobody switches off of you and so so for the last 30 years that's been the best business ever you might have heard of constellation software they built like a70 billion Behemoth public company and all they do is buy businesses like this D don't they buy like a hundred a year they buy 100 a year they increase the prices on a schedule they hold them they don't really you know do anything crazy or improve them in in any particular way and they're buying like $3 million a year software companies three 3 to 10 sometimes bigger but they have a formula in so um basically I I believe let's let's just take Funeral Home software right so let's say that there's one developer who built Funeral Home software and he's had no major competition for 10 years with tools like repet you can literally go in like and you can reproduce basic software very very easily right if if your software is like highly algorithmic and complicated yeah maybe not but something basic like Funeral Home management where it's like case management basically is incredibly easy to replicate in 10 or 20 minutes and repet and so my belief is basically that as more and more people don't need to learn how to code and can build software software will become more and more commoditized there'll be way more competition and it'll be a way harder world for software businesses and I think that ultimately it just comes down to time for us all of our software businesses we' bought we've generally bought them in a way where we've drisk we've paid ourselves back or we have some sort of unique competitive advantage or cost can advantage or something like for example we own a uh a framework a hosting company for a framework and a lot of people have standardized and built software on that framework they're going to keep hosting with us because we support that framework and nobody else does right there's there's things like that um but personally when I'm under writing software deals now I am being incredibly conservative and honestly I'm much more focused on communities and social networks as a result um we still look at software when there's like a hardware component or there's some kind of lock in but I'm much less enamored with software right now because of this that's [ __ ] crazy do you guys think I'm like out to lunch on this am I totally like overthinking this or so say say the thought out loud what's the specific thought right well well I think it's pretty wild implication that we may have mass disruption in terms of jobs and mass disruption in terms of every business that we know that we think of as a good business may not be a good business in and it's not a long term right this is not 10 years we're talking about a two-year time Horizon so let's take the business side of it right um the business item your argument was basically software for the last 30 years has been an incredible business to be a creator of or an owner of whether you're buying or building software businesses and you're saying I think that's going to change because um if it becomes so easy for anybody to build software that they need then they're not going to be buying $5,000 a year or $50,000 a year software anymore and so maybe this one thing vertical software VMS right um or other other categories like that where it's like more of a simple crud database with a a user interface on top of it um that those are going to become less valuable I totally agree with you that that's that those are less less appealing than they were before I don't think it goes to zero because in reality um it's sort of like anytime you've actually built software it's the last 10% that takes you you know you can get 90% of the way there you feel like you're almost there but then the last 10% will take you as much time as the first 90 it's just like a a rule you see over and over and over again and it's the same thing with products which is that to actually make something work and solve all your problems that you need that you're used to your current software solving it will take time effort love care and whether it's just might just be somebody else building software that's a competitor to you or you know if is somebody in your own company going to build that I think it's less likely that that becomes like a major disruption to all of software because like you were saying like some software like social networks or communities the value is not the app the value is the people and the connections and the habits that they formed so you software where there's already habits those will be safe software where the value is the people or the data those will be safe software where the value is in the Enterprise relationship the service that's on top of it or the like fine-tuning and tailoring and the cya which is that if I buy enterprise software I'm I don't need to save 40% on this bill as much as I need to not get fired for being like yeah we home brewed our entire CRM and like the security wasn't very good right because we didn't I made this in [ __ ] clawed instead of it being software I bought from a vendor that's been doing this for 15 years and has actually like solved the security vulnerabilities and so I think that enterprise software will be safe so I think a lot of software will be more safe than software just as a category goes to zero yeah I would I would I would generally agree with that although I think it's going to be a lot easier to offer incredible sport incredible sales Etc on the other side of it you get the the market expands right because it's not just that oh there's going to be more competition in this fixed pie it's that now a whole bunch of software that really wouldn't have made sense to build because coders didn't understand the problem so they weren't working on it or you would have need too much funding to build it it's not really worth it so all this new software is going to get created that was not really feasible or wasn't really easily accessible before like I'll give you like a stupid example I went on repet the other day and rep's amazing because it's literally chat gbt except for when you tell it something it makes a website for you or makes an app for you and so I had this like you know World selfish problem which was that I like to log my meals um like I like to take I take photos of my meals when I when I eat them uh to be able to send to my my like coach but um then my entire camera roll is just shitty pieces of chicken and my kids it's like beautiful pictures of my kids and then ugly pictures of chicken and I'm like all right this is kind of annoying that that's there so I I just told rep I said make an app that when I open up the app instantaneously the camera is on I don't want to like type in stuff I just like open the camera take the photo show me a thumbs up or a thumbs down where I can rate my own meal and then save it in a calendar view where I can see like a streak of if you know if I've been doing roughly good make it green if I've been doing bad make those red and can it make it an app that it gets approved in the App Store so that was so immediately rep like hey I can't make iOS apps yet but I can make it as a website you could add it to your home screen and you could use it on your phone but it'll just be a website you open up I was like all right deal and then it made that app for me and it's like you know it's not perfect like I ran into some walls where that rep's like hey I don't know why it's not working I'm like y it actually is working it's like you're you're just being crazy but like you know okay you get through the craziness and it's not exactly good enough I would say like like I I'm using it every day and telling you guys how amazing this this tool is but nine months from now pretty sure I'm going to be able to just do that right so like I can be a software creator without knowing how to code that's already a big big deal because of that any idea I have I can make come to fruition so a whole bunch of new ideas are going to come into the market that didn't exist and I could it for like other problems that weren't going to get solved maybe through like you know if you look at software today it's like a u lowest common denominator like I need to serve the most customers who are willing to pay so I'm going to like shave off all the edges and make some product that's what I think most people want even if it's not what I personally want right or what me and a cluster of people like me really want and so I think the overall market for software gets bigger because you can create way way more stuff so so that's the other Counterpoint to like software being bad phenomenal for consumers right as a consumer I'm so excited it's more if you're buying these businesses and you're underwriting 10 years of returns continued profit margins all that kind of stuff I think it's it's a lot it just got a lot harder because before it was like look there's only so many programmers out there right there's only so many competent Mac OS iOS whatever programmers and I'm with you in terms of like where repet is at right now where it's like yeah you got to you got to fiddle a lot to get it to a point where it's shippable I've built a lot of stuff that is 90% that I can't put out into the world because it's not there yet um but I think it's a little bit like stock photos two years ago you know stock photos generated by AI were terrible now I would not want to be in the stock photo business because it's it's perfect and it's only getting better I will say one other thing like this same thing happened with media right so like before only people who can make media were media companies you would there was limited TV channels newspapers if you owned one of them it was amazing if you didn't it wasn't right and you're right that like owning those Legacy Media businesses kind of sucks in the world of social media where anybody can create content and so those businesses went down but then suddenly new businesses which were social media based emerg and the set of social media based businesses are way bigger than the set of Legacy Media businesses right you have if you're if you're interested in whatever weird Niche you don't have to rely on the Wall Street Journal to write about it right so I think it Nets out way ahead I don't know if you guys heard Larry Ellison yesterday when he was like going off about AI like people like oh what are you excited about Ai and he like did this little rant which I don't know how well versed Larry Ellison is in like what's actually like possible with AI versus like masaan you know showing a picture of a golden Goose laying eggs and being like that's why I'm investing um but he was like he's like with AI here's here's what's going to happen in the next few years he was like you're going to be able to do early detection of cancer then the the AI is going to sequence what cancer you have it's going to be able to design a personalized vaccine for your cancer and cure you of cancer so why am I investing hundred billion dollars because I want that and I want a hundred other things like that and it was just like a very compelling like rant he did outside did he deliver it in that type of compelling way well nobody's me but yeah he did his he did the Larry Ellison version of it the B+ but he did do like he was like uh that like he he was able to dumb it down he was basic basically like like he want it was like he was shaking somebody and be like do you hear what I'm saying like do you know what this is like get this in your little head it's not about an investment for a data center it's we're going to cure cancer with this [ __ ] okay and it's going to save like your mom's life like that's what we're going to do with this thing okay that's that's why we're doing this let's not get caught up in Project Stargate and the politics and the the investment amount and the infrastructure like okay all that's a means to that end is kind of the way he was saying it dude this shit's so exciting he also I think he's obsessed with living forever I think he's one of these guys who's like into that and throws is you know the 10th richest guy in the world so he can kind of throw his weight behind a lot of that stuff and I think that's pretty badass and that's probably a huge motivator Andrew can we do one more you had this great thing in your notes that I don't I want I want to hear you explain you said AI hedge basically you were looking for Investments given that you think okay software might not be the best place to be investing where are you investing and what what what is all the stuff I see here down below uh down below your AI hedge notes sure so I feel like um you know there's a bunch of different scenarios here including that this scaling slows down and it's a mo moderate disruption we've got a couple years of some people being unemployed and then they rescale they go do different things like you said the economy gets bigger whatever there's another possibility that there's what's called an AI fast takeoff which is like masa's graph of like the singularity happens and you know it's crazy and if that happens it's like does capitalism matter does the free market matter does the AI basically just become this like communist Overlord that allocates assets and stuff but I've been thinking about um you know what do you want to own in a world where that happens so you can go out and you can try and buy secondary in Claude or anthropic or open AI those are very expensive you can buy Nvidia at 30 times earnings or asml at 30 times earnings some of these or or tsmc but there's the W risk all the other stuff and so I've been trying to find stocks that I can buy that are actually affordable but capture AI upside and I found a really interesting one um so I love stuff that's miscategorized and misunderstood by public market investors Public Market investors are very simple in the way that they think about companies they have a series of boxes and they filter you through the boxes and there's a saying you want to look like a duck and quack like a duck in the the public market they do not like complexity and so if you say the wrong keyword their brain turns off and they just say I'm not going to invest right and so let's let's a couple of those examples are uh cannabis right they just put you in a box biotech oh high risk and Bitcoin is another one there's all these crappy Bitcoin mining companies dude when we sold the company to HubSpot one of the reasons we went into the year with millions and millions of dollars booked of advertising and we were probably going to do $20 million that next year here and they were like yeah just cancel all those contracts and give the money away give the money back and we're not going to do advertising anymore and I was like but you could scale this to like a lot to tens of millions or whatever and they're like yeah we make billions of dollars a year and also we would have just have to report that and that's a little too complicated and people won't understand it so like the decision of them to not do that was worth more than the tens of millions of dollars of advertising Revenue they could have made which is wild have you ever met one of those like really ADHD young entrepreneurs who's pitching you on their business and they're like oh we do this we also do this and also I've got a company that does this right and and we all the older Statesmen we always are like ah you know young Padawan just focus and you know don't do that or or if you're going to do that don't tell me about all this other stuff because it just confuses me I feel like public market investors are like that so so here's the business I found it's called Iris energy uh the ticker is iren I en and and basically it's these two Australian guys who were infrastructure bankers and their thesis supposedly was that compute was going to be a big deal in the next 10 to 20 years so pre they went out they secured a whole bunch of huge data center properties that were right next to mostly renewable energies so they'd find a power plant that's like a hydroelectric Dam or something like that and they would literally just buy a massive data center right next to it and build one so for example where I live in BC um they have one in Prince George right next to like a big Hydro Dam and currently the best use for these data centers they've built so far has been mining Bitcoin so they've been doing that and they're not Bitcoin bolds they're not like micro strategy or someone like that they don't hold the Bitcoin they just mine it they've got their gpus and whatever and they sell it immediately and right now they're making somewhere in the range of $500 million of EA annually doing that now the stock trades at about a $2.4 billion valuation so you can buy it actually quite cheaply based on the Bitcoin thesis right and Bitcoin would have to drop by about I believe I'm guessing based on some assumptions but I think it would have to drop about 70% before they get to break even on mining these Bitcoin so here's what's interesting about this business so it's totally misunderstood by the public market because everybody thinks oh they're Bitcoin Bulls they're mining Bitcoin there's all this risk or whatever what's actually interesting here is uh they are going to flip or we I hope or they've kind of publicly communicated to some degree that they're going to try and flip these data centers over to compute so all these huge companies like you know uh Amazon and Microsoft and anthropic and whatever they all need data centers and they need the data centers to be centralized in one place you can't have 10 computers here or 10 gpus here and 10 gpus somewhere else you for training you need them all to be in a massive super cluster so the other interesting thing is you can't just go and build these super clusters you can't go build these data centers anywhere it takes a long time to get permitting uh and approval and it takes a long time to build and so basically there's a finite amount of this stuff to the point where you guys have probably heard like Bill Gurley talking about like trying to buy nuclear power plants and all sorts of crazy stuff so basically if they flip this business over to doing inference and to working with hyperscalers on training this could be a massively uh a massive boost to the business and it could you know five 10 20x I don't know um but very significant if they signed some deals with hyperscalers which I know that they're actively working on they've communicated as much um so basically if you believe in a fast takeoff it's a very interesting uh way to to kind of buy something with relatively low downside and very significant upside um instead of buying Nvidia or Microsoft obviously your sound like you're Leonard DiCaprio in uh yeah exactly do your own research this is not investment advice I do own the stock um but I think it's interesting how much of the stock did you buy um I only bought like a million dollars but I look at it as like a small it's a very small position it's like buying fire Insurance yeah what what is this a position for ants just a million dollars Andre well Andrew I know that was not Financial advice but I do appreciate the advice that you just gave me financially uh last public stock we talked about I think was Weight Watchers and like there was definitely a correlation from when the episode aired and when the stock I don't know if it was causation but there was definitely correlation uh I wonder if that's going to happen here you said the downside is like you have this Bitcoin mining um free cash flow priced very fairly right you said like 3x free cash flow basically is the price and then the upside is if they make this AI switch one question you said they it sounds like they're not huge super clusters so oh no they they are huge so they have a massive they have a massive site in Texas that they're working on building now here's here's the the probably the reason why it's trading lower is these profits do not just go to investors they are almost all being pounded back into building up these data centers so if for some reason compute stops mattering or you know we move to distributed inference or something like that there's definitely a downside scenario which is why I'd say think about this cautiously don't put your entire portfolio in it but I look at it as it's like a good one to five% position I need to look into it that's not how I roll obviously but it was compelling and I I'm fascinated by their entrepreneurial story I'm amazed how this was just launched in 2018 and how fast they grew how much financing did they raise I don't know how much they've raised but I do know that they have no debt which is quite impressive for a business like this they have they have a lot of uh a lot of interest in retail like a lot of retail buyers in the public market and so they've been every time they need to expand they do what's called an at the market raise so they basically just issue stock into the market and then they raise Capital to do it that way um but the I mean the way they die would be big amounts of debt so they're avoiding that I think well I forget what that online stock market Club is that like Bill akman and all these billionaires are part of where they got to pitch their stock and they have to make a compelling argument and it's like really hard to get into this is like if that and beavon Butthead had a baby that's what this is right now have you ever been to se it's a s conference right that's what you're talking about no yeah that's what I'm talking about is is it online or or uh in person I've always wanted to go but it's un ordeal to go maybe this was your audition tape yeah there you go what do you think of it Sean I mean I I don't know anything about this company I've never heard of Iran until Andrew talked about five minutes ago but I like the I mean problem is Andrew is very persuasive this is also the problem with me I can talk myself into anything that doesn't mean it was a good idea and I I have done that to myself many times um and so you have to be careful uh I apply basically a discount factors like a Charisma discount so the more persuasive somebody is about everything the more I have to Discount to some degree that doesn't mean I just like throw it away right uh but I have to be careful not to get overly excited and then the opposite is true in the other case like uh when somebody's got like the David Blaine dead pan delivery of everything and then they're saying something that sounds exciting I'm like wait if that sounds exciting coming from you that means it must be 10 times more exciting than you're actually giving it there actually like an amplifier there so got to be a little bit careful this is why whenever I read Malcolm Gladwell books I have to be like wait this is just a theory this is just a theory like this is not a fact necessarily uh that's a that's pretty funny what did you call that the charisma the what the Charisma discount yeah that's pretty awesome yeah like our friend Jack Smith whenever he tells me something he'll be like yeah it's pretty cool I I think I like this I'm like do you love this yeah I think I love it then I'm like all right I'm in there's some people who pretty good means it's incredible and there's other people who are like oh it's the [ __ ] best and that just means it's just another thing that they're that they're doing you know it doesn't mean anything right you have to like uh you know it's like an audio mixer has to turn some people's levels down and turn some other people's levels up on their microphone you know are you guys tracking those stock stock uh you guys did that like investment episode maybe like six months ago and yeah TKO versus Ferrari uh TKO won I believe Sean I I think yeah it's up like 19% I think since we did that episode so you know that one did pretty well but I mean it was funny that we did a a stock picking episode just stock stock aooa and like we just didn't just say the word Nvidia and then stop the recording because that would have been that would have been sufficient and like it was pretty obvious and in our face but like when you try to be smart and make good content that doesn't mean you're necessarily actually making the best advice this this my fear of uh all all YouTube doctors by the way and I I like hberman I like AA I like all I like them but also they're content creators now first and so you again you have to apply the discount factor which is that their job is every week to come up with new things to say that doesn't mean that I'm not saying they're wrong either it's just that the best advice might have been you know five minutes long long said once and never you know or just repeated 15 times would it probably be more helpful than listening to the 3our podcast about how like you know getting UVB rays in your ears in the mornings is going to help you right like those might not be the things that actually will help anybody at this point but that doesn't make for good content and so whenever somebody's primary job is content and I say this as somebody whose primary job is content you have to like remember that before you before you you know uh get totally hooked and listen to everything that they say this is the thing I remember in 2013 or something I'd sold a business I was sitting on like seven or eight million of cash and I was like okay I need to invest this and I read this Tony Robbins book I'm not a big Tony Robbins person but he had that money I think it was called money mastering the game or something and basically the whole book is just like by index fund and I I have this disease and I think most entrepreneurs do where they say well that's the obvious thing that's for the normies I'm going to go find door number three and I look back like I read Chip War which is like all about semiconductors I knew that Nvidia was an amazing business tsmc was an amazing business I saw Facebook trading at five times earnings but it's like I have a really hard time going through door number one and I think going forward I want to be more I just want to do the thing that makes sense and is obvious and then forget about it and stop trying to be clever this is actually an instance of me trying to be clever what did you want to invest in and then you look back and you're like oo dodged a bullet on that one oh um basically where was the where was the obvious thing the wrong answer yeah because it won't be the right answer 100% of the time Nvidia was a it's yeah Nvidia Facebook you look back and you think I should have known better but where was it the opposite I don't think I've ever really messed up on the one that's obvious that slaps me in the face and I don't like I'm actually really decisive when I see that but it's interesting it mostly happens for for me in private businesses I think that's where my decision making is usually the strongest because I usually do what's obvious and will work for sure um but in public markets it's very easy to get excited have you had one Sean where you're like uh I almost did this and God I'm thankful I didn't well I've had a a bunch of those but is it specifically it was like an obvious kind of seemed pretty straightforward but it was a mistake oh I have one so so um my first designer was this guy named Adam and he's just the best the best dude like he was one of our designers but also like a great friend and he went off he left after a couple years at metalab and he started this company called bench and so he comes to me and he's like hey we're doing you know basically AI accounting 10 years early and I loved him I loved his co-founder I loved the idea but I looked at it and I was like oh it's a Services business for accounting and low margin and this is going to be hard so I didn't invest and for the next 10 years I felt like an idiot because over and over and over again I'd see these big series a series B Bane Capital buys them for you know huge amount of money or whatever um but it turned out that when Bane invested I don't think they got any money off the table nor would I as a shareholder and it I I think a lot of people saw this but he just posted a a big post on LinkedIn about how the business basically went to zero and shut down overnight and was a total disaster and that's an example of one where I was like man I wish I so badly wanted to be part of that business and I would kick myself for years and then in the end I'm like really glad that I didn't invest in it well I first want to coign what Andrew said I think uh you know I have meddled in the overthinking Olympics many times and I and more than anything the reminder is to do exactly what Andrew is saying which is like stop trying to be clever and just simply ask like what's the obvious here what's the obvious move here what's the obvious answer here and if there's not obvious answer is just move on like you don't have to do anything uh no action is required in most situations and um I'm struggling to come up with a time just like Andrew I'm struggling to come up with a time where there was a obvious thing staring at me that I did and it turned out wrong which almost just reinforces even more how hard that is whereas the opposite if you said hey tell me a time where you kind of thought you got a little cute you tried to be clever and it didn't work out your buddy text Ted you at 11:00 at night and said hey round's closing tomorrow and these 10 cool people are in and it's this really cool founder I can't even blame anyone it's even simpler than that it's I was a believer in crypto early Sam I was talking to you about crypto early for a long time and then one year last year the year before something like that where crypto had a dip I was like I'm a tax loss Harvest so clever you know what I could do I could sell this [ __ ] I could buy it right back I still own the thing and I booked this beautiful tax loss oh my God I am 900 IQ and I just I'm I am the guy and so then I sell the thing and I book the loss and I tell my accountant I say don't worry about this one I advised myself on this I got it and they're like okay great well make sure we have the that booked for the year and I'm like cool and then I'm like I should buy back in I was like you know but I did just read this report I think it's going to go a little lower first let me just wait just let it go a little bit lower and the stupid goddamn tax decision ended up costing me you know what probably saved me maybe I don't know hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes cost me millions of dollars in gains because I didn't just do the thing the the obvious thing was sell the thing book the loss buy it right back you're exactly where you were five minutes ago with with additional tax losses the getting C or clever was thinking you know the knife's still falling let me let it fall a little further and then it fell a little bit further and I just padded myself and I said I'm so smart I knew it was going to go down it it's going to a little bit more I was actually reading this article the other day and I saw this guy on Twitter who's got a picture of a [ __ ] cartoon and you know he said something pretty smart let me just hold on for a second let me just wait till it goes down a little bit more and then it went right back up way past where I bought and I ended up buying in at a much higher price I would have been better off doing nothing it's like U you know Ross alrick was in jail and just got freed which is I know a big day for you Sam um big day and so I'm trying to I've got to shave my legs for our first date he's walking out of prison by the way holding a plant which I love I don't know what he's just got a small house plant that he he had I guess I don't know what that is but you know everyone's like oh my God you know I'm so glad he's free must have been so tough blah blah blah and then somebody goes well government did do him a favor because he was basically forced to not sell his Bitcoin from 2011 or whatever when he was running uh you know Silk Road and Bitcoin was like you know in the dollar range to now it's $100,000 it's like yeah they also did give him a gift by not letting him sell wait is that so he still he still he owns some still I thought that Tim Draper bought it no that's what they seized presumably they didn't seize all of the Bitcoin that this guy had right like he could have had Bitcoin in multiple wallets he could have had personal Bitcoin like They seized what they got from the Silk Road that doesn't mean they had all of his crypto wallets necessarily you know how people say uh like buying a home is forced savings he uh he just had prison was his forced savings uh yeah 24-hour lockdown forced savings by friend for example I had the opportunity to invest in coinbase not super early but like let's say series A or B somewhere there and I remember doing the math and being like okay I believe in Bitcoin should I invest in coinbase the exchange or buy Bitcoin and again tried to outsmart answer should have been just do a little bit of both and let it ride and in the end I I did this analysis that showed me that you should just own the underlying asset Bitcoin it's going to grow faster than this exchange which is going to have multiple competitors their exchanges etc etc and actually I was right Bitcoin overperformed but the thing I didn't factor in was that I would have made more money had I just a done both but B coinbase you couldn't sell your shares so like bitcoin price went down you couldn't Panic sell and so the forced Savings of just being a coinbase stockholder will turned out to be more beneficial than being liquid with Bitcoin where you were now at the mercy of your own brain and U there's been you know tons of examples like this I have a good one I talked about this a little bit but metalab um back in 20 I guess it was 2012 or 2013 we designed slack and at the time slack was actually a failed gaming startup and steuart Butterfield was basically trying to do something with the remains of it and trying to build build a a chat tool and so he comes to me and he's like hey I've only got $80,000 budget for this and I was like well we normally you know this would cost quite a bit more um but we really really want to work with you we're like big fans and so he's like hey uh what if we did some stock and I'm like no no no no like you know we don't we don't like metalab would go broke if we just took stock we don't do that whatever and so I said no and my thinking was well I want to get as much cash as possible so I can invest it in my own businesses and if you think about what I was investing in at that time it was my productivity software where I lost $10 million so I instead put it into this money losing productivity software I could have made a $100 million or something crazy because it was at like a 20 million valuation at that time and it sold for 28 billion I think Salesforce that that's a good one where it's like maybe maybe obvious actually that's maybe not that obvious but it's still it's still a brutal one my most recent one is uh Justin May's true Med he was Raising for it at a I forget what it was reasonable valuation Justin's my friend I think Justin's amazing he had I thought he had too much going on and I was like no way are you g to focus on this I pass and he just told me how things are going and I'm like [ __ ] like it was so obvious you're a winner I should have just said yes I'm in in my uh my Ecom business my I brought in a friend into the business gave him Equity he um he knew Ecom much better than I did I thought okay my rate of learning is gonna go up with this guy and I was so excited for this like value ad from this guy and his value ad was like he's super good at a bunch of things one of the things he's really great at is marketing so I was like okay he's gonna be so helpful with marketing and so we closed the deal signed the docs and I set up the first session I'm like oh I can't wait for this guy to come in and just spill the beans on all the secrets that I don't know and make and solve all of our marketing problems this going to be amazing and he comes in and he has that first first session and uh instead of spilling the beans he just opens up a Google doc and he's like okay what's the best product that you sell and we were like it's this one he's like cool what's the best photo of that product we're like what do you mean he's like just like what's the best picture you have about that product and like and he puts it in the Google Doc and he's like okay if um you know like what do people say like why do people buy this and we're like well they buy it because it's great he's like yeah but like what like why do they buy it like what do they say and he writes down the Capt and then he like goes and sets up a Facebook ad of that product with that picture with that line of like what people say and he's like cool let this run for like the next three months and so then he so that becomes our top performing ad it took him five seconds and I'm like okay that was cool um but like surely there's more and so nine months go by and I hit him up and I'm like dude you're my great friend and I was so excited for you to be in this thing but like honestly I feel a little disappoint like feel like you could have done more I feel like the expectation was you're going to do more you know like and he's like oh I did so much and I was like wait what do you mean like what did you do like where's the list of like what what do you mean what when you're saying you did so much I'm saying you didn't do enough what's the Gap and he was like oh I I stopped you from doing all the dumb things he's like I didn't do extra things he's like remember when you got really excited about influencer marketing I was like oh yeah that was awesome I read this article and I met this guy who was crushing with influence marketing I wanted to go all in on influencer marketing he's like yeah remember I just told you like hey Facebook's working like uh just keep that going like don't it have you run into a wall with Facebook no all right then let's just keep doing that don't get distracted and he's like that's what I did he like the second thing you wanted to expand your products and like actually I just stopped you from doing that then you had this genius idea to go subscription and I told you really like hey like this thing's working so let's just keep doing the obvious thing here and just keep it going and basically he laid out like four or five things that were all just simply like him taking the knife out of my hand as have a toddler and preventing me from stabbing myself and he was like those were all super important moments that like this business would have gone a different way and I was like I don't know if you just Jedi Mind tricked me into believing that you added a ton of value or you actually just said something very very insightful to me and I I landed of I think he's actually very very insightful and that that is one of the best ways to help someone is to just simply prevent them from hurting themselves rather than solve their problems for them or give them some new tool that they've never seen before will solve all their problems well this is I love investing in private markets right to Sam's Point about houses being forced savings with a a private business there's so many of our businesses that I've owned where if I could press a red button like a sell button just just any given day because I read something or I'm paranoid or whatever I would have way way less wealth because I would have panicked over and over and over again and when I look at my public track Public Market track record I've actually had the right call over and over and over again but then sold way too quick like I bought Chipotle stock when they had that Health crisis I doubled and then I just sold right I could have made way more money same with meta all these other things so I think that having a psychological lock in creates uh a really positive thing for people like us who are impulsive there was a guy at the event we just threw and it was like everybody was giving their claim to fame it's like okay this guy built this thing he's been spent 20 years building this he's been grinding every day and he built this Empire and then this guy he's building this this Empire Jimmy's building this YouTube Empire and then this chocolate Empire on top of it everybody's just like go go go go go try to figure it out and then there was one guy there and it was like yeah he's one of the most successful investors in the world he invested in all five of elon's companies at the first round and didn't sell and it was like that's one way to do it it's like identify the best operator in the world or one of somebody who you think is just like absolutely brilliant and obsessed invest in all their things don't try to judge Rockets are going to fail but this is going to work just invest in the jockey was it Antonio no I can't say the name but um one of the wealthier people there in a room of the wealthiest people in America some of and someone was like what do you do he goes um I'm like uh the CEO of my kids right now like I dedicate my life to my children and um like you guys work 16 hours a day on making money I work 16 hours a day on making my kids like happy and healthy and making sure they're well loved and all this other stuff and I was like you're the greatest person I've ever met yeah and he had that like simp it's not the right way to describe it but like a simplon mindset like the midwit thing but like where it was like this seems simpler I'll go that route whereas many other people refuse to sit still and and and stay the course what's the quota Pascal all of man's misery arises from inability AB ility to sit quietly in a room you know this guy did not suffer from that um guys this is awesome I could keep going great I just I'm happy you're well Andrew yeah yeah it's great to see you guys I gotta come back soon that was fun all right thank you that's it that's the pod [Music] [Music]

today I'm going to tell you about seven strangers who made the greatest investment of all [Music] time Sam I'm just going to put my finger to your lips and just say let me cook here because I got something for you I'm just going to I'm going to take you down a road here all right so I've been down this Rabbit Hole dude for the last I want to call it six hours preparing for this podcast because I just got obsessed with the random story and lore of the first people that invested in Google this is crazy so this is the story of all the people who invested early at Google and the the lessons from this are not about investing in Google this was like you know 20 years ago but how crazy the world of Angel Investing is and how much you can almost create your own luck and I want to show you how these people created their own luck step by step so first let me show you something all right Sam check this out do you recognize this building just probably something in Downtown Palo what you're looking at is 165 University Avenue also known as the lucky office also known as the karma building uh you might recognize a little better here when you see one of the companies that was started here so Google was started here before Google was started there PayPal was started there before PayPal was started there Logitech was started there after Google was started there a company called danger rest started there sold for 500 million to Microsoft by the guy who created Android right after that this office is legendary who's in there now well it's had a little bit of a cold streak recently and um it's kind of like Ed Sheran says Ed Sheran believes that rooms have songs and he's like once a studio has been mined by like four or five great artists it loses its magic it's there's no more songs left in the room that's kind of what's happened to this office now hey let's take a quick break to talk about our sponsor today HubSpot has put together a list of 200 AI business ideas these are business ideas that you could create using Ai and it's a list of 200 they did a huge brainstorm so you could check it out if you just click the link below you can get access to these 200 AI ideas uh I'll give you an example of a couple of them one of them is you could build an AI dressing room so let's say you go to an e-commerce site and you want to see what something would look like on you you could use AI to actually take a picture of you and show you what the clothes would look like on you or what the makeup would look like on your face it's pretty cool right um or AI tools for real estate brokers maybe something that takes their listings and makes them more more fancy more more more beautiful and attract more buyers so check it out it's a brainstorm of 200 possible AI ideas brought to you by HubSpot you can get it for free in the link below all right I want to take you through the first few people that invested in Google and how it happened do you recognize this guy here do you recognize either of these two guys the guy on the left is Sergey he's one of the found is that Sergey or the other guy Larry yeah that's Sergey Sergey and the guy on the right is that Eric Schmidt it's not Eric Schmidt it is a guy named Andy beckstein does that name sound familiar no maybe if you just look at these murdered out guys from yeah these murdered out red Corvettes from the early 90s here this might ring a bell or two what you're looking at are some of the ogs of Silicon Valley these are the founders of sun micr systems do you know what Sun Microsystems did it was one of the first uh big companies was it making microchips workstations computers basically okay and they made their own chips also they ended up making chips they ended up making their own operating system they ended up doing a lot of things these guys were like the OG's of the OG that first guy the Indian guy that's venod kosla so that's venod venod kosla there's Bill Joy there's Andy and then there's Scott mcney all right so these are the four founders of sun dude by the way for the record they look dope they look dope as hell the and Corvette and the flex that doesn't exist anymore and I think it's fantastic I think this is great first of all they're all on cell phones guess what cell phones hadn't been invented yet so I don't even know what they're holding there're there's like a corded phone that's running into their car with the little you know like the spiral cord anyways these guys are awesome so Andy wakes up one morning and he's got an email in his inbox and it's from two Stanford students Larry and Sergey the founders of Google and they're pitching him uh on an idea for a new kind of search engine you know the way that search engines worked at the time was there were these uh as geves there was altav Vista there was Yahoo and all of these companies back in the early 990s they were you know search engines that had some combination of manual curation so they had like editors picking what goes up front for people where what how do you find what you find or you would search and it would just try to match the words that you're typing to the website and these two PhD students said hey we have a new way of doing this it's called pay rink and what pay rink does is it basically says this genius Insight the genius Insight was of Google was that instead of just showing you what our editors say is the right answer when you search for murdered out Red Corvette instead of s just giving you a a word batch for it we're going to show you a link to the website that other people are linking to social proof right so if other websites are linking to your website that means your website's probably pretty good and the more important those websites are so like let's say the Wall Street Journal links to you that matters more than if Sean's website links to you and they had this Insight that they could create better search results this way they said we'd like to show you and so he says I'll see you tomorrow morning 8: a.m. he sees them they pull up in a parking lot he's in his uh the story says Porsche so maybe one of these is a Porsche one of those is a Porsche okay great so as you can tell I'm a car guy one of those is a por that's Andy's car Larry and serus show up they have a little laptop and they are trying to show him a demo of Google and they show him they say search for something he searches for something and the results come up and it's magic the results are way better than you would get out of a traditional search engine and they start telling them their their thesis and what they're going to do and how they're having they're thinking about raising money to to go actually turn this into a company and he says guys there's a lot of things we could talk about right now but I think it's easier if I just give you money and he goes back to his Porsche and he comes back with a checkbook he writes them a check for $100,000 and he writes it out to Google Inc and they're like Google uh they're like hey uh we haven't even Incorporated the company yet and he goes doesn't matter and they go but what about valuation he goes guys this is the best idea I've ever seen take the money start building and he leaves he gets back in his Porsche he drives away and he doesn't even know how much of the company he's just bought because he didn't even agree on evaluation a number of share price none of that he invests the money he walks away he invests at a $10 million valuation Google today is like multiple trillion dollars right so he owns 2% he owns 2% of this company he doesn't even realize this at the time because they haven't decided on evaluation and he's so excited about this company and uh if you remember the four levels of luck he's basically has that luck uh favors the prepared mind he knew when he saw this company that this was he goes this is the greatest idea I've ever seen and um and this is the guy who created son at at the time he's the he's like the man right this is like if Elon saw something and invested in a company he's like no this is the best product I've ever seen and this is the guy that made Tesla and uh you know SpaceX and building Rockets he's like no no no this is the [ __ ] so Andy does that and he's so excited he goes and he tells the next guy in our story and this is the next guy do you know who David sherian is he's another OG like Cisco or something like that or Z one of these like big things that I don't even know what they do but they have a huge building Arista Network he also invested in I think VMware that sold to Cisco for $700 million so I I took the screenshot off of Google it says the quiet billionaire oh I forgot to say Andy's nickname is the Golden Boy well David sheron's nickname was he was the billionaire Professor this guy's a professor on at um at Stanford but he's super wealthy like a multi-billionaire he's also on many lists as the cheapest billionaire as the top 10 cheapest or most frugal billionair you'll ever meet uh a little quote from him on it they were like dude you're a billionaire why don't you like you ride your bike everywhere you don't even have like a fancy car you still live in This Old House that you lived in before you got rich what's the deal and he goes honestly I kind of hate the idea of living like a billionaire he goes I'm actually pretty offended by that sort of thing you know the type of people that live in houses with bathrooms and so on something's wrong with those people and this is David Shan he gives away tons of money so he's giving away you know tens of millions of dollars to universities to schools to education to philanthropy but he himself just rides around like a doofus with a bike helmet and on his old bike and he just that's how he lives his life and he's great so can can we just say really quick that the professor billionaire type I think of all the billionaires they might be one of the best maybe your favorite I think I thought I thought criminal billionaire like Silk Road type [ __ ] was those are cool but they're not aspirational like I would to be friends with them but like the aspirational one is the professor billionaire you know the guy who started renissance the big hedge fund Professor billionaire Ed Thorp uh was a professor billionaire those are the best billionaires but what about I thought you love like the just the ruthless tycoons the I like reading about them they're fun to read about they've got great stories but if you could be anyone you you the professor billionaire is great so Andy tells David Chan he goes hey you got to talk to these guys there at Stanford he starts uh he meets the guys he also writes a check in the same round again like1 $150,000 so he he puts it in okay so now and was he a billionaire when he made that deal or was he just successful not a billionaire but successful he had started a company called Granite system he had uh and eventually he does create Arisa networks which is a a multi-billion dollar company but at the time was like you know let's call it probably had tens of millions of dollars and he is really rich now I just Googled them holy crap yeah like 10 billion plus right 20 billion like closer like really rich like top 100 Rich yeah he's him and Andy both of them they they both are now so uh he this guy's made this guy ended up making over a billion dollars just off his Google Shares okay so he meets David now who's the next person that finds out about this little little company called Google that's started by these two students uh on campus well David goes to a holiday party and at the Holiday party he meets another person do you know who this guy is yeah Ron Conway Ron Conway this is going to be a little bit of a long session because Ron Conway is a goddamn Legend and I kind of knew Ron Conway was the man I've actually met Ron Conway before and I just he just has this presence he got a bit of an aura about him but do he like a forgetful Professor type cuz like where he's like always taking notes and he's like always moving and doing stuff and he forgets stuff that he's always taking notes so like this picture he's got this leg yellow legal pad when I met him he also had the yellow legal pad and he was furiously writing notes and we were just at like a lunch uh we were at like a lunch with the mayor and he was just writing like copious amounts of notes and he was just like always on the move he was moving and uh if somebody asked him a question he would just somebody came to introduce themselves he's like how can I help you do what you're doing and he was just like get to the ask like what's your ask if I could do it I'm going to do it and then he would jot down a note on his yellow legal pet cool I'll make that introduction and like literally like seven minutes later the introduction was made like this guy moves at a different speed you know like in the Mafia When The Godfather has a wedding his daughter's wedding everyone in town can come and ask him one favor he's like that every day exactly I you said is he also like the forgetful Professor I think he's more like he's more like Santa Claus he's he's St Nick he's like St Nick after with like a Triple Espresso and so he's just moving so okay so Ron con goes to this holiday party and the way he tells the story is he goes uh I get to this party and I'm in a tuxedo and I godamn I hate being at a tuxedo I'm so uncomfortable and I just see uh I see David there uh he's also in a tuxedo and I go up to him and I go David let's talk about something else because I'm so uncomfortable with this tuxedo right now and he go David had invested in in his fund and he goes David the deal is you invest in this fund cool I'll invest your money but you got to be telling me what you're seeing and like you got to be my eyes and ears on the ground he goes David what are you seeing at Stanford what's exciting right now he goes oh I just I just invested in these um two PhD students that are doing the search engine thing and he had invested in ASG so he knew okay um search engines big deal if somebody says there's a new search Eng that's better than ches I got I'm interested I want to check it out so he asked David can you arrange for a meeting and he tries to get this meeting and he kind of fails they they're like um they're busy they're like look we're not taking Angel Investors we want VCS but they go but but maybe you can actually help us uh get a VC was Ron a legend then or a legend in the making legend in the making got it all you do you want you want the quick backstory on Ron that's pretty insane yeah all right so he uh Ron Conway starts off as an entrepreneur he starts this thing company called Altos Computing so he's also making computers like sun and he ends up taking it public and then they get their ass kicked the personal computer comes out the PC and the PC starts kicking their ass they end up selling the company but they do well and his early investor was Sequoia so he goes to Don Valentine who's like the guy who created yeah the OG of OG investors and and Don's like all right Ron what do you want to do next what's the next company you're going to start he goes honestly I never want want to manage a th000 people again that was that was a nightmare I don't know what I want to do but that's not it and he goes uh that's a bummer like you know my My Hope was you're ready to start a new company and I was ready to write the check but if not maybe you'd be a good investor how about I recruit you to sequ why don't you come follow me around for a couple weeks see if you like this investing thing so he follows Don follows Don around and he's like hey this is he goes hey I think you could be pretty great at this but you know what you should do you should do this thing called Angel Investing it's a new thing and Angel Investing at the time was actually a term from Hollywood it was about investing in movies I think they called it super angel or something wasn't it like even like a different term he became a Super Angel but like it started with just Angel Investing he goes you know what you don't even have to start your own VC fund you could just invest your own money just Small Checks 10 20K checks and then hey when you see something cool you bring it to me it's sequa right and so he tells him you should go do this and Ron decides all right I'm going to start Angel Investing and basically he he starts Angel Investing his own money very quickly he decides he's he's like I made one great decision in my life and it's in 1994 he's like all right I could just be an investor he's like but if I if I'm competing competing against guys like Don I have no Advantage right they've been doing this they're just more skilled more experienced than me they have a better brand than me and um they just know that game inside and out he goes but what can I do to differentiate he goes well what if I actually just start investing what if I pick a niche and he goes the and so Don's like okay is your Niche going to be like Hardware computers just like you just did with your company he goes no all I know is I hate Hardware so what's the opposite of Hardware software what's this new thing the internet and at this time by the way the browser hadn't even been invented like Mark andri is still a student at University of Illinois he had even graduated yet but he's like I think there's this thing software we needed it for our computer for our hardware and there's this new thing called the internet [ __ ] it I'm all in on the internet and he just decides he's like look it's a thing that's at zero so he goes the beautiful thing is there are no experts so I can't be behind because this thing just started so I'm going to go in this thing at zero and I'm going to get to watch it grow and by the time you know this thing's four years five years in I'll be the expert and he goes That's the greatest decision I ever made in my life and he goes by the way it's now 2025 I'm still Allin on the internet he's like I this this thing I I thought this thing was small then he goes I still think it's early days and so he he goes all on the internet now around 1999 he's been Angel Investing he raises a fund he raises a fund for $25 million from other people to be uh the Silicon Valley you know Angel Investing fund uh SV Angel if you've heard of it and actually at the time it was called something else Angel Investments or something like that but he decides I'm going to invest in silic value companies he raised $25 million the boom hits it's getting hot he raises the next year another 175 million and his his approach is just spray and prey he's investing in anything and everything that he sees and so he's made like 250 Investments by the time the dotom bubble bursts and when it bursts he's like oh [ __ ] and they go to him his his he's only working with like four or five guys and they're like hey what's our strategy like the Market's crashing goes our strategy is we don't invest anymore like our strategy is I think it's over I don't know I don't know what to do like there's just no there's nothing to invest in now and so um he's he's like but my hope is that one of these deals that we did early on is a winner and basically what he says is that when that.com Bubble Burst 80% of our companies just went to zero but luckily he had Google and he had invested in Google along the way and Google carried him okay so how did he end up investing in Google because remember they didn't want an angel investor they wanted an institution well the thing about Ron Conway is that Ron Conway is known for being just extremely generous so even if he's not going to invest in the deal he's just like I'm going to help the founder and he his philosophy was and a lot of people say this but he actually did it his philosophy was all I do is I am in service of the founder I'm just going to help as many Founders as I can and money will be the byproduct like money has to come if I help enough great Founders money has to show up and um Paul Graham basically calls us the the Ron co-principal and he goes Paul Graham describes us he goes I he goes I noticed what Ron Conway goes I've never heard one instance of Ron Conway Behaving Badly to any founder and that's incredible because this guy's invested in like thousands of companies he in fact I went looking for examples has anyone had an experience where Ron Conway treated you poorly or didn't act in your best interest he goes and instead I just got this outpouring of people be like no you know what he had nothing to gain from a situation and he just went above and beyond and he goes so Paul Graham hears this and says you know what actually maybe there's something to this actually I've heard about a couple other investors that are like this and he goes maybe this is not just like a a funky coincidence maybe this is a bit of a strategy which is uh so much of Angel Investing is getting invited into deals and if your reputation is just one where you just always act benevolently then it it's actually not just like an act of generosity or charity you're actually building a reputation that's going to get you into the next deal the next deal the next deal and that's exactly what happened here and so Ron Conway who by the way just side note go to SV Angel's website if you were trying to research this company what would you what would you pay attention to uh which companies they invested in and what do you see there uh Pinterest coinbase Facebook open AI Snapchat Twitter Rippling Reddit OCTA anthropic Square every hit company is on this list every hit silica Valley company is on this list Paul Graham when he Airbnb brex checker everything ever like literally every company Paul grab did a talk where he interviewed Ron Conway and he goes all right uh if you need to remember one thing from this I'm going to say a bunch of words but just remember this one one sentence Ron Conway is the man he goes I was going to do an intro talking about the hit companies you've invested in and then I realized it's actually shorter to to write down a list of the hit Silicon Valley companies that you missed and he had three it was like he missed Salesforce he missed uh Kickstarter and he missed um one more I forgot what which what it is and he's like it's insane the number of hits that you've invested in and he goes um and the funny thing is that Ron doesn't even spend like uh I don't know if you know about his like investing style but it's exactly the same as YC which I find fascinating which is why he just like $100,000 into every single thing he meets you and in 10 minutes he makes a decision and he Ron says it's usually three to five minutes and he'll just decide on on the spot in three to five minutes YC has a 10-minute interview and then they make their entire decision off 10 minutes so the two best Pickers the two best angel investors in the history of Silicon Valley both make all of their decisions in under 10 minutes isn't that insane and so how much does he invest initially he was investing like you know 25k and then it became 100K and then it became 250k I'm not sure if that strategy would work now because there's so because I think that then in the 2000s and '90s and things like that there if you had the gumption to be one of the people who like threw your hat and like got a meeting and did this I think that because the barrier to entry was high because there was a higher ratio of like freaks doing this [ __ ] you know now it's because it's like cool that there's a lot more noise but I don't so I don't know if that would work now let's look at their list here anthropic that's recent open AI That's recent hugging face that's recent right like these are the big if I said one of the best companies in the last four years you know that to be invested in open AI anthropic hugging face like these would be in that list you know he's in UDA swap it which is was the big one in the crypto phase like you know five years ago or whatever so I think this still works but the trick to making it work is not just that they make snap decisions right like his decision uh you know his process was basically they're like What's your thesis he goes I had no thesis he goes I went into Angel Investing when there wasn't even really a word he goes there was no thesis that you could have at the time I just all right the internet's cool and then he's like I he goes I I realized one mistake pretty quickly which was that the more I try to judge a you meet a founder and they have a idea they have a personality and then there's a market and basically if you try to blend those together you try to make a decision off the the mix of the idea the founder and the market you lose if you love the founder but you hate the idea you also lose he goes Airbnb I didn't love the idea but I love the founders so what does he pick one of those three or just the person he's just like I just picked the founder he goes and I what I do is I's like I'm just going to invest in the founder it's the Founder's job to figure out the idea and they'll change they often they change the idea and he goes and by the way I'm not just investing in this founder for this company I'm investing in this founder for life because he goes I realized that the best Founders start multiple companies so for example he put one of his F first uh employees at when he started doing this was his son Topher and his son's 13 years old and his son makes his first investment at 13 in a little company called Napster and he's like oh I heard about Napster but I don't know about this [ __ ] Topher go use this thing and tell me if it's amazing Topher comes back the next day he's like Dad this is the craziest thing I've ever seen I can get any song I can download anything this is changing the game I'm downloading bits of the song from other people around the world it's the like this this mind-blowing this decentralized thing and he's like cool all right let's go invest in this thing he goes and he meets the founders or he had already met the founders that was his diligence and he invests in Shawn Parker and Sean Fanning and he's like cool anything you guys do from here on out I'm in and so Napster didn't work out but Shan Fanning's fourth or fifth company ended up being a hit Napster didn't work out but Shawn Parker's next company was Facebook and he's like I totally didn't get Facebook I didn't know how social networks would make any money it seemed like college kids you know posting pictures of their drunk you know escapades like didn't seem like somebody was going to be money but Sean Parker's in and I just I've decided Sean Parker's a Founder that I wanted back and so I invest in Facebook too all right so bringing it back to Google all right so bring it back to Google he goes to the Google guys they're like hey we want a VC but they're like all right we will let you in if you can go get us tooya because Paul Graham asked him they go he goes you know when you invest in Google did you know like this is a huge company there's going to be like an alltime company he goes you know you could never think of a company as like a trillion dollar company he goes but I did think it was going to be really really big and I went all in trying to get this investment and he goes why'd you go all in and he goes well because they had three things he goes first super smart Geeks that's criteria one two really determined three do they do something that surprises me for example they're really smart Geeks but they're also really charismatic or they're really he goes but that wasn't the case for them it wasn't the case for Zuck that they were really charismatic he goes with Zuck it was that um early on he was talking to me about like getting into getting 300 million users and he's like no service had 300 million users so the fact that Zuck had figured out like yeah we're going to connect everybody and he's like oh [ __ ] okay just the fact that this guy is saying things like that is a level of ambition that's not really you know Common and guess what I wasn't surprised when he turned down a billion dollars from Yahoo because all he wanted to do was rifle focus on a product that would actually reach everybody so with Google he goes they were super strategic they he goes they they told me they go you can you can be in if you want if you can get Sequoia he goes okay uh that's great se's great but why seoa they go not just seoa we need Mike Moritz he goes okay Mike's great but why Mike and he go because Mike is on the board of Yahoo and what we're going to do is we're going to build the best search engine and right now Yahoo has a deal with Alta Vista ala Powers all of their search so we want to cut two Mega deals we want to be the default search engine on Yahoo and once we convince Mike Morris say this is awesome he's on the board of Yahoo he'll get us the meeting and then we want to do the same thing with AOL do they have like a product at this point they had a product they had users and and he talks about that he's like you know basically he's like I saw the searches the results were better and they had early users that were like the people who used it used it all the time so it wasn't like they had a ton of users but it's same thing as Facebook the people people who used it used it like crazy and so he and so they go we want seoa and we want kleer Perkins he goes well you know you could have either or they don't usually like to do deals together he goes we want seoa and we want Kleiner Perkins because Kleiner Perkins John door is on the board of AOL or has a relationship with AOL we need that deal too so they were cocky and smart and strategic yeah they they knew what they needed and they were like we're going to it's like an algorithm it's like that's the output we need so then we need to find the path to that well I I I I've read uh stories of them the Sergey and Larry retelling the story and they were like we were full of ourselves we thought we were the best and we were pretty good and we and we acted like it well there's stories of both right at one point they tried before this they tried to sell the tech for a million yeah and uh this is when they were like it's just an algorithm and then they had sort of gotten bigger and bigger so anyways so he goes um so he goes I basically so from the time that that guy David Shon tells about this company at uh at this holiday party he goes I called them for 5 months straight every month I called them and finally I got my audition and at that audition they go you're in if you can get seoa so he starts working the phones he gets them a meeting seoa is in and kleinet Perkins is in oh actually there's one little thing before that he goes hey guys I'll lead this myself $10 million and they go no we don't want you and he goes okay fine I'll go get you SEO so he goes and he gets him SEO and client percus but they're negotiating they both want to do the deal they both want to do the deal at unprecedented numbers they're trying to do it at like a 7 $5 million valuation which at the time was like bananas to do a $75 million valuation but they they they believe that search was already like a big deal and they thought this was the new search thing but they can't agree who's going to get the deal they don't want to share it and Larry and Sergey get frust after a month of back and forth to lar and C are like dude forget this we don't want to be fundraising Ron you said that you would do this thing 10 million yourself uh was that [ __ ] or is that real he go they go you said you could make that happen Could you actually make that happen he goes I can make happen this is Friday he goes I'll have it by Monday if you want it and they go um all right that's all we want he goes but honestly guys do you want do you want that or do you want them to share the deal they go our first choice we want them to share the deal but if if they can't get their [ __ ] together we'll do it with you and again Ron conre badly wants this deal but he he does what polyram calls the most generous act in the history of Silicon Valley he calls seoa he calls Clin Perkins he goes guys um they're not bluffing if you don't have this thing done by Monday they're doing a deal with me to do all 10 million but they want this with you guys that's what they truly want you guys got to figure this [ __ ] out by Saturday morning they've agreed we're going to do this and they carve out Ron a little allocation because he put that deal together yeah he he he gets the 250k so that's how Ron Conway gets in on this deal one last little Ron Conway thing because I just you said something about like Mafia and um here's Ben Horowitz from from Andre Horowitz Des he wrote a whole block post called Ron and in the blog post about Ron he says Ron is not an investor Ron runs a network and in Ron's Network everybody who's a node knows you are important and there's a certain code of behavior that you have to have he goes to get into the network you must have a relationship with Ron no I say relationship that means not not just I've met or I know more on this later he goes two you must answer when called Ron makes sure that his Network matters because he demands extreme reliability if he calls you to participate you must participate when called upon and he goes three that keeps you in what I call good standing with Ron which is you must remain in good standing with Ron to remain in the network if you do not act when called upon or you do not act well in terms of you have some kind of bad behavior with Founders Ron will light you up and take your ass out of the network and he goes no matter what deal you're in it is more costly to be out of Ron's Network than it is to you know try to get get one up and because of that he is ensured that Silicon Valley works so people like this guy that much huh all right listen to this story so Alfred Lynn who ends up have you ever heard that name Alfred Lynn before Zappos zapo yeah he he ends up being like the number two guy at like Ron did invest in our company early on and they're like we we had this deal if with this big company this Fortune 50 company it fell apart and like there was no way if we lost this deal the company's dead so he goes I didn't know Ron at the time and his investment was really small which is why we hadn't reached out to him yet we first went to our big investors but we struck out so he goes we had nothing to lose at this point so at 11: p.m. I wrote Ron an email that said hey you don't really know me but I'm an executive at a company you're investor in and we need a meeting in person with the CEO of this Fortune 5050 company we need the meeting this week and if you can't make it happen hey that's totally okay I understand but we may be going down and I'm sorry he goes he goes two minutes later this is 11: p.m. two minutes later Ron writes back in a way that I now have learned is Ron style it's immediate email short and it's all caps am on it all caps by the next morning Ron had done it we got an 8figure contract with that company that led to a nine figure contract all because of this desperate email and eventually our company got acquired for 800 million we were on the brink of death Ron didn't know us from Sam and he saved our ass dude the takeaway from all of this San Francisco is amazing now it's cool to [ __ ] on it because it is very frustrating it's a very I've lived there for 10 years it's super frustrating but I have missed out so much not being there and just like what people don't realize is San Francisco's only like what 800,000 people and if I had a guess Ron Conway lives in like Pacific Heights Marina area and just like walking around that area you feel it and you hear these like weird conversations and just being able to email someone and just be like I'll meet you at the coffee shop five blocks away that's special man just these types of interactions are special so check this out so you said like I don't know if that approach would work because now there's so many more companies and that at the time when there's very few people starting companies that might have worked so they asked him this was kind of like when he was in his Peak uh investing uh time they go so how do you invest he goes I only take meetings that come from my network so he goes I will get five pitches a day so I see 30 a week 30 deals counted by desk a week every single one is from a referral of a founder or investor that I know well that knows me and knows what to refer to me he goes I will invest in one out of 30 every single week he goes of the five that I get per day I'll turn down two or three just via email no phone call the rest we'll invest in and I'll invest in I'll make my decision within five minutes of talking to the founder they go well what are you looking for in that founder he goes I'm looking for three things insane 24/7 desire to work he goes I could tell when I'm talking to a Founder if they wish they could just spend all of their time working on this and they view everything else in their life as like a nuisance or an obstacle in the way of doing this he goes have they warned their wife or girlfriend like hey I love you but I'm all in on this thing and I'm going to be gone and I'm going to be doing [ __ ] um and like this is this is it this is my thing and I'm doing this he goes that's the first thing I look for he goes and when I he goes if I could feel it then I know it's going to be infectious to other people cuz they're going to have to recruit badass other people it goes lastly can they communicate why this matter matters he goes you know Zuck it's not like he had like this crazy Charisma or personality but when you talk to him it's the feeling we got when amjad from repet was on the podcast where there like this it's like oh [ __ ] this is kind of bigger than I realized and this is like your life's work this is kind of this is going to change everything isn't it and they sort of distort your reality to believe that this [ __ ] is even bigger than you could ever believe next week we're going to hang out with uh with Jimmy Mr Beast and I always have this feeling every year we go to this event with him we hang out with him we stay we literally like stay at his house and when you're there it's like what he's doing is the most badass important crazy [ __ ] that any human being could be doing and then you leave and you click a video like 3 weeks later it's like these friends are putting their hand on these chocolate bars and whoever takes their hand off the last gets like half a million dollars of chocolate bars it's like wait this is just like this is kind of a dumb video but when you're there it's not a dumb video it's [ __ ] everything and he's able to like make you feel that way so that's kind of what he describes the last thing he talks about is he goes rifle focus on the product he goes I invested in square and all Jack dorsy ever wanted to talk to me about was the product he goes I invested in Twitter same thing all they talk to me about was the product I invested in uh Facebook all Zuck talk the product he goes Pinterest Pinterest I didn't really get it's like this pin board like scrapbooking I didn't really understand it because I met the founder Ben and he goes all he's talking about about this product he goes then I met his his head of product or his like kind of his one of his core guys and I met him three times and every time he was wearing the same shirt and I go hey do you wear the shirt like often he goes I wear the shirt every day and you know what the shirt is it's a shirt with a circle and just the inside is just this word focus and he goes this guy literally every day wears this shirt that just says focus in the middle of it this guy was ex Facebook and then he was at Pinterest and this guy was just absolutely obsessed with all we need to do is focus on the product Oh there's a meeting oh we got invited to speak at this event what what are you talking about I don't want to go there he because to the point of being rude these people just want to focus on the [ __ ] that they're F on their product that's it so he he did Google he broke at the deal who are the other people I next guy to who you see I see uh Shaquille O'Neal Shaq not a chance so Shaq is sitting at the that doesn't even make sense what's even famous then of course Shaq is famous this the '90s um Shaq is is an NBA star at this time Shaq is in a hotel he's in a fancy I don't know Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton sitting in the lobby and he this is sha telling the story he goes I see four distinguished gentlemen s uh in the lb this your sha voice lower let's see four guys four distinguished gentlemen he goes and what he says he goes the gentlemen don't know who I am but their kids do and their kids are like oh my God it's Shaq and they run up to him and the cool thing about Sha if You' ever seen videos of Shaq Shaq is like a giant kid he's super playful he's super good he's super good to people that see him he does he's not like one of these celebrities that's like sunglasses hat on trying to like push people away at all times getting annoyed when you get in his space and so Shaq goes I'm doing my job babysitting and so he just starts playing with the kids he's just babysitting while they're having a meeting at the end of the meeting Ron Conway comes up to Shaq and goes thank you so much for playing with my my grandkids and so so they just start chitchatting he goes yeah we were just talking about this investment that we're doing you know what you should invest in this company it's one of the best companies I've ever seen it's called Google Shaq gets a meeting with uh with with I think I think I guess it's with Larry and Sergey he goes yeah it was an accident he goes I've doing my job my babysitting and then he goes I asked him he goes I have a meeting with them sounded good I put in some money I forgot about it years later Google goes public he he doesn't even realize that he's invested in Google he reads in the newspaper that Shaq has Shaq is in the S1 Shaq going to make a killing off of this he goes I'm Shaq what and so he goes and he remembers it's and so sha turned and he's like yeah I wish I invested more Shaq turned like you know a couple hundred grand into you know 100 million plus off of his Google investment no way really no nobody knows how long he held it but uh you know it's pretty insane so Shaq is the next one do you know who this is yeah rip rip this is um I don't know actually how do you say her name do you know Susan Susan last name a Polish name wowski I forget yeah wajis I don't know what it is Susan W so Susan ends up getting in on the action early with Google but I don't know if you know the story how I know that she had a garage and they wanted to work there and did she like give them free place to stay and work there and got like a little bit more Equity yeah kind of so uh her sister an was dating Sergey and an says my boyfriend needs a office space and Susan wasn't wealthy at the time she was like a mid-level like marketing manager at some company and her and her husband had just bought this house and then uh they were feeling a bit of the pinch about like kind of the the home and they were like you know what what if we rent it out our garage so they put up an ad saying we'll rent out our garage an is like oh actually my boyfriend needs a space so the Google guys rent out her garage for $1,700 a month and they start working out of her garage and she just sees them working there day and night and she sees she she hears updates just CU she's bumping into them she quits her job she ends up employee 16 at Google and so that's how she became a billionaire was by quitting her job to go work for the company that was working out of her garage at the time and she ended up being up until recently when she passed she was the Youtube CEO exactly so she she had worked on AdWords for a bit and then when the Google she was a big advocate for like hey we should acquire uh YouTube and when they acquired YouTube they were like hey you were a big Champion for this deal she ends up becoming the CEO of YouTube for many years um before she passed away I think that sister of hers started 23 and me correct um all right this is uh do I don't think you know who this is no oh yes I do I do pair yes oh wow that's a that's a deep pull for you to know this so this is pedman um now he did not actually invest in Google so I'm cheating a little bit but this is part of you said what my takeaway is the magic of Silicon Valley here's more of the magic of Silicon Valley okay so this guy's story is crazy he um him and the other guy last name Ami I I think it's like Sam Ami or something like that amini pers two Persian guys so first persi guy starts a rug shop in Silicon Valley right in the heart of Palo Alto he's selling luxury Persian rugs and right above his uh like right next to his his rug shop there's also some office space and so he um he ends up renting out office space to the founders of I think it's uh like PayPal or something like that PayPal's early uh early uh Founders were there um there was a couple others and so he ends up uh in he's like he's selling rugs to these people he gets to know these people and then he realizes like wow Google um that like that classic gregarius uh like immigrant or Persian guy like hey my friend come here come here come here my friend exactly you want some tea let's have some tea and they have tea tell me about yourself tell me about yourself he becomes friends he's right next to them he's selling them rugs he's selling them Office Space but he's like dude um these companies you know made a killing and so they start taking their rug money and they start investing become Angel Investors and they don't know anything about technology really but they're like let's just invest in the people that come in to buy the rugs if they seem interesting and so how does pedman factor into this pedman cold calls this guy and he's like hey I'm coming out to silica Valley and he's like can I give a can I have a job with you and the guy's like well have you ever sold rugs before he's like no he's like have you ever sold anything before he goes no but I could learn and he goes listen man I how could I give this job to somebody who's got no no experience he's like he plays on the the Persian side and he says like how could you turn me down you haven't even met me yet just meet me and so he agrees to meet him he hires him and um so he ends up becoming uh basically like a a rug salesman for this guy and he over the next 15 years his English improves his confidence improves he becomes Aid's top rug seller in in his best year he moves $8 million worth of rugs that'se that's absolutely insane one of his first out of a out of a storefront out of a storefront paloalto and so so that's like a you know $600,000 of rugs a month or that's so many dollars wor the FR it's insane it's totally the so along the way they is what is that 20 grand a day of rugs yeah and this guy living he he comes to Sila Valley he lives in an attic above a yogurt shop and then becomes a rug salesman and that guy ends up becoming one of the greatest investors in Silicon Valley and here's his trick so he's like he he meets somebody he starts selling rugs and one of the guys who walks in is this guy Andy Ruben Andy Rubin comes in he sells him a $5,000 Persian rug and during the negotiation he's like so impressed with this guy he's like man you're a great negotiator what do you do he's like oh I'm a businessman I got this company and he's like tell me about it and he's he's got this company called danger remember I told you one of the companies in the lucky office company called danger and these guys made do you remember the T-Mobile Sidekick cell phone that's Andy Ruben made that yeah his next thing he made became Android and so Andrew Ruben's prolific and then now he's since done deep mine or some type of like no he went he went and became like the a head of mobile for like the big Chinese manufacturer or whatever and then I think now he's doing like an AI thing um so he's like and so he's talking to this guy and he goes to his uh he goes to his and he goes he goes we got to invest in this guy's company he goes cool what does it do he goes couldn't tell you it's something technology super complicated I don't know anything about it but I'm telling you we got to invest in this guy he goes he goes are you sure he goes listen if this guy was selling Red Balloons I would invest in it this guy's going to make things happen and so he goes okay they write a $400,000 check into uh into danger and along the way he ends up becoming like a partner in their investing as he makes money from his commissions he takes every dollar he has basically 200,00 ,000 and he buys into like their partnership to be investing in startups and they invest in all these different startups so he meets Joe Lonsdale no way um after he' done paler Joe's buying rugs whatever he gets introduced to him and he goes Joe I would love to show you a rug um he's like cool I'll come into the shop he goes no no no no brother let me bring the rugs to your house so he brings like a hundred rugs to Joe lonsdale's house and his trick is he's like you learn a lot about a person when you go to their house much more if you meet them for coffee or they come into your shop and at the time Joe linale would have been in his mid 20s right yeah he's very young and he goes and he meets him and he's like he's in that Persian rug game he's in that Persian rug game already and he's like he's like doing this next company adap par which by the way recently sold for a couple billion dollars and at the time he's like love this guy love adapar Joe lale we got to invest in this thing and he ends up investing in adapar he ends up investing in Dropbox because one of the co-founders of Dropbox is also Persian and so he's speaking in farsy he's like Ching him up and he's like come on please let us in he ends up doing that he ends up investing in app Loven which is now hundred billion plus company because I think the founder of App 11 might be a Persian guy right I think so too I think so yeah he's Iranian or some somewhere from that area and so there's like this whole Mafia that gets created off of this rug shop how insane is that dude do any wasp want to relate with me hey let's talk about baseball and hot dogs and cows like like where's my at dude okay I'll give you some credit you one of your best investments now is this company you told me about that I totally didn't get cuz I was like dude what are you doing you're just putting nicotine pouches in your mouth while we're doing the podcast you're like yeah I always have one in and I was like what the hell are you doing and you invested in this company called Lucy that was making like a nicotine gum or pouch at the time at the time it was a gum and it kind of just wandered around for a little while it didn't even seem like it was going to take off but now this [ __ ] is taking off dude I think Lucy is going to end up being like a 500 million or billion dollar company you invested early on in that because you were you were pouch Bros with these guys yeah I did 25 Grand into it and I um when I did it I um I was just like oh you started soilent and our mutual friend is Josh and Josh says you're you're cool and nicotine is uh addicting yeah like I guess cool sounds sounds good I'm in and so I invested $25,000 I think only had $100,000 saved up so it was like a big deal for me so hopefully and then I like messaged them and I'm like what's happened to you guys I haven't heard from you in like six years what's going on and then they recently holled at me and it turns out it's going really well yeah it's going amazing now um shout out to John cougan and and the crew there okay so let me finish off the story here did you know that Bezos invested in Google I heard that did he invest in it because he was getting a lot of traffic from it or why I'm not sure there's he's I tried to find it could not find like any of the backstory here but Basil's invested 250k pretty early in Google as well which is kind of wild it's the same way that you know Microsoft also invested in apple and kind of Saved Apple from failure at one point in time like there's these stories of these people that you think are kind of enemies or competitors but actually at at a key point in time invested in each other I just thought that was kind of kind of cool all right I want to share with you let's see do I have anything else oh there's one other hilarious story from this whole thing uh Rod Conway was like they go did you know that gole would make you know so much money it would be essentially the most profitable money best money machine man has ever made and he goes no he goes I still have Google's first slide deck 10 pages 10 slides and it was all about the product and he goes the last slide which is always like the financials and the projections it just said Thank you he's like Dude where's that where's your financial slide and they go we have no idea and he goes okay love it I'm in but how crazy is this like wild world of like meeting people at a party or the lobby of a hotel and hearing about this thing and doing this deal isn't this isn't this crazy but that's how it still is isn't it it is like it's just that you don't get out you know you still live there but you don't get out like during during the Tony Robbins episode on our pod he he has this phrase he says which is proximity Is Power and he just talks about like literally just being close to the action is is like this the most underrated thing you could do just being as close as you can to the people you want to be around to the people you want to be like because whether it's you hear a thing you meet a thing you start to do the same habits and lifestyle of those people proximity Is Power and like that's the crazy thing about silica Valley is like proximity Is Power principle I moved to where I moved because of family reasons but if I could live anywhere I think Palo would be the place I think I I dearly loved San Francisco but I got pissed off at it because of the crime but Palo is like pretty amazing would do you ever think that you'd rather be there I mean you're an hour north of SF do you wish that you were an hour south no I mean SF is now where the action is but uh so the question would be do I wish I was still in the city and the answer is I definitely would have I definitely know I would make more money if I lived in SF like it seems like it's a more expensive place to live but actually I know I would make way more money because there just the serendipitous bumping into of people headache though it's such a headache but yeah exactly making money is not the only criteria is so like you know familywise it's much better to be in the BBS for me so lifestyle wise I'm happy with this choice but damn when I hear these stories it does make me wish I was back in on the action like I went and hung out with my friend Luke and Palo Alto and we he was we went to his house and he was like you want to take a walk and I was like yeah let's take a walk and we walked around for probably two three hours and in that two three hours he was like that's the garage where Google started and this is this and that's uh zuck's house actually and this is this person's house and then we bumped into like somebody he's like oh that's where the founder of Kora is and then we go to we go to the Starbucks there like a little coffee shop there and like I get recognized by five people that I you know I just sit in my house all day but there's people who listen the podcast and then they start telling me what they're up to and they're doing a cool AI company and then you leave the coffee shop and we just pop into our friend um you know like VC shop and we he's having a meeting he introduced us to those Founders and so I'm like oh man dude the amount of serendipity I had in three hours just now was crazy and you don't you don't really get it until you until you experience it and so if there's like takeaway from anybody who's who's like you know listening to this I would say my two big takeaways was number one proximity's power and like literally just showing up and being there being in the heart of the action for whatever scene you want to be in how much that matters and the second was the Ron Conway principle of how do you just act so benevolently that your reputation is the product you're actually building you're not building a portfolio you're building a reputation the reputation builds the portfolio and the third one is the midwit meme strikes again where it's like so the two best early Pickers of startups ever in the history of silica Valley both make their decisions based off of just do they feel like these people are Fierce Founders and they could figure that out in less than 10 minutes and then here you have people that are doing market analysis and segmentation maps and tons of due diligence and and this and that and they have thesis on on on all these different markets and it's like dude the best people are literally just amazing judges of people and they're making their decisions in five minutes and then they spend the rest of their time just helping people people it it's so exciting to hear these stories how much do you think that each of these investors made like uh I guess like if you and what was the first valuation so the first valuation was 10 million the next round was at 75 pre so Ron Conway this is now a decade plus ago I think 2012 they asked him they were like Ron how much did you they they were like first were you scared off by the valuation I mean 75 pre today is a lot is a high valuation for a series a company and you know Google obviously now it's obvious but like nothing's obvious at the beginning nothing's that obvious and he goes which by the way uh that's worth $150 million today so that's a shitload of money you're like how am I ever so this company has to sell for a billion dollars right right so like they're like did this valuation scare you off he goes no I think that's crazy he goes companies are binary he goes a company the investing we do a company is binary it's either a huge win or it's a zero I just let the market figure out the the valuation and then I invest once I've decided to invest I let the market decide the price he goes yeah we did great he goes for every dollar invested we got $400 out um and this was back in 2012 and they go and they go is that the peak valuation or that's the current valuation he goes the peak valuation of Google is far in the future right he knew right this is because this is you know 12 years ago and Google has since you know you know at least tripled in value since then um so it's a pretty pretty wild return now I don't know how much guys like Shaq and others got so Ron got in at the 75 million round the guys like Andy or David that I mentioned at the beginning the professors they got in in the $10 million round right which is just just wild so you know $100,000 became over a billion dollars for each of those people and the crazy thing about pricing is like um so Google was started I think 30 years ago right 30 28 years ago and the I don't what are they worth a trillion or something or two trillion what's what's what's crazy is that the companies like the the equivalent of that would be investing in a company today and trying to convince yourself that it will be worth 6 trillion do you know what I mean like it's really it's a $2.3 trillion company today so in 30 years uh double that or triple that so like it's it's it's incredibly hard for the brain to think if I invest in this company maybe one day it could be worth a trillion dollars that's like an inconceivable thing to think about and so that's why Angel Investing is a mind [ __ ] like to think like like cuz you think like oh this is worth a 100 million now you got to sell for a billion and the Founder's like no man it's like one trillion like those the the the the math behind all of this is very very very challenging to even like wrap your head around yeah totally uh and even when it's staring in the face I think I've told the story before but I remember sitting in a a conference room in silica Valley um 20 maybe 14 15 something like that there was some point in time where I was telling this guy I was like yeah I came out Sila Valley I applied to two places the place I'm at now and the other place I applied to was stripe there only two job I'd ever applied to in my life and I didn't get the stripe jum I got rejected I blew the interview and he goes oh actually he goes I'm investing in stripe right now and I go stripe now it's not like an angel investment anymore he goes yeah he goes yeah it's a $3 billion do valuation and I remember just thinking like what a dummy like you three billion what do you think this is going to turn into like three like I thought this the game of start was to create a billion dollar company so hearing that one was already at three it's already 3x overvalued it's like oh hoping it gets to 10 billion and you triple your money like n nuts and now it's you know1 billion company I would have 30X my money even then and it was so obvious like anybody I knew used stripe it was so obvious stripe was the best company in Silicon Valley at that time and I talked myself out of investing in it because I just couldn't fathom the numbers right uh it just didn't make any sense it's because you think an absolute numbers so I remember one time when I first started my company we were spending $30,000 a month and I met with the CEO of like a billion company and I was like can you believe this I hired two people and we went from spending $88,000 a month to $330,000 a month how insane is that and he was like dude like I spend you know uh 300 million a year like you these aren't he was like you can't think of this as an as an absolute number compared to your real life this is just a number on a spreadsheet and it doesn't matter how many zeros are behind it you just are these zeros going in and you're getting more zeros out that's all you have to think about don't think about this in terms of like a real number uh and when he told me that that kind of like shaped how I how I viewed a lot of things you you need to do like the casino thing you have to take your cash trade it for these chips that are different colors you're not used to and then just try to make the chip stack bigger versus if you look at a you know a hand of blackjack you're playing ,000 hand dude that that's a month's rent or whatever it is right it's like an insane all of a sudden you just start making different decisions I remember like even uh it's not even the absolute number sometimes even relative will screw you up because um I remember investing in Tesla when Tesla was like at at like A5 or6 billion dollar valuation and or I invested even before that I think it got to six or seven something like that I had made like three times my money and I remember looking at the market cap of the biggest car company I could think of at the time I think it was like GM or some a Ford or one of those one of those companies and it was like A6 billion do company and I remember thinking like I looked up how many cars Tesla was selling and how many cars they sold it was like you know Tesla sold like nothing compared to them and I just remember thinking okay okay the feeling of this as like a $30 billion company like cool so like if I ride this out if if Tesla became the most valuable car company in the world it would be a $30 billion that would be 30 billion to be like a 5x from here or I could just take my winnings now and go and enjoy them I don't remember the exact number but I remember that 26 billion was like where the the car companies were at Tesla today is not only is it today like a and a. half trillion dollar company or whatever it is so it's now it's a one and half trillion dollar company so I was off by like you know more than 10x I was off by like two orders of magnitude basically on top of that Tesla is worth more than the next like 10 car companies in the world combined it's it's the whole idea of like number one it broke like it breaks my brain right like Tesla is literally worth the all of the next six car companies they're worth like uh I think it's like I don't know 600 billion or something something that it's like a uh oh no the big six are 477 billion Tesla is 1.3 trillion right so it's it is just mindboggling what these things it's hard it's hard to understand I mean didn't I tell you the the when I was trying to understand what a trillion dollar a person worth $100 million compared to a person worth $1 trillion which is what Elon will be in three or four or five years if you have $100 million you're like ungodly Rich okay but the equivalent of those two compar of those two the Gap is the same as100 million $10,000 right isn't that insane so like when I think of a $100 million person I think you're one of the richest people I've ever met dude my I think my in there's this great quote about happiness it's like I have talked myself out of Happiness a thousand times but I've never once talked myself into it right I've never thought it's like I've never thought my my way I've thought my way into unhappiness a thousand thousand different ways but I've never thought my way into happiness um I don't know if I buy that quote exactly but I get the the premise of it which is like we could very much talk ourselves out of things or into unhappiness I think investing is very much the same if now realize like especially in technology investing this may not be true for Value investing but for Tech investing where you're the whole game is like find the one or two psychos and the one or two like breakout categories that are going to just break the entire game it's the power law and these things are going to become worth not a billion dollars not10 billion but like a hundred billion doar or even a trillion dollars each I think it's back to the like make a 5 to 10 minute gut based decision on the like quality of the founder or the overall space like the internet in 94 crypto you know in the in the early 2010s mobile now ai right it's like just oh the smartest person I know is doing something in AI that's enough I don't need to like the more I think the worse my returns will get is sort of what I've realized when it comes to to Tech investing because it is all about the breakouts and the breakouts are not things that you could just linearly you know figure out we had shield on the Pod the other day and he's like yeah I invested in Bitcoin early and Nvidia early like wow you're so smart he's like yeah I invested in Bitcoin because I thought it was going to become this other thing and I invested in video because I thought about I thought it was going to win in uh crypto mining so he's like you know even in the ones he was right even in the Prof professional investor with amazing returns who picked the right two things to bet on of the last 15 years Bitcoin and Nvidia he got it absolutely right he did it even for the wrong reason right like it's like God damn it what what are you supposed to do in this this was a great podcast that was a great story um we should it would be fun I would love to do a series where we get the first employee or the first investor in or one of the first in legendary companies to come and and talk so like Google Facebook um Reddit I think that's the hack because getting the founder obviously is great super hard and they're also get they're also like still running the company and have to say certain things and like they they've been so mediat trained and like the statue of limitations can be like past it so it's like if it's 10 years old it's like look no one's going to get mad at you if you say that you guys like uh called the competitors and pretended to be a customer just so you can get like fake information you know what I mean like it's we're past that it's so you could actually reveal a bunch of stuff Paul Graham asked Ron Conway he goes uh you've been do this now for like you know you were a founder and now you've invest all these legendary Founders what's changed and he goes he goes we drank way more back then he goes he goes what that's the thing you're going to say he goes yeah he's like every day around like 400 p.m. we had this woman Donna who would like push a cart around the office with booze and we would all drink and he's like he's like we literally talk like work hard play hard at the same time like let's do this he's like there was all kind crazy [ __ ] going on and in our company and he's like that's just what we did he goes now I go to these companies they don't do that at all they're much better about segmenting it they do play hard but they like happy hour on Fridays after work like not like all the time during work crazy Shenanigans going on dude that was great is that it that's it that's the p

I talk to my barber and he tells me this story that's pretty crazy about muscle [Music] milk so he's cut my hair and he knows I have the podcast so every time I go in for a haircut he just gives me research and it's great dude my handyman knows knows I have the podcast and he always asks me what stocks he should buy and I'm like that's not the point bro he thinks you're Jim Kramer yeah he's like so what socks what socks should I buy like I I don't know I don't know uh don't ask me that just change the light bulb please if he asked you like you know what's the best way to increase my testosterone right now using an illicit drug I feel like that is what he should be asking you yeah clearly he's aen buy from what can I buy from a forum that will make my tendons stronger like Sam has answers to those types question I'm like do you want to know some really cool subreddits or an illegal place to download books I got you bro go my barber and he's like dude you know whose hair I was cutting um he goes he's your neighbor uh my neighbor and he goes yeah the guy lives just down the street from you it's the family that started Muscle Milk so they started back in 1998 and it actually started because he bought a sub brand called cytomax from his employer and uh which is like who does that who who goes to their employer and is like hey can I buy this like asset that's kind of undervalued or whatever and and it's a niche product and he has this idea which is he names it Muscle Milk because he wants to name it after mother's milk like after breast milk and he wanted to make a drink that had the nutritional profile of breast milk cuz he was convinced that breast milk was the most like nutritious food ever it's not ended up it's not what ended up working but I think it's a hilarious starting point yeah it's sort of like how SpaceX started cuz he wanted to send like a a small plant to Mars and now he's like you know built like a trillion dollar company to this you know uh what's the colostrum I get so many ads on on colostrum good stuff dude I don't is it like from a animal or a human it's from a cow yeah damn so I'm like depriving some newborn cow from you know like her fresh milk well that's how all have you ever seen how milk is made it's pretty insane no you know milk is made it's messed up is it just tons of devices that hook on to you like an alien all right this is this is my wife vegan say she's forced me to like go down this road to like acknowledge what what goes on here's how a lot of milk is made I can't say all but I think this is like the mainstream way they impregnate a cow artificially literally a dude sticks his hand and then like artificially inseminates a cow gets the cow pregnant cow has a baby baby is then ripped away from the cow but placed nearby so that the mom can hear the crying and will produce more milk and then they take the milk yeah I mean that's that's sad [ __ ] up I hate that what kind of podcast is this yeah dude I literally sad ass vegan podcast is this I drank a glass of whole milk just last night and now I regret it what up YouTube Sean here uh you guys know that I have started a newsletter company and sold it Sam has done it too Sam built the hustle got it to millions of subscribers sold it to HubSpot I built a company called the milk Road was a crypto newsletter and sold it for millions of dollars one year later and we've both had success with newsletter business model so the team at HubSpot got together and they did a research project called the future of newsletters and they're trying to put together some research around where they see opportunities for the newsletter industry um what are some of the you know sort of checklists some things you should pay attention to when it comes to newsletters and a bunch of other data and research that they're packaging together if you want to check out what the HubSpot team has put together go to the link below this video and um and download it it's free and you can check it out and you can learn something about newsletters to Muscle Milk yeah okay so Muscle Milk not actual milk it's a supplement and it starts out as powder you put in a drink and he's like cool I think bodybuilders are into this they're willing to drink this kind of chalky nasty drink and he buys in and basically it's a family business so it's Greg picket and his his uh kids are involved with it uh and what's cool about this business is years later Muscle Milk becomes a household brand they end up selling the thing for $450 million they make almost half a billion off this muscle mil thing the guy lives down the street they basically started this as a culdesac company meaning he lives in one house the son lives in another house the sister uh his daughter lives in another house and they all just live in one culdesac sounds awes the kids play together and then they just built this Behemoth that way like isn't this insane that is badass that is badass that was like inspiring to me it's just like a family like you've heard of a family business but dude just imagine the culdesac business I'm kind of insired by this very much in the vein of thinking of find the people you love and do life with them like so okay how did It win uh wait really quick have you seen land man the oil show hell yeah I've seen L man I might have wore a cowboy hat yesterday just feeling a little Billy Bob Thorton myself I haven't seen it but this clip I just saw makes me want to watch it but basically Jerry Jones comes on and Jerry Jones like gives this like amazing acting performance where he talks about the importance of working with his family and how he's proud of his wealth and his real estate and he's proud of his the the Cowboys but you know what he's proud of most is that I got to spend time with my kids and we work together and that's why they're here uh at my deathbed because they loved me and we got to spend a whole bunch of time together and I heard that speech and I was Allin for one I was Allin and two Jerry Jones who would have thought he like had tears in his eyes I not think he could act like that somebody was saying they're like I don't think I think this is such a good performance cuz he's not acting I think all of this is just true for him and he just said the truth which um which is great by land man fantastic show yeah it was such a good scene all right so tell me about uh milk and muscles milk and muscles all right so they start the business pretty humble um plan they bought this like kind of supplement and it's powder you mix into drinks and they were like look if muscle bodybuilding enthusiasts drink this this would be great we think we can make this more mainstream but we don't really know how we just kind of are believers in the general idea and they were like look if this thing ever got to like 18 million in sales that would be like imagine that that would be crazy and they that was like the dinner table talk by the time they sell this thing is doing over 200 million in Revenue um and about 60 million a year in profit before they they sold so they they had built like a really s really successful company um how did they do it they eventually and and what I love about these stories is you hear about the story and you're like you nod your head you're like d yeah that makes sense how that happened but then you look at the timeline and sometimes I'll force myself to literally draw out the timeline so it' be like all right 1998 they start the company and then I'll draw 99 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 it's like 2004 is when they actually made the product that hit which is the ready to drink like we've all seen you know the Muscle Milk Carton and so you when you hear that you're like okay cool 2004 then really took off and you just sort of read the numbers and the revenue ramp and it looks good but then you think you zoom in and you you force yourself to look at that like five or six year time period and you're like there's not they don't even talk about what they were doing during that time because it's just like the forgotten the Forgotten grinding out years of trying to make [ __ ] happen and staying in the game long enough to get lucky and what were they doing they were just selling they were just trying to sell and they were selling to like really small niches but ever expanding out of that Niche and eventually he has an Insight the dad has an insight and the Insight is basically like hey you know what flavor matters and he's like if more people are going to drink this it's going to be because I uh I can I get this to taste like dessert and he realized that the initial Market they were looking at which was bodybuilders they took pride in drinking nasty [ __ ] and so anytime you tried to make like a fruity better tasting thing sweeter thing they almost kind of rejected it because it felt less hardcore and they were super hardcore and that's who the you there's a lot of people who um like take uh testosterone or steroids or OIC and a lot of doctors will offer you a pill a cream or a syringe and I've asked the doctors and they go they all want the syringe because it feels more like this works better it's going through my veins I can feel it right so exactly and I think that's true for the early markets the hardcore markets you know Ben is like this Ben is an early adopter of every product as soon as a product gets popular his interest like completely drops in it right cuz the fun part was doing the hard thing getting the edge being a head and so same thing for bodybuilders so what the The Genius of the business is that they saw that hey okay the market we see today the people who are buying it today actually is different if we want to reach this other Market we got to like ignore all the signals we're seeing today so he goes in the lab and he starts doing small batch production and everybody else was so big that they could only test flavors in basically bigger batches and so that meant slower Cycles it meant kind of like getting less like tight feedback loops so what he did was he goes to LA and he starts testing flavors in like 15 gallon increments and he pours it and he gives it to people and they're like ah too chalky and he gives them another one they're like too sweet goes another one and he finally makes this vanilla flavor that they're like this tastes like dessert I love this and so he brings those flavors into the ready to drink beverage and it just takes off it goes nuts and eventually like Walmart starts knocking and Walmart's like hey we want to carry this he's like dude we can't even fulfill Walmart but he's like all the specialty stores the GNC's it's flying off the shelves and for like the first year they're like so inventory constrained because he nailed the flavors so what my barber was telling me which is fascinating what caught my attention about this he goes so this dude down the street they created Muscle Milk sold it for like $500 million but the cool part is he goes he didn't sell the flavors I go what do you mean he goes yeah there's some story he goes it's not out there but the guy I I cut my I'm cut he telling story his Barber on blast it's not like insider trading he's just telling me it's a really cool story but he's like you know when you go and research it's not this part's not as reported so maybe he got some of the details wrong that's my my caveat but here's what what what he explained which was basically the um when they did the sale they sell the brand Muscle Milk they sell the operating business they sell all the distribution and then the buyer was like cool and the flavors and they're like uh actually we have our own separate company that does flavors and we're not going to sell you that company and they're like well we need the flavors like cool yeah we'll do a licensing deal like we we could provide flavors but we won't sell the flavor company and again this is where the details are not reported so either that's what happened or right after they sold they started a new flavor company cuz now this is what the family does they have this um flavor house that they created and they were like we're not going to do any Brands anymore but we will do flavoring as like that's our that's what made Muscle Milk successful and that's what we're going to do now as a service and now they've got a bunch of customers for this flavor brand that this flavor house that they've created and if you look at their facility it's like this insane like you know huge facility with like a [ __ ] vacuum sealed room and they're like oh we do this technology like spray flavoring where you can add flavor to things that doesn't add any calories and they're basically it's all about Flavor Tech and I'm just like fascinated by Flavor houses and flavor technology it's called flavor insights it looks awesome and I see like the they have a video with the father and his son and um on the about page it's the whole family this is my dream by the way this is how can I tell you why this is even more your dream while he's building Muscle Milk he's got a hobby and I know that you love a man with a real Hobby and his hobby is racing cars and he has his own racing team that he created and then he himself races in I I don't know [ __ ] about racing but is it l man L man it's like it's like a famous I guess track but it's like a the famous thing is like it's a 24-hour race and so like Ford versus Ferrari all these I think he like won the race where he performed really well how impressive is that is this like just Rich guys doing it or is he competing against like real Racers I'm not a real race Enthusiast so I could be wrong but yeah it's like dude like the story Ford versus Ferrari it was about the time that Ford beat Ferrari at Lama like it's like a big deal yeah it's like a movie worthy deal uh you know like Rudy Style movie off Underdog winning Lama right so you know dhh the guy the Jason Freed's coer he he competes in out did he I don't think he won did he he won yeah he won I think he I think he won the race and he said he's competed in it 11 times um yeah it's sort of like um and often times like the company that wins they win for some Innovative reason and then like 10 years down the line that car part that helped them win becomes like the norm gotcha gotcha um yeah so that's a big deal isn't this a it's a total like life goals story build a killer brand you stuck with the thing you built it with your family you do it in the culd toac uh I just think it's it's amazing sell the thing for500 million none of his kids are yolked right like these guys they don't look very yolked I'm looking at the family now well as their public defender here's what I have to say about that one of the things they talked about with Muscle Milk is they go we wanted to build a product that everybody would look at it and see a different thing so they go women see it as a weight loss product men see it as a muscle building product some people see it as a snack some people see it as a meal replacement our goal was to build a product that you that would basically you know solve multiple problems for different people at once I'm just saying that I want to see some bigger buys and tries on this family photo they look great they look very healthy more importantly they look happy the founders teeth are beautiful like he's got a really nice smile I just think that we should see a little thicker neck can I tell you one other thing so this company that bought them uh originally now they own by Pepsi Pepsi owns it now but before that they was bought by something called Hormel Foods it's one of these companies that you've never heard of this company does 12 billion dollar in Revenue they do like a billion and a half dollars of profit a year and if you go to their website they the like the the headline like tagline for them is like we sell more pepperonis than anyone on Earth they're this like food holding company they own Skippy peanut butter they own Planters they own spam they own spam and then they sell just a [ __ ] ton of ronies dude they just sell pepperonis worldwide they own Applegate they own Justins they own Planters Skippy ch-ch I don't know what chese is is Black Label bacon they own a lot of sh I mean literally spam is like on their homepage as like their like their their priv enjoy like the way my parents pin like pictures of me up on the fridge that's what this company does with with Spam which is like it's pretty pretty good horrible for you but oh dude hor yeah Hormel pepperoni I know that that's one of my snacks one of my snacks is like eight pepperoni with a little bit of mozzarella cheese on it microwaved it's a pizza without the the pizza yeah I just call it like red pizza hold the dough just just pepponi and mo redneck Fitness food dude this should be your brand a line of of not that bad for you redneck snacks it's like it'll it'll make you farm strong yeah or do you know like PB dip you I call it dip but you know PB powder the powder yeah yeah you get a spoon of that and you straight and you have Chuck it up on your the top of your Ru of your mouth and you suck on that thing for 60 minutes I call it uh like Fitness dip so like instead of like having like a fat Lipper in you just have a PB dip you're just and your tongue just rub it against that that that dehydrated nut ooh boy [Laughter] boy oh boy you want to have a good time put a little PB dip on the roof of your mouth all right we got our we got our cold open for the episode um by the way let let me show you one thing you said something that I do religiously I just sent Ari a document that I I just sent her one of the tabs I have dozens of tabs on this Alli can you share your screen so whenever I read a book I have this Google doc that I've used since the year like 2010 all right so check this out whenever I read a book I do a few things one I make whenever there's like a year and a money term or some type of Milestone I write it down in a sheet and the reason why I write it in a sheet is because a lot of times when you're building a company or doing anything that's like really challenging you you'll read about someone else and you're like that was easy and so I like to do timelines and you'll see like oh okay like they went four years with nothing happening and so for those listening I have got a timeline of coke Industries which is like the largest privately held company in America i' read the biography of their family and I like did a timeline where every Everything major happened in their life and then I converted the dollar amount into $ 2019 which is when I made this particular one and it's really fun to do because you could see that things took like in this case like 30 years right and so if you like uh if you scroll all the way to the left I did this with Kirk Koran another one of a guy who I love and i' I every biography I read I I create one of these just another man you love can I just point out a couple things about this what we're screen sharing here that are are just just fantastic this is it's just a a peek into the Mind first of all it's a Google sheet that's just called sheet which is just a great title okay scroll over Ari here's some of the Milestones that Sam wrote down all right so he starts for for Coke Industries 19 1900 fr o born uh 1924 so 24e Gap Big Break finds Mentor okay so then it goes 1927 just a quick update still broke then it goes 20 1929 C success 1931 big success with two G's just a big double G success right here this is amazing and then 1940 he uh buys a company and that company he buys it for $4 million um you also should just have pictures on here where it's them and the caves and it's just your calves just for reference and you're just comparing calves cuz I feel like tell me that's not part of your research process is looking at photos and judging their looks yeah particularly the Coke brothers cuz they're like these tall uh waspy guys and I definitely am sizing myself up to them yeah the the the the total picture of success includes a picture for sure yeah it's like tennis sweaters it's like oh they're into tennis sweaters therefore I will wear tennis sweaters but yeah I definitely like two guys that are both 6'2 from the Midwest with blonde hair blue eyes like we there's definitely like a there could only be one of us in this room dude there's this girl who keeps going viral on Twitter and it's the same tweet she does every time and she just goes my dad goes to a bar with his friends every Friday and he makes a list of topics to discuss yes and then she she put she has a photo of him holding a printed out agenda and I'll just read you one of them Ted Perry's fun Capital story shown on Fox News 6 next one what's going on with the Bucks question mark NFL overtime rules take ball first or second question mark Bahama breezes how close is too close to an alligator do you think people that throw garbage out of their car window are the same people that don't pick up their dog poop when walking through my subdivision then it read at the bottom goes please be on time as you could see we have another week of a packed agenda and it goes was super viral every time it's like 100,000 likes cuz I think everybody who sees this is like yeah that's part of the winning life I'd like to go to the bar with my friends every Thursday and have like an agenda that we print out and we talk about while wearing our new balances do you know who does this and he's not joking I already know CU you're talking about a legend a social Legend and I know it has to be Nick Ray tell me I'm wrong not I'm wrong is it not Nick Ray the second time I hung out with Nick Ray we went to a bar called Lazarus Sarah and I came and he goes hey guys uh I would love to hang out this is our second time hanging out I thought it would be nice to have an agenda so we could stay on track and there was a 13-point uh agenda list where it was like ask Sarah about her job figure out how that's going on explain my dating life and get opinions from it uh like it was a and we stuck to that agenda and he took notes and it was was it thrilling cuz I think I'm going to absolutely start doing this it was thrilling you know how like you know how like was it the agenda that was great or the fact that he had agenda that was great which which of the two was great second one here's why so look in a world everyone wants to be a tough guy it feels good to be a leader but you want to know something Everyone likes getting LED and like we like the assertive person I'm just a leader who loves being led that's me like that's on my LinkedIn I I like leading some stuff but then there's other times where it's like just tell me what to do and right small talk is one of those things that no one just like tells you what to do and when there's an assigned leader who something outlined for small talk I'm just like yes sir I'll do whatever you like me to do and uh thank you may I have another sir like it's like the best way to go about doing stuff and that's what Nick Ray does okay by the way that's how we do this podcast actually we both bring some agenda items and then we discuss in bullet point form yeah I think it's good I and he's done that for years and it's awesome all right we're going to normalize having conversational agenda Hangouts with an agenda okay let's do more uh um I have a business that's pretty cool can I tell you about it here's my here's my opening for this business Sam I found the business that you should have started instead of wasting your goddamn time with the hustle okay I like that so you built the hustle and if you recall one time you came to me hat and hand absolutely begging for an investment you needed the money and you got that and you said please sir invest in my company and I looked at it I I flipped through the business plan like it was a flip book and I just said no thanks remember you said you said look Sam you're coming to a knife fight with a knife I don't even want you to come to this knife fight with a gun I want you to come to this knife fight with a magic [ __ ] W and and that clearly I turned away on my heel with a dramatic Spin and I left the room and then you tried to pull the door to open but it was really a push door um exactly blew it at the end stick The Landing like you clearly had just read that on a whatever the equivalent was of Twitter and you're like that is now my line yeah exactly this back when I was like I had it written on the inside of my palm and I was like Peter teal says this magic W thing say that somebody totally owns them no matter what they're doing um so but you know the reality was I looked at the business and you were like here's what I'm doing I am creating a media company so every day we're going to write the news so every every day you had to recreate your product yeah sus oh that sucks um it's like do you get any is there any benefit uh of all the work you did in the last three months it's like ah not really we got to recreate it again we got to bake that cake every morning okay sounds good and then you said and then I was like cool so then people pay you certainly for this service that you're doing nah it's free oh okay you're like but then the advert then we have to do a separate business basically to a separate customer selling advertisers I like okay but certainly they're on retainer and it's going to be recurring Revenue that's going to stack up you're like no no no they're just going to if they feel like advertising they will if they don't they don't every month we're going to start back at zero yep and I thought damn this is a tough business to win and that's when I hit you with the knife and the knife fight and blah blah blah which it is tough is to to do well yeah and by the way the the best punchline of the whole thing is five years later after you successfully sold the business and got rich doing it I then copied your business model and did the same thing for crypto and and was like came back to basically being like what how do you what was the business plan again how do you do this um so so that's the the end of that story now here's a better business that somebody created 5 years ago that has the following profile they don't recreate the product every day people pay them for the product on a subscription it's in a hobby that you love doing and it's a thing you were doing anyways for free so I think you would have been great at it and also it uses your gift which is making things simple summarizing things uh making them easier to understand saving somebody time doing it and this person has bootstrapped this business to 200 million in Revenue with 30% profit margins I have no idea what is this it's called Headway app and it is a book summary app so this guy in the Ukraine created this company where he takes popular books and he summarizes them and the promise is basically instead of reading the book I already read it I summarized it I could tell you main point one I could tell you main point two I could tell you the main point three and in under 15 minutes you can get the gist of what's in this book you'll get you know the the big ideas and you'll get them explain to you you could either read it or we have ai that turns it into audio and you can just listen to like a 15minute summary of This Book and we've done it for 1,500 of the most popular books and people pay a simple 12 13 bucks a month for this and this has become an absolute Juggernaut so I did not think that these book summary apps could get this big but damn if that's impressive 200 million in ARR 30% profit built this thing out of the Ukraine they just raised funding at of $2.3 billion valuation right right holy crap so like you could have done that instead and I think you would have been great at this by the way you know here's why I said that this this like you could have done this because when I went and looked at their ads right the the way this business grows they run ads on Tik Tok on Facebook whatever and the hook of their ads tell me if this sounds familiar my boss thinks I'm a genius but and thinks I read 150 books a year but actually I just use Headway that's the ad it's not word for word I just wanted to really bait you with that one but it's basically the it's basically the gist of their ads it's the same invented that that ad I invented that ad I stole it from someone else and I invented that ad that's my ad that's the ad that's my ad that I yes I stole that from the SK and I invented that ad their ad is a little bit more like um it'll be the average CEO reads 52 books a year how many do you read right so they're basically making you feel like a shitty CEO or it'll say everyone thinks I went to Harvard with the amount of books that I know but actually I just use Headway or it'll be meet the app that all the intellectuals are using stuff like that and so um those are the sort of hooks that used to get people to do this where they're not saying here's a book summary they're basically saying be a smarter person and be seen as a smart person because you seem so well read and here's your hack to seeming so well read so what's interesting is um thrive thrive we should do this for the podcast it's like my boss thinks I'm kind of [ __ ] but know a lot about business the secret is I just listen to my first million but I still sound a little [ __ ] my boss is so impressed that I know all these numbers but did he wonders but then facts checks [Laughter] me my boss is wondering why I have pepperoni in my mouth this is ridiculous these guys so they raised money from Thrive which Thrive is a big VC uh investor in chat gbt are they're not worried that chat gbt just does all this well they are themselves using AI for a bunch of stuff like if you go look at a bunch of their ads are all like AI generated ads um I think you know businesses like this that are like super laser focused on one thing you know even if you can use chap GPT to generate a summary that's not the same thing and I think you know um dude they're not even old they started in 2019 I know right super impressive they also have done this other app so there's this one ad that was like so frustratingly good it made me pissed that I didn't think of this it's the simple look puzzle tell me if you've seen this I don't know I don't know how much you use these like it's like in a lot a lot of games this ad pops up or Tik Tok it's this like it's like a maze imagine a maze and it's like you're you start on this dot you have to get across without picking up your pen and it just shows somebody trying to do it and they're messing up yeah and it's like try see if you can solve this only 5% of people you know can solve this but 50% of fifth graders can do it or whatever and you're like ah I got to see if I can do this you download the app by the way that puzzle is actually impossible if you there's there is no solution to it they just put it in they put a thing that looks simple but you can't figure it out you can't figure it out cuz it is actually an optical illusion it's actually impossible they use it to down yeah they have this other app called impulse that's done like 70 million downloads and it's a brain training app and the the framing of that is basically keep your brain sharp with these little like mini mini mind games um and like you know my mom likes a lot of these things cuz she feels like oh I'm getting older should I should have these little things on my phone that um you know keep me sharp so she plays sodoku and crossword and she she downloads apps like this so they skill set they're just like crazy good inter marketers uh internet marketers and really good uh like creating uh apps that retain apps that first and foremost get you to convert and become a subscriber and then yeah obviously you know the retention helps uh and you know this guy talks to he frames it as microlearning he's like microlearning is this how do you get somebody to spend 5 to 15 minutes a day getting smarter what if you use your phones to get smarter instead of just to waste your time and so he makes it sound like this Grand Noble Mission and at the same time on the back end it's just this ruthless funnel that is like run get the download convert convert convert convert convert and like that's the game that's what you got to be uh we talked about um was it remember the Period app or flow were they were they Ukrainian as well yeah so we these guys all have like a a like these Eastern European app makers where they have these family of apps and you go look at their website and they're like no rais no funding and then they'll have like 300 employees and then their apps will do like you know a 100 million downloads a year and it's like based out of Kiev or whatever right like this just seems to be a pattern I think there's like a just a very high density of talent that knows how to build this specific type of company yeah they're just like all homies and they all have this like I don't know this idea of like it feels fun to get one over on someone but then they're like all right if we're going to have that attitude we should also like provide value so we stick around for the long time which is like what every internet marketer ever has they're like I'm going to do something shady and they win and they're like oh but it'd be a lot cooler if the customers came back to us or if we didn't have to refund people constantly so let's just like do the Shady stuff but do it for something like if I could tell my mom what I do without shame which is like what every internet marketer ever has done um but this is badass uh how'd you find this how did I find this actually that's another good story have you seen this Twitter account Arthur Rock arur arur I know that Arthur Rock was no it's a it's like a parody account it's Arthur rock is his his account have you not seen this this thing is amazing so how spell Arthur bro just you try to spell Arthur and naturally and just see what happens you'll land exactly at the right thing it's a r f Rock arur okay so it's this guy who's this like Anonymous he's like this Anonymous VC and what he did is he just created this Twitter account where he just tweets out numbers from companies that are raising money or trying to sell and he's just like leaks information and so he's this just this giant leak and so he tweeted out the numbers for uh Headway app but if you just look at his feed his feed is like pure signal because it literally just be like uh it'll be like post hog 13 million in ARR growing 2x year-over year they're currently crazy it'll be like or like somebody will be like you know the the founder will be like we're we're pleased to announce that we raised our serc from Excel it's a huge milestone and we feel so validated and then he'll just tweet out he'll read quot tweet it go 50 million AR as of November up 1.8x year to date congrats or there's like another one that like they raised that $400 million post they did $6 million in 20124 congrats yeah exactly exactly like how amazing is this this is like the best Twitter account right this is really good and you know what's funny and we've seen this again and again and again these meme people Anonymous meme Jokers are like right a lot you know what I mean it's sort of like how um Esquire or what was it called uh American what what was the Tabloid uh that like is in the grocery store Inquirer National Inquirer yeah the national Inquirer like they say a lot of [ __ ] but they also like predicted that the Bill Clinton scam uh or Bill Clinton stuff before everyone or like the John Edwards uh Affair uh and so like I do love following these Anon accounts this guy's great yeah dude he says Hollow a Catholic prayer app doing 60 million AR growing uh 3.5x a year yeah like he did uh in he'll also post updates so in May he'll be like sunno the AI music app just closed around 15 million AR in the first year light speed invest at 500 million post congrats and then he'll then you know that was May and then in October right so like you know five months later he just wrote at 40 million AR now right this guy's just providing I don't know you're not a you're not as big of like a basketball fan but like in basketball there's these two guys who were like famous on Twitter for just like just has sources everywhere so it'd be like Shams and it'd be wge and they would just always have Intel and this all their entire Twitter feed is literally just inside info and be like you know sources say Jimmy Butler wants trade his list of teams that he wants to go to are these four or it'd be like like during the NBA draft like you know 45 seconds before every pick they just say they're taking this guy and it would just spoil the draft if I'm one of these Ukrainian guys like I don't have the skill set to do this I'm not uh technical but I wonder if you like do you ever wonder why aren't there more people just copying fast growing companies like just there are that happens a lot it doesn't but I think your I think your answer is actually pretty good which is why aren't there more so actually I think I answered your question wrong I was like no some people do do that and I think your question is actually correct which is why are more people doing this I don't want to do this because I kind of have a reputation and I don't really want to do it but if I was a little bit younger and if I had the skill set which I don't uh like if I see a company that's growing at like 400x a year which this guy does he's like here's some app that was only doing 5 million in Revenue but they're set to grow 4X I'm like yeah just go to their website and copy that yeah I mean it's not so easy right like you could copy a product that doesn't get you to the customers and so you have to not only C copy the product you have to figure out how they grow and be a as good at growth as them you can figure that out you can use all this technology like here's what their ads say I'm just going to do that exact same ad you can but you know most people who have that ability if you're if you're that good you're also able to create new things from scratch and I think also what ends up happening is that a lot of things look similar but they're you know they're 80% the same and they're 20% different but that 20% difference is actually a huge difference right it's like uh if you've ever looked at we were talking about flavors earlier it's like the difference between two flavors is like a 0.1% change in a certain you know certain chemical but it'll change you know from vanilla that's that's the difference between you know vanilla and and uh you know orange soda or whatever right it's like there's it's not that big of a difference on the on the whole right you're doing 80% the same but it's 20% that's different and so you know I actually advise this and and talk a lot about this which is if you see something that's working not as company maybe but like let's say a trend or a business model like you know let's say e-commerce or whatever try to figure out what's working better or worse in a category and then you know if you're going to go into that category you're probably going to end up even if you're trying to be super original you're probably going to end up with 80% of the things the same because that's how business is you're not 100% different uh but the key is to figure out what is your 20% difference going to be and how how well can you execute on that 20% Innovation um and I think that's a more humble honest way of going about things versus I think most people believe they're doing everything 100% original and unique and that's just not true right like even this is also for Content or wisdom right like how many truly original wise thing you know I love Naval but how many of naval's things are 100% homegrown not inspired by anything not not not similar to anything else that was out there very rare right like that's not how anybody does things Tony Robbins talks about this he's like yeah I I learned under Jim ran and Jim Le learned under Zig Ziggler whatever and like it's the same school of thought but like me putting my Twist on it is the is what makes all the difference then you have people like rocket internet which are literally like pixel for Pixel clones but even they operate in different markets so they'll be like cool we're building Amazon and Amazon for for Brazil or Thailand or whatever and turns out once you try to do that you're going to like over time a lot of things are going to end up different all right let me tell you a story really quick about some investment thing that I heard about that I would never do you would do but it's a thrilling story okay let me guess it's obscure overly complicated um doesn't really make a whole lot of sense too much risk and will end up netting less than the S&P 500 in the long run no this one um he came out on top actually so the story is this first of all like I was just listening to Scott goway's podcast while I was driving somewhere I think it was like over Christmas break and something happened at the very end of the podcast that I was with Sarah and I literally pulled over to the side of the highway and I was like are you listening to this and she's like shut up no uh but I'm like all right but this is actually amazing can we get an instant replay on YouTube of your wheel diagram you just did how big is your wheel dude you're like literally driving a school bus what was that it's like a shipul outlin it's like a tractor that you're driving it's a ship um I pulled the ship over and I literally had to sit down because she yells at me when I use my phone and I had to like type this out so I had this note I remembered it but Scott Galloway had Michael Lewis on so Scott Galloway is an investor and podcaster Michael Lewis is an amazing author wrote about ftxs um downfall and he was with Sam bakman freed uh when this all happened and so he he you know he has unique perspective in the 45 minute part of this like 50 or 55 minute episode Scott Galloway just me mentioned something where he's like yeah I bought some of the the the bankruptcy claims against FTX and Michael Lewis started talking about something else and then Michael Lewis goes wait wait wait wait wait what you made a good investment where you bought the FTX claims what was that about and Scott like just casually throws us out there but the story is actually pretty amazing so the background is this so in 2022 FTX goes bankrupt because uh sorry FTX goes bankrupt because SBF Sam bman freed he's overleveraged he spent all the money and whatever it didn't work out because of a bunch of different reasons and because of that $10 billion in customer funds are lost you know they're just gone and people are distraught they're freaking out but when a bankruptcy happens one major thing happens which is the person who had the money in FTX so let's say I stored $1 million in FTX I now am a am going to have a claim against that company for $1 million so it's going to go to court and we're going to figure out how do I get my money back somehow and in a lot of cases you get no money back and so what happens is these kind of vultures I mean I don't know what you want to call them but they come along and they go hey FTX owes you a million dollars you're probably not going to get that back you might get that back but I'll tell you what you have a million-- dollar claim I will buy that claim from you for 100 grand so you get the 100 Grand today whereas the other outcomes are potentially you eventually get nothing or maybe you'll get a little bit bit more like 100 Grand 200 Grand 300 Grand but it's going to be in like four or five years and you don't even know for sure so just let me buy your claim and so sure you could do that so it creates a market when that happens but Scott Galloway he's kind of a he's kind of a strange guy and he had this quote on this podcast where he's like when I See Fire I run towards it because when because I've known enough seeing a lot of bankruptcies that when there's when a bankruptcy happens there's opportunity and so Scott Galloway he reads the paperwork about the claim um or about the bankruptcy and what he notices is that Sam bankman freed unlike a lot of different Ponzi schemes a lot of times with Ponzi schemes they're spending this money on coke hookers planes like party [ __ ] s SPF maybe did a little bit of that but you wouldn't know what he was a real degenerate about Venture investing he loved investing in companies and one of the companies he invested in a few and I think a lot of them didn't work but one of the big ones that he invested in was he invested in an ropic which is like the number two or the number three best AI company and Scott looks at the numbers and they don't actually say what the valuation was of what s of what the they didn't they don't say the valuation of anthropic when Sam bman invest in them but what they say is that he invested uh $500 million and Scott does a little math and he's like I think the valuation was around $5 billion meaningf owns 10 10% of this company and this was happening two years ago he's like I think anthropic is going to raise money at a $10 billion valuation and then eventually one day at a $60 billion valuation which by the way as of today there are rumors that that's happening and because of that I think I can buy a claim for 20% so a million doll claim for $200,000 and if you do all the math I think I could actually triple or quadruple my money based just off this Venture return let alone if we ever are going to claw back any of the crypto that was lost Well turns out a few things happened one Bitcoin exploded and because of that well not because of that but they were able to recap or uh clawback a lot of the money and Bitcoin explo uh exploded and so a lot of these people are going to be getting back a lot more money than they actually had in there because the money you know the Bitcoin was just sitting there growing and also s bman freed Investments one of them killed it knocked it out the park and so I think now the people who lost money they're getting something like 125% of their money back which is not bad for a Ponzi scheme that you were a victim of Scott said the numbers he goes I bought uh $250,000 worth and I sold I bought two a million doll claim for 250 and I sold it for uh uh 90% of the million so he like tripled his money and Scott like goes through the story and he explains like his reasoning on this podcast and it was amazing to be honest like how on Earth you could find Value in this way yeah that's that's super impressive I actually happened to hear this segment too and had the same you know I wasn't driving a bus but I had the same sort of like neck snap reaction where I was like what what's funny is you said a couple of things but I don't think you said a couple things but I think we have to correct a couple of things one it wasn't a Ponzi scheme no I met like he stole customer funds I didn't I guess I wasn't mean that um this was a Ponzi scheme but it's in that category of like schemes where you know a lot of people are like how do I get my money back scammed you lost your money yeah exactly um the other thing is that he was saying you know I valued FTX stake in anthropic at 4 billion but that's not really what happened so they sold their stake for 800 million so I think he put in 400 or 500 million and they sold it for 800 or 900 million in the liquidation and so it wasn't the anthropic investment that really paid off he was using the anthropic investment as a downside protection where he was like doing the math where he was like all right that gets me that gets my investment up just a little bit to like a safe Zone but then what else can there be yeah exactly so I but I I think his math was wrong so he said in the thing he goes I valued the anthropic uh based the based on the anthropic uh stake I thought it was worth 4 billion the total claims were 9 billion so I thought anthropic was giving me 44 cents on the dollar for every dollar of claims that I would buy um claims were selling for 22 cents on the dollar so he says to me this was the easiest trade I ever made but the reality is that the anthropic stake ended up being worth less than 1 billion right so it would have been 10 cents so even he got it right even though his logic was wrong and we had shial on the other day and he basically said his two best investments kind of worked out the same way he's like I bought Nvidia in 2017 because I thought that crypto mining was going to take off and Nvidia took off but not because of crypto mining at all it turned out it was Ai and you know kind of like I was wrong but I was I got massively right you go same thing with Bitcoin he's like I bought Bitcoin early on because I thought it was going to be this fast peer-to-peer transfer thing turns out that was all wrong but Bitcoin went up anyways because of this other store value gold you know digital gold use case and so I think what ended up happening is that he made a great investment but I think his underwriting was wrong I think that's one of the hard things about doing this like what you know the smart money investing is that when you're right you feel like such a goddamn genius and when you're wrong you chalk it up to you know whatever you sort of either mentally block it out you either say you were wrong or or you think maybe one of your assumptions got got a little off but this there's also this weird state where you can end up right even though your underwriting was wrong and you can flate kind of like luck and skill and that guess the question is uh I guess like that's one of my my observations I've had in this process of of like as I do my own investing and get something's right get something wrong I talk to other people it's very humbling to realize how much of this even your wins aren't your aren't yours they're not your wins because you got so much of it wrong well and there's another learning that I had which is finding value in crap like this story like this was the worst that that like this was the worst asset the worst company like you don't want to touch this because a it's like a scam so like there's a no-o there and B it's like a reputational Ruiner like who wants to be involved in this guy and then it's like I have so much better things to do why would I waste my time with this pile of [ __ ] and what was interesting was seeing Scott walk through his reasoning on how he can still capture value from a horrible situation and I thought that that was really intriguing because that is not how I tend to do things like what did they say uh try to trying to catch a falling knife like yeah when something's bad it's just going to get worse and just stay away but that's not always the case dude when I went to monish P's house and we recorded that podcast together we did the podcast and then at the end he's kind of just like touring me around and I go to his desk where he works I like seeing like literally where you sit when you work I think the environment kind of tells a lot and he has this placard on his desk like the way you would have a like if you walk into a bank or whatever it would be like the name tag of the of the bank manager or something like that but instead of a name on it it just said trouble is opportunity and and literally he was reminding him he wanted this on his desk because in those moments where there's Panic where there's trouble he wanted the reminder that trouble is opportunity and not all trouble is opportunity right like one of his isms that he had took from Charlie merer and Buffett is he puts things in what he calls the two hard pile so he's like yeah you know I look at a 100 opportunities I could probably tell you the three Obviously good ones and I could tell you the 10 obviously terrible ones but then the other whatever 77 I'm I just put in the two hard pile and I'm sure some of them are really good but I just throw things in the too hard pile when they're too hard and so for example you know I was asking like what's your thoughts on crypto and he was like well I think there's a case for I think there's a case against he's like but I just don't do anything because I put it in the two hard pile so I like I don't need to win in that uh it's too hard for me to figure out so I'm not going to bother and I think this the concept of the two hard pile is so valuable because I used to be very black and white about everything like either it's good or it's bad and if it if I thought it could be good I would smash my head against the wall trying to like make it work and if it was bad it had to like stand out as bad for me to like to to throw it away so you said 100 ideas the story is the story is this he's at the he's at lunch with Warren Buffett and he goes Warren you I think one of your great gifts is you're a great judge of people and he was talking about like you know Warren Buffett hired that guy AET who like runs their insurance business he's like I just think you're a great reader reader of people judge of people how do you do it what's your secret and he goes I don't think I'm a great reader of people and he he's like but I'm not trying to be humble he goes I just approach it differently he goes it pays to be a harsh grader when it comes to people meaning the cost of being optimistic about somebody who turns out to not be great to let them into your circle of friends or to do business with somebody who turns out to not be great is so costly that I just rule a bunch of people out he goes if you put me in a cocktail party and you let me have five minutes with 100 people in that five minutes I could probably tell you the five people who are really outstanding I could tell you the five people who are really lousy and I just don't want anything to do with them they just obviously came off super bad like in in a five minute interaction but then there's 90 people that I just can't make a judgment on in five minutes and I he goes so I just put them all in the bad pile they're all in the too hard to know pile and so I just rule them out because it's not worth the brain damage to try to figure it out on a case-by Case basis just so you don't miss a good one because the cost of a bad thing is worth way cost me much more than missing out on a good thing CU there are more good things that I could just filter for and I'll find those good things like over time that'll be Obviously good I'll just focus on the Obviously good things and he does this with investing he does this with people and it's just a very useful heuristic because I think most of us try to be if there's a 100 we try to be accurate at the hundred level it's like I want to have an accurate grade on all 100 and I'll spend all my time on the hard to judge things and I'll get a lot of them wrong but I'm trying to get them right and therefore I'm taking a too much risk whereas his take is don't take too much risk take the Obviously good and act on it obviously bad throw them away and everybody else put him in the two hard pile and ignore it can I dumb this down let me explain why I'm a genius when I go to a restaurant there's like two columns of Entre I start at the top and I skim down and the first one that I see that's a seven out of 10 I go oh that's it menu over I don't look at the menu for the rest of the meal I don't second guess it I just say the first one that's a seven that's that that's done and I'm able to do that right away does this apply to everything is this marriage advice is this uh what what other things does this apply to where does this not apply I mean yeah I think like it could apply to marriage like the idea of like settling is like good like you settle for something that's pretty good and you can like make it great I don't know like is there any like data on like Indian couples who have been uh yeah like arranged marriages have like the same s quotequote success rate as like American marriages which are like involved dating and selection and courtship and then eventually you know engagement and then marriage versus like the way that Indian couples do it is very much the menu thing you scan the the listings that'll do engineer good family full set of teeth seven out of 10 let's go yeah I will see you at the altar for the first time then new high five uh no I um I uh I just think think that's how I order like I've done that for years it's just I just don't want I I want less choice and I think what Warren Buffett is actually saying similar which is like I know for certain that these three are fine enough therefore I don't care about the rest yeah you know that book um The Mark Manson book subtle art of not giving an F like I think that book it got so popular that it sort of got written off you know what I mean like do you ever hear a smart person being like man I learned so much from this book The subtle art roet like it's not like it's not like a cool intellectual thing to reference because it's pop it's like pop MRE it's like if I'm like oh I really like Justin Bieber's music it's like okay what that's like a low status thing to to sort of say but there you know he brings up one good point in the book the book is basically around one point which is um life is not about caring about everything or not caring about everything it's about choos you know assume you have a limited set of e you know FS to give in your pocket like you got five to give Choose Wisely choose the things you're going to care about so like you know the menu you you just don't have to care to get that right and that's kind of like the Warren Buffett like you can just throw a bunch of things at a to hard pile and ignore them um and then like there may be a few decisions where actually getting it right really really matters and then you have enough bandwidth to actually care about those things because you're not caring about everything yeah I think that's good [ __ ] what do you want to do now I want to give you one other story have you heard this uh bill akman story of his running into the fire when everybody else was running out story The his his 4-Hour investment decision do you know this one oh man I thought it was like literally a fire well kind of it was the 08 crisis which I think to people on Wall Street felt like you know the the giant fire oh you me Bill Amman the famous Twitter influencer he invests wait he's an investor we're joking I hope you're still coming on later um all right so he tells a story of it's' 08 the financial crisis happening banks are failing like Bear Sterns fails and then this other be bank is going to fail people don't know what's going to happen Widespread Panic and the bank wacovia was on the brink and basically what he did was he did a four he's like I had four hours I I spent four hours just looking at the business of wacovia and came to a decision in four hours that the Panic was overblown and that wacovia would be saved and that Wells Fargo which ended up buying wacovia was you know farad healthier than the market believed in that moment of panic and so he made a huge investment and it was like you know one of his most lucrative Investments ever it was a 4-Hour decision and it was made at a time of extreme panic when trouble was opportunity and when everybody else was just running out you know screaming he was calm and basically looked at the situation and assessed the risk return differently it was just sort of like what you're talking about with the Scott Galloway when when FTX just feels Taboo in every way and it feels like uh you know the worst possible situation and he's like cool it's the worst possible situation at a price and there's a price for everything and the
