[Music] all right edger I thanks so much for being on the second episode of exit strategy podcast super excited to have a conversation with you I feel like you and I are both in the e-commerce space and we've never met although I've met Jack before so excited to meet you yeah that's a pleasure thank you so much for having me on it's a little bit about your background you were a the co-founder and partner at atomic and the CEO of hims and hers right now is that right okay looking forward to this conversation because I think that every every company that I talk to you today wants to be the new atomic and can you tell me first how you describe atomic is it like is it an accelerator is it like an incubator how do you describe time yes atomic is something pretty special it's it's neither a venture fund nor is it a studio model essentially atomic is a company if you sole purposes to build other companies so we have a group of twenty or thirty individuals there that are all operators and entrepreneurs and we diligence at that between 20 and 30 businesses per year and end up spinning out and evaluating the ones that we see the highest potential in and then going and funding and founding those companies with other co-founders that we bring into the fall so it's really a it's a team of operators that have a phenomenal access of pool of capital and great LPS like Peter teal and Marc Andreessen and we use that capital to build the companies that we have seed and have the best promise and the most signal from all of our tests internally okay so Tom like tries to test out 20 to 30 different business ideas per year one of those business ideas was hims and hers is that correct that's right and how much money does like atomic spend in order to test a business idea so you've like atomic has raised money independently of hims in hers and hims and hers is really raised money independent that's right how much the money does a Tom expenditure to test a business idea so traditionally we'll start with something like 50 to five thousand to get a little bit of signal and then it might expand up into a hundred or two hundred thousand but you're talking about relatively small seed checks necessary for one or two individuals to build prototypes get data call people try to sell things try to understand product market fit positioning price points offers etc and then if then when we get that data we're able to actually look at it relative to to ten or fifteen other companies that are in that incubation process and look at metrics side by side to see where outliers exist so for example with hymns and hers you know the the crazy part about that company was we used about fifty thousand dollars to get that company started and with fifty thousand we built a prototype over the weekend and this was in you know 2016 a prototype over the weekend that would let men download a mobile app and answer questions about their health and then sign up for a package relating to different types of medical conditions that they were worried about and that prototype it was it was called clubroom at the time and that's because in my gym there was an old deodorant bottle called clubroom and I said okay that seems like a good test name what's wrong with that so we literally got this thing up and running two or three people on a weekend and in the first five weeks of that prototype we did a million in sales signing up for for the offer and again nothing was built yet it was signing up for a waitlist they put in a credit card and then I would manually email them and say hey you've been added to the list you know total total really testing right kind of zero to one face but that that cost just fifty thousand dollars and it was at that point that we were able to look back look into customers that had come in look at their profiles look at their willingness to pay and decided that there was a real demand to go and build that company and so how much you spend fifty thousand dollars to build a mobile app how much would like cold clubroom how much of that is done internally versus externally look or your operators sort of developing the apps and putting them on the App Store or do you get to that externally so all of that is internally so we you spend money on Facebook ads to try and get people to download the app and sign up that's right depending on on the company whether it's a consumer app you might try traditional distribution methods like an Instagram or Facebook or Google or Direct Mail or radio or whatever it is if it's a b2b company it might be sales to tests like sales calls automated calls and understand price points and offerings but essentially that capital is used to build the prototype and find what I like to call some type of proprietary distribution channel that gives us confidence we can scale this business successfully not only that we know how to build something that's amazing but we know how to get it in front of people in an efficient manner that gives us confidence we can we can grow this company in a unique way and so aside from hims and hers what are some of the other idea is that you guys have launched yeah there's quite a few so a company bungalow which is a cool living company based in the proscenium as well over there or they've raised quite a lot of capital from Khosla founders fund a lot of big names home bound which is a construction company it's helping families during natural disasters around the country rebuild and have that supply-demand model actually be much more efficient so that people can fill the homes much quicker much easier much more on time much more capital efficient and that companies raised maybe 40 to 50 million from Google Ventures and thrive capital there's a company terminal which is actually a remote education company that brings together recruiting and engineering into one hub so you can imagine this company going around the world building amazing hubs for engineers to come learn and work with Silicon Valley startups hims for example we've been a client of this company for many years most of our engineering team is scattered through Mexico and through Canada and they all live in different terminal offices so those are a few er a few of the the most recent companies that have broken out and raised you know maybe 40 or 50 million in the last time can you give us an idea of like three companies that you thought would break out and didn't like you know what I really love about Bessemer Ventures is that they have this thing on their website would they have the anti pork like you know we missed the opportunity investment Airbnb at FedEx seven times at Apple I feel like all VC funds to do that like whenever I was trying to raise money I was like that's where should be the first company I go to do because they're like humble about their origins what if what are a few of the companies that you guys try taking bait and didn't work out particularly guys who got past phase one past the $50,000 and got into now $150,000 yeah you know there there's a lot of them right and then that best summer page is I think one of my favorite pages on the internet frankly I think it's incredible you know there was a sleep apnea company we have family members that have suffer from sleep apnea there's about thirty to forty million people in the United States at have sleep apnea and the process of getting diagnosed tested and actually getting the equipment for CPAP machines is is excruciatingly painful and expensive and so the idea was could we make that easier for people to do diagnosis and treatment and actually get the equipment could make that business work then that was a really unfortunate one that we tried there was a business in pet insurance his years ago I was really passionate about this everyone loves their dogs willingness to pay for your animal is in many situations higher than a willingness to pay for yourself or your partner couldn't get the economics of the business to work so this was a pet life insurance or pet health insurance a pet pet life actually was pet his pet health insurance I'm sorry not life insurance okay so yeah you know there's been there's been a lot of them and most of the ideas that hymns and hers are really internal ideas right it's it's things that that us as partners are really passionate about and really want to exist in the world and so hymns and hers was one that I was very passionate about wanting to exist terminal which allows you know any company to hire dozens of incredibly talented engineers from anywhere in the world very quickly that was something that us as founders as always we've always wanted and so we like building businesses that we you know can really resonate with and I think that's where you know we've had a lot of success is just there's that instinct and building something you're passionate about and then we're like as these ideas sort of are born and grow up how do you how do you staff then so you know for hims in hers it's easy you're the co-founder and a partner at Atomics it's simple with bungalow with terminal do you hire internally defined CEOs or do you look externally yes we you what we do is something called a founder and residence program so at any given time at atomic there might be five or ten individuals that are internal founders that are working with the partners and working with the operating teams so prototype and test ideas and they are really the leader is taking a charge of bringing those tests to market and so when bungalow for example Andrew and Justin are the two co-founders of that company they were founders in residence with us for many many months looking into a vast range of ideas and we're prototype many ideas as a group we saw incredible signal around the co living space the desire to live in a city the desire to have a more affordable life the desire to live with people in a community and they were really excited about it and we were excited about it and so we jointly decided to found that business together and so in almost all circumstances the founders of those companies started as founder residents operators internally helping us evaluate ideas and then they choose a path once they get that passion and that conviction for an idea and so that happens and that happened with you with hims and hers and then and then what is the next step so you've got a conviction around it well I guess first you do clubroom this is this app is clubrooms just available for when you're pitching clubroom and running ads for it are you running ads for like certain types of things are you saying hey we're gonna provide you with you know the generic version of propecia we're gonna provide you with generic version of Viagra or is it one or the other or is it yeah when we were pitching clubroom it was it was a range of all those so when we were we were exploring what conditions for men really resonated most at in an efficient at an efficient CAC worthy of holding a business right and so at the end of the day these companies really are successful when you can build a recurring engine right there's a willingness to pay there's a margin structure and there's a proprietary set of distribution channels that allows you to pour an amount of capital into that and grow the company and so you we we look looked at a range of different medical conditions that have different margin profiles different medication offerings and then went to market and tested those to get a good sense of what men would be willing to pay for each of them so you test price point right out of the gate as well price annoying offering the whole thing and so after you've spent the $50,000 or $100,000 sort of proving the business model you raise you got to raise money right you're gonna need a team you're gonna need to build a much better app that like where you're not manually emailing customers do you raise money from atomic or do you go to VC's yes so at that point into its mix of both so atomic has a large fund that's able to contribute in two rounds what I did and I think what most of our founders have done is they they bring in other or create partners into the round so that you get even smarter people that are experts in its different areas depending on your business and so for my company went when I decided to found this we decided to partner with Kirsten green at forerunner and Josh Kushner or at thrive the two of them are you know incredible human beings some of the best investors I've ever worked with today and still to this day are exceptionally valuable and involved in the business you even on a you know week tweet basis but they were truly experts in how you revolutionize old industry with new behavior new business models new brands right it's really moving that from you know Harry's and Warby to Dollar Shave Club and the chat glossier and bonobos and the list goes on and on and so at that point when we decided to build hims we raised from those two funds anatomic also participated in that round and that was really our seed financing and how much did you raise in that seed financing you know don't quote me on this but it's summer I want to say between five and six million I can really reserve and what's the what's been the total fund raise to date and can you talk about valuation I'd certainly seen that you're a unicorn certainly got to be nine figures that you've raised how much have you raised what's that valuation well yeah we've raised over 200 million today and and yes the last the last public valuation was was over a billion dollars and and so that's kind of where we're at right today gotcha and then can you talk a little bit about structure I'm curious because you know when uh when you're building a business generally you know the founder controls the entire business until they start raising money and then VC start owning a share of the business and at some point either the founder still has majority share or doesn't have much already share but there was really like to parties founders and D seats here there's a third party where there's atomic so who sits on the board who controls the board like what is that structure look like yeah so the way we think about anatomic is it is essentially that your co-founding your company with the time atomic is a group of operators that are highly incentivize to make sure that all of the companies we found are wildly successful it so there are a number of partners at atomic each of those partners will take lead with different companies and with different founders and and and be essentially the operational lead for atomic with that company and so the way you think about it is as you join atomic you're going to be co-founding your business with a huge group of individuals and this group of individuals from strategic finance distribution marketing sales strategy accounting legal HR are all available to you and and not on a kind of as needed service basis but truly as a part of your team and so it's a pretty incredible advantage that allows me as a founder or anybody else as a founder to focus on the one or two things that actually matters for your business right and that might be building the brand it might be finding the distribution channel it might be sourcing the product but but it allows you to co-found the business at scale and so structurally that's what the business looks like your co-founding it and you're splitting equity depending on the situation and then when you raise external capital we are all equally diluted by that external capital and so who decides for his external capital look do me the you know I was a member of the I was a you know residence member an entrepreneur in residence at an atomic and I was like okay great this business is working you all sort of agreed to that I go out and pitch funds am I making the call is atomic making the call or like what's happening there no the the the CEO that gets put in place and is taking charge of that effort has complete autonomy to make the decision of who they want to work with what partner is what be sees you know at this point atomic and Isis partners have worked with you know the vast majority of GPE is at the funds in the valley and so we can give guided based on expertise or specialty or past experience with a certain fund or a certain set of individuals but it is always that individual who finds that kind of personal connection with the board members and the new investors that they want to be bringing in gotcha okay so it sounds like the CEO has a lot more autonomy and can you talk about who sits on the board of hims at hers or is that confidential the the board is confidential at this point but it's fairly reflective of the major investors in the company so just like any other structured startup and board your primary investors are the ones that are taking board seats for the company gotcha okay okay I want to dig into hims and hers a little bit more and I think we're maybe where I can start is where I can I can start by explaining what it does and you can correct me if I'm wrong since you're actually running the business perfect you know it's a men's wellness brand and well hims is a men's wellness brand versus a women's wellness and basically you're trying to make medicine available that has been scientifically proven to do what it does without the headaches and inconveniences I mean to walk into a doctor's office get pretty you know get a prescription and do a bunch of before you get your medicine I think that's a good way to put it you know the way I'd put it is that hems and hers is a healthcare company that makes it easier for you to get access to experts and the medicine and treatments you need for a range of dozens of different conditions you're worried about that's a great weight so if you're you know like when I was doing research about hims and hers I saw I you know I read a bunch of other interviews that you've done you said you did a million dollars in sales the first week that you launched the brand that you launched guys and that was the worst week you've ever had that's right that's absolutely bananas like you know in 2013 like Casper which at the time was certainly the DTC darling of the world did a million dollars their first month and everyone was like how is that humanly possible and you've like move the bar much much higher to do a million dollars in your first week I'm out there somewhere that's gonna do a million in their first day in the next few years yeah yeah I'm sure there is as well and like you know I hope it comes out of the top and I'm sure the bar is move move can you talk a little bit about how you achieve the million was the million dollars in sales the first week generally results of you going to guys who'd signed up at club room saying hey come by this or was it something else and more importantly week to you did another million dollars how did you get those customers in the door yeah it's a great question so you know the way in which we did that and I think reflecting on it was having a very solid understanding of the type of guy we're gonna go after the type of messaging that worked type of brand that resonated and the type of offering that we knew they wanted to buy and so you know while people say we did a million dollars in our first week they think okay what we'd launched and all of a sudden when we started learning that first day when we started learning people just came and started running towards us and I think that's where there's a big big education gap in fact there was probably two and a half years before that when we were really understand our person right we were getting customer insights we were talking to men we're asking them about how it made them feel to be losing their hair or to be struggling sexually or to be feeling like they didn't have energy or they had acne in their mid mid 20s or late 30s and that didn't seem right but really understanding who our person was and so there was those years of doing that research and in particular years of figuring out what is the brand that activates that customer right and the some of the key insights were stigma is a huge problem right there was this concept of men being too tough to take care of themselves and brushing it off and so there's this whole kind of toxic masculinity that we had to crush as a brand to encourage and empower people to go and take care of themselves and so that was a set of insights there's a whole telemedicine component as you said like I'm the last person want to go to like the doctors and I'll really only go and less of like bleeding from the head or I've broke an arm or something and so if I can make that easier from my phone 90% of our orders take place on their mobile device talk to a talk to a physician click buttons answer questions take photos and then and then I get access to the things I need it like that's make it simple right so there is these insights we knew needed to happen and so you know well we had an incredible first week and I think it's an amazing sign of the success I don't want to you know undervalue the fact that it was probably two years of work to understand the customer in order to launch on that day and say we have a high degree of confidence what we're launching people are gonna love because we've been talking to them for a really long time definitely I absolutely think that's really worthy of being said you know one of the other things I saw when I was doing research for this was that multiple branding agencies have taken credit for building buildings that's right can you set the record straight who was the branding agency that you guys actually worked with so we worked with a lot of granting agencies to be totally honest and what we did was and this was I think some of the secret sauce because some of the insights coming out of this were you could build dozens of different types of brands but we knew we wanted to do was build a brand that good cross-gender we new hymns and hers or men and women together was gonna be critical because we had this idea of a future healthcare brand and that wasn't only men and it wasn't only women and so we didn't want to build a brand that only segmented two men we wanted to build a brand that was accepting of where you felt you were as a man you could be a young old straight gay black white doesn't matter but it needed to be as modern and fresh and leaning into that that flexibility that modern masculinity has sure and so what we did was we actually put about a lot of the agencies and they came back with concepts and then from there we filter down to a couple agent season in particular we worked with partners in Spade now in New York which i think is one of the best branding agencies in the world and what we did with them was actually designed multiple brands so we identified them as a great creative eye talent and strategic talent and we actually designed five or six brands and saw how they felt and we sat on them for weeks literally weeks different names some of the names or a triple point McCoy we almost named a company McCoy there's Admiral was one of them and and so this process of finding out who we were really happened with partners in Spade and then what we did is we took a lot of that work and we brought in some expert teams like Gin Lane out of New York our VP of design is a guy named Daniel Kanger who ran creative team at gin lane for a decade he joined us recently a few months ago and he's been working with us from the beginning and we took that brand understanding from partners and state and we said how do we know visualize this how do we art direct it how we put it on sites on mobile devices and went from there and so you know the reality is is that we had a lot of people giving us input and we had a lot of people designing different concepts and then what we did internally at the end of the day is we are directed every single photo shoot by we I mean me and Hillary are you know a co-founder mind and a head of product right now we were on the shoot we were writing the copy we were owning that spirit of the brand so that really was as pure to what we wanted to be as possible gotcha okay so you've got branding coming from multiple agencies with sort of your curation and your vision being executed you've got all this feedback that you've received from customers and two and a half years of studying who you think is gonna buy the product and what you think the barriers are to buying these products already you launch and you have a million dollars in sales the first week you know one of the things I've heard you talk a lot about and you mention this earlier during our conversation as well as a proprietary marketing proprietary marketing strategy which is you don't want to be subject to the whims of option based marketing platforms like Facebook or Instagram so first I want to understand are you able to advertise on Facebook and Instagram or are you not able to yeah I'm always curious what you know you are able to yeah just gotcha and then yeah you know those you know I built an e-commerce business that was largely based off of auction based advertising and found it to be successful but certainly you know a roller coaster ride what we've told me some of the marketing mecalac marketing things that you do that like you know certainly everyone is seeing your you know your television ads and everyone has seen your out-of-home ads everyone knows that you advertise on top of journals and you know in the train station as you work we're are some more unique things that you guys do and tell me how this sort of tell me how you're buying this type of advertising like you know advertising in trains in New York anyone can do advertising in urinals and stadiums a lot of people haven't done like are you rolling up these stadiums or is there a third party that you were working with right so the the way we think about this is we want to create inventory not buy inventory and so our entire marketing team and our entire marketing strategy goes into every room they walk into in every store and every gym and every locker room and every restaurant and their eyes are looking every bar and their eyes are looking around for literally things we could write that we could have a relationship with and and the criteria is where is your turn cause to her man or woman and it's different for different medical conditions right maybe Edie is something you want to talk about when you're in a urinal but hair loss is something you want to talk about when you're in the gym locker room and you're looking in the mirror and you're realizing that you know you're thinning it top but something like birth control maybe is appropriate in a completely different setting for women and and acne for women is appropriate in a completely other environment and so this is our marketing type of thinks about it and the reason we think about this is because for better or worse the auction based marketing channels are effective and they're efficient and for that reason companies become dependent on them and in building companies in the last decade at atomic I've seen a lot of companies that become too dependent on for sure in a negative of course what happened is the saturation rates as you want to continue to grow and pump more dollars into those channels the costs go up the curves get worse the retention of the customer gets worse and all of a sudden you're really stuck in this limbo and so the strategy for us is we want to have as little of our capital being deployed in free market auction-based platforms and we want to be owning proprietary relationships with other partners and so there is no third-party agency right there's no like Blackshear market for buying a urinal you have to go to the SF Giants and say hey I love the walls and the urinals and and I don't think you're making any money off of it what if we paid you X so I'm going to like the guys who own equinox like related properties I've been like hey we want to advertise in the locker room at Equinox I mean I would imagine they'd say no but is that something that you guys have done in the past I've talked to the executive team at Equinox many times you know they're there are a lot of different opportunities when you start opening your mind and so yeah you know for example for all types of stuff we were sitting in a bar one night talking about it and I was like tearing I've got this nerve root hat nervous habit of tearing the bar coasters right and like pieces and I look and it's like a Budweiser bar coaster like well somebody arty was finally just bah I don't we do that you know we're sitting there so now if you're in a New York Bar San Francisco bar in a good chunk of the bars the coasters are him right with hilarious statements and branded and the amount of text messages I get from friends and family saying hey this is incredible I would have never imagined that it just came from the creativity that we've empowered our team to have them hey go find opportunity I do have to work with both individually to do that or do it can you do that at scale with a certain like coaster manufacturer yeah you try to do both yeah and you end up having to do both yeah at a certain point you get efficiencies and you find individuals that own multiple bars or network bars or maybe it's alcohol distributor or something right but it but it is it is coming from this first place just kind of like open creativity of finding opportunities yeah you know what's crazy is during this conversation I've realized that you're the first startup that is not subject to the immediate needs of driving revenue today like in order to build marketing channels like urinals at SF Giants are you having multiple conversations with the executive team that related properties you need to be able to be you have to be comfortable with the idea that the revenue you generate from conversations you have today will not come from the press and at most startups they don't have that type of like timeless you know you have to be like hey I'm now I'm gonna have a conversation about generating revenue in the next few days and how is that possible is it because your investors are more long-term focused is it because you already have such a large moat in terms of revenue and in terms of capital or look we're like why is it that you're singularly not focused on revenue in the next 30 days he's a great question you know when I started the company and I think in part because I've built a number of companies before the opportunity before for his and hers in my mind and is to build a multi-generational public company like this is a large opportunity you're talking about probably 80% of healthcare for moving to digital telemedicine in the next five years or so that's a huge huge opportunity maybe one of the biggest left in that I'm aware of right you've got to read about Commerce you've got real estate transportation and then you've got healthcare and it hasn't been touched yet and so you know from the beginning that was the vision and when I went and pitched this to Kirsten and Josh I made it very clear that's what I'm going for I have no desire for this company to be acquired you know a couple hundred million and that's a great exit and then boom I'm sitting on a beach no desire like this is one of those ones you really just put your head down and go for it and in order to do that you have to invest in the brand and investing the brand what that actually means is losing money okay you have to lose a certain amount of money for the purpose of building equity based value and relationships and communications with your customers it is always cheaper to buy an advertisement on Facebook right or to buy short Google dad at low volume but you can only build so much from a true depth of relationship with customers and the variation of customers by doing those types of channels and so what I made very clear to the investors was we're gonna allocate a certain amount of capital to these types of initiatives where every single month we're going to be testing we're gonna be learning we're gonna be making brand investments and then for the other chunk of capital which is still the majority chunk of capital it's gonna be exceptionally efficient and we're gonna hold ourself accountable to real numbers and making money back and they signed up for that and to this day we still have those parameters in place where there's a necessity to change have the percentages change or are they pretty stones have been roughly the same and the members have goes to like the majority goes to naan bread or like more like I don't wanna call it direct response but more like I'm looking for revenue in this short term versus building brick that's right the larger bottom first I've been pressed by your marketing budget then because like I see like you know I know how much you know ads in the New York City Subway cost and those are brand advertisements right and like that is a lot of money already and so really impressed by the marketing budget how do you work on attribution when it comes to like the idea that you have these chunks that are happening today and chunks that are brand value like we're you know your tests you know I think that's really hard like I'll give you an example at native we were constantly trying to drive people into stores at Target Walmart right and so we tried digital ads and we're like you know do we see a lift in this certain zip code if we bump hard these people with ads and and so we ran those types of those types of tests how do you know if like you know if you're owning coasters and you're owning the San Francisco Giants urinals what's working what's not yeah so the only way you do this is through a set of control tests right so depending on the brand campaign maybe you're talking about a TV you identify the zip codes that those TV commercials went live you look at spiked attribution and Al assist of the minute it went live and and the historical trends before that minute and the six minutes after that and then look at the zip code you know two blocks away and see if you got that same that same day right so you need big sense maybe the business of giants is much harder are you looking at different games and some Giants is the same thing right so again 90% purchases are taking place on mobile look at the day games look at the times of those games look at the traffic during those games and understand right and so you can do spike based analysis based on zip in that type of world and then the also thing you can do is is more traditional and this is never accurate to a perfect degree but at least it's directionally helpful is post purchase and pre-purchase surveys right like how did you hear about us I heard about you from seeing it on an advertisement somewhere which advertisement boom and then you can get an idea at least proportionally where that that uncharacterized traffic is coming from right because it's traffic that's coming directly to your homepage everyone will say hey that's free traffic that's organic yeah the vast majority of its not organic you pay for it somewhere and you have to figure out what bought it from yeah and can you tell me a little bit about the marketing channels that you spend money on today so a big bucket is still sort of direct response to the big buckets brand what are the top three you know there really are no top three channels it's it's buckets and then within the buckets are dozens of little buckets so you've got the traditional digital channels that you can think of right i traditional digital's one bucket right that's like all the Facebook's and Google's and instagrams and tic TOCs and snapchats and dating apps and yeah Philly all that kind of stuff there's an audio bucket right you've got all types of audio people here podcast ads at your streaming ads that your radio talk hosts things of that sort podcasts there's TV buckets right and then there's very non-traditional buckets that like urinals or planes flying over Coachella or coasters sitting at bars or things like that is that the order of buckets that we spend money digital that audio then to eat now okay what does look in audio is podcasts the number one bucket there are the word podcast as there's like five let me change the question then in digital is Facebook / Instagram the number one bucket its largest within digital okay what's another one that's larger within digital well within digital you also have dating apps you have affiliate networks you've got partnerships with education sites right yeah I mean there's I mean there are again the the traditional things like Facebook and I'm not gonna tell you all the things we do because your listeners need to literally think about what their product does what their customers need and then think okay where are they and how do I talk to them and so we do that for our customers all the time that doesn't mean that Facebook and Instagram and Twitter and all those are not tested but they're they're not really the majority they're not the majority for you the traditional digital spend it's not the majority I've spent for you okay gotcha yeah I couldn't agree more with the idea that like you know you have to speak to your customers where they are and what works for one business won't work for I wish they wish somebody had told me this list of server bullets but unfortunately you just have to really understand who your person is and then go think about where they're spending their time couldn't agree more with that okay so you did 1 million dollars in sales the first week can you talk about like revenue or growth year over year where are you at and from perspective of understanding that you're spending a good portion of your marketing dollars on non direct response ads but on more brand equity ads are you profitable or are you not today we are not profitable we are relatively close so I'd say you know in the in the coming years when we want to pull will that switch we are definitely capable of pulling a switch which is a great position to be in currently we reinvest essentially all of those profits back into the engine and grow into new conditions and so we recently launched a behavioral health I'm sorry a primary care category that has everything from like hey you know asthma and allergies and sinus infections and UTI Eisley cetera and so continue to expand on that front from a kind of public numbers I think what's public is we've done we did over a hundred million in sales last year we did about over a million telemedicine visits in the last year year and a half on the platform so that's actually a patient talking with the physician and getting a treatment evaluation so those are like a asynchronous or synchronous communication it totally depends on the condition and the state so it's both and it also depends on what the patient prefers and then the company's only been live for two years right and so you can think of growth rates if we did 100 you know hundred million in sales last year it was a pretty fast growth rate from the year before yeah certainly was incredible growth I don't think anyone is questioning growth [Music] pretty phenomenal what can you talk a little bit about categories that are leading that growth and also whether it's his or hers that are leading that growth yeah so the historical categories which are hymns which have been around you know a year or two a year and a half longer than hers are still the majority of the business right given the time the majority of things that we are launching today and that we plan to be launching this year there's may be I think 50 launches in 2020 that the rolling out each launches a different medical condition that a patient can get evaluated for on the platform the vast majority of those are hymns and hers together so they're they're non gender-specific treatments and these are things like you know the majority of things we care about right people worry about sleep they're worried about anxiety they worry about their health or immunity cholesterol right like big normal human stuff and so there are they're non gender-specific and so there's a pretty big investment from our side to being to bring those offerings essentially out to market together with hymns and hers in a unified way got it and so it is the majority of the business it can talk a little bit about categories does it go like I've looked at some of your categories I think it's Edie hair loss and then I think it's also cold sores is that right those are a few of them some of the big ones you you've got acne and anti-aging you then have supplements for sleep immunity heart health and then you've got the sexual health stuff which is you know STDs and erectile dysfunction as well and for the anti-aging stuff is it like retinol ugh is it retinol as you guys are prescribing or is it over-the-counter stuff it's also all those categories are prescription categories so we are actually compounding prescription tretinoin in high concentrations that are custom formulas for your skin type your age the type of acting your experience and we're the type of anti-aging that you're struggling with and getting those shipped to you overnight and so do you guys own a pharmacy at this.look I imagine there's a lot of regulatory tailwinds that are aimed that are going in your direction patents are expiring with Viagra states are opening up their medicine telemedicine laws um do you guys own a pharmacy or are you working with a third-party both but so we work with a number of pharmacy partners in a provider network and then we also have publicly announced a very large of a four hundred thousand square-foot pharmacy operation of fulfillment center in Ohio that will be going live in the next few months and how did you like I guess were there any you know obstacles when you guys were growing the regulatory side of things you know um well let me give you an example uber and airbnb those guys were like look we're gonna do this we're gonna run into a bunch of regulatory hurdles and when we run into those regulatory hurdles we're gonna jump we're gonna figure out ways around them or over them and sometimes that's right and sometimes that's not certainly a little bit harder with medicine and I don't mean to like say that yeah I think I think what you guys are doing is phenomenal and genuinely providing a real service to consumers who are either too embarrassed or can't afford to go to the doctor yeah so I'm really like I'm genuinely thankful that you guys exist in the world um you know we're there regulatory hurdles or would you like with you that were air B&B side of the spectrum or were you on the Procter & Gamble side of the spectrum um probably neither right we're somewhere in the middle we've a you know a very veteran executive team in these areas in particular you know our chief legal officer ran the telemedicine practice at Jones Day for a decade our head of regulatory or SVP of regulatory affairs and legislation of Public Policy ran these initiatives at lyft and it's square and its benefits right then that's been doing it for for over a decade and so our coms executives ran it at lift as well and so when you look at maybe lift verse over at PG or PNG they were they're kind of in the middle and I think that's maybe where we fall from a risk tolerance standpoint you know we are always pushing on behalf of our customers but we are going to the regulator's and we're going to the medical boards in in sit-down conversations explaining why we think this is right as a to breaking the law and then having the conversation afterwards so I think we have been very careful you know to to be as as safe as possible to make sure that we are the gold standard for telemedicine because this market of telemedicine is growing and changing and adapting so quickly and so we've kind of put it on ourselves and I feel like you have that's been a really important part of our strategy to be the the talking point to these medical boards and explaining the benefits of all the things you said and so in order to do that you have to keep the credibility of following the rules and following the laws and it actually helped change the laws and we've done that in a number of states we've actually had laws changed in the last few months and in my last couple of years and I would suspect that continued to happen as these legislators understand the benefits of telemedicine like you know to that effect you know you're talking about being a gold standard of telemedicine how do you think about your competitors you know some of your competitors are well-funded some of them less funded is it you know if people are all prescribing generic viagra or generic propecia it's sort of a race to the bottom to that effect are you his door is your thought process because hey I want to create you know proprietary medicines sort of like the anti-aging which are customized to people to build remote or how do you think about separating yourself from your competitors yeah you know I think it's really interesting that him to hers the vast majority of what people buy our treatment solutions that are fairly comprehensive and so they might include like you said a generic pharmaceutical like finasteride or like a sildenafil or like about Rex type medication but what they also include are shampoos and conditioners and moisturizers and custom topical solutions and vitamins and not offering and we see that across the board when customers come to us they don't come to us because they are looking for cheap drugs you know those options have always existed you've had online pharmacies Canadian pharmacies exist for years what we see from our customers is they're in their teens and 20s and 30s and they're learning these conditions for the first time and they're coming because they want to get educated by a physician and they want a comprehensive treatment that's custom and tailored to them and so you know III think the commoditization of the pharmaceuticals should happen right because they are generics and can be affordable and they should be cheap and the more that companies exist in the space the better for all customers and I think we will continue to be able to differentiate by offering real solutions and a lot of times those solutions are flexibility and options and customized care and as part of that might include one of these medicines does that push back against like this scientific background of the you know of the proven medicines so like if you're using propecia which you know the FDA has said helps you keep your hair and you're also selling you know if you're so like rogue a and I understand that you know they're also oft a regulated but look are there like fda-approved shampoos for instance that product you know keep those allow you to keep your hair yeah you know there's always that spectrum right and I think one of the things that that I believe is that and this is this comes from a kind of deep understanding of our customer our customer when they think about their health it includes pharmaceutical medicines on one side and including food meditation on the other side and they're both home care like they truly are about health care right and so what I believe we need to offer as a modern platform is flexibility say hey if you're worried about sleep there's a lot of things we could do there's cognitive behavioral therapy if you haven't tried that it's incredibly effective there's things letter over-the-counter and safe that you can use on occasion like a melatonin chamomile l-theanine blend there's Chinese medicine that has been proven to be effective and then there's also pharmaceuticals right there are there there are side effects there are pros and cons to all of these and I think what we've seen is that customers in our demographic that are coming into their 20s and 30s and 40s they want that flexibility and depending on the severity of what they're experiencing and what they've tried in the past they might have different spectrums for different conditions and so we as a platform one we are always standing by the statement that everything on the platform has the best medical clinical experience it can have but doesn't necessarily mean it's always FDA approved sure but when you talk to a doctor about supplements 9 out of 10 are going to say if you're gonna try something that's the one to try yeah I mean that's really what we're gonna always lean on that's fair I appreciate that sort of clarity really quick questions about understanding your team size because I know we're running up against some time I'm how large is the team of doctors and nurses that you have on your staff that sort of prescribe medication we have over 300 physicians and providers on the platform and how quickly are they writing prescriptions is there like a metric where you're like on average a doctor can write a prescription like on average doctors are writing prescriptions every 7 minutes it's not it's not a metric we we choose it all the provider networks essentially have complete independence for how they treat patients we are the platform that's connecting the patient to that external provider network and so they get paid off essentially on an hourly basis just to see as many patients as they're able to see what is the rate of people that they prescribe medicines to it totally depends on the medical condition you know so there are safe medications when you're talking about like a Trenton Owen for acne or you might see you know 90% of those patients coming through the door qualify for that medication and maybe 10% based on other medications they're on do not and then there's more serious medications like let's say a birth control that has blood clot potential depending on the patient you might have a 50 or 60% prescribed rate and so it really depends on the physicians understanding of that patient and the patient before they get to that point goes through a full couple like consultation with that position so they're talking about the medical history the drugs they're on any side effects they've experienced in the past etc so the range is quite quite large or just depending on the medicine gotcha letters like makes a lot of sense two questions actually two more questions actually one is how as Kovan 19 sort of affected the business has it been great for because no one wants to go to the doctor and I mean great with the understanding that this is a catastrophe for the catastrophe for the world or has it been taught like how is covin you know it certainly it affects team morale by virtue of the fact that all of you guys aren't able to go to the same day how is it affecting visitor you know I think what I've experienced most from the Cova 19 tragedy is that our team is energized like I've never seen it before it is a full-on war time mentality within within the divisional office at the moment within slack like I've never seen anybody on our team act and so you know we are in a position I think like many to actually change our priorities to help the situation you've got a whole population of people staying at home those people at home are still struggling with asthma and bug bites and UTIs and yeast infections and acne and and sinus infections etc right but it is more important than ever for them to stay at home both for the safety of them themselves their family and their community but also to give as much relief as we possibly can to the health care system right and not going in and for non life critical illnesses into what I've seen is our team be energized to think about first principles what can we use our assets for we have physicians that are experts we have telemedicine platforms we have a pharmacy fulfillment brand how do we get things to customers that can help them and help the health providers that are on the front lines and so you saw that we launched the primary care offering a week ago that opens up a huge telemedicine platform and and I hope in the in the coming weeks and months we'll be able to continue to expand that to more things because I think from a business standpoint that's what I've seen more than anything is our team is trying to read prioritize in order to help the current situation and so it has there been an acceleration in people's adoption of telemedicine in the last you know month I think across the board there has been an acceleration right when you have people at home and unable to go into a physician's office telemedicine is the perfect solution and so I think across the board people that are working in digital environments whether that's tell education telemedicine videoconferencing right like this those businesses are seeing customers come to them in exchange for the in-person opportunities contra okay my final question is about the state of the director consumer industry you know I read this quote by Gary Vaynerchuk where he said 98% of direct-to-consumer businesses are out of business right now and just don't know it basically meaning that they're addicted to the Facebook's and Pinterest of the world their unit economics will never work there's been a come-to-jesus moment with the failure of brand lists and with you know the headwinds around outdoor voices where where's the industry five years from now look at one is Gary Vaynerchuk right and where is the industry five years from now you know I think there are aspects of what Gary said that are right there have been a number of companies and a large swell of companies in the last couple of years that have been deploying capital into open auction based platforms like we talked about then have completely upside-down economics and it's not because they're building their brand and invest strategically but because literally the economics don't make sense right but they're trying to figure them out and every founder is always working their butt off to try to make them work and so you know in an environment of the last few years when you've had the capital and the investor is willing to fund that experimentation it's beautiful in an environment like today where I think it's gonna be exceptionally hard to raise capital I think flat rounds will be the next two to three x rounds you know because it would be so hard to get I think I think he's right and that a lot of those companies are gonna struggle to get profitable and they're gonna struggle to raise capital and so I do think that is a reality I think the market has been able to finance the exploration for a number of years and we're now getting to a point where that willingness to finance the Rd is no longer there and so companies need to be exceptionally efficient at finding their profitable cohorts finding their profitable customers and channels and focusing on those because in a situation like we have right now with the markets and with cope in 1905 the next year and two you have grown substantially and I think as a founder that's the only thing I'm thinking about and the thing that I would recommend all other founders you know and what are the things they've done to in order to like um in order to focus on that so if you're if you're focused on survival or maintaining or like ensuring that you get through this crisis but if you pull back on marketing have you ever been hiring freezes boring like look full you know full steam ahead damn the torpedoes you know so we we're in a very privileged position in that we have you know a material balance sheet of capital in the bank that gives us a flexibility to get to a point where we're profitable and so you know we're not dependent on raising outside capital which is phenomenal but we did immediately institute hiring freezes comp freezes and if we communicated this to the team saying hey we need to evaluate the impact of what's happening to the business we have no idea what it'll be it might be positive or might be terrible it might be completely trivial but until then let's all just stay calm and let's stay as we are and learn and look at the data to make decisions and so we're in that process right now of evaluating data in real time as it's coming in day over day and week over week and until then we're not making any big strategic moves until we can get a good sense of what's gonna happen got it fantastic really appreciate the time I drove like love chatting with you love being able to see a direct consumer business that has a long-term focus instead of a short-term one not sure I've ever seen that in the history of my life before and you know congratulations a lot of props to you not only for all the success of atomic but really hims and hers is the gold standard of direct-to-consumer businesses today I hope you're incredibly proud of what you've accomplished like you know 20 years from now you might be looking back on your life and being like this is gonna be the first line of my obituary and you know I I hope you feel that pride today and don't only feel at 20 years from now thank you thank you appreciate that great thanks for the time really appreciate it awesome [Music]

Imperfect foods and imperfect produce doesn't usually make it onto the shelves of the grocery store. The produce that doesn't look appealing enough for the consumer won't make it. Some companies saw an opportunity in this and started selling the produce to restaurants and other businesses.

[Music] hey everybody this is Nick De Santis from the hustle thanks for tuning in to another episode of behind the hustle the show where we bring you inside some of the stories that we are working on and introduce you to some of the interesting people in our world so for today's episode I wrote a story last for a newsletter last week about the 54 billion dollar wedding industry that has really really fallen on hard times right now obviously and that's true of pretty much anybody that's associated with the events world knows what this is about you have couples across the country that are canceling their wedding plans or in some cases postponing them and it's really sort of thrown the entire industry into a little bit of chaos but in some cases there are a few couples who decided to go through with their weddings anyway using technology like zoom or Facebook live or some of the other platforms that are out there and what was especially interesting about this story is that after we published it last week one of our readers reached out to us and said yeah actually me and my my wife we actually did this a couple days ago and we'd love to talk to you about it and I thought their story was really interesting and and wanted to share with all of you so I'm here to welcome in dan-and-jenn Wilson who live in Orlando Florida and we'll be celebrating two weeks as newlyweds on this coming Saturday welcome to you both thank you thanks for having us yeah I really appreciate it so I think the first thing that I want to ask you is something that everybody wants to know and we talked about a little bit the other days how did the two of you meet yeah so we met so how fitting for a virtual wedding is we actually met online so a dating site tinder which I'm sure everyone was familiar with so tinder actually works so yeah I was actually moving to Jacksonville and so that was I wanted to meet new people and I met Dan my first week there so worked out well anything in particular stand out about that first tinder date I know that some people have memorable first dates the most normal data yeah I think both did a pretty good job of you know setting up profiles and such a way to I guess attract people that were maybe like-minded and you know we did I think for a bit of text screening beforehand to see if you know someone can actually complete a thought or have similar interests and things like that before we met face to face so it's a pretty normal dinner yeah yeah tell us a little bit about the proposal and sort of then what went into the the planning yeah so yeah it's something yeah it's kind of been on my mind you know so it's April this month this is six years we've been together and over the last couple years I know it's you know something I've been wanting to move forward with and you know asked you to marry me and there was really no question in my mind that that's the route I wanted to go but it was you know trying to think through the different options of how to propose and you know something that's maybe more practical versus you know something romantic and things like that so you know just it didn't quite have a good feeling of how to do it until really last summer so we're on vacation in Colorado and you know I thought yeah this I think could be you know a good time and you know basically went and got a ring Akil over and we you know that's the silicon rings that way so I went to a running store in the morning before we went for a hike and you know bought a couple rings just hoping to determine which size and you know style she might like I'll grab a couple you know see what happens and you know she was looking at the other part of the store so he went to the cashier I need to buy these really really quick you know cuz that would kind of ruin everything so got him shopping them on my pocket and we got to walked around and then went on our hike and you know just had them in my pocket and you know just as we got towards kind of higher elevations the people on the trail started to thin out and I say well I better do this pretty soon while I can you know convince some some kids at college kids you know so gave them my camera to take to take video and then Jen gave them Kirk here Monaco we'd get her picture you know so I wanted to be a video and then she got pictures on hers and you know yeah it was I was completely surprised I was like why do you want video what do you want a video for we'll just take pictures it was very sweet very cool very cool so you told me a little bit about sort of what you had planned for the wedding obviously I don't think anybody goes into planning their wedding thinking that Facebook live or zoom is really gonna play a role in the celebration but you guys found yourself in that in that situation pretty quickly so tell us a little bit about sort of what you were planning and then how quickly you had to turn when once you realize that that was not really going to be an option right so we we had planned a smaller wedding about 50 people since we met in Jacksonville we decided that's where we wanted to have it it was going to be simple married in a park and then have the reception at one of our favorite breweries in the and a backroom area there and we started to get kind of text messages and calls from some friends who were planning on coming to the wedding and said you know gee I don't I don't think I'm gonna be able to come with everything it was just starting to happen so for I would say quite a while we thought we would still get married same day maybe you know smaller amount of people would be there but it became very clear quickly that we wouldn't be able to do that so we very much planned and then kind of unplanned and pivoted the entire wedding just let people know that we weren't going to be able to have it one we didn't feel comfortable having it in two week we couldn't have if we wanted to because the brewery and all the restaurants and all of that obviously what we're closed or just doing very takeout type of things so that's when we decided to kind of pivot and for us our decision was but us the two of us were the most important things and so we still wanted to get married and we figured we could use technology in order to do that yeah I would say one of the things that was cool is your your whole ceremony is posted to Facebook and you can go and watch it and I did that and it was beautiful and it looked great and one of the things that was actually really cool about it is you could see in the comments threads underneath the video there was sort of anticipation starting to build as people were taking selfies with drinks and cheering you on tell us a little bit about sort of what that was like to see that anticipation build-up yeah yeah it was cool I mean it you know I think of someone we created the event you know so kind of pivoting and a little bit from something where you know we wanted a smaller in-person wedding again is because of costs and and they new restrictions as far as size and things like that but since you know we made a decision ago virtual it was like well let's open up to two more people and invite people to watch and so that was kind of neat to include more people that you know I guess it's not that they were better friends or not or whatever but just you know maybe people that would have had challenges you know traveling further or you know with with family obligations or work obligation thing like this I felt like we would actually share it within a broader grouped and maybe we would have in person with a little bit smaller group that way yeah yeah so I mean it was awesome to see the virtual part of it and everyone and we also did have there a couple people in the neighborhood who were friends with who figured out where we were doing it at who showed up obviously from a very far distance but we're still able to watch so that also made it pretty cool and so tell us a little bit about sort of the there's an interesting moment where you're actually like you're going live on Facebook tell us a little bit about the technology set up and how you actually were able to navigate that from the moment where you're you know you're Hertz probably beating out of your chest with and then you're in a situation where you have to make the texture that the technology works yeah we we did FaceTime with our friend who was marrying us and he was in Jacksonville so we had one screams that was used for FaceTime and then we had the computer and we used that for Facebook to livestream we actually had done a trial run a couple days before I think and we also had to figure out where we could get Wi-Fi in the neighborhood and have a backdrop that looks you know somewhat nice for ceremony solos all the logistics of figuring that out the end time of day because it's Florida and it's already pretty hot so if I'm not mistaken so that was you know intentional because you know with the jacket on and you know clothing and you know I was already sweating like crazy anyway so but we had a little pre-production check on you know it's technology just to kind of see well it should work it looks like we've got pretty good Wi-Fi let's let's cross our fingers and hope it stands up yeah it seemed to work so the technology went really smoothly were there other sort of logistical bumps in the road that you hit you know there's all sort of essentials around a cake and flowers and a dress and did you have any trouble with those essentials well the night before we went to the grocery store and got our wedding cake and flowers okay I would say probably 15 minutes before the wedding the gardener went by with the blower so that was a little nerve-wracking that's not gonna work and then for us an important part of our wedding was our dog as well so she we brought her and thought that she would kind of settle down but she she went crazy she kind of was just like doing laps and then in the area there and yeah I wanted to be right next to us and the only other hiccup and we talked earlier in your dress was yeah the dress well the the Jets had gotten lost oh there were yeah there were some things we had to do we it ended up I got the dress which was amazing and it was beautiful but yeah it was a scary month of don't know what I'm gonna wear hopefully not something that had to come together at the eleventh hour like the cake so tell us a little bit about sort of the reaction that you had from friends and family I'm sure there were people who were bummed obviously that they couldn't be there in person but as I said earlier the ease of connectivity makes it potentially more-- more easy for people to participate if maybe there were you know they had to come in from from from farther away so I'm curious sort of what you heard from friends and family about how it went yeah I actually think it was it was awesome I so we had so many comments on our Facebook page and from as Dan mentioned from people acquaintances co-workers that I actually feel like it made the day extra special to have so many comments and people post and like you saw the photos and people celebrating and even FaceTime with folks afterwards who wanted to talk with us and sharing the experience I thought it was awesome yeah no I agree I think it was just a great experience to a broader group of you know friends and family and co-workers and ex co-workers and things like that I kind of our circle that we could share the day with and from the from the ceremony standpoint and I think we still you know we envision having an in-person celebration party if you will hopefully this fall at some point you know in when schedules you know kind of a line but you know for the day I thought it was great to be able to share it that way that's great so you went through the ceremony obviously went through and went off without a hitch but one thing that we talked about the other day is the the the shutdowns did disrupt your honeymoon plans that too yes yeah we we had a trip to Germany plans so we both are in triathlon and I was fortunate enough to get into a race in Roth's Germany challenge Roth and that was been July fifth and so we were gonna do the race on the front end and stay extra in honeymoon in Germany so that got canceled recently which I figured it was going to probably a month or so ago just because of the state of the world there's no way they'll have it so so the honeymoon is on been deferred for a little bit we've got to figure out when it be planning the wedding we're so still I'm gonna do the race next year but you know maybe we do something yeah we will probably do a honeymoon whenever we can travel at least somewhere yeah yeah well I hope that the race does go well when you're able to to get back to it next year so one of the things I'm also curious to hear your perspective on a little bit is where we're edging into prime wedding season in the US and there are a lot of couples who are having to make similar choices to the ones that you did so I'd be curious for for other couples who might be in your shoes thinking about do we do this virtually do we postpone what are some of the factors that you would recommend other people weigh and what advice would you have for other folks who are in your shoes you know I think you know as we said here in early to mid-april you know weddings that may be planned for for May and then probably into June I think are pretty pretty high likelihood that they're probably not gonna go off as planned with you know especially than anything of size you know as it is I think our personal opinion is you know the virus kind of you know plateaus and settles down a little bit I don't know that it'll be an overnight you know rush back to you know sporting events of thousands of people or congregations of you know 50 100 200 300 people for a wedding right so you know I think over the next couple months you know as restrictions lifts it might be more of a smaller venue more intimate so if if that is what the couple is looking to do you know perhaps you can you know still accommodate something like that but you know I think anything larger than that near-term you know is gonna have to either be deferred to later in the year or look at you know other options like like virtual or you know kind of downsizing for now and you know down the road having a a larger event then you may be a little different but you know yeah I think it'll come down to personal preference and what's important to the couple is it having everybody there in person and if it is it maybe deferring it but I will say that doing it virtually I know we were both disappointed we couldn't have friends and family there together but in the end it was such a special day for us all the comments all the videos you know people just driving by and honking and you know saying hey congrats it just made the day special it was just in a different way so I think it's just preference on on how you want to do it and how you plan for it I know the logistics on all you know big weddings is a lot more so that's the other thing is just talking with vendors and figuring out you know what they can do and can they do it laters and how that all plays out so big consideration when you have a wedding especially if it's a big one so it'll you'll be celebrating two weeks on Saturday but it's been you know I would imagine two weeks in quarantine and self-isolation so how have the past two weeks been for the two of you okay great I mean you know I think it's more star status quo to some degree and then we you know been together now six years and yeah I think it's it's nice to have kind of a special bond you know so but I think kind of the day-to-day you know it's not terribly different other than you know we're kind of cooped up a little bit and fortunately here not here in Florida we we are able to get out and you know go for a run and you know we have the weather that we can do that you know go for a bike ride or something like that certainly you know keeping your distance from people and things like that so we you know we can get a getaway a little bit if we need to but I think it's been great so I agree it's been an awesome two weeks we tried to make the day of extra special and feel that way and I I feel like it did it and then we kind of got back into the normal group of things so have you thought oh uh one thing that I people always ask me is sort of what are the first couple things that you're gonna do when you're able to like be out in society again have you thought about that at all it's a good question yeah I know for me like he had mentioned we're triathletes so it's that time of year when there's a lot of races and be nice to do a race and traveling I know for me I would love to just go somewhere get out a little bit more yeah I say you know see friends you know get together so you know some of the local spots you know restaurants universe bars you know spots that we have you know kind of the regulars and friends and such that we see typically that you know we haven't been able to kind of catch up with and you know meet up with first language would be you know be nice to kind of be able to do that again so well we'll all look forward to it I really appreciate you all coming on and telling us about your special day it's it's we're just in such a sort of an unbelievable time right now and I'm glad that the given the tough choices that the two of you had to make and sort of it didn't work out maybe wasn't your ideal it was still something that you can look back on and it's sort of special in its own right yeah definitely absolutely yeah thanks for having us Nick resolutions to both of you and thanks for coming on really appreciate it yeah thank you thank you take care yeah [Music]

okay well do one more we're almost out of time so I'll do this company I don't know how you say it ty Eve its ta ivy ty a weird name don't know why they chose that name but whatever so what these guys are doing is they you know how every bar or restaurant has TVs and they're playing sports usually or whatever it is so what they're saying is hey the commercial break that's a lost opportunity right so what they do is they hijack the commercial break on that TV and they just upsell stuff from your menu so you know you're watching the game when the commercial happens it'll show the wings that they have on the menu it'll be like nine dollars for these wings right now you want it it's a commercial just locally for your bar or restaurant I love this idea because I think there's a lot of restaurants out there who who are in this scenario they have you know Blatz of bars lots of rest just ahead TV so I think there's a decent market for it I like the idea of helping them make money it's a very simple solution but the thing is most these restaurants and bars haven't done anything yet so like this is a there's a lot of low-hanging fruits still available this is one that I like it's like sort of an ad block for those TVs what I think might be challenging for them is selling into bars and restaurants I think that's gonna be a slow and painful process for them alright I have a little background info information on the CEO tribe TV know what's that okay so you know the Chive calm yeah okay the Chive calm the founders leo it's and I know Leo and John Leo is one of my investors and someone I look up to he started the Chive and he now they have chive TV and weight started was they would get like a lot of funny videos like America's funny some videos looks like dad's getting hit in the nuts by their kids swinging a pinata baseball bat like just silly stuff and in all of Texas what they did was they would give these bar owners these little dongles like these like fire sticks like an Amazon fire stick and they uploaded all this programming and they just like constantly filling the pipes and so if you go to the bar you see just like America's Funniest Home Videos in the background and chive would put their ads in the in the mix and they made millions of dollars doing it and so much so that they eventually spun it off into a different company and they call it atmosphere TV and they've just raised ten million dollars to launch it and Leo was like this is gonna be a multi-billion dollar business and interesting so I have now the verdicts still out if that's gonna happen but chive TV was huge for the Chive atmosphere he says it's gonna be the greatest thing ever and he said that what they need to do is just go out and hire the same thing that I described earlier hire those people how you go yeah we're just gonna hire a ton of salespeople and we're gonna do this and then another bit of background is you and I talked to the folks at Firefly yeah I won't put words in your mouth but I have no problem in saying I thought that was a horribly dumb to do good idea and this idea is a little bit similar but I think way better right yeah more defensible for sure fireflies the company that puts a little add a little billboard thing on top of it uber uber driver can make a little more money that's cool but this is this is a little bit different this is more what I'll call it's not dependent on the ad market which I like your internally advertising stuff in the restaurant or the bar to get people to have a little higher check size yeah but that's not what they're saying that in their deck they say at first they're doing what you're describing right and they go they said all of our one-year contracts are insanely profitable but our next phase is to sell ad time at $25 per CPM interesting okay all right so maybe maybe the in restaurant upsell is not as good as I thought and that's why they're like already planning to go out of that and I think that's a good market but will in their numbers what they're assuming they're saying they're gonna have a $25 CPM that's gonna make us way more money and create this new 32 billion dollar market and begin the math is that we have X amount of impressions and we're gonna put $25 CPM ads on there now here's the problem which is their fill rate is not going to be a hundred right and it's not I'm gonna be close to 100% yeah so that's a little ridiculous here's the other thing I don't like so they charge forty two hundred dollars per location per year that's really expensive for a restaurant or bar they also charge a one-time $1500 hardware installation and so I just think that they've added a lot of friction to the adoption of this I think already it was gonna be hard to get people to adopt that's a high price point and a high one-time installation fee that they're asking people to do so I think that's that seems tough for me that said I think that this this could be a business that makes 10 20 30 40 50 million dollars a year in sales this is a great company to own not a great company to invest not a great company if they raise all this money that's my opinion yeah that make sense oh I like this they just had someone smart once told me he's the only thing that you can't screw up in business is your cap table and so when I look at when I look at a lot of these companies I think that could be good so salt so long as they don't screw up their cap table right yeah that is one way to die for the wrong reasons that's a great way to put it [Music]

Sam do you have the coronavirus I was not able to get tested but it appears so based off of just symptoms from out now according to my doctor so who the [ __ ] knows but you were saying so far kind of mild today's a little worse it today for sure the wait okay so you know how everyone says it's like not that bad or bad that's hard to quantify so the way that I've been quantifying it is when I stay home from work today if this was last June right and yesterday was the first day that I would have stayed home and just barely today for sure I would stay home from work I see so no it's not that bad but dude shortness of breath is scary because like a it's not bad right like I can breathe perfectly fine but it definitely is like oh my god what happens if this gets any worse right and I was Gary I've been following a bunch of people who are like pretty fit like there's one guy who's an Olympic athlete and he's a I think he's a swimmer or runner Australian swimmer a runner he has it and he's like yeah so yeah mate was tough and he's like you know shortness of breath and I just you know it's impossible to train like this and you know he's talking about it and then somebody like retweeted it and they're like this guy's an Olympic athlete by the way like and he was basically yeah this gets tough and then there's the guy another guy followed who's healthy guy he was the bachelor his name's Colton and he got it and he's like you know pretty jacked guy he was an NFL player for a bit and he's like he does a little Instagram post to like update his fans of a holiday it's bad yeah he's like you look at I mean looks raggedy as hell like he is not he is getting knocked out by this thing and it's been like a week plus and he's doing just at home treatment and he's like quarantined in a room his you know girlfriend and their family they just deliver meals to the door he kind of opens the door drags it in I haven't left the home and about a week like on Saturday I went for a walk but besides that or since Saturday I haven't gone on a walk I haven't left house at all Wow it's you know it's crazy so do you know how like you here like Ti and Martha Stewart and dr. dre all served house arrest and their their house arrests are definitely different because their homes are massive right but only in it but house arrest would suck still like it would be that cool right it's a little bit of an arrest yeah it's crazy okay well I hope your symptoms are mild I hope it's just actually the cold because I think it's fine we'll see I mean whatever it's all the same right right all right well the show must go on so what do we want to talk about today so first you guys released this like book thing what is that I saw that yesterday it's just to get more sales to trends it's to get people in the door and it's incredibly effective what we did was we put together all of our the best talks with Iran we transcribed them and when I first started the company do you remember this book called the founders at work by Jessica yeah look like changed my frickin life and it's not even up I mean it's a book technically but like she didn't do any like work other than what you and I do every week right and she just transcribed her interviews and so I was like let's do that so we did and so it's pretty cool yeah I downloaded it and I started to skim through it I was reading the Pandora guys one and said that's good okay where do people get it if they're listening to this they want that good question I want to see we just posted it we just posted it Tuesday so let me see if it even ranks on Google listen we'll put a link to it in the description if you want to read this thing it's is it free or you have to you have to become a dollar that's a dollar dollar and though everyone's like what's the catch I'm like well it's a dollar and then you're gonna be automatically subscribed to trends but you have two weeks to cancel so get value or sign up and try it and if you don't like it then just cancel and you're only a dollar right the so if you go to trends that Co you should you'll see it at the top like a like a link it's not even ranking for Google yet and hopefully we can link to it in here okay cool we'll do that that's fun that's exciting I'm glad you guys did that yeah it's great the cold email lecture one was even better I mean that was people love that [ __ ] yeah okay cool so we wanted to we did a bunch of the YC companies last week or last week a couple days ago and reaction was good people wanted more we only did five or six of them at that time the way I'm thinking about this is like I listened to a couple of sports podcast like Bill Sam it's podcast and every year around like the NFL Draft it's like there's these special sort of annual events that you do like these deep dives for and to me that's kind of what the YC demo day is it's like I could see us doing this as a recurring thing in the podcast where it's like oh that's our version of the NFL Draft you see all these hot prospects and you're scouting them and you're checking them out and you're you're using them to sort of see what are the you know what are the smartest people working on where do they see the opportunities and then what do we think about those what did yours write in this day because I talked to Jack and a couple other guys about this and they go I think the some of them are like I think that Bash was pretty weak and I totally disagree I think there's a bunch of amazing things so people who have been going to YC demo day for years this is like their favorite thing to say it's like oh yeah YC bash this year's week and like you know I don't know to what extent that's true versus just a cool thing to say you sound cool by saying it I'm always skeptical of those Jack's not the type to do that though so he said he was not like totally negative but he was basically like is okay so what I heard from what I heard the sentiment I got from people who've been going to demo day for a while is you know in the past it was like the glory days and there was less competition on the Investor side and the companies were better and higher quality and there was fewer of them so you could go deeper with them one of the problems now is like for example demo day has become something where they get up on stage they talk for I think one minute they do a one-minute presentation and then it's like if you're interested you know come talk to me and then there's a line of investors already wanting to talk to that person from the one minute pitch and it's so competitive the deals or do half the deals are done before demo day just because people swoop in beforehand and then the other half get done you know very shortly afterwards so a lot of smart people are like dude this is a frenzy that is not smart now it is but if I'm doing it in 1 minute pitch it's just a slide one slide and to two paragraphs and then you decided to talk to them more or not and I think that's great to be honest if I was an operator which I am like I see these and I'm like oh my god for my founders it's fantastic well I'm like I should do that and even for the investors I actually think this one's better because it's digital so it's like you say it's like tinder you basically when you see the listing you say yes I'm interested in no I'm not and if you if you say yes then they get a request that says this person wants to talk to you and then they can say yes and then it matches and so I think that's actually better this year because because it's digital I think people are gonna take time to have conversations whereas when it's sort of a live event you it's again it's just like a meat market you're just sort of it's like you know the old Wall Street trading floor people just standing up and yelling [ __ ] it's a little bit faster paced and people don't feel like they're able to make thorough decisions and what's in well I think what we I don't know if we told us to people I don't know we want have to blank this out we won't name names but people can't see what you and I see so we're writing off like a private list and I don't think we're breaking any of the rules I mean it's not like yeah I don't think so TechCrunch has reported on all these companies now and also there's some companies that say off the record and we just won't talk about this no problem do you what can I do wait did yesterday I was pretty hopped up on dayquil the other day did we talk about did we talk about this so here's a theme that I noticed I we talked about last time about how there's like X of India so right now I see Bill calm of India right this thing for lat this thing's for Latin America export for Africa yeah ok so we saw that a lot we saw that a lot and I like you that day India thing last time I went back and looked there's two like 28 companies in the batch that are Indian startups like the India we took over the spelling bee and now we're taking over YC yeah let's go it on no at first I was like I don't know if I like that not the country thing but like we're just gonna wear this wear this business but of that region right and I think I've changed my opinion I think it's cool because why comment you're supposed to be all about innovation and [ __ ] and it's not exactly innovative to say you're gonna be the smile direct Club of Latin America but I still think it's cool and that's what I want to bring up did you did we did we talk about that we didn't talk about that one now did you read that I didn't look into it but yeah we can talk about it okay so what was it called they don't how do I do a search on here but anyway the the it was called um you see I can't do it they're not letting me do a ctrl F okay it was called moons okay it's and they just say smile direct Club but for Latin America and here's why I like this and one of their decks they go smile direct Club became a billion dollar company in five years we're gonna do it in four and and I looked up the people behind it and the people behind it previously worked at rocket internet which is notorious for cloning companies model in different in different industries or cloning on buffered Thailand or something and I'll uh I mean there's pros and cons to that but it definitely creates some value and the fact that they said that at Y commenter I think is like I just think they're ballsy and I love these guys yeah so there's a bunch of these Augusto for Africa acorns for India cameo for India flex port for Africa smile direct Club for Latin rightly this is a you know it's not like a groundbreaking idea but it's it's you it really does stand out when you look at the list I want to do the opposite I want someone to tell me what school in India that's not in America so I'm doing that so I'm basically putting together a report of the coolest companies in India that don't have analogs here like for example just company called Bijou have you ever heard of Bijou byj you and ey Ju yeah this guy basically started off as a teacher and he would teach like essentially test prep oh you freaking love this I think I've told you about this before but basically yeah you like you say that's your dream yeah this this guy he started off as a small teacher in a town basically and was doing test prep and then sort of got bigger and bigger and bigger people wanted to learn from him to the point where he was selling out stadiums of people coming to watch him teach math and that was when I saw the picture of the stadium I thought this is that's remarkable then he turned it into an online learning platform a basically a video based teaching platform sort of like Khan Academy but for profit and it's eight billion dollar company now and this guy Bijou is sort of one of the youngest billionaires in India he's a t-shirt but turned billionaire which is very rare and you know cool product cool company and there's actually a company in this YC batch that's trying that's the former first instructor of Bijou he's like I was the face of Bijou because he was in all the videos and he left to start his own thing he's like you know here's the dirty secret about Bee Gees thing it has very low retention great at making money great to getting people to sign up but less than 15% of people stick with the course as he goes along we're doing this other way and we're gonna win and they're in this batch as well so that's interesting so I would love to ask you questions about that first I want to tell you that I'm looking at their Wikipedia it says they do they're worth eight billion dollars they do 80 million in US dollars in sales and then it says they only have five employees yeah that's wrong and also they do more they do more revenue recently there were over a hundred million I think the last like I've read something where they were or they were doing over a hundred million but so why in a way they have five in place that'd be amazing why is this big in India but not America is because Indians love math and science I mean yes education is like you know God in India like you you can be dirt poor in a village but you'll do anything to educate your kids and you know even these or any people in America you probably notice or like you know their parents are pretty strict about education you got to get good grades all that stuff and so Indians are willing to pay anything for education and they don't really pay anything for anything else so you know entertainment is is usually lower on the list although Bollywood does well but like on a per capita basis where you're gonna spend your money education is sort of number one for for Indians so that's the first part second part is they have such a huge population so you can take a really small amount of money from such a huge number of people and built a very big company that's the second part how much bigger is India than America and population three times yes at four times I think it's at one pole I think it's I think it's over 1 billion and us 300 million I believe so it'd be like about 4 times and and of course not all those people have smartphones not all those people have money but like you know it's correct it's India has like sort of the largest growing middle class so that's some of the reason why this works is because people willing to pay for education and there's so many people that if you take a few bucks from each and everybody's willing to pay for this because it's education that adds up but you know 8 billion is sort of out it it is outpacing the revenue growth right so I think the part of it is the story of what this becomes and there are sort of defensibility that's probably why they're valued so much higher than they're valid then their revenue would suggest do you think that that that can be popular in America oh I think so like I think Khan Academy is fairly popular and it's mostly in America no money though it's just yeah it's a non profit and they don't pour money into growth like these guys do I'm sure these guys are aggressively trying to grow and using their payback to to sort of fund more growth but yeah I do think like something like this can work here but you know we'll see there might be other reasons why it doesn't there's a whole bunch of other companies I basically found these five guys on Twitter who are like in the Indian startups thing that are actually really smart and once I started following them I started seeing awesome companies all the time and I'm trying to put together essentially the Mary Meeker internet trends report that she does every year for like global internet trends I'm doing that just at India State of the State of the Union Indian startup scene here's what you need to know because a lot of people in America want to know but they're not gonna do the research to figure out what's going on in the India Tec seemed and I think I can distill it down I am and probably gonna steal that that is a great okay great what did you cut that was cool like a trends report of mary meeker for different countries yeah mary meeker for india basically can I tell you why I think that's a great idea is because have I told you about Kevin Ryan he's in charge that media company right so Kevin Ryan was the 20th employee at double-click and double-click ended up becoming a Adsense or Adwords and Google bought it for three or four billion dollars very successful and then so he was the CEO he's the 20th employee and then CEO so he was successful in that regard then with his earnings he made told me that he made twenty million dollars personally with his earnings he went and started this thing called Silicon Alley group in Silicon Alley group created MongoDB which is now a publicly traded company in the billions of dollars they created Business Insider they created about Zola which is big and they created about four other things and one of the things that they did was they create a guilt guilt group which is like flash deals for women's clothing and the reason he started it was he said because I called email them and asked him all these questions that became friends with him and he told me that he was walking down the street in Paris and saw a long line outside of a women's store and he asked a woman like what is this thing and they go Ellie do they do these deals every day only for an hour at noon and so they're starting to do them online but they still do them in person and he goes oh oh I'm gonna do that in America and that's how guilt started nice yeah so you're basing import these sort of the behaviors and innovations you see in foreign markets back into the US not just right now US an exporter of innovation and it's a thing we can also become an importer of innovation yeah I mean like you did it and you kind of you try to do it with sushi trains yeah yeah when we did their sushi thing yeah like in Australia that was a common and in the US and I don't think it still has caught on but you you did the same thing well we tried you you definitely tried it was a good swing I think it's a great swing and in case you're curious I just looked it up while we were talking Khan Academy because it's a nonprofit they all their financials are available and they do like 80 million dollars in sales yeah so actually on par with Bijou and does the same real quick where you're at how many students they have that active like active learners anything it does so if you go to con a con con Academy annual report org you can see all the information okay I'm gonna check that out afterwards and I'm gonna do a report on them because I'm a education nerd and so I'm gonna like I'm gonna bring them to the table for the next podcast all right so let's let's go back into the YC companies let's just trade off you do one that you find interesting I'll do one that I find interesting go for it I did smile direct Club for Latin America you're my turn alright so I'm gonna do this one I don't know exactly how you say YZ wholesale or love it wholesale I love this train that up yeah really interesting company so basically the premise is it's a marketplace for buying and selling used smartphones and you know I'll tell you some of their stats I haven't sort of verified how real these are but they say that you smartphone sales are 46 billion dollars a year annual market they say that 230 million smartphones are sold per year you could do the math that checks out they have so what they did is they made a marketplace where you could if you have phones and you're a wholesaler you can basically say hey I'm either I'm looking to buy or looking to sell and they made it like a stock market you basically put a a bid up you say I'd like to buy this iPhone and if somebody has it they can fill your order and they can basically like dude they can close your transaction out there your ticket out or you can say I'm selling a hundred of these specific Android phones and somebody could say I'll buy ten of those and so they made it easy they said that most of this used to happen through Facebook groups whatsapp sort of the underground you know just using social tools but they I wasn't a marketplace and that was focused on this and so they they've 400,000 and gmv so far now DMV you know you can assume maybe they're making in the tens of thousand dollars themself then the GMB gross merchandise volume volume okay so basically how much is total sold through their market so if one sells for a thousand dollars that's $1,000 of gmv their cut might be 5% 10% of that but this is a because the smartphone if the smartphone if the used smartphone marketplace is this big and they have some stats about how fast it's growing they say that you smartphone sales is growing faster than new smartphone sales per year because you know Apple is trying to like make the old model irrelevant so quickly and sure some people do upgrade but there's all these other phones still out there that are still very good phones I like I I can afford new phones I up until my most recent phone all of them have been used and the the best part about these guys is so I believe that they were bootstrap time members not sure but they so they've gotten to this point they they themselves were former buyers and traders of cell phones and they had sold prior to this just as brokers eight million dollars over the cellphones and then decided to create a sort of technology marketplace out of this so if you think about it market love it style of business marketplace love it so I love that love that they're going for use market use smartphones I love that they're doing a marketplace I love that they came from a background where they actually did this manually before and we're sort of prolific brokers eight plus plus love this love this company here on this YC list okay I like it let me play devil's advocate here which is okay so I looked up a few okay so first of all I think that it this is a lot harder than people think the reason why I think it's a lot harder is I think it's incredibly competitive with a lot of people who are already very established so I think giving distribution and getting eyeballs on their product is going to be prohibitively expensive maybe I also think that so there's a company called swap do you know swap ah no but I see your note here okay here's why this is interesting I've actually used it before but I didn't but what's interesting is I posted or I have a thread that I found of the guy who's so swap ax is the same thing slightly different I don't know how it's slightly different but it's the same it's a you were you by youself cellphones what's interesting is that in 2011 the guy who started swap up posted on Hacker News and he said hey I'm launching this thing on the side here's what it does and so you can actually go and like see how he started it and it's I don't know how big it is right now but it's it comes up number one when you google by you cell phone so I would imagine it does I bet you it does fifty million dollars in sales at least because I'm comparing it to the person that's number two which is gazelle which is a big company but anyway swap bootstraps and so I if I was a greedy if I was these these guys how you say easy yeah if I was these ease guys and I or what did you say let's go with easy if I was easy I would be greedy and want to raise very little money like less than a million dollars and just see how well how I can just make this really profitable but you know they say launch three months ago 400 kg MV monthly 8% margin profitable and growing a twenty percent month-over-month of course easy to be profitable when you have two people and you're not taking salaries but nonetheless I think this could be a profitable business because of the you know the sort of take rate and here's why I but here's why I don't know if I would raise money if I was these guys is heavy did you see what happened two days ago do you know this up and let go I know some something bad happen offer up and let go combined Oh interesting okay they merged who was the sort of bigger parent was it offer up yep offer up was the bigger parent and they raised an additional 120 million dollars to make this all work and so that's not a good sign and you know they have a pretty cool story I don't know if you guys told it or where I read this but offer up has a pretty cool story where it sort of started I believe on my butcher this might be thinking of something else but I believe it was there in Canada and people have these buy sell trade groups on Facebook and they saw this behavior of Facebook you know sort of local used goods selling happening and then they started they built off the back of that of these Facebook groups for buying new stuff and they built offer up off that of that that community of people so I I i dig that they also raised like five hundred million dollars and they haven't hit terminal velocity I mean they're not like they're not a player yet compared to eBay and Craigslist so I would say if I was these guys if I was ease easy or ease I would um I would be very happy to start and own that if I was an investor which I am and I just came across these guys I think I would invest a small amount of money because I think I could make money off of it but I don't know if I would raise venture capital like significant amount yeah I think they still need to prove a lot yeah for sure I think it's a good investment I like him alright let's go to the next one okay let's do um build a plane love this if these this is a this could potentially it could be a ten billion dollar company I think tell me why okay so build a plane what so what they do is they look at it's boring let me see I'll try to read the exact description but what they do is they it's project management for construction okay though let's find it build a plane but here's why I think it's cool first of all there's member hi I was just gonna read their description since people have done more contacts so we're a powerful dashboard for construction companies we give them visibility and control of project finances change management documents compliance at communication blah blah blah they built a different company that got acquired for 80 million prior to this and they say bill plant us all via the core issues of being the centerpiece of projects empowering full automation blah blah blah okay whatever basically they're saying that total profit they're saying that construction costs controlling construction costs and and making them more efficient represents a sort of a ten billion dollar opportunity globally here's some of our features here's our product check it out so when you're building a 300 unit apartment building and you want to see how much everything costs you want to see RFPs for your vendors and you want to know what your cash flow Gleave what your cash output is simple right yeah I think there's the the this is one of those where if you win you're in such a big space that your your prize is humongous hard for two reasons hard to get any sort of blue-collar project industry to adopt software is always a challenge when you do it it looks like oh yeah obviously they used to be using paper and pen or they used to just use clipboards and you know whatever and now and it looks obvious in retrospect but there's also that so many cases where it's like yeah we just our thing is better it would have saved them time and money they just didn't put it in their workflow so that's one piece on the other side I think there's a lot of competition I know there's like several companies that are you know every year there's like 15 companies that try to do project management software for construction and the question is what do these guys know that they that the others don't or what is their unique angle that didn't come through for me in this page it did not come through to me either but just because the market is so big if I was these guys this is one of the few companies where I'd be like get as much cash as you can right out the gate and just throw it at the wall and go big or go bankrupt why why do you advocate for that because it just what do you think the cash does for them why do they need so much cash I would hire just say math okay so there's a few ways that you can grow you can grow through content marketing you can grow through word of mouth which happens way less people think you can grow through like network effects like Facebook you can grow through paid advertising which is really easy if your product is achieved or you can go grow through hiring a sales team right I love products that are priced in such a way where you can afford to hire a sales team you cannot Ford to hire a sales team if your product is probably less than 10 grand a year and so what I would do is I would create a fat office in Dallas a huge office in like Charlotte and then maybe in office and or like like Nashville and Dallas and then like maybe New York right I would just recruit all the sales people from composer competitors and wrap my office and like this startup be [ __ ] and go for it okay I like it and I think what what you but I the other part I heard that you didn't say explicitly is just even though this pitch didn't have everything they had and now for you're like I need to know more I want to know more so sometimes you know there's better pitches on this on this site right now but there's not better markets and say like for example there's this one that's about like a rewards program for gamers I hate this I hate this idea I hate the market that they're in super hard to make it work and even if they have a great [ __ ] even if the attraction right now it's a stay away from me and so whereas construction tech it's a it's a come closer let it live flirt a little bit more right let's get some coffee it's like building like freakin driverless cars right now it's like you'll probably fail but if you make it works like the greatest thing ever another example is homebound you know homebound not well okay it's launched by atomic atomic labs or I don't know what they call themselves atomic it's like a start-up I don't know they just launch companies they've launched Tim's and they launched a few others and they're like monkey inferno which I used to run like a studio that that creates companies yeah they launched one called homebound and they're doing this but only for people who are building single-family homes right and it's got some traction that's cool right I got another company for you ready please tell me it's the strippers on demand no but that one's good oh we shanks talked about that so there's this cool story this is not a YC startup although maybe should have been cool story we're basically in Portland you know right now is coronavirus everybody's getting deliveries right and so I have a friend who runs a company called farmstead and they do grocery delivery they've been doing this for you know two years now and they all they all farm set does is they deliver you know your staple foods milk eggs bread stuff you need repeatedly and you don't need you know go to the grocery store every time you run out of milk kind of sucks so they just deliver to your door and so they're like a version of instacart that's just focused on the staples okay and also you know for a key difference instacart goes to the grocery store and buy stuff and marks it up these guys are the grocery store so they just have a they buy wholesale and they sell retail so they don't mark it up they actually get good prices so ok good start up they are exploding 20 X 30 X oversubscribed on demand right now because everybody is ordering food in because a coronavirus right so everyone's getting to try this like delivery thing they're forced to do delivery for the first time and what they call again those guys are called farmstead well not farm theory ok farmstead ok yeah this is my buddy's company I he listens the podcast sometime so shout-out if he's listening so so cool name love the name yeah great name great band it looks good that the product is good so I actually like it a lot now one problem that they're having and that every delivery company is having right now is that they're short on drivers are short on delivery people they have too much demand and not enough ability to fulfill so this company in Portland started hiring out-of-work people from the coronavirus now what what industry was been affected by this strip clubs nobody's going to strip clubs right out during coronavirus so they hired the strippers to do delivery and so they got a bunch of PR from this which is a crawl I got I gotta find out which company it was I don't know if it was door - or whatever I don't even know if the company really did this or the server's just started signing up for this that's like oh we got to make money so what are we gonna do I guess we should become you know delivery people right now for the interim I see it I see it which would do you know which company it is that therefore does it say he jokingly calls it Boober eats so it all started as a joke with lucky devil lounge one of his clubs and no one was coming in and they go we need to do like uber for weed delivery or Luber for sex lube delivery and I was like let's do Buber which is topless girl picks you up and takes you to a strip club so anyway that's the joke is that it's uh I don't think it's real but it did get PR yeah they PRI I think I think I did read that they were like the gig workers are basically shifting from one to another right if you can't if the demand has gone down in this area it's gone up and delivery and then more people are becoming livery drivers and it was I thought that was interesting meals for four-inch heels meals and 6-inch heels well I don't know if it's smart to create your own delivery company but I think if you're a stripper we got to work right now you know you girls gotta eat got to do something well I bring up another two I see one let's it let's see what else okay so ditto I think you'll like this one so do those tagline is it's a tool for teams to manage copy from design to production so copy something we've talked about I also I always define copy because I remember when I first moved to San Francisco got a job in tech and then somebody asked what can be give me some copy and I didn't know what the hell they're talking about thought maybe they said coffee maybe I had to go make a copy of something I didn't know what copywriting meant so copywriting is just like the words on a website the words on your on your product it's a very vague word yeah so anyways what these guys did was they said all right we have all these tools like figma you know Photoshop whatever we have Google Docs spreadsheets so we have all these collaborative well made SAS tools that help us collaborate on design or on engineering or on modeling and on in Excel and so why is it there a tool that helps teams collaborate on their copy and so they basically built a tool that says you know their their pitch which i think is you would agree with is copy is the most under leveraged aspect of product building it has a higher ROI and is easier to change than almost any other part of your product and could drive sales faster with better copying which I agree with and what they're saying is that teams don't have a great way right now to collaborate under copy and so they built a tool that lets you point and click and make suggestions and what the copy could be or should be or look at what it was before that sort of thing on the product there the products not super clear exactly what it is but I like to know I I think it's interesting okay but let's talk about this the the peep okay the people who started it one of the women oh they're young but okay they said they came from venture capital they were like interns at BC so I was going to say while they're really young their first jobs before this for interns good for them so I believe their claim we think copy will be the new visual design I think that's I think that's true I think design got super-important over the last ten years and now every company just sort of knows that paid design super important usability UI UX is super important and well nobody talks about copy it's not the [ __ ] new version of that it always has been it just people just are vogue in tech companies yeah I'm at a tech company of two thousand people I don't think I've heard the word copy once I don't think anybody has a strategy to make our emails better or the text on our website battery I don't do that though this is like saying figmas gonna make your website look better yeah that's true you know the tool I think if you make it easier to do people do do it more but right now the problem is people aren't aware or sort of considering this as something they need to be focused on so yeah they need to educate the markets of the market of the importance of copy first and then of having an easy tool second I think it's cool I think it looks great there's one red flag that I have which is they're like the pricing it's twelve dollars a person a month right I it's gonna be hard to build something big when it's so cheap you really need a lot a lot of a lot of people right I mean they'll need a you know a million users at that rate they're not a million but you know a lot maybe am well yeah a million users to be like really large so I think their pricing is silly but they might be able to figure it out great idea I like the idea but it's not there yet but I think that if you wanted to bet on them it's an interesting bet so here's something interesting have you ever read this blog post by Stewart Butterfield called we don't sell saddles here yeah yeah and it's old it's old it's so Stewart Butterfield is the founder of slack and before they launched slack he wrote this memo to the team and he released it later and what he said was he wrote this blog Lowe's is great if you're a founder you should read this and I'll summarize it very shortly so we don't sell saddles here what does that mean so he talks about let's assume you were a saddled company you make saddles and you sell them and so you could make saddles sell them to existing horseback riders and basically try to tell them why they're their old saddle that they use is not great and how they should be using your saddle and that's tough because any you've got to get people to switch and be there's just not that many people who are horseback riders today and here's you know the better approach and the reason he says we don't sell saddles here even though we're a saddled company is that what we need to do is sell the joy of horseback riding if we can make people want a horseback ride that we can tell them how about how awesome it is to ride horses how it's fun how it's great exercise how it feels great to have the wind blowing in your hair then they'll want to do it and when they do it they'll be like oh should I need a saddle and it's like don't worry we got you he basically says this is the Lululemon approach so Lululemon doesn't go didn't go to a very small at the time yoga industry and say hey you should be buying hundred dollar you know yoga pants what they did was they helped spread the joy of the of the sort of the lifestyle of a yoga lifestyle they got more people that want to do it that's why they offer yoga classes in their store like who does that they want people to be in that lifestyle and then once you're in the lifestyle it's like do you want the best coz we we do have the best materials and so this is just a general strategy if you're operating in a niche sometimes you have to actually sell the lifestyle of being in that niche more than your product to the existing people in the nation I love that and did and a lot of times not a lot of times every once in a while those like marketing things like and those selling the lifestyle actually becomes bigger than the original thing so for example this is an example where one has become bigger but it's become its own its own thing you know Michelin star restaurants okay yeah you heard a Michelin star restaurant it's like is it it's like the standard of what is good and why dining yeah well you know Michelin tires created that and they did it because they created a guide on which restaurant like this the Michelin has been around since this car started it was around even before that they made rubber for her all types of things and then cars got popular and it was you guys need to get out and travel the world and you see all these amazing things and look at these restaurants this one we rate this one one star you should go see it but this one's four star you have to go see it and if you do happen to go see it make sure that you use our tires right are you gonna get there you better drive if you're gonna drive you better right and that was that's how a Michelin star Michelin stars got started and there's a whole bunch of examples like that where these marketing schemes have become their own their own thing so anyway what's it called again ditto so do I think they're gonna have to do that I think they're gonna have to not sell saddles I think they're gonna have to sell horseback riding and okay so the these people who are starting it are pretty young let's see if they're like aggressive enough to do this and I maybe they they might be able to but selling copy is really easy like if I if I like I could just go to you I could look you give me a blank piece of paper and because I have this skill set I'm an ATM like you're like like if just or like there's like this up there's this very famous copywriting story of this barry of this copywriter who sees a guy who is a homeless guy who's holding a sign and he says i'm blind please help me and he goes and the copywriter goes up to the guy he goes hey let me help you out here and he just writes it's beautiful outside comma and then it fills in and i'm blind please helped interest and the whole point is like dude if you just add two or three words it changes everything right and so these people did oh they're ad campaigns could be really good so yeah good point I'm on board can I tell a quick story about and we're totally off the YC train for a second but right a fun thing I just remember when you told that story so my very first company we had no money we were funding the whole thing off prize money so I would be going out like a like a busker pitching at startup competitions trying to win them and every every time we won we got more money to keep going and I don't know why we didn't just pitch investors but like it was working so when we just kept doing it so we didn't have a lot of money to hire anybody but we realized hey we were right next to the University of Boulder and we could get a bunch of interns the question was how do we pick which interns how do we know who's good so I was like all right we're gonna design a test case and so the case we gave them was and we wanted a marketing intern and I said hey you know near the university there's a there's sort of a homeless population and they you know let's say today they all earn on average 50 bucks a day let's say that's what they're making today so your challenge to show me your marketing skills your salve your instincts I want you to come back and I want you to basically pitch me a plan the idea was for them to actually go do it but we never we never ended up having them actually go do it but we said come up with a plan of how how you would earn the most money in a given week so what would you where would you stand so this was about like understanding locations foot traffic which is like essential for restaurants so where would you pick that you were gonna go what would you write on your sign how would your image look what would you what would be your sort of your your look and why do you believe that that would be the most effective way to get money and this was our sort of test as a little bit like not politically correct but there was one girl who had a she had a good solution where she was like I don't remember all the details but it was like I'm gonna go to this area because this type of person is she was like first I wanted to figure out who's the type that donates and so she was like first I would observe which Piper person I'd spend the first day just observing which type of person donates and I was like that's smart understand the customer first before you implement your plan and then she was like okay and then after that I'm going to you know I would target where that person's commute is I would be there and then I would have a positive message because I believe that the positive messages will sell better than the sort of the negative messages and I would try to tug at people's heartstrings so I'd go for emotion and not logic on on why it can help but that you know I'm struggling and I'm a mother or whatever it is and like that's why people die so yeah and it just proves how important copy is and copy is not words copy is understanding how people think and communicating it effectively and it just so happens it often is used with words right speaking of copy farm theory that is an example of copy so you have farm theory on here which is the selling ugly produce to restaurants in India yes is that a YC thing it's a YC company yes okay no dia and that's a company in America and what's it called you know that it's it so it's farm theory no oh there is also one here yeah there's a there's like a farm-to-table box I think that's the ugly produce thing in America for one it's called it me too I just googled it foods yeah imperfect food so I'll give you the stats on these guys so so they're doing twenty-two thousand a month of em are are they say forty percent profit margins they say they're growing 65 percent week on week which doesn't mean anything because it's YC but they're on track to get to a million dollars a year are the coming months what they're doing is interesting but they're taking farming is huge in India so they're saying okay there's tons of farming tons of produce produced there's tons that's not gonna get sold because it looks ugly it's not good for a consumer retail but we could buy that stuff for cheap because it's just waste otherwise we can sell it to restaurants who don't care about the aesthetic look of the you know they're not picking like a consumer doesn't in the grocery store where they pick a you know the best looking one out of a barrel the rustlers don't care they're chopping it up processing it turning into food if they can get lower food costs fantastic and so they're looking at you know right now at seven hundred twenty dollars a month just for the restaurants in Bangalore which is a part of India and they're they believe it's a big marker they claim a 500 million dollar market just in Bangalore just do the restaurants that are there sounds a little high to me but the the value prop makes sense the restaurant saves about 30% by buying ugly produce the farm gets some revenue out of something that would otherwise be no revenue and they take their cut in the middle I like it what do you think I like it now but let me I'm always being like the negative guy I like it but let me tell you okay I'm a subscriber to imperfect produce first of all it's not imperfect like the this is a stick of the farm theory of them selling like things that are ugly so what do you say they look normal you're saying yeah I mean it doesn't look like it's a it's a wonderful marketing scheme but it's it's so like it's just normal [ __ ] right because I'm guessing you would not sign up for something that just says here's vegetable delivery it's like saying there's a famous copywriter named Joe Sugarman he wrote this great ad for a new cast they called Cassio a Casio watch and he's like we use space-age aluminium with quartz movement and [ __ ] every watch has that same aluminum and quartz movement is used in nearly every single watch he just explained it in a great way and so this is a this is the same thing with these guys and it's a stick that works it's a real it's like it's like Guiness Guiness putting a ping-pong ball in their beer I don't know about that what is that Guinness beer if you buy it in the can it there's a ping-pong ball in it because apparently that ping-pong ball has a little bit of night as it nitric oxide some type of like gas in there that keeps it super fizzy I see okay and when they release that ball it like went up big-time I love it yeah so this is great marketing I'm in do it I don't know anything about India so it's hard for me to say that I do know that I just googled it imperfect produce they have two hundred thousand subscribers and wouldn't pay per month roughly it's a weekly bill I think I was paying two hundred dollars a month Wow so incredible yeah big market so yeah III think it would depend on how talented these entrepreneurs are but you definitely can build something significantly significant here right okay give me one that you like and then I'll be the bad guy saying wedge Ben did we talk about up flow let's talk about up flow okay okay I didn't know this until well until I started my business collections for collecting your cash flow is actually really hard my father-in-law has a moving business and he's like yes to paying the but to collect to collect the money with my business you know we make let's say eight figures a year and collecting the money I used to have a team a full two full-time people whose job it was to collect the money now I but then I found an outsource service to help me with it and a lot of companies that even if you're small let's say you only do a million dollars a month in sales you need someone full-time just to collect that money and that person could be a $70,000 a year salary person it's expensive and so there's a lot of services that I've recently found but there's not that many that help you collect money and up flow is up flow built software where they like you can track who owes you money based off your QuickBooks and you can like constantly send email reminders to those people now the service that I use it's literally a person who does it right and it's and it's incredibly effective and I pay five hundred dollars a month for it I think and it's like easy like I would totally I would totally like that's the last business expense I'm gonna cut because it was so effective so I like up flow for that reason um let me ask you a question when you saw this did you send this to your finance team let's use this yeah we saw I signed up for an account and what was the reaction you know what is the let's call it the friction in adopting something like this because you definitely have a workflow already to collect yeah so that was the friction I said Edie this Duke Shawn just showed me this new company it's at YC I signed up it looks neat if you have any problems with our current vendor gives these guys a look right yeah and so the friction is that we she said she goes yeah our people work really really well so I don't want to disrupt it I said yeah don't worry about it but if I was starting again from scratch I would maybe use these guys not a problem the you could be you play devil's advocate no no go for it the problem is is that the company that I use is like an old-school company and they have like men and women and their 40s and 50s who are like in Missouri who are like pinging these people and that works it's low tech and it's super effective the problem that I would see what these guys is if they try to get too techie into Silicon Valley it could not work like what they could do is just hire like 200 people in Missouri to just do this manually and that could be super effective so if I try to get cute with the tech then it could not work and what do you wouldn't you use the human solution what do they take what's their fee pay $500 a month okay so they don't take anything on the actual collected thing okay no but I bet you if there might be a scale right I can tell you what I use I think it's called ax and ax I am oh wait no that's not it is it Aksum let's see let's see they could maybe okay while you looked at it's coming to tell you go ahead I'm gonna tell you what I don't like about this because I'm just trying to put my hater hat on in general I like this idea but I'll say I hate the way they're describing it we're building venmo for b2b yes stupid I don't think that's what this is and I think that's confusing I think what they need to say is we help businesses collect X percent more revenue by automating the you know collection service today this is what happens so I think they got cute with this venmo for b2b and i don't think that at all unless I'm totally misunderstanding the product seller saying I agree with you it is kind of impressive they 160 paying customers and 50 50 km RR that's pretty damn good for where they're at to be at 50 km or this early is is actually quite impressive so they're definitely doing something right I don't want to hate on it just rating on its sake I think they have a good thing going here I don't know about the competitive landscape and I hate the way that they're describing I completely agree with you I think that they're describing it very stupidly I just sent you the link to the service that I use axiom ink.com ax I am inc.com the tagline is improve cash flow reduce risk save money we we manage your accounts receivable like very sit so you don't have to worry about it and if you click meet the team the founder his his name is axon or no sorry James and miksa so it's accent the good name is company's his last name backwards and it looks like his son or his husband some relative is also working there and so and it's a very like low-key unsophisticated way to go about doing it and it works probably doing like 30 million a year yeah and like you could see who's collecting the money like they have the names of the people where in there so anyway I like this business I just think that if you if it's if this company of flow is run by a bunch of young Silicon Valley guys they they have to be careful to not overthink it and get cute because I think I think that like they could just do old school ways but just package it in an interesting way for Breck's or for Sean's new startup or for whoever right right right okay we'll do one more we're almost out of time so I'll do this company I don't know how you say tie Eve it's ta Ivy tie em weird name don't know why they chose that name but whatever so what these guys are doing is they you know how every bar or restaurant has TVs and they're playing sports usually or whatever it is so what they're saying is hey the commercial break that's a lost opportunity right so what they do is they hijack the commercial break on that TV and they just upsell stuff from your menu so you know you're watching the game when the commercial happens it'll show the wings that they have on the menu it'll be like nine dollars for these wings right now you want it it's a commercial just locally for your bar or restaurant I love this idea because I think there's a lot of restaurants out there who who are in this scenario they have you know lots of bars lots of fresh just ahead TV so I think there's a decent market for it I like the idea of helping them make money it's a very simple solution but the thing is most these restaurants and bars haven't done anything yet so like this is a lot of low-hanging fruit still available this is one that I like it's like sort of an ad block for those TVs what I think might be challenging for them is selling into bars and restaurants I think that's gonna be a slow and painful process for them alright I have a little background information on the CEO tribe TV know what's that okay so you know the Chive comm yep okay the tribe comm the founders leo it's and I know Leo and John Leo is one of my investors and someone I look up to he started the Chive and he now they have chive TV and weight started was they would get like a lot of funny videos like America's funny some videos looks like dad's getting hit in the nuts by their kids swinging a pinata baseball bat like just silly stuff and in all of Texas what they did was they would give these bar owners these little dongles like these like fire sticks like an Amazon fire stick and they uploaded all this programming and they just like constantly filling the pipes and so if you go to the bar you see just like America's Funniest Home Videos in the background and chive would put their ads in the in the mix and they made millions of dollars doing it and so much so that they eventually spun it off into a different company and they call it atmosphere TV and they've just raised ten million dollars to launch it and Leo was like this is gonna be a multi-billion dollar business and interesting so I have now the verdicts still out if that's gonna happen but chive TV was huge for the Chive atmosphere he says it's gonna be the greatest thing ever and he said that what they need to do is just go out and hire the same thing that I described earlier hire those people how you go yeah we're just gonna hire a ton of salespeople and we're gonna do this and then another bit of background is you and I talked to the folks at Firefly yeah I won't put words in your mouth but I have no problem in saying I thought that was a horribly dumb to do good idea and this idea is a little bit similar but I think way better right yeah more defensible for sure fireflies the company that puts a little add a little billboard thing on top of it uber sober driver could make a little bit more money that's cool but this is this is a little bit different this is more what I'll call it's not dependent on the ad market which I like your internally advertising stuff in the restaurant or the bar to get people to have a little higher check sighs yeah but that's not what they're saying that in their deck they say at first they're doing what you're describing right and they go they said all of our one-year contracts are insanely profitable but our next phase is to sell ad time at $25 per CPM interesting okay all right so maybe maybe the in in restaurant upsell is not as good as I thought and that's why they're like already planning to go out of that and I think that's a good market but will in their numbers what they're assuming they're saying they're gonna have a $25 CPM that's gonna make us way more money and create this new 32 billion dollar market and begin the math is that we have X amount of impressions and we're gonna put $25 CPM ads on there now here's the problem which is their fill rate is not going to be a hundred right and it's not I'm gonna be close to a hundred percent yeah so that's a little ridiculous here's the other thing I don't like so they charge forty two hundred dollars per location per year that's really expensive for a restaurant or bar they also charge a one-time $1500 hardware installation and so I just think that they've added a lot of friction to the adoption of this I think already it was gonna be hard to get people to adopt that's a high price point and a high one-time installation fee that they're asking people to do so I think that's that seems tough for me that said I think that this this could be a business that makes 10 20 30 40 50 million dollars a year in sales this is a great company to own not a great company to invest not a great company if they raised all this money that's my opinion yeah that make sense oh I like this they just had someone smart once told me he's the only thing that you can't screw up in business is your cap table and so when I look at when I look at a lot of these companies I think that could be good so salt so long as they don't screw up their cap table right yeah that is one way to die for the wrong reasons that's a great way to put it okay cool so okay we're gonna come back and we're gonna do more of this I also think we have be sure scheduled tomorrow to come in and talk about buying companies roll-ups that sort of thing and so so we'll see how we'll see how that cures I need to confirm with individual but his name's Brett baby shore at Bayshore he owns something called permanent oh yeah I like that guy yes he's fine then another thing that we can do is Shawn Dave my friend Dave who founded Soylent and also started loosie loosie nicotine is a company you want to he just texted me he said he wants to come on you want him on I definitely want him on all right I've told the story before but I when I bumped into him at that the hustler con after-party we did a mini brainstorm right there and he had you know five bangers you know five amazing ideas just come off the top of his head so he's the type that I look for which is like people who've got more ideas than time do you want me to ask them for this Tuesday or next Thursday yeah let's do a Tuesday all right I'll ask him and hopefully the the people wanted him as well okay thanks for listening everybody stay safe share the podcast tell your friends post on Twitter a little love we're trying to keep growing this thing it's growing and we wanted to keep growing so share it thank you [Music]

so I'm gonna do this one I don't know exactly how you say ease sale or love in wholesale I love this train that up yeah really interesting company so basically the premise is it's a marketplace for buying and selling used smartphones and you know I'll tell you some of their stats I haven't sort of verified how real these are but they say that you smartphone sales are forty six billion dollars a year annual market they say that two hundred thirty million smartphones are sold per year you could do the math that checks out they have so what they did is they made a marketplace where you could if you have phones and you're a wholesaler you can basically say hey I'm either I'm looking to buy or looking to sell and they made it like a stock market you basically put a a bid up you say I'd like to buy this iPhone and if somebody has it they can fill your order and they can basically like dude they can close your transaction out there your ticket out or you can say I'm selling a hundred of these specific Android phones and somebody could say I'll buy ten of those and so they made it easy they said that most of this used to happen through Facebook groups whatsapp sort of the underground you know just using social tools but then I wasn't a marketplace and that was focused on this and so they they've 400,000 and gmv so far now DMV you know you can assume maybe they're making you know in the tens of thousand dollars themself then the GMB gross merchandise volume volume okay so basically how much is total sold through their market so if one sells for a thousand dollars that's $1,000 of gmv their cut might be five percent ten percent of that but this is a because the smartphone if the smartphone if the used smartphone marketplace is this big and they have some stats about how fast it's growing they say that you smartphone sales is growing faster than new smartphone sales per year because you know Apple is trying to like make the old model irrelevant so quickly and sure some people do upgrade but there's all these other phones tool out there that are still very good phones I like I I can afford new phones I up until my most recent phone all of them have been used and the the best part about these guys is so I believe that they were bootstrapped I don't know how much I'm sure but they so they've gotten to this point they they themselves for former buyers and traders of cellphones and they had sold prior to this just as brokers eight million dollars over the cellphones and then decided to create a sort of technology marketplace out of this so if you think about it market love it style of business marketplace love it so I love that love that they're going for use market views smartphones I love that they're doing a marketplace I love that they came from a background where they actually did this manually before and we're sort of prolific brokers eight plus plus love this love this company here on the YC list okay I like it let me play devil's advocate here which is okay so I looked up a few okay so first of all I think that this is a lot harder than people think the reason why I think it's a lot harder is I think it's incredibly competitive with a lot of people who are already very established so I think getting distribution and getting eyeballs on their product is going to be prohibitively expensive maybe I also think that so there's a company called swap uh do you know swap uh no but I see your note here okay here's why this is interesting I've actually used it before but I didn't but what's interesting is I posted or I have a thread that I found of the guy who's what's a swap ax is the same thing but slightly different I don't know how it's slightly different but it's the same it's a you by youself cellphones what's interesting is that in 2011 the guy who started swap up posted on Hacker News and he said hey I'm launching this thing on the side here's what it does and so you can actually go in like see how he started it and it's I don't know how big it is right now but it's it comes up number one when you google by you cellphones so I would imagine it does I bet you it does fifty million dollars in sales at least because I'm comparing it to the person that's number two which is gazelle which is a big company but anyway swap bootstraps and so I if I was a greedy if I was these ease guys how you say it easy yeah if I was these guys and I or what did you say let's go with easy if I was easy I would be greedy and wanna raise very little money like less than a million dollars and just see how well how I can just make this really profitable but you know they say launch three months ago 400 kg MV monthly I'm at 8 percent margin profitable and growing a 20 percent month-over-month of course easy to be profitable when you have two people you're not taking salaries but nonetheless I think this could be a profitable business because of the you know the sort of take rate [Music]

so I'm basically putting together a report of the coolest companies in India that don't have analogs here like for example there's just company called about you have you ever heard of Bijou byj you me why Ju yeah this guy basically started off as a teacher and he would teach like essentially test breath oh you freaking love this I think I've told you about this before believe this yeah you like you say that's your dream this guy he started off as a small teacher in a town basically and was doing test prep and then sort of got bigger and bigger and bigger people wanted to learn from him to the point where he was selling out stadiums of people coming to watch him teach math and that was when I saw the picture of the stadium I thought this is that's right remarkable then he turned it into an online learning platform a basically a video based teaching platform sort of like Khan Academy but for profit and it's eight billion dollar company now and this guy Bijou is sort of one of the youngest billionaires in India he's a t-shirt but could turned billionaire which is very rare and you know cool product cool company and there's actually a company in this YC batch that's trying that's the former first instructor of Bijoux he's like I was the face of Bijou because he was in all the videos and he left to start his own thing he's like you know here's the dirty secret about Bee Gees thing it has very low retention great at making money great at getting people to sign up but less than 15% of people stick with the course as it goes along we're doing this other way and we're gonna win and they're in this batch as well so that's interesting so I would love to ask you questions about that first I want to tell you that I'm looking at their Wikipedia it says they do they're worth eight billion dollars they do 80 million in u.s. dollars in sales and then it says they only have five employees yeah that's wrong and also they do more they do more revenue recently there were over a hundred million I think the last like I've read something where they were where they were doing over a hundred million but so why is it awaiting a 5min please that'd be amazing why is this big in India but not America is because Indians love math and science I mean yes education is like you know God in India like you you can be dirt poor in a village but you'll do anything educate your kids and you know even though these or any people in America you probably have noticed I like you know their parents are pretty strict about education you got to get good grades all that stuff and so Indians are willing to pay anything for education and they don't really pay anything for anything else so entertainment is is usually lower on the list although Bollywood does well but like on a per capita basis where you're gonna spend your money education is sort of number one for for Indians so that's the first part second part is they've such a huge population so you can take a really small amount of money from such a huge number of people and built a very big company that's the second part how much bigger is India than America and population three times so yeah four times I think it's like one pool I think is I think it's over 1 billion and USS 300 million I believe so it'd be like about four times and and of course not all those people have smartphones not all those people have money but like you know it's correct it's India has I sort of the largest growing middle class so that's some of the reason why this works is because people willing to pay for education and there's so many people that if you take a few bucks from each and everybody's willing to pay for this because it's education that adds up but you know eight billion is sort of out it it is outpacing their revenue growth right so I think the part of it is the story of what this becomes and there are sort of defensibility that's probably why they're valued somewhat higher than their valid then their revenue would suggest do you think that that that can be popular in America oh I think so like I think Khan Academy is fairly popular and it's mostly in America no money no it's just yeah it's a non-profit and they don't pour money into growth like these guys do I'm sure these guys are aggressively trying to grow and using their pay back to to sort of fund more growth but yeah I do think like something like this can work here but you know we'll see that there might be other reasons why it doesn't [Music]

[Music] well Meg super excited that you're able to join on the this is gonna be the first episode exit strategy podcast I'm super excited that you're here just a little bit of background about Nick Nick is the co-founder and CEO of thrive market thrive market is like a Costco meets Whole Foods online business he was also an investor in the business that I'd started native I think you know you were one of the bedrocks of native in terms of our investor base I'd give you a call and tell you about all the problems I had all the time and you were really calm about that I mean you didn't have that many investors so I didn't have that many investors but there were even fewer that I felt like I could trust and give a call to and you were certainly one of them so I always appreciated that can you start out and tell everyone a little bit about thrive market in the off chance that they don't know about it already yeah so first just honored to be here super upsetting to get to do something like this I mean my work from home office right now so it's it's a convenient time as well yeah to be here and excited to be to be jamming with you and it's setting where we're not solving business problems we were just getting to play yeah okay that's right so thrive market is you mean you described it well I think the easiest way for people that don't know about the business to get it is to think you know Costco membership club needs Whole Foods catalog all delivered online with increasingly I'd say a bit Trader Joe's blended in so when we launched we were carrying basically the top 78,000 natural organic products that you find in a health food store and then through the membership making them available at twenty five to fifty percent off so mission is make healthy living affordable and accessible to anybody ship anywhere in the country fast and free now we actually have not only all those products but also a lot of our own products so you know fully 1/3 of our sales are on the thrive market brand so you know we started out very much a retailer online I'd say now we're this strange hybrid beast between a retailer a brand and really a community platform online where our members are going to us not just to buy products but to learn how to use them and to participate in campaigns and initiatives that align around their their values and their impact on issues like sustainability and can you talk a little bit about the history of the brand like when did you guys start that when did you guys start you know what what size are you at today what's the growth look like how big is the team yeah so we I mean I could spend hours just answering that question we we started back in 2014 unlike native we didn't have a lien we don't didn't have the capital requirements so you know we spent the better part of the first year self-funded the business and kind of getting up the starting line we tried to raise more capital and we got rejected by 150 plus species so you know first of many existential crises in the business and launched I guess October of 2014 and we finally got live and the the really fortunate thing that happened to us actually ended up being that we were rejected by so many pcs that we raised all of our initial money from health and wellness influencers who turned out to be the best promoters of the business as well so we had this you know probably 100 plus kind of Coalition of the Willing that was on our cap table and then also promoting the business and grew very very fast pretty much from day one you know we have over 700,000 members today we're doing hundreds and millions of dollars in sales you know five years in and still growing big double digits per year and so can you talk about that first year you said that you know you got rejected by dozens of VCS it was you and three other co-founders and you were sort of bootstrapping the business early on what was the cost of that and was that model is sort of the same model that thrive market ultimately became or did you were you guys bootstrapping something slightly different I mean look like like so many businesses we were iterating in real time all the time for the first really for the first several years and in that first year before we got live it was you know almost like the business model morphed every day yeah the very very initial model was going to be a basically Groupon for healthy food so when ganar pitched me back at the very very beginning you know I was a I'd sold my last company was an entrepreneur residence at a startup accelerator probably saw fifteen pitches a day had seen hundreds over the prior few months and you know ganar came in and pitched me on the idea he was calling shop tribe and the idea was to literally build this was like back in 2013 to build Groupon for healthy food so Groupon was like the big thing buying it yes we're gonna change the world I was the way that everyone was gonna buy everything why not do it we were Suri's but what captivated me was the the mission was exactly what it is today which is let's make healthy living accessible to anybody and the initial idea was let's pool people's people's funds by with a wholesale account from these brands directly and cut out all the middlemen and cut the prices by 25 to 50% off so that organic and natural products right below the conventional equivalent so this is a crazy sorry sorry interrupt isn't it crazy how like e-commerce Ehrlich startups are fashionable you know in like twelve and twenty thirteen Groupon for X was fashionable like a few goes goes like uber for X is fashionable yeah you know we we iterated we iterated through every fashionable business model no like we like we were briefly gonna be a subscription box right for poor healthy food so you know the challenge that we are trying to solve or the problem we were trying to solve was how do you make these natural organic products which at retail tend to be 25 to 50 percent more expensive than conventional accessible to anybody and that first barrier was price so Groupon was one way to solve that but it involved getting your groceries on a you know 10 to 15 day delay or more as we tried to buy direct and it involved you know getting your your coconut oil one day and getting your chips the next day out getting your toilet paper the next day just didn't really didn't really work so where we ultimately land it was an evergreen catalog and then this the membership model so really started studying Costco closely and realized that allows you to basically run your product business at zero margin because all the margin comes off with the membership and then for us there's especially positive powerful because we use every paid membership to actually sponsor a free membership for a low-income family so it sort of turbocharged the mission at the same time where it doesn't actually cost us anything to let those low income families and they actually in fact will drive product sales which gives us poor volume but it baked in that ability to truly you know get get margin from people that people that can pay but be accessible to anybody else yeah Costco is business model is crazy when you look at the 10k their net profit is basically the equivalent of the membership feed revenue that they generate and they also limit the margin that they take on any given product and I think for luck you know Kirkland products it's like 13% for other types of products it's something like 11% those numbers might be off by a little bit and I remember I read this one story where the Kirkland C ants are the Cossacks itting on the board of directors of start at Starbucks and Howard Schultz was like guys great news coffee prices are going down we're not reducing prices so our margins are going up and so he goes to Howard Schultz after the meeting and he's like when are you gonna give us a break on coffee prices and Howard Schultz is like we're not intending to pass along any savings discounts to retailers like Costco and he's like great we're gonna eliminate Starbucks coffee from all cost cos pretty soon because you're not passing this along and Howard Schultz is like okay we'll give you a price discount on cents which speaks to cost goes you know scale and position with their with their vendors but also I think your bigger your bigger point is obviously if they pass everything along and their value to the members is the savings on the membership right and that was very much where we started you know the interesting thing is today the value is actually much more right it's the ability to vote you know vote with your dollars for brands whose values you align to it's the ability to get you know all the highest quality products curated in one place it's the ability to shop buy buy your dietary needs and things like that so it's interesting some of the ways the businesses to verge from from Costco sure but fundamentally that first thing we had to solve was how do we make it affordable that only happens if we can go without margin that only happens if we have another source of margin and that was membership and so it's 2014 all these VCS have said no to you how much of your own capital how much of you how much do you put down in order to like start the business in order to pivot from shop drive to ultimately what becomes the right market so slow low six figures you know is that not listen or is that altogether each no ganar me each individually so I mean I could go into the whole kind of like saga we you know we spent $100,000 alone on an agency to build the website which we found out two weeks before we were thinking we are going to launch it basically wasn't even started I was like like our ship shows our level of sophistication we brought in Sasha our third co-founder at that moment of crisis and I remember going to to Sam teller who is a good friend of mine and was running this struck me as a actually venture investor now but at the time was running the startup accelerator Launchpad LA and I'm like who in LA is the best C CTO for startups like wherever they are whatever they're doing we need to hire them we'll give will give them whatever percentage of the company they do now like we're in it word our you know we're the Nexus tential crisis and he's like Sasha artha and fortunately he just rolled off his last business and bridged with another one unfortunately he's talking to like 40 other companies right now ya know we like you know we more or less locked him in a room and didn't let him leave till he's totally til I came on as our as our fourth co-founder and you know had we not done that we literally went have gotten to launch so you know we spend $100,000 there we spent a bunch of money just on payroll ramping up thinking we were gonna launch before we before we did we spent you know it was it was like every mistake you can think of making we probably made and we had no excuse to be doing it either because both ganar and I were serial entrepreneurs we both started and sold businesses before but it was this very humbling reminder that like starting something is hard sure learning takes time and taken the same lesson at least twice before you really learn it and and like I said it in the end a lot of those things ended up being the best things that ever happened to us right we failed to raise money we ended up getting connecting with all the influencers we failed a bit at build a site we brought on the right co-founder who to this day is our CTO you know header product and drives huge amounts of values value in the business so you know it was it was it was challenging but yet like we wouldn't be here where we are had we not stumbled so much early on and were you worried early on when you sort of spent six figures you're like well you poss are we doing here yes yes thousand times yes how old you're being calm Rises you been calling me like yeah we spent six figures and things weren't working if I if it happened to be a doing even today I'd be like I cannot believe this happened no I we weren't calm at all we were you know here's like moments of real despair you know sleepless night it's like all the all the cliched things you would do if you're like pouring honey into a black hole and not seeing anything come out we were feeling so no and it wasn't you know you can look back on it now and it seems like the whole trajectory seems inevitable and this led to this and that led to that but the only thing clearly was leading to at the time was more failure so it was they were some of the darkest darkest times of my entrepreneurial life for sure probably in my life in general I mean you question everything right in the business model you questioned your selection of partner instruction you question yourself of course right like like was I did I just get lucky the first time like am i regressing to the mean here yeah absolutely yeah and so so you launch the site it's on Magento which I think that like people don't talk about enough is there tech stack like I remember talking to Christopher Gavin once from honest and he's like we're reap lat forming for the third time you know in our life at honest and I was like that seems like a lot of work you guys have been on Magento you're doing hundreds of millions of dollars a year is Magento amazing is Magento better than Shopify like why Magento I guess so I mean that's a technical question you should spend some time with Sasha on yeah he would laugh if he urghhh you've been asking me that question but it is you know there's there's pros and cons right every platform has its pros and cons but Gento is very scalable it's also got a really like like robust set of kind of off-the-shelf applications that you can sure that you can use Shopify does too and there's a there's a large developer community so the ability to scale up engineering resources to get going quickly was really imperative at the time we've obviously felt a lot of pressure to launch being six months out individually intended to yeah and so you know that was a that was the call that Sasha I think there's definitely been some challenges with Magento - not to say that it wouldn't have been other challenges with any platform we selected so we've we've actually some of the core e-commerce infrastructure is still on Magento but a lot of the front facing aspects the features of the site and applications we've actually pulled off and put in to react and and other other platforms okay so you're it's 2014 you've spent six figures you've pivoted from shop tribe and a bunch of different models to what ultimately becomes thrive yeah we're still shop drive until two weeks before we launch by the way Wow let's create and I could show you yeah I can show you our our color was magenta was screwed up - sounds like Magento but it was magenta as in like a cross between purple and pink that was all that was the color of the site like the whole branding was that you know our our logo is essentially a gemstone and the company was called shop tribe you know it was not it was not positioned the way it needed to and that actually is a story behind our 4th co-founder Kate Mullen who is a brilliant writer and content content curator editor and brand brand mind and she came in and basically was like guys this wasn't gonna work you know this this and this and I took her two months to convince us to move off of shop tribe so I mean weeks before we were launching I was spending time on the phone with some you know website squatter in Florida trying to buy tribe market calm unless we be forced to launch it Wow okay what did you pay for it ah low it was five like between ten twenty thousand dollars gotcha you know I'm not sure I told you this but when native was trying to sell when we were trying to sell our business we had all like we hadn't we didn't own our trademark and I I think I might have mentioned that if she mentioned this to you while you were investing and I was like I probably didn't wanna I probably don't want to hear this you were actually you were like you need to go solve your trademark issues because we've had a lot of trademark issues and so you know I was like you know sort of it was sort of on the back burner where I was like okay I need to solve these trademark issues M&A is coming up like down the road and I'm like okay these trademark issues are becoming more important and you know at one point we had signed like you know we'd signed not a term sheet but like a letter of intent or something to that effect with with P&G and PN G's like you need to go buy your trade like the only thing holding up the transaction was our trademark and so we purchased the trademark from two people living in the middle of like North Dakota on a Friday and then I'm like the next week on Wednesday we sold the business five days later but it was literally the only thing holding us up from our I'm guessing you paid more than $20,000 or your money no no substantial like more than 10x I felt like we had to do it we're like we never bought Native calm but we had to do is either that or we had to retain like change our name and sort of restart the business and prove that we could do it under a different name and yeah I mean look we've had we've had different challenges with dry market - and probably some some similar to native right you've got a term that is already out of the zeitgeist and there's a lot of common use already of them or some of the marks so it was one of the trade-offs right with with R I love like do we go with something that really evokes something powerful but it's gonna be less ownable from a trademark standpoint where do we try to create you know Nike which is that a totally new word and very own Abul but you know building brand equity around that's gonna take a lot of time so trademark is under underappreciated it's one of those things that you don't think about until until you know there was always pretty been a lot of value built in the business in most cases but if you can solve it early it saves a lot of headache down the road yeah and if someone else on through trademark they have monopsony power right like you they have the only out set that you need and you cannot go anywhere else for it and it's a lot of trouble okay so it's 2014 you've launched the site you've rebranded to thrive market because you realized shop tribe is a big mistake the gemstones out the magenta color is out how do you get your first like you know hundred thousand dollars and cents I mean it was just influencers so this was another social aggregate you had influencers it was 100 percent right so we raised we ended up because we couldn't raise money from any one institutional because no investors were put in it we went to basically health and wellness influencers and asked them to invest in the company in addition to being affiliate partners and what we found out is it not only brought in capital very slowly like we was like ten to twenty five thousand dollar investments but we brought in whatever it was 50 to 100 these folks they were totally aligned with the mission they got what we were trying to do they cared about it themselves they many of them became and have become good friends of ours right who are not just you know financial partners the business but true supporters of our cause and all of those the dynamics cause them to also want to promote in a very different way than they would have if it was just a transactional relationship so they were they were stakeholders they were aligned with vision they got something less as people they understood what we were trying to do with the business and when they started talking to their audiences about it they saw you know mom just monster reactions and so it was it was actually too much too soon I can remember our original warehouse was in the center of our office or offices call it 6000 square feet and to give you a sense of like we have 800 thousand square feet of fulfillment center space today so the entire warehouse fit along with all of us into an office that was 6,000 square feet you know we ended up having within two or three weeks we had storage containers in our driveway that we had racked and been that we were like fulfilling that of you know we like in her entire driveway it was filled with just boxes like stacked so high you couldn't see the sky thing so it was it was crazy but there was no once we actually got live and with these really value elide authentic and supportive influencers talking about us who was like there was no turning back so we believe through that defense yeah and and so they agreed to invest prior to you having $1 in sales virtually call it 80% of the influencers that ultimately like were it like and many of whom still continue to be amazing partners came in before we had a dollar sales which is you know it's very it's a really interesting kind of window into the way BC is think versus the way you know kind of a value or values driven mission oriented investor things every VC said no right none of them could see it yeah and our success rate with the influencers was probably seventy to eighty percent close right you know like three out of four then were coming in and there was two things that they contributed to that one was they just got the they got the value proposition they entered sure that healthy have a healthy living maybe is he healthy living at affordable matters and it matters to millions of people because those millions of people were also the people that were their audiences and then the second side of it was and this goes back to like when I was you know kind of the ways that we got help early on from specific individuals but we had one of my buddies from college john durant who's basically a meta influencer you know to influence her to the influencers if you will and you know coming in through a trusted trusted person that that they really looked to and followed made a massive massive difference so he opened up the doors and then as the dominoes started to fall every influencer knew more influencers are sure to just spiral beginners so we have four hundred people on a cap table today so was was john to rent the first influencer so that signed up who was the first influencer john durant predated all the influencers yeah the first free did the first influencer they came on board was mark Sisson of primal nation at the time this is pre primal kitchen behind you right so he was just mark Sisson of marks daily apple yeah yeah but a mega influencer in paleo and back in 2013 2014 paleo was was much bigger like keto wasn't even on the scene so paleo was the biggest the biggest sort of lifestyle tribe that we were going after and John introduced us to to mark then he introduced us to wellness mama which is but who's been our biggest influencer of all total and then it was just one after the other after that so you know we got very very lucky with from a people side right just getting the right people come the business at the right time and then we got very very fortunate to find people that actually like I said cared about the mission like that was the thing that if we hadn't if we didn't really we were doing it for the right reasons does influence respond to come on board it's also spectacular to get people who are basically going to be your customers to become your advocates as well like nothing more authentic than that so till one I think I've heard you say in the past that you didn't spend a dollar in paid media in the first year and how much look at what our sales look like the first year and what is you what is the first like you know you've raised from I don't know four hundred influencers or something to that effect you know within a year one of them cutting you checks because I imagine it wasn't like one round I'm actually sort of it was investing a check at a time yeah it's rolling how much have they investor so we raised eight and a half million dollars before before doing a series a we did the series a nine months after we launched and we were probably at a forty million dollar run rate at that point you know we did over thirty million dollars in the first year so it was it was crazy so we stood up a 40,000 square foot fulfillment center you know over the course of like six days I remember at one point five for five months in now it was just like doing whatever we could to meet the volume and also in many cases asking influencers not to talk about us right it was like this like crazy backwards situation where it was there was so much demand we could we didn't know what to do with this so to be honest we probably could have done more in sales in the first year than we did and it was very vindicating or very validating of the core thesis of the model right because what the what the feces were always skeptical of is that you know normal middle class middle American people want to get healthy it was like no no they're they're out there like this is my background I grew up in in Minnesota so I know that people in Midwest and the southeast many of whom don't live near a Whole Foods want this but you know VC who lives in San Francisco and doesn't do his own grocery shopping you know yeah sure not in touch with it so it was it was incredible to see that come in where it was like more demand we knew it with and and coming from people that were you know everyday middle post middle Americans is there anyone who you know initially told you no we're not going to fund you that came back and ultimately invested or tried to invest in the series in a lot of a lot of them and some of them it was like oh come on right like when they when you yeah cool it would tell they would tell you that you're gonna fail right or yet the people that like listen and like you know nodded and stuff and I just didn't respond to your emails so you know those are not the people you're gonna let it dance but we also had a lot of people that gave really well reasoned explanations for why they weren't investing and the truth is like we were it's a high-risk bet right it's an operational intensive business now they're ganaron or I had e-commerce experience we're going up against Amazon Whole Foods at the time we're not the same business right of course yeah and and so we had some some some folks that were really really thoughtful one of them was was Dana settle like gray Croft who said no but said hey I also love what you're doing I love the mission I aligned a lifestyle myself as a mom I see the value proposition and I believed in what you're doing it's too early and the risk profile is not right for us right now but let's talk talking in a few months and she continued to follow up and like that's who we went with yeah in this year and you didn't do any of those like Silicon Valley I'm gonna take the meeting and just on you for being to me type of like arounds when you do your Series A or Series B I did those no and I did those all in my head I like fantasy moments but no never ever actually picked up the phone and made that call gotcha so this guy Erlich Bachman goes into VC meetings and like he's like you know what I'm sensing that you guys aren't the right fit in like the VC meetings and he'll be like you know these pastries are and one time he takes his balls out and he actually puts them on the conference room table to be like you and you know there were a bunch of me and on my style yeah no yeah yeah of course you think about that though not that specifically but like a wizard thing about you know like those rejections were so painful right like if you're someone who's competitive if you're someone who succeeded things that they've done in the past to be you know to be told no it's hard to be ignored is even harder right like honestly that was the worst was like the people who don't even give you the time of day sure so it was it was super hard but again it was super formative and like at the end of the day I have to be grateful to those people because we wind up gone to the influencers had those guys said yes and I don't think sure would have build the kind of company that we have uh and so you launch how big is your catalog in year one year two we probably launched with 4,500 SKUs and scale it up to 65 minute equip so it's been more or less stable I mean we I alluded to this earlier but that first barrier we wanted to break down was affordability but the there's all sorts of other barriers to getting healthy one of them is actually just the intimidation factor of like where the hell do I start right and if you if you walk into a Whole Foods they haven't been in a bowl foods before choosing between 50 almond butters it's like totally overwhelming right if you search for almond butter on Amazon you're gonna see 40,000 results so we actually part of our value is to be hyper curated to be that place that is your trusted resource where you don't have to think about whether this is the right quality everything reaches our high quality bar and we're gonna recommend the best products in each category for you and that stayed the same so we're still we're you know our prod our catalog has probably grown less than 500 SKUs in the last two to three years Wow and so they're like is there a lot of recycling among the SKUs like are you pushing yeah okay got your net okay so we're yeah I mean the trends are always changing as you can imagine and we're you know we mix shift we're always always always looking to go deeper with the brands that really align with our values with the brands that really are authentic that have amazing stories that are doing real innovation and we don't want on as the brand that's like become commoditized become lazy you know just sort of turning the turning the crank and if that's the case we'll go into private label and we'll do it ourselves and we'll do it better and so that's that's been actually one of the most exciting things is to see like we can reward these amazing innovative we will invest in deep with them and then in the areas the catalog where there's not as much happening its innovative on the third-party side we can go to the innovation ourselves right so we work with 40 co-packers now on our own brand we're sourcing from supply chains literally all over the world so our product innovators you know notwithstanding our current period but normally they're traveling all over the world all the time sure and we're now getting to a scale where we can actually like build supply chains ourselves so like we you know we're working with the farmers collective in Patagonia that didn't exist before thrive market you know we're standing up this collective that is helping to convert farmers down there to traditional grass-fed beef practices that's you know cool stuff like that that's been just amazing and so when you have a catalog of 4,500 products or 6500 products later on how do you like or you know Facebook has this of had this amazing realization early on that if you were able to get seven friends in 10 days you'd get addicted to Facebook slack says that once a team has sent out two thousand messages internally in slacks or has you know has had two thousand slacks people are addicted to slack and will not churn is there some sort of North Star that you were looking for there would you like if we can get you to make five purchases in the first month or if we can get you to purchase kettle and fire bone broth in the first year you know you're gonna get hooked to our brand yeah there's a there's a bunch of those there's a there's a big question in my mind always of how much of those like how much of that is correlation versus causation right and as soon as you start to do things to drive the behavior the correlation and the causation can start to break down yeah but I mean the the most obvious thing is if people order they will stay period like the most important proxy for value and it's not even really a proxy it is the source of value is people getting products that they love and coming back to buy those products again so you know we will like the first order is sacrosanct for us we want to drive as many people the moment that they join the membership to be placing a first order within 30 days and that's you know days zero we look at day zero day seven day thirty day day 30 order rates we also have a concept we call core members so those are members that have placed form or lifetime orders and what's interesting is we got regardless of the rate that takes you to the rate that those orders are placed in or how long it takes you to get there once you have placed four orders there's a really significant inflection and in stick right and we're you know we're pretty lucky and that the upfront membership fee also act as as a filter to get people who truly aren't invest in a life cycle I think one of the biggest mistakes we made early on the marketing side was trying to convert people right that's not our that's not actually what we can do today as we get bigger scale and go more mainstream maybe that'll be something for the future but today what we want to do is capture the people that already want this lifestyle that are working really hard to achieve it but don't have the best option and as soon as we start we call that the wellness champion and you know if we can go after those people bring them in and get them the first order that is you know those people are gonna get a renu-it a very high rate and today our renewal rate annually are over 70 percent so it's it's not as high as Costco but I think if you looked at part of the reason Costco's are over 90 as they've titrated the membership base over so many years if you look at you know apples and apples our first two your second year 30 or renewal rates I bet were on par would be my would be my hypothesis and they don't they don't obviously don't publish their cohort data sure sure yeah and so what does that mean in terms of people so people who buy memberships what percentage are buying an actual product in the first 30 days so it depends on the source of the traffic but half of people will order in the first or purchase your first 30 days yeah almost almost a third of them will place in order of the first day and you know we used to actually have used to be a hundred percent because literally the way you would start your trial membership was by placing the first order that's something we actually decoupled those two steps I call it it's really two problems in one there's a I call the basket building problem and then the the membership problem and neither one is really a problem but it's like it's it's it's a it's a task that we have to do so we have convince someone that it's worth spending $60 a year on a membership and then we have to get them to place an order which is not trivial for us because the average unit value is only six dollars the average order size was over 70 so we're getting them to put 10 to 15 or even 20 items into a card that's a 40 to 50 minute exercise for most people on their first order so our CPAs are where I'm sure are I'm sure higher than the native CPAs okay but but the value of that customer if you can get them to place that order is white I absolutely would you know a native our average order value is about 20 to 21 dollars and we also saw the same inflection point which is if you purchase native four times you are never going to use another TIA we have you and we were really excited about that so you know we were talking about like how categories change and I went from like the world has gone from paleo taquito you know for native like deodorant also went from deodorant charcoal deodorant became a much bigger thing and never existed a few years ago what are some of the categories that you've seen sort of grow at thrive and what are the categories that are like the largest if you could talk about that today yeah I mean we can spend a while talking just about charcoal if you want that's that's been one of the most bizarre trends and it's sort of across all categories you have charcoal in your beverage charcoal and your deodorant it's important it's like faded a bit right and like all these all of these all of these trends right the the faster they rise that the faster they fall typically you know 2019 was all about CBD you know the CBD hemp extract and you know we were seeing I mean of like growth rates that we had never seen in any category period to the point that CBD was becoming one of our top five subcategories on the entire site and it's still doing really well but it's stabilized and then it's and then dropped off I think for some of the more commoditized commoditized skews quito continues to be huge and it has been for now a year and a half to two years you know looked at some of the Google search trends and it's definitely had a little bit but that hasn't gotten a case for us we're still seeing that as at a diet dwarf all of their dietary search terms combined so it's that big and you know plant-based is as you'd imagine is also really really significant I think one of the most heartening trends that we've seen on-site in general has been more interest in environmental responsibility and sustainability so you know just an anecdote there where carbon neutral or shipping we actually buy offsets to be completely neutral neutralize our shipping footprint our carbon footprint nobody cared about that four years ago even our most like hard core members was like do you free shipping we actually get we get as many enquiries today about carbon neutral shipping as we do about free shipping so people really are starting to care about that you know reusable vessels we were 98% virgin free virgin plastic free and all of our packaging you know we went fully recyclable in our packaging zero waste fulfillment like these are topics that were not in the zeitgeist five years ago for most consumers even a natural organic consumers today they absolutely are so I would say if I were to pick the top three I'd say environmental responsibility keto and plant-based are probably the three the three big ones and then within there there's all sorts of flavors and so if you let's break down the what was the largest one of these at Quito let's break that down a little bit like is it you know is it Quito snackbars is it Quito you know like like you know a Soylent version of Quito can you break a dead Quito everything is key to Quito averages Kido Kido Kido Kido strips right for the actual testing for for your ketone levels its exhaust owns which are like you can actually like ingest ketones to make it to go ketogenic it is it is a bunch of different products that are keto per se but map to the keto keto diet whether it's nuts and seeds or it's MCT oil or it's collagen peptides you know it's it's it's incredible it's like it's been absolutely amazing it's a number one acquisition strategy as well historic again now withstanding this moment which is very different with the way to cope at 19 but by his store and you know very interesting by the way and a crisis people have stopped thinking about their diet all right they just want to get healthy food but in a normal time people are absolutely obsessed with keto and it's the number one acquisition strategy we have that's interesting I definitely but let me talk a little bit more about like you know you said keto is your number one acquisition strategy you've grown from you know thirty million dollars a year one on the backs of influencers to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue today you know you went from zero dollars in paid marketing spent with a bunch of the affiliates to what I imagine is much more robust marketing budget like I think I've seen you guys run TV ads out of home ads I'm sure you're doing Facebook Ads you know where are you spending money today when you're when you're trying to do paid acquisition yeah I mean we're still overwhelmingly did it we definitely pulled in some of the more traditional channels but you know paid social works for us paid social in combination with influencer works really well for us influence what does that mean that like an influencer sort of posting something and you promoting that that Facebook post we've done that we've had actually done advertiser access with the with influencers that we have really great partnerships with and obviously they control the message of the content but we pay for the media we've also just seen that if we run Facebook ads with our influencers likeness and again in partnership with them and all the content they can perform extremely well we also see that if somebody you know when we're spending on it's an ecosystem right so people most people even if you're doing last click attribution there's there's multiple touches that are contributing to that conversion and so you know we will see that facebook has something top of funnel builds awareness and then when it partnered with you know you do a partnership promotion you that they've nothing to do with each other those two sources spend contribute to both both channels being more efficient so influencers actually a real renaissance for us since we split out that funnel so it's interesting on Instagram is you'd imagine it's it's overwhelmingly mobile traffic same thing actually on Facebook but Instagram especially and especially with so many of our influencers being Instagram influencers we were seeing that when you try to get somebody to start a trial well place in that first order the chance you were gonna get that conversion in that moment on the phone when someone's going through their Instagram feed given that it takes 40 or 50 minutes is just super super well yeah so you had one an attribution issue where people were finding us through Instagram but we're then converting later and not being attributed but to you just had a lot of fall-off right in the funnel so as we switch to a simpler funnel let people sign up directly for membership gave them monthly and annual options all of a sudden our influencer channel just started performing like dramatically better like 50% better in terms of in terms of last click contributed CPA which has allowed us now to go a lot more influencers to promote more heavily with our with our top influencers and so that's now you know it was overwhelming their largest channel for a long time than it wasn't now it is again which has been super I'm sorry what was your overwhelming was at Facebook or Instagram or are you sort of influence our influence or is knowledge Facebook's had its moments I wouldn't say we spend a lot of time talking about Facebook I'd probably say a lot of dumb stuff since you're the Facebook master but we we have struggled honestly with Facebook and I think only in recent months started to understand its role in the funnel and you know if you're lucky enough to have native on your hands where you can actually make last quick work with Facebook yeah and then back out on that like you know an actual attributed CPA basis you're very lucky we can't but yet what we found is it does serve a really important role in the funnel and when you start to when you you know when you get away from just like the myopic last-click way of looking at things and you start to think about what is the true CPA and I'm not even talking about multi-touch attribution I'm just talking about intuitively putting your team in half yeah I'm thinking more broadly about what it's doing in your in your marketing ecosystem and we've done some tests to lists to just actually try to quantify that it's really significant so we've actually interestingly been leaning into Facebook a lot more over the last six to nine months and a lot of that also has to do with the with simpler and so if influence was your number one channel what is your number two channel what is your number three channel number one channel might spend as influencers number two would be I would be Facebook and what is the matter you paid search and we've had three paid search and paid shopping with actually but our biggest channels and that is that is to me an artifact of us like over focusing on the bottom of the funnel right because last click will tell you those channels comfort really really well yeah they're also stealing a lot of conversion definitely Google used to tell me there'd be like where you're like cheapest CPA and I'm like take out all branded search terms and branded ads from this and then what is the CPA and they're like why would you ever do that and I'm like somebody just found our product on Facebook Google this product click the ad and you're trying to claim all the credit for this yeah I mean I guess breakthrough we ever I don't know if this is I know this podcast isn't just about marketing but the biggest breakthrough we ever had on paid search was to split our branded and non-branded paid search like they're two totally different atoms nothing right like you don't even I will literally like scream if I'm in a meeting where people talk about our CPA I'm paid search as a whole as like and then it's in degree more yeah do you have a $60 CPA but your CPA on branded is $10 in your CPA and nom read it is 200 your peanut butter so for $200 you get yeah yeah I'm like branded search is a tax that Google Google forces you to pay so that you don't lose the search you know the search box or something else and you know Google whenever I'd explain that to my Google rep Google would be like oh I guess I get what you mean and I'm like you must have heard this from everybody else like nobody thinks of Google's branded search as like a real acquisition it's acquisition it's somebody finding your product somewhere else and sort of pang Google for paint you have to you having to pay Google for it we only have a few minutes left I want to ask a few fun questions what is your favorite product on threat market I mean that's like asking who's your favorite child right I love them all they all end right now you have one kid so you have an answer to that it's a yeah it's super easy and then I guess I would probably go with the with the first product right which I was our extra virgin organic Fairtrade coconut oil I mean that's the one that started it all uh it was both it's a pretty dense addition it was our acquisition hook and it's an amazing product now we're doing a fully regenerative which is also super exciting can you talk about the best selling product on thrive like I don't know if you say no it's popular I already mentioned its collagen peptides so so II two years ago or five years ago collagen was basically a beauty product now it's become a health supplement so just you're like amazingly the industry that has emerged that is now taking bovine collagen and converting it into high-quality source of protein what is like um you know I we you and I've hung out a few times you're generally incredibly healthy person what's an indulgence product that you still buy off of thrive market like do you get haagen-dazs on private market or from like from somewhere else besides dry market actually both another one no both oh interesting um I mean on private market it's definitely chocolate so you know I hope her dark like dark dark dark dark dark dark but there's you now have this and this is also a huge trend we didn't talk about that kind of ties into Kyoto but you know the the sort of sugar free sweets are blowing up for us and whether it's brands like smart sweets or lillies chocolate you know monk breed sweetened chocolate has been incredibly incredibly popular LeConte oh I love lilies I can eat a whole one of those bars so that would be my indulgence on thrive got your off thrive I don't buy a lot of junk food but I'll tell you the like one candy I cannot resist is skittles skittles yeah like I'll buy one of those like giant bags at the movie theater and finish it halfway through the movie wow that's crazy okay well thrive market ever sell its branded products in brick-and-mortar stores yes one hundred one hundred percent whether that's in someone else's brick-and-mortar stores or ours is the decision we'll have to make okay gotcha um this is not a fun question his Co vat19 been good for you or bad for you I mean it's it's a it's a national and obviously international crisis it has been a huge opportunity and we feel like a responsibility for us to step in and obviously provide at a level that we've never had to so you know we it's gone from like finding healthy groceries into something that a lot of American families were thinking about to getting access to any groceries or something every American family is thankful about so you know I would never say it's been good for us it is definitely created volume for our business it's created a insane number of challenges on the back end but it's you know it is the ultimate moment for a mission like this is our opportunity to go you know truly make it accessible the time when people don't have a lot of options yeah and I don't mean I certainly don't mean like covin 19 being like evidence throwing parties cuz there's two - 19 I really mean like right has a business perspective ya know we are at the we're in the opposite yeah okay finally but this is gonna be my last question because we're almost out of time you know you guys have raised hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue hundreds of millions of dollars in PC funding you guys there there's four co-founders a team of what must be a couple hundred people I think the last time I visited the office hundreds of million dollars in revenue who what is the exit strategy with this business will you be working here ten years you know Jeff Bezos is never gonna quit Amazon Mark Zuckerberg is never gonna leave Facebook will you ever leave thrive market is that happen in the next 24 months five years five to ten years like where where when does this happen yeah I guess the way I would answer that question is every time that I have tried to predict the future even one year out in the past I've ended up being so wildly wrong and I don't do it anymore you know we we were building this business for the long term whether I'm the right person to be the CEO ten years from now I don't know what I like to be the leader of where I think this business is going absolutely do I think we have the opportunity to build a business that is doing billions if that tens of billions of dollars in sales I absolutely do do I think that this mission has to be achieved I think that it's it's ludicrous that it's easier and cheaper to buy highly processed denatured foods that healthy and organic ones and I think it's it's bad for people's health and it's destroying the destroying the planet so whether it's thrive market or something else like this has to happen in the world and and so I believe that we are well more well better position than anyone else to do it and I would be very very happy if we were sitting here ten years from now and I was still plugging away on thrive market and we were having the impact that I believed we could and are your investors clamoring like you know at native we didn't really have like we didn't have a lot of investors and so we didn't have anyone clamoring for returns like you were an investor you weren't cool I didn't want you to sell it I would have loved you too I wanted to keep going yeah fair enough in fact you weren't the only one when I called a couple people and told them we were selling the business they're like you and I was like holy we're returning you know significant returns on a capital investment but yeah by the way they did but I should have said this the very beginning part of the reason I'm honored to be on this cause I think native is the best investment in the shortest time on that I've ever had and it has made me look smarter to so many people the night and I really am as an investor so thank you for that know our investors are patient like that was one of the really advantageous things of bringing in people that aligned with the values and the mission is they want to get to the same place we want to get to and it doesn't mean that the right strategic thing for the business may not be to find a partner at some point it doesn't mean that we may not choose to go public and and and create liquidity for our investors but you know when we go public that's not the end of the business that's the beginning of the business certainly right if we choose a partner it's not because we're trying to wash our hands and walk away it's because we think that's gonna accelerate our path to scale so you know I think that for us the greatest asset in our business is that long term vision and the willingness to plan for that and act act in that direction versus optimizing for a short-term outcome and I think if we continue to do that wherever wherever the outcome lands like it's gonna be you know we're gonna have a tremendous impact okay finally you know if you're you guys were based in LA I tweeted yesterday that I was gonna interview for this podcast and a bunch of people said hey we want to sell our small like we want to sell our small businesses product to thrive market what's the best way to get in touch with your buyers is it LinkedIn is it a bad idea because you guys have a limited SKU set or are you still looking for new products we're always looking for new products right like we want to find that light that innovative product that's on the bleeding at the edge of the trend curve that's doing something really unique that has really strong values that has a great founder that is what we live for and so yes like email our buyers ping them on LinkedIn you can go online and actually submit like literally like submit a form that will go into our buyers we read every single one of those a lot of our best products have come in straight through the front door so no we're always looking we are incredibly discerning we reject you know 30 to 50 brands for every one that we bring in but we are always looking yeah and just as a note you guys rejected native which I loved is a story by the way I know I I don't I don't know card oh you're a controller no no no I leave me I push no I love the independence of your buyers to be like this isn't the right product for our consumers even though you as an investor in the CEO of the company we're pushing in one direction your buyers were saying no I love the ability that you have look of buyers to be able to sort of stand up to you sort of said this isn't the right product for us that's right okay fantastic Nick this was great I I want to sign off by thanking you for three things one is doing this podcast two is certainly investing in native and sort of being this fantastic resource that I had for years I remember I'd call you up we chat on the weekends because both of us worked on the weekends and you were like this calming rational force you were the only person telling me not to expand into 15 other categories and I really appreciated that and and finally like when we sold the business and I sort of emailed all of our investors asking them to sign the docs you congratulated me and you said I bet you built this business the way you wanted to and I really appreciated that I was trying to build native the way that I thought was right for me as a CEO as an operator and not for anyone else and I think that made that cause you know there were a lot of mistakes that we made as a result of that and you know possibly selling was one of them certainly the business is a lot bigger today than it was two years ago but that note meant a lot to me and like I still read it from time to time and I really appreciate you saying that to me so so thanks for all three of those things really appreciate your presence in my life that that means so much and I appreciate you saying that and and that note reflected one of the things that I learned from you was just was that maniacal focus and that willingness to do it exactly the way you wanted to so it's it's been a two-way street and much more to come Nick thanks so much for your time really appreciate this [Music]

[Music] hey everyone I'm Brad Wolverton I head up the editorial team here at the hustle and today I'm joined by Zack Crockett who's our senior editor of our Sunday stories welcome Zack oh yeah I just wanted to talk to Zack briefly to tell you all about this amazing story he's working on for this Sunday if you've enjoyed our coronavirus coverage you're gonna really be impressed with what Zack found this week so a couple weeks ago he did a survey of our audience and was looking for people who had survived the Great Recession and wanted to find some stories of lessons that they had learned to share with our audience so tell us a little bit about the survey Zack and what kind of response you got yes I mean just to start off I mean everyone knows the the Great Recession is a totally different crisis every every recession in crisis is totally different obviously this is a health crisis in addition to a potential financial crisis but there it is interested in talking to some small business owners who've been through basically been to hell and back there there are a lot of lessons and sometimes it changes your business in a permanent way so we were kind of curious to to reach out to small businesses that went through it last time around and hear about some of the universal lessons of what it takes to survive a rough time in general we you know got a couple hundred responses from all over the place I've basically spent the last two weeks talking to you know lotion makers and Scotland and farmers in the middle of the country car dealership owners in small town Illinois cabinet makers in Tucson Arizona just all kinds of all over the map all kinds of small business owners entrepreneurs inventors no matter what the size of your business is some of these struggles are you know result recessions and crises hit businesses in very different ways but it was so interesting to see just the very response of how people got through this what it was like for them some people thrived during the recession other people it was fighting tooth and nail to just keep your employees on board and pay the rent there was just a really incredible varied response with people all over the place anything really stand out to you in a big-picture way Zach that you found that's that could be universal universally applicable or helpful for people well a couple of things one of the questions we asked in the survey was whether people were defensive or offensive during the recession and the response was actually pretty interesting it was almost a 50/50 split it was about 6040 offensive defensive so I didn't really see a major trend with wit strategy with them fundamental strategic approach you know I also asked what they would have what kind of characteristics they had to adapt to survive we saw a lot of cost like severe cost-cutting down to five ten dollars monthly expenses just total red lining of budgets and and going through things with a fine-tooth comb I saw a lot of pivoting flexibility was really big that cabinet meant sure that cabinet maker from Tucson I mentioned considers himself an artist he's one of the preeminent furniture designers in the area really respected very high-end furniture and during the recession he pivoted to bill cabinet he basically became a cabinet maker so he became kind of a general contractor more than an artisan and you know in the grand scheme of things that might sound like a small cost to pay to survive but it took a tremendous amount of time and energy and effort to be able to make that pivot it's like it's like me a tech reporter just being having to learn how to report on science over night or something it's a completely different thing so yeah we also saw you know some people took made a very difficult decision to go to double-down and go all in and expand during the recession I think the car dealership owner I mentioned the auto industry was hit incredibly hard used car sales dramatically decreased which is one of the biggest revenue drivers of any car lot and instead of cutting costs he decided to double down on his used car inventory and use it as a time to bulk things up and then when things started to shape up again he was able to outbid a lot of his competitors on the priced used cars so it's one thing I learned in the last few weeks just talking to so many people is it's hard to find universal blessings because business is just so personal and subjective and it's such a labor of love that every situation is different but I think that there were a lot of things that came out of this that even hedging that this is a very different situation and there are all kinds of businesses many people could apply to their own situations right now makes sense well I don't want to spoil it for you because you have a lot more you're gonna tell in your story you're gonna talk to a lot of people and tell their stories make sure you open our email on Sunday I didn't want to tease one more thing there are lots and lots of people who have told their stories and we have a database of these people and we're gonna do something pretty special with it too so we've got some plans for that not exactly ironed out yet but we're going to be able to offer that people to learn some of these lessons as well so anything else you want to say Zach well you want to tell me about what's behind you there besides that the beautiful guitar what is that your outline taped up to the to the wall yeah sometimes I'll print out my my outlines my stories and just go over it physically it helps a little bit it's it's just hard to work it as anything in your head sometimes when I saw on a screen toggling back and forth between tabs and spreadsheets it's nice to hold something in your hand sometimes and look at a physical document very cool well we have you have a ton of fans out there maybe we should do a separate segment on how you actually put one of these toys to go sometime so that will save that for another time but thanks for joining us today Zach and everybody make sure you open the email on Sunday [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
so Airbnb some interesting things are going on so Airbnb you know very well is awesome company one of the sort of most successful startups of the last decade or so and was about to go public this year and was preparing for it and now with coronavirus you know travel has stopped hospitality you know hotels casinos they're all taking a total beating and Airbnb of course is gonna get caught up in the crossfire as well and so a couple interesting things here so Airbnb financially you know their revenue must have dropped by fifty sixty seventy eighty percent essentially overnight and with an indefinite time span we don't know how long this is gonna last the second thing is Airbnb not only does have a huge you know staff on payroll and now revenue drops but all the hosts were essentially small small small entrepreneurs so some people did you know a traditional thing they just rented out an extra bedroom in their house but a lot of people once they got a taste of that money they started buying places renting out places and subleasing and basically putting it on air and bebe and so all those people now there's this thing that was a moneymaker for a couple of years has gone to zero and so I think there's something very interesting that's gonna happen where what happens to all these hosts who got places just to Airbnb them and now the Airbnb income has sort of totally dried up are they gonna default on their mortgages are they gonna default on the rent payments if they're if they're subleasing or are they gonna turn into just normal rentals I don't know what's gonna happen but what about all this so you already know what's going on in Zillow you're the one who told me right well I did see some charts yes so I saw some charts that basically showed on Zillow normal housing so just normal rentals not a short-term Airbnb stay but just here's an apartment for lease for six months is exploding so like it looks like the coronavirus it's like here's last month one little blue dot this month fifteen blue dots on the map right it's like the number of listings is exploding for rentals which is also bad for Airbnb because in places like San Francisco where there's a house shortage and four years Airbnb has been saying oh we don't contribute to the housing shortage we are we're a different thing altogether well now it's actually kind of a whether it's whether it's truly the the proof or not I don't know but it certainly does look like if you're somebody who was anti air B&B you have a lot of evidence a lot of ammunition now to say hey look when we turned air B&B off look at how much more housing supply came on the market look how that lowers rents for everybody well you know what Airbnb is doing now though is long-term rentals they've been getting into that for a while where you could rent something for many months maybe many years and that part is growing so it's growing a lot right now right so I'm curious whether people in cities who are anti Airbnb are gonna take this and run with it and yes yes very sensitive to legislation right they changed some rules here in San Francisco where it's like you can only do 90 days out of the year and you have to live in the place you have to prove that blah blah blah and that you know eliminated like 30 or 40 percent of the listings overnight when that legislation happened to your or to ago so now I wonder if it's gonna get worse sander you know sander I'm googling them right now you know them know oh that's the like it's the hotel or explain saunder it's basically if you are traveling for work and you want to go stay somewhere you'll stay at asan der often let's see I'll go to sander comm it's also if you want to stay somewhere for like three months like let's say you're going somewhere for three months and you want to and you have to make a lot of money in order to do this it's high-end like in San Francisco it's like five or six grand a month need a place to stay or work we know it's time here the better yeah the best parts of home and hotel so it's like a it's like a an apartment that you can rent for two months right so the upper housing but done well yes but they just laid off 20% of their company it looks like wow yeah today so I think that's gonna be very interesting how these different companies get affected you know I'm rooting for Airbnb I think it's a great product I think it's a great company I hope that they have you know a war chest of cash that lets them endure this time but you know we'll see it's a keeping an eye on it if you could invest a little bit of what you can you can go and buy secondary shares if you're gonna invest money at Airbnb z-- previous valuation I think they raised money on a thirty billion dollar valuation would you invest in that right now what I need to know more right I need to know about the how the company's financials look and let's say that revenue drivers people let's say revenue dropped 70 percent for this I'm not so concerned about the 70 percent drop because that's that I think is is more temporary so I just need to know do they have enough cash in the bank to endure this or that that's three billion dollars okay so you've got three billion dollars you know they're probably burning several million a month but like okay three billion should still last you through this time and then the other question is where the fundamentals good to begin with so a lot of times these companies don't have great unit economics or fundamentals to begin with and so when the downturn comes and people start looking for things that are more stable more sure bets these high-growth but poor unit economic companies they struggle they were profitable in 2018 this is like a analysts call again I think they're also profitable in 2019 this is all public information right so yeah so if they're public if they're profitable right now even with this explosive growth and yeah it's probably a pretty good bet to pick up a little secondary there [Music]

so how about as a kid like were you entrepreneurial yeah so I grew up in Missouri and then I went to college in Tennessee and when I was in Tennessee I own a chain of hot dogs science called southern Sam's wieners as big as a baby's arm man and like how old were you I started when I was like 20 but before that I was selling stuff on eBay but like that was my first legal business I got business license and paid taxes and things like that have you seen a TV show called American Pickers yes so Mike the main guy the skinny guy I met him on the street cuz I was a big fan and I asked him to work at his company at his store he was opened up a store where they sell like all the old [ __ ] and I worked there and it was great but there was always a line of like a thousand people and I was like I'm gonna go open up a hotdog stand some hotdogs these people and that's what happened because the show was so famous tapia when I worked there in 2011 or no sorry 2008 or 9 or something like that we were number two on cable behind Pawn Stars and all these people from around the world would come and get in this line where was that it was in Nashville and it but is he like he's into old stuff right so he got this old building that was away from everything and there's no restaurants and I was like huh these guys I'm from the south so I can say this but they're kind of rednecks who would come and wait in line and I was like these [ __ ] what's up hot dogs at water that's all they want and I opened up this hotdog stand and that was like my first hustle yeah first business made money and I'd pay taxes and got licenses and how did that go how long did you do it for a few years I mean you would make a great a day on a good day yeah it was awesome and then I started a website that made a little bit of money but I was like oh the Internet's the way to go and so I left school and moved out to Silicon Valley in San Francisco and originally had job offers at Airbnb but at the time was called air bed-and-breakfast but I was like you know screwed this let's try to start something so I started a roommate matching app that had a small exit and then kind of parlayed that into the hustle and what I'm doing now and what was that company called and who did sell - it was called bunk originally bunk SF it was what we would do is kind of funny we would cold email all these landlords and apartments of who had two three four five bedroom apartments and then we would host parties so people who had similar once and needs for living situation could all meet one another and we would help them move into these buildings and we would take a small cut of like a placement fee and so it was a small exit like hundreds of thousands of dollars to apartment lists apartment list comm did you have to work in that company or now yeah and I quit on the first day yeah like that last day how was that how would you know as somebody who now it sounds like your whole career has been for yourself how was that year working say was good like I still don't know [ __ ] like I had to read books on like how to run a meeting so I felt like I moved to San Francisco from Tennessee I and I'm gripping Missouri I always felt really uncomfortable not a place there but I love it now I didn't know anything like I would say things that were inappropriate I would wear stuff I wasn't supposed to wear I just felt horrible so it was good to see like what an actual business is run like but I was also young I was 22 and I was partying and I didn't take it as seriously as I should have and I regret that big time but it was great to see what was the biggest table would you argue the one or two or three biggest takeaways were from that year even though you're like okay so you guys have a great setup here okay um you started in like a small room I imagine that's a shitty office that's right and so just seeing like wait I could take all these little silly things like a hotdog stand or whatever and like properly build it out with nice offices after you get revenue and like like I need you in order to get huge as big as my ambitions where you really need to properly approach things and be able to like have a proper levels as opposed to have you started the challenge proper so like for example what was funny running through my mind and when you just said you know I read books on how to run a meeting properly I was like laughing in my head because I was like [ __ ] man I probably hate that book right because like to me like meetings and like how the world those proper things you're referring to see meetings and how I personally see meetings there's a huge Delta and I'm Kaldur you now I just I'm 30 I'm curious you know someone who also came from Adam and never understood proper I always wonder I'm always challenging myself of like what was I naturally gifted in in an entrepreneurial and human way what has evolved over these 22 years of operating and what have I taken on that is horseshit because it's osmosis yeah I know I feel you but here in my mind it's like this okay when you play an instrument when you learn a guitar you don't it's most people don't play songs of their own songs right away they kind of copy other people and feel the texture and they go oh I see some kind of like the stuff that I like I see a recurring patterns yep this is interesting I can I can disregard this other stuff so what I do is I usually read books I'll read like I'll read your guyses glass doors okay other companies glass doors about what people say well yeah like what's the baseline for like what is interesting and I can you can hit cherry-pick but you don't know like anything you have it's easier to have like a model and then you can know what to disregard yeah but I would argue that your analogy for the way you went about it unless I'm missing something is actually not flawed but not exactly the same analogy because it sounds like based on your hot dog business what you're telling me is you didn't play other people's music you picked it up started playing something and within that micro area it worked I would also I would also argue that you know it's really interesting where the source of information comes from right so there's a lot of business books being written by people who've never run a bibliography fair enough Glassdoor is just anonymous reviews yeah very dirty do one foreign or one other end that's what I mean I mean you're at this young age where you've had these levels of successes you know I have such empathy for where you're coming from because I'm sure I had a lot of those same feelings of like I'm from out of bounds I don't go to business school and things of that nature and I remember ironically it's an interesting for you to bring that up I also remember kind of hitting the Silicon Valley scene and like every single person went to Stanford and Harvard it's uncomfortable and I was like thank God for me very different for you that I already had such a real significant win that I was able to kind of use that but I have so much empathy for what must have been going through your mind in that scenario on the flips you're catching me at a very funny time where I would not what are we 20 for these eight weeks are probably the favorite eight weeks of being an operator in a long time because I decided going into this year that I was gonna go more me because I really let the company do its thing I'm running the company but I've let the osmosis of like classic executives have a lot of say over the last half decade and I would argue that the last eight weeks have been some of those productive weeks at vaynermedia's history and definitely my favorite time in the last 40 years because I'm going back a little bit to hotdogs with the baby arm [ __ ] yeah I I don't disagree we agree I think that but it's still important it was important for me to understand because you needed that contact yeah I get it I get it like problems like my thing all right I'm just gonna pick take this thousand dollars in cash I'm gonna put that [ __ ] right in my pocket right like but you don't you know spend it on some dumb [ __ ] oh you got it keep going you know I just did do things right didn't do more accounting things like that now that we have an eight figure you know we make seven figures a month is it good I think it can be a very large company just learning how to do [ __ ] properly now not everything needs to be proper know the outside world but like there are some things like I got to make sure I do things the right way 100% you know when things go from just have you brought in people like I said Adam is our president which who I knew from high school he kind of he's the president runs a lot of the day-to-day stuff he's a straight man yeah yeah and so I'm able to like I'm able to kind of be my while itself and then well we don't always meet in the middle sometimes I will still go the wild route but like there I have some proper procedures dude for a while I was doing the accounting and not good a night it was like I thought cash flow and revenue were the same thing like guys we got to get these people put that money in our bank that's not revenue I'm not paying your quota on that and I get it and then you can learn all that right stuff you know how that the right way to do it that's what I'm referring to I totally understand you know how it is like not coming from this area it's really uncomfortable at first but it's actually a advantage in the end I think a hundred thousand percent I used to have this book club called the anti MBA because when I moved to San Francisco so jealous of all these Stanford people so I would create this book club and we'd meet once a week and then we'd get experts to come in and lead the discussion and I was like we just did the same thing as Stanford of course but yeah it's really uncomfortable I think and you know how it is [Music]

okay so we talked about cron art art and res karat and Lil Lilia that's just right name you have $100,000 to put in one which one you're gonna do mmm all right let's take a look it's not gonna be cron for me I'm also gonna say it's not gonna be Lilia because even though I like the market for all those reasons we mentioned I don't know why this is the winning company I don't see them doing anything special and this is the what we have to tell people is once you meet the person behind it that could totally change your decision crucial is right this is not based on the people at all because you could beat someone and you're like they're so formidable that's like you don't care what you sell them in right I think if I was gonna do this this is crazy to me that I'm even saying this but I think I would be putting it in Arden rez I think I would put it in because I think if they can get the marketplace spun up it's gonna be valuable and I think that this is an overlooked marketplace so overlooked market so I like that it's a marketplace as a model not lead-gen not not anything else and then they on the other side I think if they can get I have a feeling that the sort of fine art marketplace has not been affected by technology in the same way as all the other industries have and so I'm curious to see what they can do so I would bet the hunter K on the art and res and I would write it off as a loss because I would assume it's going to be a loss all right I would do a cron okay why cron I just think it's it's super easy for them to be in default survival it's so easy like I think that they can get to like $100,000 in monthly revenue like really fast I think their churn might be high but III think that it's just because of the market size and because it's an impulse buy and if this just saves you a little bit of time I just think that they can get to 10 or 30 million dollars in recurring revenue inside three or four years with very little capital and so their default alive pretty easily and depending on how creative that entrepreneurs are they could expand beyond that so I'm gonna go to cron okay I like that I don't know who would buy them though well like for example Microsoft BOTS sunrise calendar I believe it was an Islander that people really liked was a pro professional calendar and they got bought for how much but I know like inbox Cal bought for 100 million for making a slicker inbox you know by Google and then sort of thrown away sunrise got bought so so I think that there's potential for an acquisition there by one of the you know big companies that cares about you know enterprise and productivity and whatnot so there's there's a chance there I just want to be evil and just cloned half of these things on this list yeah that's not evil that's that's it's not evil much as capitalism but I do it like I some of these ideas I think are really stellar I don't know how it's I tell you the one that I would invest in it's not even one we discussed and then we got to go I'll do it in 30 seconds company called duffel they're doing fast deliveries on college campuses and it's a horrible idea but go ahead not horrible not however I'll tell you why what they do is they buy the popular stuff that kids want like Ben & Jerry's and chips and whatnot beer they put it in an apartment and then they deliver it to you on scooter when you order it so average cart is $16 they make $5 per delivery and they're delivering in a very lightweight way on the same in a very tight to your graphic boundary so they don't have a bunch of logistical issues there's a company called puff or go puff have you heard of those guys no what's that it's this but it's it's basically it's a vase and they're doing over a hundred million dollars a year right now and they're just two kids out of I don't know Penn State or something like that I don't know where they are but somewhere in middle America and so I've seen this model work I think that this is a clock business idea you have puffer it's good I think the websites go puff calm Thursday and they do a hundred million in sales you have more than that I believe and so they're in you can see all the different campuses there so then how profitable are they I mean I don't know all that right I don't have all their financials but I mean 100 million like their net profit they pay the dry I mean or is it like where the driver gets most of money and most so they're there at 163 million a year is the thing and I don't think they even raise that much money like let me look at their fundraising for forego puffs I don't think they raise too much oh no they've now raised a lot how much eight hundred and sixty six million dollars Oh described as two kids well it was Softbank invested in them and recently and is a huge round that's a soft Bank backed up the truck in them but anyways I think this market works and actually think it's great that soft Bank backed up the truck and put the touch of death on this company if I'm duffel I believe in what I'm doing there's a lot of college campuses out there to make this work [Music]

#fineart #art #thehustle

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
okay so let me explain a little more about our tress from what we know so here's what here's what they say the value proposition is that you can buy fine art in installments so you were saying masterworks lets you buy a piece of a piece of art they sort of fractionalized it these guys say it's yours but you can hear on a monthly payment plan this has been a big trend in e-commerce anybody who's been paying attention to a firm or after pay these are multi-billion dollar companies that are just saying even low-priced items right here's a $40 item but you can buy it in four easy installments and a firm is doing quite well both of those companies are gonna go public or it's looking like they will right after perhaps you already public and firm is I think going to go public and so there and there's there's more sizzle there's there's others that are doing this too so that's a very good business to be in I believe and so so that's what these guys are doing they said we've sold thirty six thousand dollars worth of art in three weeks this is unlike a firm and unlike after paid they're not a payment option on other market other websites they are their own marketplace and so what they're trying to do is they give artists the ability to sell their work they say most artists don't even sell their work so they say listed here we offer people the ability to buy in instalments so more people can buy so we've more buyers in our pool and they they get the artist to put their link to their store just like an Etsy store in their bio so they put their art in res link at the bio and that's driving a lot of users because these are you know Instagram artists are artists with an Instagram who have you know a hundred thousand followers and they're getting them to buy of all these different artists and that's going to drive traffic that's a lot how SoundCloud grew early on was going for these independent artists and then saying cool we'll give you an easy way to host your artwork in that case music but you know here at share your SoundCloud profile and that's how they got tons of traffic and built up their marketplace and so I think that's what these guys are trying to do I think this is smart the art market is one of those markets that's bigger than you think because you don't even you don't even learn about it till you're already rich and what's already rich you don't do start a company in it and so I think it's one of those big invisible market to most entrepreneurs who are scrappy and don't own you know like a pencil let alone a piece of or I so I would have agreed with you and before you start talking I agreed that it was great but then you the way you described it if okay so I would I would be against it if Etsy is competent they can destroy these guys yeah I think it's gonna be hard though because ed sees niche is handmade crafts and I think that's just fundamentally different than fine art I think when you it's like putting a bottle of wine next to a Budweiser right in the aisle it's it's a little bit I don't think the people who want their art to be sold or fine art to be sold or want to buy want to be next to somebody who's making bracelets that would be my that'd be my bare case against that okay I buy that I buy that but oh okay I get it so I see a painting on here it's three thousand dollars I could pay overtime for for 24 months for a hundred and thirty-seven dollars okay so my question is this is this pay overtime feature even that unique enough to build most your company on top of why not just like have a normal art store and just uninstall a firm yeah that's a good question I don't know why they're not just using one of the existing installment plans you know why are they why are they owning that piece of it it's like an art marketplace but then also this financing program when they could just use one of the existing financing programs so I'm looking at it now yeah I I'm changing my mind it's stupid okay well we'll see jury's out on on art and res I'm not an expert in this area but I'm sure something there my bet would be I think marketplaces are really really freaking hard to start and and so I for that reason I think that it's going to be incredibly difficult and they definitely have done that yet but you know so I would say odds are always against any marketplace being successful but I do like the fundamentals of what they're trying to do I don't think this is a stupid I don't think this is a stupid bet to take if you're an entrepreneur but I do think still likelihood is that it doesn't work like most startups I think that a but there's a difference here of working and just building the wealth and then working by raising money no I mean the business working no not the reason money lots of companies can raise money yeah but what I mean is should I think this for sure can make a living for the owners the question is is if they raise money then will it work or will it not my prediction is if they raise money it's gonna fail I feel like that's your prediction with most things I think you just don't like what people raise money for the most part no the next one that we're going to talk about carrot I think that could work [Music]

what up nothing it's been a crazy few days I got my car broken into last night no front was there something in it or you just just go breakin I have a garage I didn't park in my garage and the back window was broken into and someone stole my little $200 like battery that jump jump starts the car but it was like $1000 or no it was $400 to fix it just sucks yeah I'm also pretty sure I've Corona oh no you're feeling it yeah Adam like Adam Ryan my coworker he confirmed has it he lives in Austin though but I'm pretty sure I have it were you in contact with him or you just think you have it in general I just think I have it no I was going to the office up until Thursday but I thought that was okay because I was the only one in the office right and I didn't and I was like I I didn't like see ya and Alan was only there one of the days and I didn't see or talk to anyone even like I would I drove in I parked on the street and I just walked right up but I feel like [ __ ] but not that bad not bad enough that I can't do stuff but I you know that's a bummer what's going on with you well on the bright side for you you got to talk to your hero yeah so the other day for the listeners made Sean are extra UFC nerds one of my favorite guys is he your favorite you like I like him but he's not my favorite guy I feel you I feel connected to him yeah so basically his name's Ben Askren he's interesting because he's very polarizing I would say he has more people who hate him than loves him but the people who love him love him the people who hate him hate him so on last week I gave a lecture on cold emailing and literally the day before I just cold tweeted at him and then we became friends in the inbox and then we just did like a conference call and we've been chatting and that was awesome and what was your cold tweet at him he tweeted out a podcast that he liked and I tweeted oh hey I was actually on that same podcast like two months ago and uh and then i DM to him the episode I go hey I was just on that I see you're doing XY and Z I do this this and this I just like you but like if you ever want to like shoot the [ __ ] let me know that's amazing and then you you had a call with him he's a cool guy you guys are gonna hang out or be best friends or what I pray I trying to convince Ben out okay so Ben Askren is he's kind of like this he's kind of like I think the people who like them are like the Jordan Peterson crowd like the people who never had good fathers and want to learn how to be men you know I mean yeah like discipline even though he's kind of a loudmouth and I'm like dude bed you have to like you could cut like you can like copy all like you could like the same way Dave Asbury has built this huge thing you could do that too by selling workout stuff and I'm trying to give it him to do that yeah he has a very big brand and he's a very he has a very unique personality so you I could see that working for him yeah and I'm trying to convince him to do that he's based in Wisconsin so I don't know like if he has like a whole bunch of like internet nerds hanging out with him that he truly understands what he's capable of and I'm trying to be his nerdy friend that's good and fighters don't have a very long shelf life like he's retired now so you know they have to figure out this I got a second act well he told me he has a wrestling academy and that they're not in session right now so he's like I got I got a lot of free time and so I asked him if you wanted to come on here and he said yeah so if you want him to come on the next couple of days or weeks we totally can do it yeah we should do a brainstorm with Ben on what Ben can do like what would I do if I was Ben I think it'd be cool to brainstorm those ideas I'm gonna write that down I'll email them right after this cool and we'll research a bunch of things that other either athletes or celebrities have done to leverage their name their brand kind of like what we were talking about with Lance Armstrong yeah the same conversation we had with Lance we should do a full lap with Ben on that I'll set that up you want to talk about some new stuff that's going around sure okay so first thing teachable you see teachable sould I did see that okay so teachable is you to me I hate comparing things because I want to be disrespectful to teachable but teachables like you to me it's like you to me with one core differ so you to me is like you go to you to me to find what you want to learn teachable is hey I can make you know you can make your website cold emailing calm and you can sell your course on your brand on your site and they make it easy you don't have to know how to code to basically spin up an online class on your own website yeah and you and I are friends yeah I think you are too right I don't know the guy but I'm really familiar with a thing and people know my education nerd so I'm like kind of was very fascinated about their business and they did a pretty phenomenal job they were at like 20 million or so in revenue I think they sold for closer to 200 250 millions of them I talked to encore that's how you founded it and he said that it was very lucrative and it was a it was a good it worked out quite well you know I'm super cool I'm proud of that and their last round was at 250 million so I don't know if it's sold at the same price it was just recently so I don't know if it's sold at that price or above that even that'd be kind of amazing I don't know all I know is that it's how it was a good deal for him and he is he's a he's an immigrant from India came here at age 18 so love love the story and I believe they have several teachers who use teachable and make over like a million dollars a year something like that I think they have some some real success stories maybe it actually told me it might not be a million I don't exactly know first no there there there are seven-figure annual earners yeah they're mostly like affiliate marketer types but whatever let's not let's not worry it's like we do you say teachers people think like an English teacher and it's actually like you know well he told me he told me the big one of the top earners was a guy who has an excel class yeah I've seen that and you could actually Google I've done this many times you can Google you know hype most profiting or sort of moat highest revenue teachable classes and you can find the list I think they even have it on their website the most popular classes there's like a social media marketing there's Excel how to do Excel class there's a coding one there's a bunch of those did you do a podcast by your I don't listen to any of our podcast by the way because you don't ever listen to your own stuff did you don't even listen to my voice mail yeah it's hilarious let alone you talking for a long time did you launch your individual episode so I have two episodes I did one on Thursday I didn't launch it I thought it sucked and then the editor I think has coronavirus as well so he's been like in and out of the hospital and he has like an underlying lung condition so he's like trying to make sure he died did another you know kick it in a bad spot so he didn't publish it and I was like you know I got cold feet I got to either ship it right away or I'll overthink it that's how I think you should do it and so so he listened to me he's like what you talked about this is good and so we're gonna ship that I have to banked and then I also at the end of the last one I had this idea during the podcast to do a like morning routine thing so like you're in your house right now right here in your kitchen and we're all at home and everyone's getting a little crazy and trying to figure out like oh I'm gonna work out by like opening and closing the fridge 50 times like people are trying to find a way to feel good and not go insane and I've had this morning routine I've done for years now that's a nine minute morning routine and so on the podcast I was like I should just make a podcast that's just that this is just the nine minute morning routine you can was do it's just free just put it out there so I recorded that last night so I had two episodes in the bank plus the morning routine like thing recorded and so hopefully all those will come out this week are you working out yeah I'm working out yeah so we have we've had a home gym or like a room that we turned into a gym and now I'm using the [ __ ] out of it I have a home gym in my garage like a nice one like I've got like it's like 40 pounds for squat like a squat rack heavy bag I have all types of [ __ ] and I talked to a guy the other day who was a listener or something like that he messaged me on Twitter and he said that their home fitness equipment is selling like crazy he's like we can keep up hotcakes I ordered a thousand pounds worth of weights on Amazon last year with free shipping yeah the delivery on weights is insane I felt so guilty because the guy bringing it up to my house like up the 15 steps is like you know breaking his back for this thing I'm never gonna use and so I bought those Bowflex dumbbells which is like it's one dumb but I have power blocks you rotate it and it like can be any weight you want those are actually pretty handy yeah I know I have those those are my favorite do you want to talk about air being so nice week we could do the trend stuff we want to talk about trend stuff but I and I it was a good one but I think we have a lot here do you want to talk about Airbnb now we have a lot so we're gonna do two things we're gonna talk a little bit about Airbnb and then we're gonna start this thing that we we we teased last week which is Y Combinator had their demo day and it's like a goldmine of new ideas and it's sort of you know YC is Harvard and so we're gonna take a look at this batch of companies and we're gonna break them down we're gonna do like five or six of them today and if it's fun we might do the rest I mean the list is like a hundred plus I don't know how long we can do this but let's do like five today and let's see what happens so we'll do both those things in this episode did you want to do let's talk Airbnb first thing yeah do it so Airbnb some interesting things are going on so Airbnb you know very well is awesome company one of the sort of most successful startups of the last decade or so and was about to go public this year and I was preparing for it and now with coronavirus you know travel has stopped hospitality you know hotels casinos they're all taking a total beating and Airbnb of course is gonna get caught up in the crossfire as well and so a couple interesting things here so Airbnb financially you know their revenue must have dropped by fifty sixty seventy eighty percent essentially overnight and with an indefinite time span we don't know how long that's gonna last the second thing is Airbnb not only does have a huge you know staff on payroll and now revenue drops but all the hosts were essentially small small small entrepreneurs so some people did you know a traditional thing they just rented out an extra bedroom in their house but a lot of people once they got a taste of that money they started buying places renting out places and subleasing and basically putting it on air and bebe and so all those people now there's this thing that was a moneymaker for a couple years has gone to zero and so I think there's something very interesting that's gonna happen where what happens to all these hosts who got places just to Airbnb them and now the Airbnb income has sort of totally dried up are they gonna default on their mortgages are they gonna default on the rent payments if they're if they're subleasing or are they gonna turn into just normal rentals I don't know what's gonna happen about all this so you already know what's going on in Zillow you're the one who told me right well I did see some charts yes so I saw some charts that basically showed on Zillow normal housing so just normal rentals not a short-term Airbnb stay but just here's an apartment for lease for six months is exploding so like it looks like the coronavirus it's like here's last month one little blue dot this month fifteen blue dots on the map right it's like the number of listings is exploding for rentals which is also bad for Airbnb because in places like San Francisco where there's a housing shortage and for years Airbnb has been saying oh we don't contribute to the housing shortage we are we're a different thing altogether well now it's actually kind of a whether it's whether it's truly the the proof or not I don't know but it certainly does look like if you're somebody who was anti urban B you have a lot of evidence a lot of ammunition now to say hey look when we turned Airbnb off look at how much more housing supply came on the market look how that lowers rents for everybody well you know what Airbnb is doing now though is long-term rentals they've been getting into that for a while where you could rent something for many months maybe many years and that part is growing so there's growing a lot right now right so I'm curious whether people in cities who are anti Airbnb are gonna take this and run with it and yes the answer is yes very sensitive to legislation right they changed some rules here in San Francisco where it's like you can only do 90 days out of the year and you have to live in the place you have to prove that blah blah and that you know it eliminated like 30 or 40 percent of the listings overnight when that legislation happened to your or two ago so now I wonder if it's gonna get worse saundra you know Sondra I'm googling right now you know them no oh that's the like it's a hotel or explain saunder it's basically if you are traveling for work and you want to go stay somewhere you'll stay at a saunder often let's see I'll go to sander comm it's also if you want to stay somewhere for like three months like let's say you're going somewhere for three months and you want to and you have to make a lot of money in order to do this it's high-end [ __ ] like in San Francisco it's like five or six grand a month I need a place to stay or work we know it's time the better yeah the best parts of home and hotel so it's like it's like an apartment that you can rent for two months right so the PERT housing but done well yes but they just laid off 20% of their company it looks like oh wow yeah today so I think this is gonna be very interesting how these different companies get affected you know I'm rooting for Airbnb I think it's a great product I think it's a great company I hope that they have you know a war chest of cash that lets them endure this time but you know we'll see it's a keeping an eye on them if you could invest a little bit what you can you can go and buy secondary shares if you're gonna invest money at Airbnb x' previous valuation I think they raised money on a thirty billion dollar valuation would you invest in that right now what I need to know more right I need to know about the how the company's financials look let's say that revenue drops people let's say revenue drops seventy percent for them I'm not so concerned about the 70 percent drop because that's that I think is is more temporary so I just need to know do they have enough cash in the bank to endure this or that that's three billion dollars okay so three billion dollars you know they're probably burning several million a month but like okay three billion should still last you through this time and then the other question is where the fundamentals good to begin with so a lot of times these companies don't have great unit economics or fundamentals to begin with and so when the downturn comes and people start looking for things that are more stable more sure bets these high-growth but poor unit economic companies they struggle they weren't profitable in 2018 this is like a analysts call again I think they're also profitable in 2019 this is all public information right so yeah so if they're publicly if they're profitable right now even with this explosive growth and yeah it's probably a pretty good bet to pick up a little secondary there okay I guess we'll see what happens you want to talk about some Y Combinator stuff yeah so so we're gonna go through a couple of the companies in the batch you know they're these are what we won't say anything that's to what I'll call to private information so we'll do what's mostly public information about these companies so we'll start with the first one wait I'll draw it before we get into that you can you can I tell you something that was striking about this list how many lists were there 150 yeah shockingly Africa African and Indian based yes this has been a trend in the last year or two for Y Combinator they did two things they went and did a road show some Michael Seibel who was the CEO of YC for a while actually you might still be so he went on a road show through Africa through India and met a lot been a bunch of entrepreneurs had they had a bunch of events and they sort of opened up the doors to those applicants and really got people excited about coming to YC and their bet was that hey look a lot of the growth opportunity and the best companies are you know we can go fish in this pond where not everybody else is fishing and you know certainly 500 startups has did this many many years ago where they just the investment companies all around the world this has not been the sort of way that most Silicon Valley investors have been operating they're not actively going and hunting for great companies in India or Brazil or in Africa but yeah it's pretty amazing about how like there's I see a lot of Latin America a ton of India and a ton of Africa and what's funny is a lot of them are just you know flex port for Brazil it's like this other successful YC company or it's like same one says once tagline is smile direct Club for Latin America right yeah but that's literally it yeah flex port for India sorry flex port for Africa yeah it's pretty crazy and I think that's a great move yeah for sure because a lot of these companies that that work when they're not purely software based they're gonna scale slowly they're not gonna expand everywhere overnight so same thing happen to Airbnb Airbnb got cloned in Europe and in all different parts of the world sometimes they they were able to catch up and beat them most of the time they weren't and they had to buy a piece of them or acquire them or they just lost and they said okay I guess we're not gonna be the number one player in the UK we're gonna be two or three or and it where else yeah and so why don't you want it this morning you want to start it off yeah so let's do cron so cron is an app that websites just crontab CRO and app and what these guys are trying to do is essentially superhuman for your calendar so that assumes you know what superhuman is which is this really slick and very hyped email client I used it for a while I stopped I don't know about you do you have you sue Freeman I'm still using it verdicts still out if I love it but their tagline for people who don't know superhuman is the calendar for professionals right so there are thesis is look at the market for calendar users for just if you just take google calendar is 500 million people and what they're trying to do is take the top you know set of prosumers right so professionals people who really care about efficiency people who are heavy power users of the calendar app and they're trying to say can we get the top X percent they said top 20% but really is gonna end up being the top 2% of people to pay $19 a month to have you know their Google calendar on steroids what side of what's 1% of 500 million 15 million wait no that's 5 million yeah that's 5 million ok so five million people paying 19 bucks a month not bad so so they're trying to go after that they basically made a very slick looking calendar so it's got a you know aesthetically it looks looks better they have hot keys and little short commands and oh you want to set up a meeting and it's hard to sort of say oh I'm free Tuesday from 1 to 2 and Thursday from 3 to 4 it's like you just share your availability and make it make it really easy so they have a bunch of these features and they have a thousand users on the wait list who are sort of ready to pay and there they've on-boarded the first 50 paying customers so far so they're they're doing that thing that YC companies do you'll see this a lot is big idea and then good traction but over a very short amount of time so you can't really judge if this is successful or not yet and it says like 50 percent month-over-month growth but it's run like 6 weeks but it's been 6 weeks and and a hundred percent of those companies were other hundred of the customers or other companies in the YC batch right so it's like you know it's hard to really get a sense of these things but I thought this pretty interesting idea what are you thinking up about this ok so if I was this guy I would bet my life that this could be a company that makes a [ __ ] ton of profit so there's the nearest competitor the I could think of his calendar calendly calendly is a plugin for Gmail it's a 30 million a year company that's bootstrapped out of Atlanta started by a guy who moved here from I think Nigeria cool story andrew wilkinson a guy i respect and like thinks that calendly are i think he thinks it's total [ __ ] and that Google could totally clone it I disagree with I disagree with that assessment I think that Crone can for sure be a very very profitable software company I'm not convinced that it that they should raise venture capital because I yeah I wouldn't raise venture capital for them I was them if they needed money and just to start I would say raise a million dollars and just make this make like stoop big it's stupidly profitable right yes the route they're going because they're in YC but yeah I hear that I think that's a valid path I don't think they're gonna need a ton of capital there's not a big they don't need a huge engineering force they don't have to buy a bunch of assets you know this is a software play that really a motivated team of six to ten people could support if I was listening to this podcast I would say and I was technical I would be like oh that is a great idea there their website if you go there right now kind of shows how the product works and I would just completely rip it off and scale but be far more scrappy cuz I don't think these companies out here are scrappy and I think that someone could build it and be able to pay themselves five million dollars a year and netting though yeah you know that so I think this is a good idea I also like this general Zhang er of company so our friend sue Lee tipped me off to this a while ago he goes I just think super human 4x is a good investment thesis right now and so he loves super human he loves the business it's doing really well and you know we were looking at this company called linear which is a it's like a bug tracking software so every big software company tracks there bugs usually using JIRA or some like old-school ticketing system nobody loves using JIRA it's just like you know you it's a must you have to be organized around your bugs and linear just made like a slick looking JIRA and and so we you know we talked to them thought about investing in them did you end I didn't end up it was a bit of a competitive round and then I could have got in at the end but I sort of cooled on it because when I tried to bring it into our company there was a lot of security concerns not that they were doing something wrong but you just have to do a lot of work to be enterprise security compliant and pass those checks and they hadn't done that work yet now in reality they're gonna do that work it's gonna be fine and they're gonna get there it's just it got out of sight out of mind for me because I stopped using them I forgot about the are you know and you're making investments right now no now I'm on startup investments I have cooled off referred for the time being is it freeze so okay so verdict on Crone how do you say it Krong Krong a verdict for me is great company to own I think it will work I don't know if it's good to raise money on yeah agreed thanks a good idea good product I think there's other products like this if you just take a superhuman Forex and you take any work tool that's massively used and you just make extremely slick ui/ux for for that this can work with to-do lists this can work with email this to work with calendar this can wall you know how I would do that is I would log into Gmail I'm gonna log into Gmail right now I would log into Gmail I would click that little the drop-down arrow the drop-down or no the Google Apps thing on the top right right I would look at search gmail calendar Docs drive sheets slides sites groups contacts hang out and that would just oh wow there's way more YouTube Maps news translate photos admin my business out and you just put that on a bull's eye or a dartboard just close your eyes and just let it is that's what you do air table did this for Excel notion did this for Docs superhuman did it for email there's a new one that's doing it for presentations yeah so let's talk about that I don't know much about it it's called pitch I oh right or pitch Co I think it's pitch Tonko is it awesome or something I don't know like why are people talking about it so much pitch calm do they get to calm that's like that's how you know it's legit nothing $100,000 domain name what uh what why are people talking about that so much so I saw this the first time so this is again you know just like air table did for Excel these guys are trying to do for PowerPoint so PowerPoint also has hundreds of millions of users it's a critical business function and Microsoft does not make the UI UX better over time they do not do smart things in the cloud and so you have on the low end you have Google Docs and Google sheets Google slides and on the high end you have right now Microsoft you know PowerPoint and these guys are trying to to do a better job making making a sexy PowerPoint and I'm down with sexy PowerPoint I always love their website it looks great pitch calm and it looks like it's ready to come out now I've seen this thing this has been like for over a year I believe maybe two years that I've seen this this website like this based off the people who are recommending it on their on their homepage I feel like I know the people behind this yeah it's like you're friends with all the testimonials yeah great I'm very yeah I like that I don't know anything about it other than what I'm seeing on this website and yeah and so this is one where I think great market to go after your execution obviously has to be good but like you know but but that's okay it's better than going after a bad market because then even great execution doesn't do jack [ __ ] for you I have another one that's like this on the excel side that's called causal so I've been talking these guys I'm not quite enough I don't think I'm like an official advisor but I just get might give these guys a lot of opinions so causal is it basically tries to give everyone the ability to do like data modeling like an excel wizard or like a and so they have some cool things you should just if you just google causals rent versus buy calculator you can see what the end output looks like they make this I calculator of rent verse by how do you spell that CA you si el that's causal causal app calm is their thing and then if you just Google causal app rent verse by you can see it it's a cool tool I don't think they've quite got it to work I'm telling him they're trying to make it to they're basically too smart so they're trying to do like data modeling and data science like oh look how easy it is to make a linear regression or Monte Carlo it's like yeah but you don't do that frequently you should just make it where it's really pleasurable and easy to do simple formulas and spit out awesome charts like I love to do that because what air table did was air table took the part of excel that's just rows of information and they made that sexy but what they didn't do is calculation people use Excel for calculation and charting and an air table doesn't do that so if you did the calculation and charting and you made it beautiful and sexy you could win and these guys aren't doing that and pitch calm I changed my opinion they're gonna fail I went to their about page and they have nine employees and they're all founders oh yeah that's a that's a bit of a red flag literally you know their about page they have nine people it says co-founder for all every employee yeah that ain't gonna work these are also like amazing head shots that they took for themselves yeah so co-founder and a QA engineer [Laughter] it says co-founder next to all yeah they all do pretty legit investors okay so I say Andrea is an investor in them yeah okay I'm excited to see what they got well I want to see it that's been two years okay so let's go to the next company the next one is art in res art in res so the idea here is you can buy fine art in installments and you know I personally didn't know too much about the fine art market I think my hunch is that you know a little bit more I think you like to look into these things so tell me what you think about this idea and what you know about the fine art market yeah so masterclass is one of our partners we work with masterclass I went and met with the founder his name Scott in New York a couple weeks ago a couple months ago and I learned a lot so mmm fine art is one of the largest asset classes in the world but master class is not about art right or what do you mean sorry master works as well math master works is a website where you can purchase pieces of a Basquiat or a Pablo Picasso in the same way that you buy stock in publicly in the publicly marked traded markets so but art fine art is a massive massive asset class but it's incredibly illiquid as in you you either have to have 30 million to buy a Basquiat or you don't get any upside so what master works is doing is allowing people to purchase it with a minimum I think of a thousand dollars and what I learned meeting with those guys was how how great that that that that as an asset class how great it could be so for example David Geffen from Geffen Records a big entrepreneur during the financial crisis he was famous for saying that his fine art went up 30% while his normal equities went down significantly let me see what else I have a bunch of stats here so I think I think I think it's really interesting if I wanted to look at how this company could do I would look at Etsy so as Etsy has traded at a 50 to 80 price earnings ratio which is really really good I would a right now is in the gutter but I'm really I think that marketplaces can be quite large and I think that I personally was shocked at how large fine like fancy art is and I thought it was like I thought that there was only like a couple paintings sold a year that made a difference and in reality it's not it's not that way so what's your takeaway are you okay okay so let me explain a little more about art rest from what we know so here's what here's what they say the value proposition is that you can buy fine art in installment so you were saying masterworks lets you buy a piece of a piece of art they sort of fractionalized it these guys say it's yours but you can hear on a monthly payment plan this has been a big trend in e-commerce anybody who's been paying attention to a firm or after pay these are multi-billion dollar companies that are just saying even low-priced items right here's a $40 item but you can buy it in four easy installments a firm is doing quite well both of those companies are gonna go public or it's looking like they will right after perceptual already public and firm is I think going to go public and so there and there's there's more sizzle there's there's others that are doing this too so that's a very good business to be and I believe and so so that's what these guys are doing they said they've sold 36,000 dollars worth of art in three weeks this is unlike a firm and unlike after paid they're not a payment option on other market other websites they are their own marketplace and so what they're trying to do is they give artists the ability to sell their work they say most artists don't even sell their work so they say list it here we offer people the ability to buy in installments so more people can buy so we've more buyers in our pool and they they get the artists to put their link to their store just like an Etsy store in their bio so they put their art in res link at the bio and that's driving a lot of users because these are you know Instagram artists are artists with an Instagram who have you know a hundred thousand followers and they're getting them to buy of all these different artists and that's going to drive traffic that's a lot how SoundCloud grew early on was going for these independent artists and then saying cool we'll give you an easy way to host your artwork in that case music but you know here at share your SoundCloud profile and that's how they got tons of traffic and built up their marketplace and so I think that's what these guys are trying to do I think this is smart the art market is one of those markets that's bigger than you think because you don't even you don't even learn about it till you're already rich and what's already rich you don't do start a company in it and so I think it's one of those big invisible markets to most entrepreneurs who are scrappy and don't own you know like a pencil let alone a piece for I so I would have agreed with you and before you start talking I agreed that it was great but then you the way you described it if okay so I would I would be against it if if Etsy is competent they can destroy these guys yeah I think it's gonna be hard to because ed sees niche is handmade crafts and I think that's just fundamentally different than fine art I think when you it's like putting a bottle of wine next to a Budweiser right in the aisle it's it's a little bit I don't think the people who want their art to be sold or fine art to be sold or want to buy want to be next to somebody who's making bracelets that would be my that'd be my bare case against that okay I buy that I buy that but oh okay I get it so I see a painting on here it's $3,000 I could pay overtime for 24 months for a hundred and thirty seven dollars okay so my question is this is this pay overtime feature even that unique enough to build most your company on top of why not just like have a normal art store and just uninstall a firm yeah that's a good question I don't know why they're not just using one of the existing installment plans you know why are they why are they owning that piece of it it's like an art marketplace but then also this financing program when they could just use one of the existing financing programs so I'm looking at it now yeah I I'm changing my mind it's stupid okay we'll see jury's out on on art and res I'm not an expert in this area but I'm unsure of something there my bet would be I think marketplaces are really really freaking hard to start and and so I for that reason I think that it's gonna be incredibly difficult and they definitely a vanilla they've done that yet but you know so I would say odds are always against any marketplace being successful but I do like the fundamentals of what they're trying to do I don't think this is a stupid I don't think this is a stupid bet to take if you're an entrepreneur but I do think still likelihood is that it doesn't work like most startups I think that it okay but there's a difference here of working and just building the wealth and then working by raising money no I mean the business working now not the reason money lots of companies can raise money yeah but what I mean is should I think this [ __ ] for sure can make a good living for the owners the question is is if they raise money then will work or will it not my prediction is if they raise money it's gonna fail I feel like that's your prediction with most things I think you just don't like what people raise money for the most part no the next one that we're gonna talk about carrot I think that could work let's talk about it okay so carrot it's they provide loans and a line of credit for influencers and that's interesting and the reason it's interesting is I use I have a million dollar line of credit with a company that provides line of credit for for media companies this clearly works in some cases influencers can it work maybe but the so the company that I use it was started by a DreamWorks exec it has over 100 employees and they have billions of dollars and in and and I don't know what how do you describe billions of dollars in credit yeah they have billions of billion to over a billion dollars to deploy I think it's great cuz I'm totally hooked on their company and I don't plan on leaving and I think I pay them like a thousand dollars a month for this what do you what do you use it for your company expenses or person yeah company yeah so we don't really use it but when a rainy day comes and we need money I have that set up right and so and so the other example here is clear bank where they're basically providing credit to e-commerce companies and they're saying great you don't don't go raise money for this if you can show that your credit worthy by looking at your Shopify data then will we will front you the money you need for inventory or for Facebook ads or whatever else you shouldn't go over as venture capital to pay for Facebook ads and so the interesting thing here is the big ideas the real big ideas that come out of Y Combinator don't always sound like big ideas to start Airbnb is a great example of that yeah you know when it was when it was on ycs list like this it would have been called air bed-and-breakfast it would have been like you know rent out an air mattress in my apartment and it would have seemed like a small idea and this is one of those two words it's like two influencers really need credit do they really need loans what do influencers need you know this for and it just turns out I think that there's a lot of influencers and this might be a hidden big market it might be something that influencers really actually do need this capital they are not there the traditional banks and lending institutions don't know how to how to assess an influencer for creditworthiness in the same way that they didn't do it for e-commerce and the cool question I have is how does the influence or use that capital to invest and grow their business like for e-commerce I get it for your business I get it you're gonna invest the money you're gonna grow your business what does an influencer really do to grow their businesses it adds is it to pay for stunts that's good contact like what are they doing with this money that's a good question and I don't think anything but let me go let me go a different angle here when you bought your house which was your wife listed as in an earner yes was she listed as self-employed yes well what I mean listed by like like for example when you got your mortgage sorry when you got your mortgage to see did she say she was a sole proprietor did you say that you're a 25% owner of a business do I say that now okay when she was getting approved for the mortgage was it hard for her no she well it was a lot of paperwork but it was it wasn't hard like she had the income to show it but it just required like mine was simple w2 submit they are like yeah got it we understand your economics for her she had like you know this rollercoaster history and a whole bunch of different entities and like all those different stuff that like was very very hard for them in fact we I just refinanced because the interest rates have dropped like crazy and we didn't even use her this time cuz the lady at the bank was like if we can let's just do this off your income like I don't want to do all that paperwork again for your wife that's what I think the opportunity is when I try to buy a home because I'm an entrepreneur I told them I own I think the threshold 20% they go they said you own more than 25% of a business I said yes and they go ok we need to see the last X amount of the years in P&L and I showed it to him and it was profitable or whatever and they still gave me a hard time I think that if I was this company carrot I would I think that there's a big opportunity who can provide home loan for home loans for small business owners I think that's the real opportunity here yeah and maybe the introduce of a so here's some of the stats about them right they've loaned out a million dollars in the last six months the average payback period is 45 days extremely fast payback that the APR is very high because of that so even on a low APR because of the fast payback in annualize is that 40% and now they're rolling out a credit card after they do credit card I'm sure that they would want to get into other financial services and if they can be sort of the financial services for influencers or the bank for influencers that's very interesting because this will always be a niche market that is overlooked and misunderstood by the traditional banking system and so that's the bull case the barricade I don't know I don't know what the influencers need this money for I don't know if they can actually pay it back and I don't have how creditworthy they actually really are so the the strategy here is you get into a market you get a ton of you buy ton of share you people like you and trust you and you're profiting and then you start launching more and more stuff to them which I personally love which is a trex model in this case right what yeah and it's what I do I mean it's what I did for a living we're built we build up a free email list that we sell more stuff and the more and the more the more I mean yeah a lot of people do it and but you gotta get them locked in early and you got to give a enough people so I think that that's cool and that actually brings us to a good point of our other next one how do how do you pronounce this and I'll tell you why there's a there's an angle here well what's this one called how do you pronounce that we're just gonna call it Lila I don't know what it is it's Lee Allah I don't know amazing yeah they need to change their name because that's hard to pronounce right so it's it's stupidly simple it's it's a it's a product that helps women freeze their eggs pretty straightforward but what I think could be cool with these folks as well as Kara is once you get this customer on the hook there's loads of products that you could sell them in the same way him started with viagra and now is doing hair loss and then now they're thinking about doing testosterone and doing X I've been doing Y whatever I think you could do the same thing for both carat really well and this egg freezing one hello little Lilia yeah how you say so bad name great idea great business you know this is one of those you just close your eyes and invest this is how I would treat it yeah so the so here's some stats that I I went and found this is not from their deck I just wasn't found this okay and this number was shocking do you know that only according to CNBC only like 11,000 people freeze their eggs a year is that right it's not a lot yeah not a lot but it's growing at 25 percent a year and I actually buy that I think it's going to grow significantly Gen Z I think they're gonna put it off more and more I also think that so large companies like Facebook and Google actually subsidize and pay for it so to get your eggs frozen it costs between five and 20 grand a year if you're in San Francisco it could be 18 grand if you're in a smaller city it could be 6 grand so it's really expensive it's very invasive it takes four to six weeks where you got to give shots in your arm and it's like huge needles it's a it's a it's just a it's intense [ __ ] but you know it's about having children so it's a pretty big deal and you're willing to put up with all that it's a pretty big deal my question is will they be able to convey be able to so first of all there's not that huge of a market right now ten twelve thousand people what would this new company be able to convince a young woman to use them as opposed to her doctor right and the other other existing services that surely exist around this right like I don't know the competitive landscape but I do like where all the trends are going so I think that you know the data shows that people are having kids later they're getting married later and that this is becoming less fringe and less taboo over time and so that's what's going in the favor of this is that more people the market for egg freezing is growing and it's becoming more serviceable now do they had what I don't see here is some unique go to market strategy oh here's how they're here's how they're going to acquire our customers differently than how anybody else would I also don't see they're really talking about their expertise and how they you know why that why they're gonna be able to build trust in a way that's better or different than anybody else so that's what I think's missing from this limited information we have here so you know how you and I talk about distribution and product right and how oftentimes product isn't an issue sorry we talk about product and distribution and how a lot of people particularly first-time people think well if the product is good it's gonna sell itself in reality that's not the truth because there's way more great there's a ton of great products that die because they have no distribution and there's a ton of [ __ ] products that crush because the distribution is amazing and so in this case in the same way that hims is just reselling other people's [ __ ] right like hims isn't interesting it's just generic viagra their products nothing good it's just that they like smacked cute branding on it and they made it so man can call the call and get it and young men don't have to be embarrassed about going to the doctor I need to see something like that from this company I think too in order for for it to work because what the service they're offering doesn't seem particularly different right right yeah exactly they haven't made it less invasive less painful less cost they haven't innovated on the product side that means they need to innovate it on the marketing side of the go to market side so that's what I don't like about this but I love the space that they're in and I think there's gonna be a winner I don't know if it's this company or another but that's what's great about this one yeah and do they have you I don't know okay here is I got some information on them okay so it looks like what they're doing is they're not actually doing the work they're just a middleman for the clinic so in reality they're almost like lead gen yep so they have a $500 concierge service that they offer first so how do we educate you handled you through the process and basically qualify the lead yeah so what they're doing is they are not they are not actually providing the service they're just a marketing company for the service providers if that's the case I like this I think it's cool yeah I have a friend who does a company called yo derm and what they do is the same thing around dermatology so it's telemedicine but in reality what they're doing is they said most people who need to see a dermatologist are going because of acne most people who have acne get the same prescription that prescription is you know something that they can just get quickly from a doctor the biggest bottleneck is getting an appointment takes you know 27 days on average to get an appointment with the dermatologist so what they did was they built a marketing company that basically says hey do you need to see a dermatologist this is a faster easier way to do it just do it from like FaceTime your doctor and then they have a bunch of doctors who just write these same prescriptions all the time for the same acne medicine because that's what people need eighty percent of time and twenty percent of time they say you need to go see a doctor it's not acne it's not just the generic thing and and then they're white labeling the actual acne medicine and they're the ones delivering it and that's the how big is that they're doing well I love that okay so we talked about cron art art and res karat and Lil Lilia that's just right name you have $100,000 to put in one which one you're gonna do mmm alright let's take a look it's not gonna be cron for me I'm also gonna say it's not gonna be Lilia because even though I like the market for all those reasons we mentioned I don't know why this is the winning company I don't see them doing anything special and this is the what we have to tell people is once you meet the person behind it that could totally change your decision crucial is right this is not based on the people at all because you could meet someone and you're like they're so formidable that's like you don't care what you sell them in right I think if I was gonna do this if I was this is crazy to me that I'm even saying this but I think I would be putting it in Arden rez I think I would put it in because I think if they can get the marketplace spun up it's gonna be valuable and I think that this is an overlooked marketplace so overlooked market so I like that it's a marketplace as a model not lead-gen not not anything else and then they on the other side I think if they can get I have a feeling that the sort of fine art marketplace has not been affected by technology in the same way as all the other industries have and so I'm curious to see what they can do so I'll bet the hundred K on the art and res and I would write it off as a loss because that would assume it's going to be a loss all right I would do a cron okay why cron I just think it's it's super easy for them to be in default survival it's so easy like I think that they can get like a hundred thousand dollars in monthly revenue like really fast I think their churn might be high but III think that it's just because of the market size and because it's an impulse buy and if this just saves you a little bit of time I just think that they can get to 10 or 30 million dollars in recurring revenue inside three or four years with very little capital and so their default alive pretty easily and depending on how creative that entrepreneurs are they could expand beyond that so I'm gonna go with cron okay I like that also who would buy them though well like for example Microsoft BOTS sunrise calendar I believe it was a Honda that people really liked was a pro professional calendar and they got bought for how much but I know like inbox Cal bought for 100 million for making a slicker inbox you know by Google and then sort of thrown away sunrise got bought so so I think that there's potential for an acquisition there by one of the you know big companies that cares about you know enterprise and productivity and whatnot so there's there's a chance there I just want to be evil and just cloned half of these things on this list yeah that's not evil that's that's it's not evil that's just capitalism but I I do it like I some of these ideas I think are really stellar I don't know how it's I tell you the one that I would invest in it's not even one we discussed and then we got to go I'll do it in 30 seconds company called duffel they're doing fast deliveries on college campuses and it's a horrible idea but go ahead not horrible not horrible tell you why what they do is they buy the popular stuff that kids want like Ben and Jerry's and chips and whatnot beer they put it in an apartment and then they deliver it to you on scooter when you order it so average cart is $16 they make $5 per delivery and they're delivering in a very lightweight way on the same in a very tight geographic boundary so they don't have a bunch of logistical issues there's a company called puff or go puff have you heard of those guys no what's that it's this but it's basically it's this and they're doing over 100 million dollars a year right now and they're just two kids out of I don't know Penn State or something like that I don't know where they are but somewhere in middle America and so I've seen this model work I think that this is a hot business idea you have puffer it's good thing two websites go puff calm you're saying they do a hundred million in sales yeah more than that I believe and so they're in you can see all the different campuses how profitable are they I mean I don't know all that right I don't have all their financials but I mean 100 million like their net profit they pay the dry I mean or is it like where the driver gets most of money and most so they're they're at 163 million a year is the thing and I don't think they even raised that much money like let me look at their fundraising for forego puffs I don't think they raise too much oh no they have now raised a lot how much eight hundred and sixty six million dollars oh you described as two kids well it was Softbank invested in them and recently and is a huge round that's a soft bank backed up the truck and them but anyways I think this market works and I actually think it's great that's off bank backed up the truck and put the touch of death on this company if I'm duffel I I believe in what I'm doing there's a lot of college campuses out there to make this work can I give you two that I would do right now okay this is just purely off of reading about their market and like a description of the company the first one is build plain comm project automation for commercial construction I think that with the recession this can make this company a ton of money their previous companies were acquired so they're solid but just I love software that is in boring industries like commercial construction that can help people just save a little bit of money it's called right bill build plane like III that will take off and be big I like that it's not sexy and then the second one is true north fleet did you see that one I didn't see this now we give independent truckers the resource the resources of large fleets and so basically what they do is you know a lot of truckers are just small business owners right there just like uber drivers but they just do truckers my dad is in that industry so that's how I know about a lot about it and they're pretty raw they just you like up until recently they didn't use Twitter or anything like that they would just have their CB radios and their cellphone and my dad would call them and be like hey I got a load for you to go pick up in Bakersfield and then I need you to drop it off at the Walmart in this place like that's just how it would work and this company is is building bits like software for small small trucking businesses and I don't I think people vastly underestimate how trucking is like the backbone of America and how big logistics is in our country so I'm very bullish on that one I like it okay cool yeah if you like this let us know we're gonna do either more of these YC sort of company deep dives since this batch list just came out there's like a hundred companies we could go through if we wanted to and if you don't let us know be like that was boring don't do it again and yeah we can go through a few more next week Sean did you have you had topics already that you wanted to go over we can do these next week huh yeah we'll do it next week Oh Thursday Thursday okay well thanks for listening this one was a little ghetto because we're all at home hopefully the quality was sufficient enough yeah i for one enjoy the ghetto pond I hate it [Music] you

hustle con this year that guy Eric Ryan talked about the confounder a method soap and Ollie and well lead all these great d2c brands or sort of not DS he actually just new consumer brands that they sell through Target and whatnot you know he said a line that stuck with me does the number one most important thing from hazak on this year in my opinion he goes you have to identify the culture shift first and you know the culture shift happens first and then the products and services that that meet those cultural values come second so let's say four methods soap he was saying you know consumers now they turn their everything they buy they turn to the back and they read the ingredients and so they care about what they're putting in their body they care about what they're putting in their homes they care about what they're putting in their babies but cetera et cetera and so you see honest company take off because people care about what they're putting on their baby you see native deodorant take off because people care about putting natural ingredients and not aluminum and parabens you know in their armpits and methods soap took off because they said hey you shouldn't have to clean your house to toxic chemicals but he identified the culture shift first now I don't know how much of this is just retro speak because entrepreneurs do do that where they just make up a story later about how they did it and the real reason was just some total numerical thing where they were like oh yeah I just so we know firsthand this was true with Moyes with native deodorant that he did this yeah and he actually tweeted today some more info which I thought was good he said he identified that natural deuteron was one of the top sell anything he's at number one I don't know if it's actually number one but it was one of the top selling products on Etsy period yeah but everybody was buying it out of a jar and you had to like do this weird thing stick her hand on the jar then rub it in your armpit and he's like look people want people want natural deodorant but they want the convenience of the stick if I could figure out how to put natural deodorant in a stick I think I can make a business that works and you know 18 months later sells it for a hundred million dollars so I think there's something to identifying the culture shift and if the culture shift is hey we gotta like hunker down a little bit or hey we gotta like supporter local businesses like small businesses that's where something like a Groupon or a Groupon 2.0 is very very interesting to me very hard to pull off extremely hard to pull off because local is super super hard and slow to scale and you're dealing with long I'm at bomb and pop style businesses but Groupon was not slow to scale Groupon got to a billion dollars in sales i I think faster than any other company ever now it's true that she didn't it didn't operate well it was now there didn't say I don't want to talk out my ass no I think it did stick I mean look up until recently Groupon hey I look up how much does Groupon do in revenue they still well it didn't stick from a merchant perspective what happened was they on bordered all these merchants the merchants to win on and they would get a bunch of empty traffic and then those empty sort of calories eventually they pulled off and they said why am i offering these deals people come did they take the sale they don't come back and that part didn't work so they lost on the merchant side for a while and then they got all these clones came out that were doing the exact same thing so customers sort of got inundated with daily deals products so that was a bit of the problem there but you're right actually they did scale very fast [Music]

hey everyone welcome to our first hustle chat I'm Brad Warburton I oversee the editorial team at the hustle and I'm joined today by several of my esteemed colleagues who've been covering this coronavirus crisis in doing such an amazing job we've gotten really an outpouring of positive feedback from our audience from all you guys in recent days and I just thought it'd be interesting to take a little bit more of a behind-the-scenes look to tell you a little bit about how we've found the stories and what we're working on going forward and before we get started I thought I'd just kind of introduce each of you I'll start with you Mia you are holed up out in San Francisco with a couple of roommates including your fiance and I'm curious about your wedding plans and how this is this whole moment has affected you yeah so we're on I believe it's day 11 of shelter-in-place in San Francisco yeah it's going okay we have a nice backyard so then just like taking my dog for runs and hanging out in the backyard I'm feel really grateful though that we do not have a wedding date and it will stay that way until this all passes seriously that's smart Connor you went from sort of San Francisco which was the epicenter of the crisis for a while and moved across the country to the now new epicenter of the crisis the New York City area what's that been like um yeah I left San Francisco twelve days ago right before they called the shelter in place for San Francisco and I came back in time for them to call one in New York few days later so I've been holed up with my two younger siblings and my folks in New Jersey so we've gotten terribly clovis in the past couple weeks which has been fun that's awesome playing a lot of card games and stuff I think is what you said right that's right it's nice Michael you've also moved from the west coast back to the East Coast but for different reason you were your editorial intern this semester and you were in college or senior year and now you're back home with your family what what's going on with you yeah I'm in a very strange place where my graduation a fish Billy is not gonna happen but I am not fully graduated I'm still doing like zoom classes though I'm it's just a very weird in-between space to be that I think like myself and a lot of my are stuck in or at home we're sort of still in school we're sort of supposed to look for jobs it's very odd that's a strange time I feel sorry for you that was like one of the best moments in life was that last semester of college Nick you and I are in the DC area and you're basically DC's kind of shut down right now right it is we're all sheltering in place and and I've basically been you know working from home and trying not to move around too much for like it's basically two weeks for me now one of the things that is helping me cope a little bit as springtime this time of year is is really nice in DC and spring is great I think one thing that's a little odd is we're sort of at peak cherry blossom season here in DC but nobody can go out to see them and they had to shut down all the roads down on the mall to keep people away which is a pretty surreal thing to see this time here yeah here yeah I mean I am in in the same spot I'm just I've got I'm in a neighborhood where there's lots of noises during the day so please forgive me if I don't hit mute fast enough on this call whether it's leaf blowers across the street or barking dog or teenager screaming you might hear some of it so anyway I wanted to sort of get us to have a quick discussion about the things that we've seen in in the last couple weeks of our coverage and maybe I'll start with you Nick you're you oversee our daily email and you've kind of taken a sweep of all the news that's happening but in looking broadly we sort of asked our audience what our stories and things that have been pacted you you found something that was really close to home skin tell us about that yeah you know I think there are two two themes that we've talked a lot about in terms of what we've done so far and what we want to continue doing is we want to tell stories of resilience in this moment because people are facing really tough times personally and if you are involved in a business these are really challenging times as well and pivots where for a lot of people individually and if you are leading a business you might have had to prove it overnight and one of the businesses that I that I I spoke to their founders maybe a week ago now they had to do just that where they actually open the business on on Valentine's Day that weekend at February 14th and then the pandemic set in and they had to close up shop a month later and it was a really interesting really interesting story because they have a interested a bill a unique niche and Brad I think you can probably speak to this as somebody who has a couple of kids there's it's really challenging I think for new parents to to have places where they can go out and the whole family can have a good time one of the things that the founders talk to me a little bit about is if you go out say to a brewery that's the thing that's going to appeal to the new parents but not to the kids or you can go to an area where there might be you know park where there's slides or you go to an indoor spot where there might be a ball pit and that's all for the kids but there's not really a lot for the parents so the idea here was just sort of combine the two and the the idea behind their business is they're going to have all sorts of options and ways to entertain young children but they're also going to serve coffee and beer and wine and smoothies and salads and hopefully create a little bit more of an experience that is that is relevant for the whole family and one of the things that was super interesting since they're sort of in my backyard is that you could tell right away that the business was going to be a hit because I remember hearing stories from friends who live nearby like they had lions wrapped around the building I think on on opening weekend so they were super successful and they said that they had had on that first weekend like more than 700 people through the business on you on one day and that opening weekend and and then a month later they were completely shut down and they overnight had to pivot to entirely virtual offerings where they're now doing you know virtual dance classes and trying to put together activity kits to keep kids entertained if they're cooped up with their families and their parents who might be working from home and it really the whole thing really changed overnight and I think you know in speaking to them the pivot to virtual was something they had considered over the long term but was something that they had to spin up like in the course of 24 hours that's pretty interesting speaking of virtual pivots Connor you talked to a company that does like they do make it's a makeup business can you tell us a little bit about the sparkle bar and what you heard from them and how they pivoted yeah of course it was one of the interesting features of talking to folks was we tried to cast a wide enough net to get not only businesses like the one Nick was just talking about that are trying something fairly new but also businesses like the sparkle bar which is a makeup studio so doing something that's been around for quite a while this particular makeup Studios in the Scottsdale area and it got closed down about a week or so ago but before that there was already a huge dip in the number of people who are willing to come into the studio because you obviously are getting really close with other people and there were concerns there so we talked to the team over there and Alex Bradbury who is the operator of the studio showed me that even people who are working in industries that seem kind of inflexible like a makeup studio are doing some pretty innovative things when it comes to coming up with you know teleconferencing ways of getting their business done and in this particular case the sparkle bar takes a lot of pride in its relationships with its customers and they work with the people who come into their studio beforehand and check up on them afterwards to make sure that they got exactly what they wanted they do a lot of work for special events like weddings and stuff like that and what they're at work doing right now is making sure that they're able to replicate that kind of one-to-one personal touch over teleconference and so they've already begun to do that they bought themselves a little bit of wiggle room with gift cards and some other kind of cash flow tricks that a lot of small businesses are trying and now they're hard at work as an entire staff I think there are 13 people under employ they're shifting their entire business model so that they can actually send someone make up and work with them to you know have kind of a styling session over videoconference and then check in with them afterwards to make sure well and things like that they're very much working as they go but it's pretty cool to see how even an industry like that was able to make this switch so you've done you did another piece on this company I think it's called snap bar totally different circumstances in a much sharper pivot which is probably one of the more interesting ones I've heard yeah snap bar was really cool um they're a business that normally sells photo booths for events and given that all events for kind of the foreseeable future are canceled they had to really find an entirely new business model if they were gonna keep all their employees afloat and the way that they went about doing that was actually something entirely different than their existing business and what they did was they're based up in the Seattle Tacoma area and Washington and they worked with a bunch of local vendors to put together direct-to-consumer boxes highlighting soaps foodstuffs all kinds of local Seattle goods from producers that otherwise would have struggled to keep their own lights on and they said hey we have a customer service team we have a sales staff let's use all of our you know internal resources in terms of these talented employees and have them sell a completely different product and then doing so you know hopefully we can keep our lights on and you know keep these other producers engaged and make sure that their business is still moving so they came up with this really cool solution I think it's available not just in Seattle but in San Francisco and several other cities and they're working on expanding that very cool and and also finding a way to keep the employees they have they have like 40 people on staff and various roles and so many people right now in this moment have lost their jobs just like yesterday what was the news Nick like 3 plus million people found unemployment claims which is one of the largest if not the largest ever pretty pretty amazing pivot for them hopefully they can be successful so the other one I found interesting was Michael talked to this company called think the Republican and they're basically like a chain of sushi restaurants in Ohio tell us the story of what they're doing and how other people can learn from that yeah exactly so fusion there are 10 different locations throughout the state of Ohio and basically what happened with them is Iowa was the early states who shut down all non-essential business and so this hat about two weeks ago and it totally took fusion by surprise there was no like warning from the governor that is about to happen and so the company truly just like pivoted in three days to becoming basically like a part-time grocer and the way they did this is super interesting to me and it involves like understanding the some of the logistics of how supply chain work in the US but basically there's a supply chain for groups or labs for restaurants and bars etc just because I have different needs in terms of bulk orders like what customers expect out of them and what if you didn't realize is that while grocery stores were sold out of items like tofu which they had access to London that was not because Aalto in the Ohio area was hard to access it was because groups or a specific supply chain system didn't have enough tofu whereas fusion because they use a different supply chain could easily just source that and the idea is that obviously of course they would originally source tofu like for their meals that they would sell to people but will it they realize that they could do is they could just sell it as a grocery store and so now Fusion will deliver sushi to your home in Ohio it will also deliver groceries and they've had a lot of success doing that well I'm standing at a standing desk right now it's a fully standing desk which I love and I was also intrigued to hear the story of Deskmate I think is what it's called right Nia they were struggling a couple months ago and they've actually benefited so we have some businesses in this moment that have figured out that this is a time when they can really thrive so tell us a little bit of the backstory of what happened with them and what they've experienced yeah so desk meet is a standing standing desk company so they make these like little portable cardboard standing desks that you can flip up on your desktop they're really inexpensive I think they start at 30 euro or 30 pounds and they were really struggling before Cobin 19 they had some supply chain issues that seemed to be unrelated to all of this but their manufacturers shut down and they basically couldn't fill orders for a month because they couldn't get their stock from their their manufacturer and warehouse so they the two co-founders is just the two of them they were like okay we're going to sell they found a buyer but the buyer ended up backing out because of market instability and I think this is mid-february so kind of right before Koba 19 I came to the world in an intense way but the guys just rolled up their sleeves and we're like okay we're gonna try to we're gonna try to make this work we actually now have this great opportunity because so many companies are trying to figure out how to outfit their employees at home and these desks I mean it seems like they could have started this company right now that the idea is so perfect for the moment so their biggest issues right now are that they just don't think that they can make enough for the interest they're getting so many orders they're getting orders around the world especially in expain in Italy and in the US so what they're trying to do is find a manufacturer that they can actually produce the desks in the US to so they don't have to they won't have to ship overseas they want to ship everything overseas but yeah they have an exciting opportunity very cool so before we go I wanted to just sort of tease some of the things we're working on to help people get you know get people excited about things that we haven't works Mia you're working on a piece about a straw company that was about to launch a travel fork and tell us a little bit about what you're finding with them and what you're planning to write yes this company is called final and they're they're new they started their business in 2018 and their product is a final it's called the final straw it's a reusable stainless steel travel straw they did super well they did five million in revenue their first year kind of they launched I'm in the midst of the you know anti plastic straw craze and they were working on launching a travel for their supposed to launch it actually on Earth Day but because of all this you know like no one really wants to travel for right now so they made like an incredibly quick pivot to reusable disinfecting wipes so it's basically like these bamboo rags and you have this cleaning tablet that you put in them you can use them and then you throw the rags in the in the dishwasher or sorry not in the dishwasher in the laundry and then you can you know put a new tab and then they keep using them so I think that kind of I think they obviously need a need because if you guys have found an Amazon recently you can't get disinfecting wipes very very readily um so awesome man send me some of those I could use a bunch yeah same with you Connor you've got this thing on this company called I think it's called life aid and or maybe it's yeah I think it's coming out soon we've worked on it we haven't we haven't published it yet but tell us a little bit about that or anything else you're working on this year that's right yeah this company life aid they're based in California they are a beverage company that makes healthier alternative drinks for athletes who otherwise might be inclined to grab a soda post-workout they've done quite well they've been around since 2011 and they actually you know like Mia mentioned with some of these other business she's been looking into they're doing fairly well in the crisis they've had a bunch of their distribution channels just blow up on Amazon they've been selling Walmart all their major retail partners they've been kind of blowing up so that's been really great for them but the company actually grew into its own by partnering with a lot of local gyms and all of those original partners have since closed but life eight has made the decision not to turn it back on those original partners but rather to invest the unexpectedly high revenue they've been getting from Walmart and Target and Amazon and create a bunch of partnership and affiliate programs with these gyms to help keep them open through the crisis so it's a really cool example of a kind of community business episode where the way that the founders of Life fade will tell you they would have gotten to where they are today without those original smaller partners and so they feel a sense of pretty deep obligation to them today when they're going through a difficult time so it's a pretty cool story of both how kind of business distribution works and which channels are rewarding who them right now and also just how community can kind of come together in moments like this and help each other out very neat I don't want to give away too much on this yet Michael but we talked a couple days ago about having you do a piece on your experience as a graduating senior now entering the crazy job market and what you're seeing and what you're feeling and experiencing anything you want to tease on that story um not too much yet but I do think that I already know from anecdotal experience and from talking to people so far is that like what this moment means a lot just in terms of like where people see themselves in the future obviously and especially just in terms of different industries like for instance like people have relied so much on service work as a bridge into acting or something or into these I guess funnels into these larger like thick fuel and that goes for all sorts of industries and so people are definitely starting to rethink like where they want ahead but I do think one thing that I found personally to be [Music] kind of cathartic is this all these like different face popped up like these Facebook mean groups for people are just sort of trying to make sense of this moment through like very bad jokes and actually like that has been somewhat gingka said at the top like it's a it's your place to be and I think especially I feel this much more strongly than I am too and good to know that there's at least some like sort of communal understanding about it even if that may not make a difference in terms of actual jobs well exactly lastly I've thought I'd turn back to you Nick we had this discussion this morning about the long tail of the pandemic no one obviously knows how soon any of this stuff's going to end but we're starting to think about some of the industries that are gonna feel pain for a long time is there any parting thoughts you want to share about things we're looking at or thinking about covering in that way yeah I mean certainly I don't want to be in the business of making predictions because we're not even in the you know the height of the pandemic here in the US I think it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better but I think these are questions that people are starting to think about and I'm reminded of earlier this week there was even a poll that went up on our company slack that was sort of about have your views on working from home changed in light of what's happened in the last couple of weeks and one of the things that people were quick to point out is that this is not normal working from home yeah you know normally you can you can actually leave your house and you might go get dinner or you might do something else in the middle of the day but I think that's that sort of question is a reflection of what people are going to be asking in the coming months to what extent is this pandemic going to sort of turn the world of work inside out and what are some of the long-term impacts that that maybe we don't see right yet but we're now starting to see signs that this is going to change certain industries permanently that's definitely a thing that as I said we I don't think any of us can be in the business of making strong predictions about but it's definitely something that we're going to be watching watching for and and trying to to tease out a few of those themes in coming weeks also what we've done really well I think is we found as troubling and difficult as this moment is for many people to navigate we've found some moments of levity that we can share so we were going to continue to try to do that whether that's hashtag some good news in this mess that we're all in or other things so keep your ideas coming to us thanks for listening in on our first little hustle chat today and look forward to seeing you all soon thanks everybody [Music]

#stockbuyback #thehustle

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
why are we gonna bail out the airline companies when they're doing all these stock buybacks yeah he's my boy said that and so I was yeah boys all he was saying that and I said what's up with the stock buybacks and so I went pretty deep on understanding you know what what are these buybacks cuz I only do at a surface level one pretty interesting to me so let me talk a little bit about what's going on here so stock buybacks started basically the Great Depression so in 1928 the Depression happened stock prices start crashing for a bunch of the companies and the companies realize hey normally when we want our stock price to go up we got a generate more revenue more customers more profits but with the Great Depression happening those are going down so our stock is dropping and then the way that our stock is measured revenue profits et cetera is gonna get worse and it's just gonna cause a cycle we're just gonna keep keeping keep crashing so somebody very smart decided oh I know what I can do if I want the demand for my stock to go up I should just limit the supply how do I do that well what if I just use the cash we have and rather than investing it in our business to you know grow or do more marketing or whatever I'm going to just buy back shares so they started buying back shares and they bought back shares and then all of a sudden the there's less shares available on the market and the price started to buffer a price started to go up and so this became like immediately the the sort of silver bullet solution that companies were using to sort of survive in the Great Depression now this is actually a technique that Joseph Kennedy did with there used to be a cab company called Hertz which is now the car company and this is exactly what he did the founder of Hertz said Joe I need you to lock it he was young and he goes he was willing to break the rules because I need you to lock yourself in this hotel room up in New York and I need you to do a lot of these buybacks so it appears as though we are a lot bigger than we are and then once the people start buying them back sell them our stuff and you're gonna ride a bus right exactly and you'd just need to reverse the momentum and the appearance that hey this company's doing well in spite of everything else and so when there's a you know when the economy is crashing people fly toward safety flight to safe safe havens and so if your stock is going up people will view that as a safe haven and so anyways this happens for a few years happens for six years and then they put a stop to it so the government comes out says hey we will wait this is sort of an artificial way to pump your stock price and we don't like it we don't think it's a good thing you're just buying they're basically buying the management stock itself so the management would sell the stock using the company's own money so the met the executive management would get rich and the stock price would go up and so the executive management keeps their jobs so it was a double win so 1934 the stops and it stops for about I don't know 50 years 50 years there's basically no stock buybacks in the stock market now 1982 comes around you have Reagan as the president and there's this guy John Chad and I don't know exactly what his deal was but but they decided that hey you know what we should they change they were they wrote a new law which allowed stock buybacks back back into play company should be able to do this and the theory was hey here's what will happen when a company buys back its shares they can use you know they can use some of that back a company could use its cash to do three things at any given time it can give it to the employees and raise their wages they can invest in growth hire new employees or invest in machines and whatnot or they can issue a dividend to investors and that's the sort of buy background and so what end up happening was Reagan writes his law into pass so 1982 buybacks are back after 50 years and the second change that happened was that CEO started kidding compensated not on salary but also based off of bonuses for the share price so now the CEO is also incentivized to buffer the sale to stock price and so you go from in 1980 to half a percent of profits were spent on buybacks before this law 2008 77 percent of profits are used for stock buybacks even now it's 65 percent so 65 percent of profits not going to employee wages not going into investing for growth just you announcing stock buybacks and you can see that the CEO compensation is sort of skyrocketed as well so we went from the CEO used to make 15 times more the the average employee at their company now it's 220 times more because they're compensated on the stock price and the stock buyback is the easiest way to buffer the stock price and so this has been getting worse and worse and worse 2008 was sort of that peak worst time because when the financial crash happened in 2008 companies they pulled their favorite lever to keep their stock price high or from plummeting further and so recently Trump cut the corporate tax from 37 percent to 21 percent and the idea again was like alright great if we don't tax the companies they'll use that money to give higher wages to reinvest in the business and they did a study they saw that it's been a year and a half since that tax cut and wages have gone up 1.2 percent only but there's been one trillion dollars of stock buybacks and now it's since then and so clearly the the reason the companies asked for the tax cut is not why they did this and what do you think is gonna happen so I think what's gonna happen is now there's a there's a problem right so these companies like the airline industry right so I have this graph that we can show on the screen for people who watch this on Instagram or on the YouTube channel for the Hustle which by the way for some reason nobody watches on YouTube even though it's much better we cut the clips of just the good parts and you see the video you see the graphs so I don't know why nobody's watching but they should the podcast gets way more listeners than that but anyways there's this graph that shows okay if you look at like international companies outside the US where you know at Volkswagen or whatever they'll have like 0% stock buybacks if you look at in the US some of the corporations like United eighty percent of profits went to to stock buybacks Southwest 66% Delta fifty percent of profits being used on this so now these companies they don't have cash anymore because they bought back their own worthless shares so they've ran out of cash because they were buying back their shares to pump their price and now they can't do it because the whole economy's crashing so now they can't get their way out of that and they don't have the cash to withstand this so they're gonna go to the government say hey we're all out of cash don't let us fail but really should we reward that because you used all your cash to buy back stock to make yourself rich for the last five years well by the way we know of us gonna end yeah you're gonna get bailed out and they're gonna do the same thing sadly it's yeah this is I didn't know I didn't know about a lot of that so there's our clip [Music]

this is like nothing I've ever experienced I know there were some analogies like you said 9/11 I saw this great tweet from this guy his name is yi Shan Wang do you know if you know who he is he's he was a former CEO of reddit he was like an expert guy see you've read it for a while really smart guy I love following him on Twitter he doesn't have that many followers but he says a lot of smart that I just basically steal and then say myself later and he was saying he was like you know the coronavirus thing is so different from like the last thing that felt like this was 9/11 and he goes this is so much harder for Americans he's like because when it was 9/11 the response was all bravery patriotism action revenge it was all action things and there was a clear visible enemy it was like okay you don't sort of a terrorist bin Laden you got this picture in your brain that you could sort of point it to is it with this we have an invisible enemy you can't see the virus you don't know who has it you don't know who doesn't so we all just have to hide and the best course of action is inaction and that's very strange for people and it reminds me of this quote by Pascal which is like all of man's problems come down to butchering the quote but it's like all of man's problems come down to the fact that he cannot sit alone in a room for thirty minutes being able to just sit in your house and chill and it's so difficult for people you know it's funny there's I was talking to a co-worker I'm like there's two things that a lot of people want and then they get it and it freaks them out and this is a little taste of that which is people talk about retiring they want enough money that they can retire and a lot of people want to work from home and I've gotten a lot of from the work from home crowd because I'm because I keep saying I hate this I hate it I love coming into the office and feeling energy and I've retired what not retired I took I've taken eight months off at a time and it gets boring fast and what we're seeing now is that some people are you can kind of taste it a little bit and I personally hate it so okay I got the quote because I butchered it all of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone okay that's the quote I had to correct it because it's small [Music] you

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
okay so what are some of the ideas that are interesting to you well the last week when I was sitting in you guys mentioned that religion overall is declining and I didn't think that was right and so I looked at the numbers and actually there's 66 million people coming and I'm just gonna speak towards Christianity sure 66 million new Christians every single year right people being born into it people converting and so on with only 26 million people leaving the church which means 40 million your net net net positive 3.3 billion by 2050 right which is pretty incredible and I don't know on Instagram if anyone that's listening to the podcast follows but there's a lot of actual Christian entrepreneurs yes and Christian influencers so you have people like Carl Lance rich Wilkerson jr. vous Church even and let me ask are you a religious guy or are you interested in this from a just a curiosity and business point of view both okay so I like I'm part of a men's group like a men's Christian group and it's interesting and like kind of diving into the idea itself a lot of my friends have kids that are growing up every single way that the church traditionally engages with this younger this younger demographic is outdated right read the Bible read the Bible you know listen to me talk but sit down and listen exactly there it there's no way right now there's no media company coming out there's there's really nothing out there for new age consumers Gen Z's Millennials to actually engage with the church right so we're thinking this is not like this is an area where there's 40 million people every single year joining that's a pretty fantastic growth right billions of built-in customers and by 2050 obviously they're getting born right now for the most part or they're people like us it's like how are they going to engage with the church itself there's there's only a handful of companies that are somewhat looking into this but if we look at even the way that culture is trending look at Kanye West's last album yeah legitimately a gospel album look at some of the brands that are really taking off right now fear of God Jerry Lorenzo right a Christian backed fashion company right but there's only a handful of them the opportunity is massive to create either a media company or you know you could be selling books you could whatever it might be to engage with those younger consumers so I got a couple ideas so someone in someone from the community she said somebody who'd taken action he messaged me he said give me three months mmm she gave me three months what three months they sent me a link and he and and not you know I hope he's okay with me sharing this Alaska masters we could bleep this whole thing otherwise but he said give me three months and I'm gonna show you that I can get this business off the ground I'm gonna get on your show Wow and he goes what does what's the business he goes tithing Wow so he goes digital tithing so basically let's give it an algae venmo for churches so he goes there's this company called push pay that is currently processing four billion dollars a year of digital donations inside a church so instead of passing the hat around they passed I don't know the QR code around or whatever it is it's like you can donate to the church through through it out and Ty Lee is another one so push pay 4.2 billion that's they're processed amount they took 98 million Wow so this is a very simple FinTech company to build distribution you can tell how you would distribute it to customers through the churches themselves who have a high incentive because you know if your church you need to ask for money and then you grow or you don't ask for money and then you shrink and potentially close if we think what this former church's perspective as well it'll help them with all their accounting right every week every Sunday Saturday whenever going to church they're accepting cash right someone has to sit down and like sit down you know is this tithing money is this for something else so just the accounting of it imagine which one so that'll be they said 15% I was looking into a little bit 15% of all donations now and the churches is digital but I bet that that's so I bet that that's already you know you know fivefold increase from where it was a few years ago and I bet it's gonna go further I think it gets to 30-40 percent over time and and so this is just churches and you know just one faith so there's a you can copy an existing model take it to another faith you could just compete against these so let's say tithing is one let's say you know surface area where you might go for what's another well just going on that with that one point right there what is really interesting is did you see bird come out with payments this week yes do you think bird is gonna get it they're gonna have bird payments yeah at the front of all exactly now I don't i don't think i think bird is in the last-minute Hail Mary type thing yeah okay okay well interesting what is another one the biggest one to me just comes down to engagement right you already have a passionate community of young people that want to be engaged with the church what we've seen a lot of is merchandise right so how can you physically show that you were engaged with the Christian and Catholic or whatever your church actually is right so influencer marketing obviously being big preacher sneakers is a really interesting Instagram that happening it's big preacher sneak preachers well preacher sneakers shows what all the preachers globally are actually wearing right now so it's like how can you create a brand directly for them themselves and that's the perfect bridge of like the faith and I know James II yeah you know cross over there so that really gets me excited yeah so I like the media business idea I think that's a pretty straightforward one all they're probably not the most lucrative we had talked a little bit about beautiful Bibles or beautiful Bibles to talk about this I like this idea a lot well I'm just you think to yourself it's you if you have if you're a Christian or whatever your religion might be but let's just say for Christianity sake you go to someone's house I guarantee you their Bible is hidden away because it got passed down to them they got it for all its it's hideous but if you think of what is on I shouldn't say hideous but it's not the best looking book question it's okay but if I think what is on people's coffee tables right now its kinfolk right it's things that are going that they're buying that are beautifully bound that they're visual and so I think there's this really great opportunity to reinvent what the Bible actually looks like and create like the kinfolk of Bibles yes so number one most selling book of all time yes the Bible that's a good place to start VIP again you can print your own Bible so it's not like you're gonna go a reprint Fifty Shades of Grey and get sued yeah you can go Bri print this and it could work you can remix it so you can simplify you can distill you can pull out certain anecdotes I love this idea so the only reason I'm not doing this idea is because I'm not really just but even me I'm just like would you listen no it's like I love how you just said pull out specific books yeah so Netflix didn't really a pretty interesting movie on the book of mark right and so like how can you take some of the stories that were within there and actually have them come to double-click into that yeah I like that a lot so so I think this generally speaking taking the sort of number one most best-selling book of all time or if you look at the Geetha or the Koran or whatever these are all in the top sellers of all time and if you can you know put a remix on it so aesthetically pleasing is where I would go with it first the other side of it is you know distilling it down for kids making it more kid-friendly or like you said going into sort of some of the lesser told or pulling out some of the anecdotes and stories and really bringing them to life 14 million new customers a year right do it as a YouTube channel do it as a book I think these are I think this is really interesting if someone's doing this reach out to me I want to help you make this successful I put a lot of thought into and to how you would go about doing this and I genuinely think it's really really really fascinating idea and this influencer preacher thing what's up with that it's so it's funny I thought a lot about it and guys in my men's group and I think it's a really great way to bring kind of the youth back into like Christianity for instance but they have millions of followers you know they're with Bieber all the time parlance is the first one I saw that was doing this Harlan it's the biggest you got to think he was leading Hillsong right and if you dressed a little differently you could pass it Karl and that might be that might be my next movie I saw him and I was like this guy's cooking this is act fellow stylish and funny fantastic speaks speaks in like comments you know common tongue not like you know he'll use slang yeah and I was like no wonder this guy's friends with all the basketball players and you know musicians that everybody knows about you've reformed Bieber a hundred percent no it's really interesting and he's speaking to them on their level that is really the biggest thing and so people understand that this is like being I want to be a strong Christian let's say and I want it to be aspirational yet attainable I can be him right instead of like the typical preacher you'll see it a lot of the churches it's like you could look up to someone like Carl Lentz mean like that is someone I want to aspire to be right and there's also sort of a musical component so he's with the Hillsong Church I think and they put out like tons of great you know faith-based music I think that faith-based music is a pretty big space so here's a question I had about this right because I've brainstormed these up broke some of them down I've done a bit of research and so then I asked for some I believe in these ideas okay but I'm not doing I'm not doing these ideas yep a big part of it for me is just time I got a lot of I do the podcast every job I have you know other stuff going on so for someone like you entrepreneurial Christian why don't you do this idea I'm one of these well I'm in the same place as you I'm also driving it it's all time limited I will do anything to help these get off the ground any of the ideas we will talk about right it's like you want to see people take these really nice and interesting ideas that are big and help them come to life and so if I had more time on my hands I would love to help it [Music]

what's your favorite interview question when you're interviewing for somebody for a job uh on a scale of one to ten how lucky do you think you are nice where'd you get that from when I interviewed at Airbnb the founder asked me it it's the Jeff Bezos question he was the I think the originator of it or made it popular at least they asked you Basil's what's your favorite question he said this and now a bunch of us have stole this Joe Gebbia asked me it and I told him a 9 or a 10 and he said why and I explained to him why and I go why'd you ask me that he goes people who say they're really lucky are the people I want to be around Raz like why do you think that and he goes well if you're lucky if you think you're lucky you must be talented and things just fall in your place or you actually are lucky and I want to throw myself with lucky people I want to be around unlucky people yeah the specifically the question is how like every person do you think you are one to ten one two three is like I'm not very lucky I don't consider myself a lucky person four five six is I think I'm pretty I think I'm you know decently lucky average and I you know I think I know why are sorry I don't know why just that's just how it is and then this sort of eight nine ten czar I consider myself a very lucky person and here's why and you want people who are either you know if Lucky's a thing you want them around you just like he said or if they're not you want people who are optimistic and you know when you're building a young business you need optimistic people and then the why part is interesting too because some people know how to air and engineer serendipity they know how to engineer lucky situations for themselves or they're looking out for situations where they may be getting lucky and pounce on those opportunities and that's again somebody you want in hourly business and then I'm gonna ask you the same question and I think I know what yours is but I'm gonna say another one that is deadly I love this question and this is when you back-channel on someone and you want to ask about so let's say I'm interviewing Henry and his old boss no reference check I'll go I'll go Sean what would you give Henry out of ten just say number seven okay and you're gonna give him a seven because you wanna you don't want to completely [ __ ] on them and you won't but you also want to be realistic and I would then I would say okay well what what can i what can he do to get the remaining three points what could make him of perfect ten that is the only way I've ever devised to get ready to call feedback on a person other than saying what are they bad at well you know the pretty good or that's that's what I always say yeah for sure because people like I said wanna be polite and then people also don't want to like why it's the best way I've ever found to get it love it okay you're good reference trait question for that specific thing yeah I know what it is and you should tell it I don't remember because I've told a story once but I don't remember what it was is this the founder of Second Life told me once who you are who you want to be your oh oh this one yeah this is a good one yeah you know I love questions like this I asked this in job interviews but I also just ask this in social situations to be awkward fill them I say hey we're gonna play a little game I want you to fill in the blank first thing that comes to mind first answer best answer I'm gonna say the first part you finish it and I'll say life is all right less Alan let's play all right sorry Henry you have the mic so let's play first answer best answer answer as you go life is people are I am yes and then you use it to sort of have a little bit of a conversation you try not to judge people too much off the top the mind but I actually just think this is useful for yourself so this is like your core outlook it's like what's life and you said life is great cool optimistic sort of grateful person then you said people are tough that's interesting why do you say people are tough are you have a girlfriend are you guys are you dealing with some stuff right now you are what's a situation where people have been tough tough to deal with people are tough to persuade or tough to get on your on your page that's a great question you totally have you like you could see what he struggles with in values yeah and then the last one which is I am and you went with Henry but a literal answer if you were gonna do another one what would it be I am okay and then the second question I'll kind of ask is so I'm usually pause there I do the psychoanalysis and then a couple things happen people I uh okay they just like want to leave because they feel so uncomfortable or they'll be like what are yours cool I like that that's a good sign when you're asking what are yours and then I'll tell them mine and then they'll do the same thing back to me and the last question is like I tell him I said you know one thing I did was I I did those answers top of mind and I didn't really like what I said and then I just reassessed it I was like what do I think the answer should be for me like what do I want my answers to be what do I want my outlook of life people and myself to be right what do I want my mental model to be and then I revised it and then the best people come back a few days later and they're like hey by the way I you know I came up with my own and here's mine and those are the people I'm like I'm gonna be friends with you for a long long time cuz you're like me you like to do this stuff [Music]

all right it's 10:30 a.m. in San Francisco I'm by myself in the studio because Shawn wants to be with his newborn baby cuz he's a little nervous about this whole corona thing he doesn't want to be out walking around don't blame him and I don't feel like talking about business opportunities right now I stayed up late last night monitoring this whole corona thing the stock market it's scary it's a scary time I don't know what the reality is gonna be how it's gonna shake out but it definitely it's not a normal day and I don't want to talk about normal stuff today because of that so I stayed up last night and I came up with the list of four skill sets that I've developed in the last 10 or 15 years maybe longer 20 years since I started scheming since I started trying to create businesses and I want to talk about those today because in a way they're kind of like I kind of think of them as my rock my recession-proof skill sets and these things that I'm gonna about to I'm gonna tell you have really changed my life and I think that if people use them they're gonna be impossible to stop I think that you're gonna be able to make a living no matter what and I'm gonna spend some time talking about these four these four things that I've learned throughout the years and I'm gonna riff a little bit on them I'm gonna tell you the resources that I think you can turn to most of all of them are free or they're cheap books that you can go and acquire and read and I think it makes a huge difference and everything that I'm about to talk about I've stolen from people that are smart a lot more successful than I am that's for sure and my perspective I think is a little bit interesting in that we have this event called hustle con and I've hosted about five or six of them at this point and throughout the years we've probably have had I mean we could have had 40,000 attendees throughout our events and so we do hustle con and we do all these other events and because I do these events I get to have all these really powerful and interesting people come and speak but about I tell everyone to show up a little bit early so I get to spend about an hour with them ahead of time typically privately or with just two of the other speakers like maybe the one who just spoke and the one who will speak and I'm able to ask them pretty intimate questions because that's what I do I I like to get the nitty gritty and so my insight is coming from these people and I'm talking about like folks have started these really huge companies or who have accomplished really interesting or amazing things and it's not just about money but they're definitely successful if that's how you want to define success but more importantly they're successful in terms of just turning dreams into reality and that's really what I think that this whole business thing is about which is about dreams into reality how do you take ideas and how do you shape the world according to those ideas and it sounds fluffy but I'm telling you this [ __ ] is really important and so that's what I'm gonna talk about today some of these are skills some of these are mindsets mindset frameworks or whatever you want to call it and so I'm gonna talk about these four and I'm gonna I'm gonna go through them relatively quickly but I'm gonna add details and stories where I think it's effective so let's get into it I've got my notes here I'm gonna be I just jotted these down in the last few hours so we're gonna go through them okay the first thing that I've learned that's been incredibly effective and these aren't in order but this might be the most effective which is controlling your emotions and this sounds like some generic advice but I'm gonna walk you through it I we have a lot of companies work out of our office because we got a lot of space here and when I started my business someone let me work out of their office for free and so we try to kind of do repai that that favor to other people just getting going and I always meet these really smart people people who worked at McKinsey or which is Stanford and also amazing stuff and on paper they are perfect and they are so smart and I always tell them the same thing which is this is not an intellectual game this is an emotional game starting a business that is very successful financially intellectually it's very easy now maybe being like Elon Musk and starting a company where you sent a rocket to Mars yeah that requires a lot of intelligence but for a lot of companies like it could be like we work or Institute car these things that are Oberer these things that are really large it's the very simple concepts and they're not that hard to execute but what's really hard is controlling your emotions that's that that that's incredibly challenging and what I've what I've learned throughout the years through paying a lot of money for therapy and coaching and reading is that the majority of both good and bad behavior that you have now it started back in childhood and so what I tell people and what I've learned and when I tell myself is if you just study your childhood you're gonna learn a lot about why you are reacting to certain things and I remember being a kid I was I was only four or five years old and this is just an example of what of how things that happen when you're when you're a kid a lot of times you don't even realize it but it actually sticks with sticks with you I remember when I was a kid and I was at up we were at like a bar restaurant or something with my family and my father was drinking it must have been like a Jack and Coke or something I remember he ordered this glass and I saw him get the straw and take it out and I was like why are you doing that dad I was a little kid and goes and you just made some comment no big deal he's like oh men don't drink with straws and he didn't even think twice he was just joking or I don't know he just said that because he meant like he was saying like men don't use like dainty straws when they're drinking alcoholic drinks and my whole life I never used a straw it wasn't till I was older when I realized oh he was first of all probably he was just he just made some offhanded comment even think about it and second of all he was referring to alcohol and so for my whole life when I went to McDonald's or a fast food restaurant as a kid I would never I would always pull the straw out of the drink and that's an example of how little things happen when you're young and sometimes you notice some and sometimes you don't but they entirely shape how you behave as an adult and I think it's very important to study your childhood and to study how you were raised trauma that happened when you're young because as you grow a company all of those all of those things that that happen to you they become magnified so good things and bad things both 10x as you get more people and as you get a little bit more successful and the way you react to things ways the way you gauge risk the way that you react to people doing what you said or them not doing what you said the way you trust people a lot of that stems from how you were raised and things that happen to you as a kid and so what I do is I I have a therapist so I've gone to therapy every week for maybe 10 years and I've had to work through a lot of interesting things but I think it's quite common that people have the same issues that I have but going to therapy is incredibly important or at least it has been for me and the other thing that I did is I have a CEO coach that has helped a ton it's pretty much like therapy but it's all related to your job but like we you really talk about all types of relationships girlfriends wives boyfriends husbands father mother I mean you talk about all this stuff coworkers and so that has been incredibly helpful for me and so the things that have made a massive impact the resources at that have made that massive impact art I used torch so torch yo that's my that's my coach we pay him a his name's Peter we pay my monthly fee and myself and Adam the president of our company go to him and it's been wonderful the second thing is the body keeps the score it's a great book on dealing with trauma now trauma a lot of times people think that means soldiers who are in war and who saw people die and their best friends and they're dealing with PTSD post-traumatic stress disorder but the reality is is a lot of people can go have that so whether you your parents or your siblings or someone in your life was abusive to you as a kid or it could be you just got really scared you saw something that was pretty wild it could be when I lived in Missouri when I grew up I remember being in fourth grade and seeing 9/11 and it could be it's a could be relatively small but that made a massive difference on me and that was a small indicator or a small example of trauma and that shapes how you feel and so what the body keeps the score does is it teaches you how to recognize when you've experienced a little bit of trauma or a lot of bit of trauma and how to deal with it and so that's a great book and the second thing I like right now is how to change your mind I don't drink any alcohol I haven't had a drop of alcohol in eight years not a cent not a drop I don't do drugs like I'm not against drugs I'm not against weed in fact in many regards I'm in favor of it but I personally just don't do it because it's never jived well with my personality that said I'm incredibly fascinated right now with psychedelics I have a lot of friends who do micro dosing LSD who do micro dosing ketamine and I'm not an expert on it yeah but how to change your mind is a great book that looks at trauma and how to deal with it and how a lot of folks are turning to psychedelics and how that can impact you and I'm very very interested in that and the third thing that I really like when it comes to controlling your emotions is this YouTube show called YouTube channel called School of Life it's this philosopher named Allen I think is Alain de Botton I think his name is and he does a really good job of explaining why people feel a certain way and how to deal with that and I have found his YouTube channel it's free to be incredibly impactful on controlling my emotions and the last thing that I do this is an exercise I thought I this was unique to me it's not so I used to do this years ago and I still do it to this day and it turns out there's a name to it it's methought exercise I call it looking at the downside and so what I like to do in order to control my emotions because the thing with controlling your emotions is you have to control the up and the down because when you start a company or when you start anything typically you have a fair bit of highs and the highs are probably as good feeling as you as you think or maybe even a little bit less than you think but the downs are typically way worse than you can imagine it's really hard to control the Downs because when you start anything controlling the down is the hard part and most people are shocked at how low you can feel when you're starting something even when things appear to be going well and so what I like to do is I like to think in my mind I'll close my eyes I do this a lot of times in the morning I'll do it at night as well as I close my eyes and I think what's the worst possible outcome right now and so it could be I get sick my family gets sick I'm gonna die and I visualize what what that feels like and if you do it for a long enough with your eyes closed after about five or ten minutes you can really feel what that feels like and then I do two things I say to myself all right that is the worst that can happen I just experienced it anything else that happens today it is only upside and it really makes you have a lot of gratitude and appreciate that that hasn't actually happened and the second thing that I like to do with this exercise is and this relates particularly just starting a company or getting a job or moving somewhere else that's new and just starting your life is I try to protect the downside so for example if you are gonna start a company you can ask yourself well in order to start this business I need a little bit of cash and so you have to be very specific you have to say how much cash do I need well right now I'm spending $3,000 a month how much how many months saved do I need in order to feel good about this and so let's say we come up with the number six that means I need six times $3,000 I need $18,000 in savings I'm gonna go out and get that $18,000 okay I've got that $18,000 what else is the worst-case scenario here what's the downside here well I spend all my money and my business goes under now do I want to be homeless no I'm not willing to accept being homeless okay so what's the net so I have to protect myself from being homeless how would I protect myself from being homeless well I would probably get a job driving uber because I have a car do I want to am I willing to accept that no I'm not willing to accept that or maybe you are and then that's the worst-case scenario but that's one stage up could be maybe well I'll just get a white-collar job at a huge corporation and I'll just be a cog in their big wheel and their machine and it won't be fulfilling it won't be glamorous but it'll be a really good nine-to-five with benefits benefits so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and make friends with recruiters at those companies right now even though this isn't even coming close to half it's not happening yet and so at least at this point if something ever bad happens I know that I have a connection at IBM or I have a connection at Target headquarters or I have a connection at into it or just the biggest companies in the world and the likelihood that I can get a job there is relatively high am I willing to accept that that is the worst-case scenario yes I am willing to accept that and so what I do is I go up the scale of like alright well where's the lowest that I'm willing to accept now I'm gonna lock that that that in as best as I can so now anything that happens above this I am happy and it is only upside and so that's what I like to do to control my emotions when it comes to taking risk the second skill that I think is incredibly important and this is maybe the number one or number two skill I fit in terms of business I think it's the number one skill and so this skill is copywriting I think copywriting is the most important skill that you can have her business and one of the most important skills that you can have in life and here's why when you learn how to write well you learn how to think well you when you learn how to write clearly you weren't learn how to think clearly and copywriting is a particular type of writing but it's not just limited to writing copywriting is understanding how people think and how they feel and how to use the written word or a script or spoken word in order to sell a product or sell an idea basically how to use words to get people to do what you want them to do and the way that you do that is you have to understand what motivates them what makes them paint what makes them work and so this can be applied to literally anything I have made tens of millions of dollars this way using copywriting but I've also met my wife this way I learned when I was when I was trying to meet her she was that way out of my league and so I used what I learned in copywriting to like get her attention and make her or at least try to make her interested in me copywriting copywriting is incredibly effective I've used it to get customers like as in people to buy stuff from us or for the hustle to get advertisers I've used it to get speakers to our events I've used it to recruit people I've used it to sell people on this interesting di have copywriting is incredibly important and it boils down to a bunch of really simple principles but the easiest one to remember for this conversation is a de a I D a tension interest desire action for the majority of your copywriting life which for most of you it has nothing to do with getting a job it's just a good skill set to have in life attention interest desire action is the framework that you need so when you write you line it up with attention can I get your attention interests can I tell you some facts that get you interested and get you to fall down the slippery slope because once I get you to start reading my work I can get you to keep buying into what I'm saying and it's really hard to get people to fall down that slope but interest by specifically tell them very interesting facts and features about the story that you just started with your your action point or sorry your a tension point desires the second part so I'm gonna make you desire whatever I'm selling and I'm gonna get you to desire that by telling you things that you don't know and how this can benefit your life and then finally action I'm gonna tell you specifically how to get you to act and so here's an example that my friend Neville always uses uses that I love which is if I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna try and convince a 15 year old guy to drink more water I could say drink more water it's healthy for you or and a lot of these facts aren't necessarily true because I didn't research what water does for you but I very easily could use those premise for that I'm gonna say have you ever seen those guys with huge muscles at the gym carrying around gallons of water in their hand it's like they use those milk containers to carry water so that's how I get your attention you see they're doing that because if you drink if you drink a gallon of water a day the likelihood that your muscles will grow by 30% more than how do not drink water now the reason that happens and this is the desire part the yeah this is the desire part the reason that happens is because water has these molecules in them that helps oxygen travel through your blood and oxygen is needed to build up your muscles that's my desire part is I'm trying to show you how to build up your muscles and when that oxygen goes to your muscles they grow 30% faster so and this is the action part if you want to build big muscles and be healthier than before you need to drink about a gallon of water a day per hundred pounds of body weight so that action part I specifically explained how to do that now that was just a silly example I don't none of that shit's true but you get the point this ADA it works wonderfully and I always think that I always tell people you got to learn copywriting and there's a few great ways to learn it you can do what I did which was very labor-intensive and very effective but it takes a lot of time and that's called copy work and so what I did was I got a hold of the hundred best sales letters of all time I don't know what makes it 100 best but it's just famous sales letters so and then in the 50s 60s 70s 80s and 90s before the internet really came around and it even happened after that but predominantly before that these salesmen would send these letters to people's homes and they would try to convince people to get interested in buying a vacuum or an encyclopedia or a pair of sunglasses and the it was typically the they typically wrote the wives the the housewife would take out her checkbook and be like oh this is really interesting I need to buy this and she would write a check put it into the envelope and sale it back that's a lot of friction and so these people were so good at using words because it was so expensive to send out all these letters I had to be good they were so good at using their words that they had to that they convince these strangers to write a check and mail to him and so I found these hundred letters and if you google best sales letters of all time you're gonna find them and I would I spent probably six months where I would spend about two or three hours a day and when I was 22 years old I would write them all out by hand I would also do that with books oh the Great Gatsby Saturday Night Live live scripts I would do it with movie scripts just any piece of great writing I would do that with and when you do this it's kind of like how you learn an instrument the way that we teach people how to play music it incredibly effective so if I hand you a guitar or a piano I don't say go ahead write a song I tell you copy the star-spangled banner' go play jingle bells go look at Jimi Hendrix go look at Led Zeppelin play all this all these copy all these other people steal their work for a little while and or whatever genre you're interested go and copy them exactly and in time you're gonna learn how to feel the texture you're gonna see the patterns that work best that works extremely well with writing and it's the same concept I call it copy work this is how a lot of people used to learn our school our schooling the way that we do it now it's changed over the last handful of decades but for a long time people used to do this Ben Franklin was a great writer and he said this is how he learned how to write and it's really effective so it's called copy work the second thing that you can do and I'm biased Neville is my good friend but there's a guy named Neville Medora and I actually met him because I bought his course and I bought his course and then after I took his course I became friends with them and years later we became best friends and he was the best man at my wedding so I love Neville and so I'm biased but his course is what I took to learn about copyrighting he's he's got this course called copywriting course it's spelled with AK a copy with a k' and course with a k' I don't know it's always stands out it's a great course I don't know how much it cost right now it could cost a few hundred bucks or a hundred I don't even know but it's relatively affordable and I think if you don't like it he'll refund you his money your money but anyway it's a great course so it teaches a lot of this stuff it's worth it it's totally worth it and I actually think I used to promote this so much that if you go to copywriting course comm slash Sam I've got like a referral link and I think there's like a fifty dollar off code or something you could use so if that interests you do that the third thing is this book called advertising secrets of the written word by Jo Sugarman it's a great book it costs $10 and I bet you if you google google it correctly you can find a free PDF of it online it's a great book that walks you through copywriting principles and why certain things work and why they don't and finally the last thing it's not a copywriting thing but it's a writing thing and it's a book by Stephen King called on writing and the first half of the book is it reads really fast it's only 250 pages maybe the first half it's all about his tools and tricks and his toolbox he calls it his toolkit or his toolbox for writing well and it's incredibly effective it's it he has got rules like don't use too many adverbs or keep your sentences short things like that it's incredibly effective it's a great book on writing the second half of the book is about his biography and it's really really fascinating so it's called on writing by Stephen King so the second skill set that I wanted to go through copywriting I think that because I know how I would say I'm a pretty good copywriter I'm a B because I am a B copywriter until the day I die I will never be homeless I will always make money now verdicts still out if I'm gonna be very very wealthy but I will bet everything which I am betting everything by starting businesses and things like that that no matter what happens I will always be able to make a really good salary rather as an employee or selling someone else's products so I think that copywriting is incredibly effective it's it's just it's really useful for your life business and just living okay we're gonna go to the third one and the fourth one and then that's it the third one or the third skill set or thing that I've learned in business that had pretty much shocked me I really only learned this in last year but looking back at it people have told me this forever which is there's a massive difference a massive gap in skills and a lot of people cross it but there's the gap exists of starting and managing so when you start businesses a lot of people think of Mark Zuckerberg and they're like this college kid started this thing he was 20 when he started it now he's only 30 or he could be 25 still and he manages 10,000 employees he hired the best people in the world from Princeton and Stanford and Harvard and Seoul people from Amazon the bright mines on earth and you think yeah that's just how it goes well managing those people and the business it's incredibly challenging and oftentimes the people who are creative and crazy enough to start companies a lot of times the skill sets they needed to start it are not only different but oftentimes opposite of what it takes to run when you start something you could look at a lot of spreadsheets and you could kind of like guess your way there but a lot of times not all the time but a lot of times starting something it's completely irrational on paper things may or may not work and you just got to be creative in you got to do [ __ ] you got to move fast and you're not gonna have meetings you're not gonna talk to people about stuff you're just gonna move quickly you're gonna execute you're gonna do it and it's a very creative process it's almost like creating a piece of art like maybe there's some equation that says like the perfect rectangle looks this way but every but a lot of times there's just Picasso who just says [ __ ] it this is interesting to me I'm doing this and sometimes it works that's kind of what's starting up businesses but managing a business is a lot different and so at our company I did a pretty good job of getting us to about a million a month in sales but towards the ends of that I was breaking I was doing horrible I was not good at managing it and I was very unhappy and so we hired one of my first hires was this guy named Adam I went to high school with and he's now president of our company and he runs a lot of the day-to-day stuff so I kind of I kind of I'm like he's like Sam sandwiched in the middle whereas I'm really good at thinking of these really high level ideas and I'm also really good at going in at the very bottom and just being an individual contributor and creating interesting things I'm not always great at managing the day-to-day of what's going on it's I bet I could get good at it but it just really doesn't interest me and that was really hard to learn and I struggled with this for years I like I said I hired a CEO coach I had we have a handful of really great angel investors and I kind of talked to them I'm like I don't know what to do here and it wasn't until I realized that Adam is one of the best at this he loves us he's the type of guy who was the captain the football team the president of student council he loves leading people and it kind of hit me I'm like man the way that I sometimes don't understand why people are unwilling to start something or how on earth they're afraid of starting I am kind of like that on the other end with managing there's people who it whether it comes naturally to them or they've just worked on this skill set they're really good at it and so in a way I was wearing this backpack that was full of weight and I hated carrying it on my shoulders I just took out some of the weight and I put it in Adams bag and he loves carrying it and so through this process ice mentioned earlier we have hustle con speakers through this process I actually talked to a lot of people at our conferences and that was one of the major things that I used to ask people which is if you have a right-hand man or a right-hand woman do you have someone leading the day-to-day because I'm struggling with that how do you do that and there was typically two answers which was yeah I don't like it it's really hard and I could sense that these people I'm talking I mean I don't want to I don't want to call anyone out but go and just Google like hasta con speakers or something look at all the people who we've had in our events and those these are this is the type of person or those are the people who told me this which was they would say like I am horrible at managing this or oftentimes they would have like one of their assistants or like a keeper or like a handler like with them and I would be like hey what's this person like as a manager and if the answers were pretty consistently pretty bad this person is not good and so the the first answer was I'm not good at it I'm really struggling with it and a lot of times those people would say I wish I had someone who I could replace myself a CEO I I would hear that all the time and you I was shocked by it and the second answer that I got was yeah I hired a really good see oh oh or a really good president and this is my right-hand woman or right-hand man and they run a lot of the day-to-day and it allows me to focus on what I do best and the people who said number two were way happier and oftentimes I think a lot more successful now there are these rare occasions where the person who started is just there they're there also a great CEO or a great people manager that that definitely happens but often it is not the case I'm looking at a photo of Ted Turner Ted Turner's one of my heroes he was pretty notoriously a bad manager he was a great leader people wanted to follow him in battle but what he would do is he would come up with these great ideas so Ted Turner came up with the idea of CNN and he launched it but before that he had other businesses and when he came up to CNN a lot of people think Ted Turner you're the guy started seeing in well yeah he is but he also there was another guy named Reese and Reese was the guy leading the day-to-day Ted would come came up with the idea and then he went away for three months and did a sailing competition so having these right hand people are is very important and a lot of times I feel like I'm the right hand person at this point but I think that it's really important to understand the difference between starting and managing I mean for a long time for a long time it was normal that they would calm gray hairs it was normally get a gray haired leader to come in for a startup so these young people would come up with this idea for this great tech company and then the investor would say all right let's go guys CEO and that is not popular right now but I think it should be I think it's actually quite effective maybe not CEO but you definitely need this team of experienced people and and so the reason why I brought this up is it's a it's something that most people I found struggle with but there's not a lot of resources out there not a lot of people talking about it and so I think it's really important to learn this ultimately I'm this skill set comes out to delegating and there's four resources that I'll have that I've liked the first one I don't like the name of the book but it's very helpful it's by a guy named Fela Felix Dennis Felix Dennis he was this he's dead now he died a few years ago maybe ten years ago he was he's kind of like Richard Branson but more vulgar he was a British entrepreneur he started Dennis publishing which launched Maxim magazine which launched a ton of great titles it's still like a 200 million dollar a year business he also launched micro warehouse which basically before Amazon was around it was like Amazon for software and it was a huge multi-billion dollar publicly-traded company so very successful entrepreneur close to a billionaire and so this is why I don't mind his book being titled so horribly it's called how to get rich and the reason why I don't mind it is cuz he was really successful he wasn't this like get-rich-quick guy and in that book he does a great job of talking about delegating and that book I use it as a reference book I read all the time about how to work with people that that's might go to the second one is I like the one minute manager just google it you'll find it it's a great book on managing the third thing is [ __ ] is the five dysfunctions of a team and so it's a great book that looks at what successful teams and people look like and what they don't look like more importantly and so you in order to oftentimes the best way to be good at something is you find out the bad ways of doing it and you just don't do that and the fourth thing is one of my investors is this guy named Tucker max Tucker max if you're a man and you're between the ages of probably 28 and 40 you probably know who Tucker max is he was famous because you know this blog called I hope they serve beer in hell and it was very controversial it was basically about his frat days and he was just this wild partier and drinker so he has a really controversial opinion but after he's in his 40s now so he's no longer a kid but he's really thoughtful at this point he's kind of turned his image around and he has a great blog where he a talked about firing himself and replacing himself as CEO and he it's maybe like a 12-part blog it's really good I would highly recommend everyone reading him and he's one of my investors and he's kind of an a mentor to me you know he him and I are kind of similar and that we try to be macho and or at least we started that way of wanting to be macho and show no weakness but he's actually done a really good job of being introspective and talking about his feelings a lot and he's done really good about talking about managing people he Tucker also has this great book on how to create this great document on how to manage a company or like create a culture and nuclear goal Tucker max culture document and you'll see it it's free okay the fourth and final skill set that I want people to take away from this rambling is how to influence people in fluent whether you I'll collect persuasion or influence it's really similar to similar to copywriting but this one's a little bit more psychological but it's similar and what most people don't realize is how to get people to do what you want them to do or how to influence them to think how you think and that sounds evil but that's not how I mean it I mean you could use it for evil ways I mean the stuff that you convince people to give to a non-profit or you convince people of certain morals or why something's bad and something's good it's the same stuff that you can use to get people to do a lot of really bad things and so this is definitely a scary skill set to learn but if you but the thing is is that people are like animals I mean in the same way that if you show a dog food you know what's that Pavle Pavlovian experiment where you you show dog food and you ring a bell so the dog starts associating the bell with the food and so whenever you ring the bell he starts slobbering people are the same way you can there's all these little tricks that you can do to get people to say yes to certain things or get them to buy into certain things more so for example if I'm a politician and I want to put a huge billboard in your front yard the likelihood that I of me just knocking on your door and asking to put this big billboard in yards in your yard the likelihood of you saying yes is pretty low but if I go in there and I say hey can I put this small little sticker on your window and you and they're likely gonna be saying yes so that is quite high now if I go back a week later and ask you to put this big billboard in your front yard the likelihood then that you're gonna say yes is a lot higher than had I not asked you to put that small sticker because you're already bought in and there's about eight or nine principles just like this of getting you to buy anything so another one's the rule reciprocity and so what that means is let's say that I I go out or let's say that you go out of town and you and I'm your neighbor and you ask me to check your mail for you when I'm gone and I say yeah sure no problem I'll check your mail you I've just done a favor for you now you owe me a favor and this is how humans work we all we work on favors and so now let's say next week I go hey look I wash I I checked your mail last week can I borrow you car for a day the likelihood that you're gonna say yes is actually a lot higher because I've already done you a favor and so the interesting thing about the rural reciprocity is that people pay it back disproportionately meaning I can do a really small favor for someone and then I can ask them to do a much bigger favor and shockingly so a lot of times they'll say yes and so there's about eight or nine of these principles that are incredibly effective for influencing people another example I've used this before I wanted to go I went and bought a motorcycle for a guy for three grand or he was asking three grand for and I thought it was I thought yeah I'd be willing to pay about 2,200 bucks for this and so I went and bought a can of coke I bought two of them and when I showed up to the place I opened up one I start drinking I go hey man you thirsty they you want a coke I was just down the street and I bought one and I thought maybe you'd want one too he opened it up he starts drinking it and I go cool motorcycle I'll give you twenty two he goes huh everyone's been offering me that I'm not gonna do it but you seem like a nice guy I'll do it fine and so I don't know if the coke was the reason but that's just an example of there's all these little tiny things that if you do them effectively they kind of add up to be pretty effective and so to learn these things there's this great book by Robert Chow Dini called influence maybe just google influence book you'll see it seems Robert Chow Dini read that it's it's that book changed my life and the second one which is pretty famous a lot of people know it's called how to win friends and influence people that book I think that book is one of the best-selling books of all time the best-selling non-fiction books of all time it was written in the 1930s 1920s it's still 100 percent effective so go and read those two books and I and I think that if you learn how to influence people it's really really really effective and it will shock you now like I was a nerd in high school and I liked women and so it was always just like any other kid I wanted to go meet girls I remember reading this book as a kid I was like I want them to like me how do I do that and so I read this book and I would apply this stuff to meet girls and it worked I am married to a an amazing woman and she was way out of my league when I first met her and she still is out of my league and I remember I use some of these things when I met her and it helped me kind of get my foot in the door it's so this stuff will help you make money and will help you start a company it'll help you balance your emotions or it will help you meet your your future spouse it's incredibly effective and so I'm gonna wrap this up those are the four skills that I wanted to talk about today this whole corona thing man it's it's weird and didn't I didn't want to talk about little business and schemes today but I wanted to talk about a few things that actually impact your life more than just more foundational things that can impact your life bigger than just a business and I don't know maybe maybe we'll have to call this like the there were recession proof skill set or something like that but that's it let me know how you feel about this I miss my best bud Sean my co-host these aren't here today but maybe we'll try to publish this the same day that I've recorded it what's today today Wednesday I don't even know it's Thursday today's Thursday it's 11:00 a.m. so tweet at me the same power let me know what you thought about this have you actually made it all the way through maybe we'll do more of them but uh good luck talk to you soon [Music] you [Music]

skill set or thing that I've learned in business that had pretty much shocked me I really only learned this in last year but looking back at it people have told me this forever which is there's a massive difference a massive gap in skills and a lot of people cross it but there's the gap exists of starting and managing so when you start businesses a lot of people think of Mark Zuckerberg and they're like this college kid started this thing he was 20 when he started it now he's only 30 or he could be 25 still and he manages 10,000 employees he hired the the best people in the world from

challenging and oftentimes the people who are creative and crazy enough to start companies a lot of times the skill sets they needed to start it are not only different but oftentimes opposite of what it takes to run when you start something you could look at a lot of spreadsheets and you could kind of like guess your way there but a lot of times not all the time but a lot of times starting

to people about stuff you're just gonna move quickly you're gonna execute you're gonna do it and it's a very creative process it's almost like creating a piece of art like maybe there's some equation that says like the perfect rectangle looks this way but every but a lot of times there's just Picasso who just says it this is interesting to me I'm doing this and sometimes it works that's kind of what's starting up businesses but managing a business is a lot different and so at our company I did a pretty good job of getting us to about a million a month in sales but towards the ends of that I was breaking I was doing horrible I was not good at managing it and I was very unhappy and so we hired one of my first hires was this guy named Adam who I want to I school with and he's now president of our company and he runs a lot of the day-to-day stuff so I kind of I kind of I'm like he's like Sam sandwiched in the middle whereas I'm really good at thinking of these really high level ideas and I'm also really good at going in at the very bottom and just being an individual contributor and creating interesting things I'm not always great at managing the day-to-day of what's going on it's I

bag and he loves carrying it and so through this process ice mentioned earlier we have hustle con speakers through this process I actually talked to a lot of people at our conferences and that was one of the major things that I used to ask people which is if you have a right-hand man or a right-hand woman do you have someone leading the day-to-day because I'm struggling with that how do you do that and there was typically two answers which was yeah I don't like it it's really hard and I could sense that these people I'm talking I mean I don't want to I don't want to call anyone out but go and just Google like hustle con speakers or something look at all the people who we've had at our events and those these are this is the type of person or those are the people who told me this which was they would say like I am horrible at managing this or often they would have liked one of their assistants or like a keeper or like a handler like with them and I would be like hey what's this person like as a manager and the answers were pretty consistently pretty bad this person's not good and so the the first answer was I'm not good at it I'm really struggling with it and a lot of times those people would say I wish I had someone who I could replace myself a CEO I I would hear that all the time and you I was shocked by it and the second answer that I got was yeah I hired a really good C oo or really good president and this is my right-hand woman or right-hand man and they run a lot of the day-to-day and it allows me to focus on what I do best and the people who said number two were way happier and oftentimes I think a lot more successful now there are these rare occasions where the person who started is just they're there they're also a great CEO or a great people manager that that

up with the idea and then he went away for three months and did a sailing competition so having these right hand people are is very important and a lot of times I feel like I'm the right hand person at this point but I think that it's really important to understand the difference between starting and managing I mean for a long time for a long time it was normal that they would calm gray hairs it was normal to get a gray haired leader to come in for a startup so these young people would come up with this idea for this great tech company and then this investor would say all right let's go guys CEO and that is not popular right now but I think it should be I think it's actually quite effective maybe not CEO but you definitely need this team of experienced people and and so the reason why I brought this up is it's a it's something that most people I found struggle with but there's not a lot of resources out there not a lot of people talking about it and so I think it's really important to learn this ultimately I'm the skills that comes out to delegating and there's four resources that I'll have that I've liked the first one I don't like the name of the book but it's very helpful it's by a guy named Fela Felix Dennis Felix Dennis he was this he's dead now he died a few years ago maybe ten years ago he was he's kind of like Richard Branson but more vulgar he was a British entrepreneur he started Denis publishing which launched Maxim magazine which launched a ton of great tiles it's still like a 200 million dollar year business he also launched micro warehouse which basically before Amazon was around it was like Amazon for software and it was a huge multi-billion dollar publicly-traded company so very successful entrepreneur close to a billionaire and so this is why I don't mind his book being titled so horribly it's called how to get rich and the reason why I don't mind is because he was really successful he wasn't this like get-rich-quick guy and in that book he does a great job of talking about delegating and that book I use it as a reference book I read all the time about how to work with people that that's might go to the second one is I like the one minute manager just google it you'll find it it's a great book on managing the third thing is is the five dysfunctions of a team and so it's a great book that looks at what successful teams and people look like and what they don't look like more importantly and so you in order to oftentimes the best way to be good at something is you find out the bad ways of doing it and you just don't do that and the fourth thing is one of my investors is this guy named Tucker max Tucker max if you're a man and you're between the ages of probably 28 and 40 you probably know who Tucker max is he was famous because you know this blog called I hope they serve beer in hell and it was very controversial it was basically about his frat days and he was just this wild partier and drinker so he has a really controversial opinion but after he's in his 40s now so he's no longer a kid but he's really thoughtful at this point he's kind of turned his image around and he has a great blog where he a talked about firing himself and replacing himself as CEO and he it's maybe like a 12-part blog it's really good I would highly recommend everyone reading him and he's one of my investors and he's kind of an a mentor to me you know he him and I are kind of similar and that we try to be macho and or at least we started that way of wanting to be macho and show no weakness but he's actually done a really good job of being introspective and talking about his feelings a lot and he's done really good about talking about managing people he Tucker also has this great book on how to create or this great document on how to manage a company or like create a culture and nuclear Google Tucker Mac sculpture document and you'll see it it's free [Music] you

the last thing that I do this is an exercise I thought I this was unique to me it's not so I used to do this years ago and I still do it to this day and it turns out there's a name to it it's Minh negative thought exercise I call it looking at the downside and so what I like to do in order to control my emotions because the thing we're controlling your emotions is you have to control the up and the down because when you start a company or when you start anything typically you have a fair bit of highs and the highs are probably as good feeling as you as you think or maybe even a little bit less than you think but the downs are typically way worse than you can imagine it's really hard to control the Downs because when you start anything controlling the down is the hard part and most people are shocked at how low you can feel when you're starting something even when things appear to be going well and so what I like to do is I like to think in my mind I'll close my eyes I do this a lot of times in the morning I'll do it at night as well as I close my eyes and I think what's the worst possible outcome right now and so it could be I get sick my family gets sick I'm gonna die and I visualize what what that feels like and if you do it for a long enough with your eyes closed after about five or ten minutes you can really feel what that feels like and then I do two things I say to myself all right that is the worst that can happen I just experienced it anything else that happens today it is only upside and it really makes you have a lot of gratitude and appreciate that that hasn't actually happened and the second thing that to do with this exercises and this relates particularly just starting a company or getting a job or moving somewhere else that's new and just starting your life is I try to protect the downside so for example if you are gonna start a company you can ask yourself well in order to start this business I need a little bit of cash and so you have to be very specific you have to say how much cash do I need well right now I'm spending $3,000 a month how much how many months saved do I need in order to feel good about this and so let's say we come up with the number six that means I need six times $3,000 I need $18,000 in savings I'm gonna go out and get that $18,000 okay I've got that $18,000 what else is the worst-case scenario here what's the downside here well I could spend all my money and my business goes under now do I want to be homeless no I'm not willing to accept being homeless okay so what's the net so I have to protect myself from being homeless how would I protect myself from being homeless well I would probably get a job driving uber because I have a car do I want to am I willing to accept that no I'm not willing to accept that or maybe you are and then that's the worst-case scenario but this one staged up could be maybe well I'll just get a white-collar job at a huge corporation and I'll just be a cog in their big wheel and their machine and it won't be fulfilling it won't be glamorous but it'll be a really good nine-to-five with benefits benefits so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and make friends with recruiters at those companies right now even though this isn't even coming close to half it's not happening yet and so at least at this point if something ever bad happens I know that I have a connection at IBM or I have a connection at Target headquarters or I have a connection at Intuit or just the biggest companies in the world and the likelihood that I can get a job there is relatively high am I willing to accept that that is the worst-case scenario yes I am willing to accept that and so what I do is I up the scale of like alright well where's the lowest that I'm willing to accept now I'm gonna lock that that that in as best as I can so now anything that happens above this I am happy and it is only upside and so that's what I like to do to control my emotions when it comes to taking risk [Music] you

okay the fourth and final skillset that I want people to take away from this rambling is how to influence people influence whether you I'll call it persuasion or influence it's really similar to similar to copywriting but this one's a little bit more psychological but it's similar and what most people don't realize is how to get people to do what you want them to do or how to influence them to think how you think and that sounds evil but that's not how I mean it I mean you could use it for evil ways I mean the stuff that you convince people to give to a non-profit or you convince people of certain morals or why something's bad and something's good it's the same stuff that you can use to get people to do a lot of really bad things and so this is definitely a scary skill set to learn but if you but the thing is is that people are like animals I mean in the same way that if you show a dog food you know what's that Pavle Pavlovian experiment where you you show dog food and you ring a bell so the dog starts associating the Bell with the food and so whenever you ring the bell he starts slobbering people are the same way you can there's all these little tricks that you can do to get people to say yes to certain things or get them to buy into certain things more so for example if I'm a politician and I want to put a huge billboard in your front yard the likelihood that I of me just knocking on your door and asking to put this big billboard in yards in your yard the likelihood of you saying yes is pretty low but if I go in there and I say hey can I put this small little sticker on your window and you and the likelihood of you saying yes so that is quite high now if I go back a week later and ask you to put this big billboard in your front yard the likelihood then that you're gonna say yes is a lot higher than had I not asked you to put that small sticker because you're already bought in and there's about eight or nine principles just like this of getting you to buy anything so another one's the rule reciprocity and so what that means is let's say that I I go out or let's say that you go out of town and you I'm your neighbor and you asked me to check your mail for you when I'm gone and I say yeah sure no problem I'll check your mail you I've just done a favor for you now you owe me a favor and this is how humans work we all we work on favors and so now let's say next week I go hey look I watch I I checked your mail last week can I borrow your car for a day the likelihood that you're gonna say yes is actually a lot higher because I've already done you a favor and so the interesting thing about the rule reciprocity is that people pay it back disproportionately meaning I can do a really small favor for someone and then I can ask them to do a much bigger favor and shockingly so a lot of times they'll say yes and so there's about eight or nine of these principles that are incredibly effective for influencing people another example I've used this before I wanted to go I went and bought a motorcycle for a guy for three grand or he was asked him three grand for and I thought it was I thought yeah I'd be willing to pay about 2,200 bucks for this and so I went and bought a can of coke I bought two of them and when I showed up to the place I opened up one I start drinking I go hey man uh you thirsty they you want a coke I was just down the street and I bought one and I thought maybe you don't want to he opened it up he starts drinking it and I go cool motorcycle I'll give you twenty two but he goes huh everyone's been offering me that I'm not gonna do it but you seem like a nice guy I'll do it fine and so I don't know if the coke was the reason but that's just an example of there's all these little tiny things that if you do them effectively they kind of add up to be pretty effective and so to learn these things there's this great book by Robert Chow Dini called influence if you just google influence book you'll see it seems Robert Chow Dini read that it's it's that book changed my life and the second one which is pretty famous a lot of people know it it's called how to win friends and influence people that book I think that book is one of the best-selling books of all time the best-selling non-fiction books of all time it was written in the 1930s 1920s it's still 100 percent effective so go and read those two books and I and I think that if you learn how to fluence people it's really really really effective and it will shock you now like I was a nerd in high school and I liked women and so I was always just like any other kid I wanted to go meet girls I remember reading this book as a kid I was like I want them to like me how do I do that and so I read this book and I would apply this stuff to meet girls and it worked I am married to an amazing woman and she was way out of my league when I first met her and she still is out of my league and I remember I use some of these things when I met her and it helped me kind of get my foot in the door it's so this stuff will help you make money and will help you start a company it will help you balance your emotions or it will help you meet your your future spouse it's incredibly effective and so [Music] you

you can do what I did which was very labor-intensive and very effective but it takes a lot of time and that's called copy work and so what I did was I got ahold of the hundred best sales letters of all time I don't know what makes it 100 best but it's just famous sales letters so and then in the 50s 60s 70s 80s and 90s before the internet really came around and it even happened after that but predominantly before that these salesmen would send these letters to people's homes and they would try to convince people to get interested in buying a vacuum or an encyclopedia or a pair of sunglasses and the it was typically the they were typically wrote the wives the the housewife would take out her checkbook and be like oh this is really interesting I need to buy this and she would write a check put it into the envelope and sale it back that's a lot of friction and so these people were so good at using words because it was so expensive to sell all these letters I had to be good they were so good at using their words that they had to that they convince these strangers to write a check and mail to him and so I found these hundred letters and if you google best sales letters of all time you're gonna find them and I would I spent probably six months where I would spend about two or three hours a day and when I was 22 years old I would write them all out by hand I would also do that with books oh the Great Gatsby Saturday Night Live live scripts I would do it with movie scripts just any piece of great writing I would do that with and when you do this it's kind of like how you learn an instrument the way that we teach people how to play music it's incredibly effective so if I hand you a guitar or a piano I don't say go ahead write a song I tell you copy the star-spangled banner' go play jingle bells go look at Jimi Hendrix go look at Led Zeppelin play all this all these copy all these other people steal their work for a little while and or whatever genre you're interested go and copy them exactly and in time you're gonna learn how to feel the texture you're gonna see the patterns that work best that works extremely well with writing and it's the same concept I call coppy work this is how a lot of people used to learn our school our schooling the way that we do it now it's changed over the last handful of decades but for a long time people used to do this Ben Franklin was a great writer and he said this is how he learned how to write and its really effective so it's called copy work the second thing that you can do and I'm biased Neville is my good friend but there's a guy named Neville Medora and I actually met him because I bought his course and I bought his course and then after I took his course I became friends with them and years later we became best friends and he was the best man at my wedding so I love Neville and so I'm biased but his course is what I took to learn about copyrighting he's he's got this course called copywriting course it's spelled with AK a copy with a k' and course with a k' I don't know it's always stands out it's a great course I don't know how much it cost right now it could cost a few hundred bucks or a hundred I don't even know but it's relatively affordable and I think if you don't like it he'll refund you his money your money but anyway it's a great course so it teaches a lot of this stuff it's worth it it's totally worth it and I actually think I used to promote this so much that if you go to copywriting course comm slash Sam I've got like a referral link and I think there's like a $50 off code or something you could use so if that interests you do that the third thing is this book called advertising secrets of the written word by Jo Sugarman it's a great book it costs $10 and I bet you if you google google it correctly you can find a free PDF of it online it's a great book that walks you through copywriting principles and why certain things work and why they don't and finally the last thing it's not a copywriting thing but it's a writing thing and it's a book by Stephen King called on writing and the first half of the book is it's it reads really fast it's only 250 pages maybe the first half it's all about his tools and tricks and his toolbox he calls it his tool kit or his toolbox for writing well and it's incredibly effective it's it he has got rules like don't use too many adverbs or keep your sentences short things like that it's incredibly effective it's a great book on writing the second half of the book is about his biography and it's really really fascinating so it's called on running by Stephen King so a second skill set that I wanted to go through copywriting I think that because I know how I would say I'm a pretty good copywriter I'm a B because I am a B copywriter until the day I die I will never be homeless I will always make money now verdicts still out if I'm gonna be very very wealthy but I will bet everything which I am betting everything by starting businesses and things like that that no matter what happens I will always be able to make a really good salary rather as an employee or selling someone else's products so I think that copywriting is incredibly effective it's it's just it's really useful for your life business and just living [Music]

the second skill that I think is incredibly important and this is maybe the number one or number two skill I think in terms of business I think it's the number one skill and so this skill is copywriting I think copywriting is the most important skill that you can have for business and one of the most important skills that you can have in life and here's why when you learn how to write well you learn how to think well you when you learn how to write clearly you weren't learn how to think clearly and copywriting is a particular type of writing but it's not just limited to writing copywriting is understanding how people think and how they feel and how to use the written word or a script or spoken word in order to sell a product or sell an idea basically how to use words to get people to do what you want them to do and the way that you do that is you have to understand what motivates them what makes them think what makes them work and so this can be applied to literally anything I have made tens of millions of dollars this way using copywriting but I've also met my wife this way I learned when I was when I was trying to meet her she was that way out of my league and so I used what I learned in copywriting to like get her attention and make her or at least try to make her interested in me copywriting copywriting is incredibly effective I've used it to get customers like as in people to buy stuff from us or for the hustle to get advertisers I've used it to get speakers to our events I've used it to recruit people I've used it to sell people on this interesting idea I have copywriting is incredibly important and it boils down to a bunch of really simple principles but the easiest one to remember for this conversation is ADA a ID a tension interest desire action for the majority of your copywriting life which for most of you it has nothing to do with getting a job it's just a good skill set to have in life attention interest desire action is the frame work that you need so when you write you line it up with attention can I get your attention interests can I tell you some facts that get you interested and get you to fall down the slippery slope because once I get you to start reading my work I can get you to keep buying into what I'm saying and it's really hard to get people to fall down that slope but interest by it specifically tell them very interesting facts and features about the story that you just started with your your action point or sorry your a tension point desires the second part so I'm gonna make you desire whatever I'm selling and I'm gonna get you to desire that by telling you things that you don't know and how this can benefit your life and then finally action I'm gonna tell you specifically how to get you to act and so here's an example that my friend Neville always uses uses that I love which is if I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna try and convince a 15 year old guy to drink more water I could say drink more water it's healthy for you or and a lot of these facts aren't necessarily true because I didn't research what water does for you but I very easily could use this premise for that I'm gonna say have you ever seen those guys with huge muscles at the gym carrying around gallons of water in their hand it's like they use those milk containers to carry water so that's how I get your attention you see they're doing that because if you drink if you drink a gallon of water a day the likelihood that your muscles will grow by 30% more than how do not drink water now the reason that happens and this is the desire part the yeah this is the desire part the reason that happens is because water has these molecules in them that helps oxygen travel through your blood and oxygen is needed to build up your muscles that's my desire part is I'm trying to show you how to build up your muscles and when that oxygen goes to your muscles they grow 30% faster so and this is the action part if you want to build big muscles and be healthier than before you need to drink about a gallon of water a day per hundred pounds of body weight so that action part I specifically explained how to do that now that was just a silly example I don't none of that shit's true but you get the point this ADA it works wonderfully and I always think that I always tell people you got to learn copywriting and there's a few great ways to learn it [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
the Sequoia memo okay did you read this no I avoided it on purpose thanks denial the best the best approach yeah I we haven't raised venture capital so it's a little bit different so Sequoia is one of the biggest venture capital firms here in Silicon Valley they are famous for back in 2008 I want to say they released this presentation called our IP good times and they basically they called an emergency meeting of all their portfolio companies they invited them to this dinner locked him in a room put this presentation up on the screen that was basically like hey the good times we've all been experiencing are about to end here's why most of you entrepreneurs you have not been a part of these cycles we've been investors through the dot-com boom and the bust and then this new boom and this was right before the sort of financial crisis of 2008 and they told him look money is about to become hard to come by we are going to have a giant financial crisis it will have ripple down effects to you guys to your customers to your clients to your investors and so you need to start tightening up anything you're wasting money on you need to stop wasting it anything if you haven't raised money if you don't have 12 months in the bank you need to go raise money right now to sort of be able to endure a downturn and they just released another one which is the new Sequoia memo so that was 2008 now they released a new one and they basically like look this coronavirus stuff is a this is a once in a hundred year virus and there's this it happened in China which is like when you shock China you shock the global supply chain and also now that travel is gonna stop a whole bunch of business is gonna come to a halt but stock markets gonna go into a panic because we've been in a 10-year bull run and that's about to sort of end anyways so they told them the same thing change your spending habits you need to tighten up raise money if you if you have an offer out there take it don't worry about valuation just taking get the money in the bank and and you know you need to go into a sort of survival mode you need to change gears and that's what just came out which i think is very interesting have you made any adjustments to your business not yet but I live like this anyway I'm kind of a cockroach in the first place yeah and I actually think that me living this way has kind of been a consequence it has been is hurt me more than it's helped me actually I think it made it so I wouldn't spend enough money which if you have a machine that turns a dollar into more than one dollar dump that dump the truck your money truck like what ad spend or what do you mean yeah I mean look if you have a funnel where you are a product where if you just spend more on marketing or spend more on engineers or spend more on content creators and it turns that new customer into more than what you acquired them for right then if anyone had a little machine that turned one dollar into one dollar one penny the name of the game is throw as much money on into that machine as you possibly can as fast as you can and I've had those machines and I didn't capitalize on it and so I've lived this way all the time and I think it's actually hurt me a lot but in times like these bring it on yeah you don't need to adjust we haven't changed how we've done things just because we're always tight yeah and your company's in a good position to like just now before this we were looking at a company's P&L and it was like cash in the bank 220 grand or something like that it's like do sure a couple months away from insolvency you know if that is the case whereas you guys are in a much better position yes I do I am I do have a little fear I don't know how I feel about this Corona thing it when it means what it means for business I do think that I'm on the side of I think it's bad but I don't think it will be as bad as I think or as I originally thought right I I guess I just have faith I have a lot of blind faith that it will work out [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
manzil so this is cool this is one of my favorite reasons to do the podcast is that interesting people just reach out and tell me about their business so manzil is this so this guy sam reached out he listens the podcast what's his last name Sam and so he was like hey I got this business you know would love some help with it or just would love to chat and so I said okay let's chat so I get on the phone and I end up blown away by what these guys are doing so they teach me about something I've never heard of and is now very finite very very fascinating to me so what they do is manzil does Islamic financing what's that mean yeah we talked about not on the podcast but we talked about it offline cuz I was pretty interested in it so Henry do you know what Islamic financing is if you didn't know lead gen I don't think you'll go this way so are you Muslim I'm not I'm Hindu well I'm neither but like my my family is Hindu so I didn't know about this but basically in the Muslim faith there's actually a sort of the advice is against traditional loans so interest which is known as like RIBA I think in the in in their faith is frowned upon in these so a traditional mortgage where you go to the bank you have your down payment you take out a loan and you're paying interest is actually not compliant with with their with their faith in their law and which is actually common and a lot of other different religions is that true yeah so i'm catholic christian and was raised that way and there's definitely rules regarding handling money and interests and things like that yeah and i think the fundamental basis i'm gonna kind of butcher this so I apologize but I'm just trying to explain as best as I understand it so so apparently your money you sort of fiat currency which is just not pegged in anything it's just a made-up concept the the belief system is that money has no value inherent value in itself and so you should not be charged interest for borrowing money which is this sort of abstract so they have loans or they have sort of agreements which can work as long as both sides are taking shared risk and getting sort of shared shared upside shared return in some way so there's damn Islamic I believe so yeah and his partner Mohammed is also so they were explaining to me that hey there's this big thing called examine financing and there's these like challenger banks since if you ever heard the word challenger bank check this out it's pretty pretty cool we know that banking has been around forever these big Bank brands that are you know in every country there's there's big banks that are worth billions of dollars and recently over the last let's say five to seven years there's these things called challenger banks or neo banks they're called and so in Brazil there's a bank called new bank and you bank and brand new bank is worth 10 billion dollars it's one of those valuable startups in Brazil in the UK there's challenger banks oh my god I'm gonna forget that but this challenger just means a new one that's a start-up bank yeah and they're they offer different things so what these guys did was better digital access so mobile apps quicker ability to get sort of credit cards and debit cards spun up and so there's you know there's a couple of them that are huge now a few different multi-billion dollar startups done this well these guys have done is they've done this for a faith-based bank which is basically saying there's a set of customers out there in this case Muslims who are not being served well why the generic banks and we can make a bank that serves them better and the way we're gonna do it is you want to take a mortgage out you can either take a sort of mortgage out to a traditional mortgage which is not compliant or you can take one out that's compliant with your faith we've come up with a mechanism that is blessed by sort of the the village elders you know they're sort of leaders in the community that says yes this is you know I think sharni allows what's called seeing its compliant which our new law and then on the other side this is this will this works as a mortgage you can actually buy your home and so these guys have this have this concept and in other countries this is apparently really big so in Africa Indonesia places where the Muslim population is the dominant population they've already solved this problem but in places like US Canada where it's just a minority of the population is is Muslim they don't have these banks yet so I love this startup idea because how are they doing so how they're doing so there they spent a lot of time making sure that they can actually get it to be compliant and actually get the financial mechanism to work that took him a while over a year maybe two years now they've gotten that to work and they have basically they have two sides of a marketplace on one side they have people who are investors because you know if you're gonna issue mortgages their average mortgages like $500,000 so it takes a lot of capital to start this business they don't want to be the one they don't want to go raise a billion dollars and then start issuing these loans they want on one side to have investors who will put in the capital to fund these loans and on the other side they want to have the borrow EES who are trying to buy a home who can pull from this pool of you know sort of halal financing you know this this financing that's compliant and so they have ten million dollars committed on the on the investor side 1.2 million in their bank 10 million total and then and they're just every week they're trying to close more of those nice I think which is a small amount but this is like just inbound interest this is not like they've never really done anything yet but 10 million will let you let you do if you just do half a million dollar loans that means they can do whatever 20 mortgage is right now and every mortgage has a certain value so it's about worth about I don't know 20 K a year to them is that mortgage just in their fee that they get on top of it and so and on the other side they have all these applicants I think you know about a thousand applicants and these are what they call super prime applicants because these are people who are doctors lawyers they have good jobs they they have the money they have the means to afford their homes they're just looking for a solution that doesn't force them to compromise their faith so I really like this business little there's a working model in the UK there's a working model in in Africa there's working model into the Indonesia there's nothing in Canada where these guys are and there's nothing really in the US where in America I think there's look this up I think there's like a couple million only to two million I want to say roughly that's pretty interesting I like that I think that there's a bunch of weird rules around banking I mean they're not weird they should be there but and so starting a starting a bank I think is it's so nearly impossible it's very difficult so what all the Neo banks do all the charter banks do not in real banks they're not real banks they sit on top of BBVA are they on top of these other banks and they're just the the consumer facing layer but the banking happens with their underlying partner and it's sort of like the lead gen model that you're talking about they go to these banks say hey I can get you a whole bunch more customers I'm gonna spend all the money during the marketing they'll be banking with you but we own this sort of relationship yeah and that's actually pretty common I use this thing my debit card is simple rightful I've heard of it yeah this is my debit card it's pretty cool I like it because the customer service I can just text and they're like you see these like young guys in Portland and they they're easy to chat with and they answer 24 hours a day they were acquired for a hundred million dollars and I was like who's like a freaking Bank that's it yeah and I did not a bank yeah and it was what's called BBVA yeah that's who they use BBVA Compass I think it's exactly they're under there and there's a few that are underneath all these now the very first there's a now one of the challenger banks got their very first banking charter banking license which is very rare if I forget their name but they just announced a couple weeks or last two weeks that sort of so now it's very interesting now once that seal broke because it was so hard to apply for this yeah I think when they all want it Robin Hood wants their license Breck's wants their license it's just very hard for them to get I think you need 5 / 10 % in reserve yeah you need a certain amount that's not it's just that there's no incentive for the government to give these out they're like you you kind of highfalutin you know tech startups do I really want to give this to you you've only been around for so long I don't know if they I have the trust in you so now the seals broke and the first one got it we'll see what what that means but what I like about these guys is they're not a bank they're not taking your deposits they're just doing loan issuance so on one side they have the reserve cap they're their investment fund but they're using other people's money OPM on one side yeah other people's money to make the loans and they're the broker and they take one to two percent at the transaction fee and people are willing to pay a premium to have halal financing just like people willing to pay a premium for halal meat or for vegan they're kosher meat you know whatever like right people are willing to pay a premium for things that are compliant with their faith I think this could be big and you wants interesting I think that they've had a hard time raising money from traditional VCS because this is understand hard to understand yeah you have to like you know most VCS are old white guys and you know it's the sort of cliche and you know I know they do look into it I think that there's now there's the natural challenges of any high aspiration startup they have those they have the problems that any any started but that's really ambitious but then they also have the problem of like first they need to educate you about this problem like you saw how I stumbled through this explanation and I talked to these guys for an hour you know and that's where I am after an hour of really trying to understand it but you and you read this by FERC on your best so I ran her yeah I ran it by him I introduced them yesterday I said hey FERC round understands this he's Muslim he's an investor he's a technologist and he's an entrepreneur if he doesn't like this I don't like this see what did he say and so he so he's like I've looked into this he's like a lot of my friends really wanted this I tried to look at what options are available in the u.s. they suck they're really super high premiums is he practicing yeah like you know to an extent yeah why I want to know is do really like like he doesn't pray five times a day but he doesn't eat pork right so he's like culturally he drinks but like his dad runs the mosque in San Jose and you know it's like culture who aren't incredibly devout are into this if he had the option he would prefer how Lal financing over not if it was convenient and he's like the problem with all the existing options they're not convenient they're not easy to use and they're very high premiums he's like if these guys did it conveniently I think this could be big so he's gonna talk to him we'll see like I'm not a practicing anymore are you guys Catholic you're Catholic for sure right do you eat meat on Friday I'm let me to I went to an all-boys Catholic high school I don't practice anymore but that's another thing I don't eat meat during Lent on Fridays or I try not to so it's kind of it sounds like that's what it's kind of like where it's like people it's a spectrum it's a you prefer it but not yeah you preferred especially if it's convenient for you you you you know the way Henry just said that a lot of guilt they're like yeah I should but I don't so there's you know if you could make it where people do what they want to do without lifting a finger then they'll do it you know that's great that's pretty cool I like that I like that thing or I like that angle of finding because I don't know anything about Muslim culture I don't know anything about Hindu culture which is you where you're from you I don't know you probably don't know too much about Catholics yeah it's kind of an interesting way to like look at how other religions do things right another thing that we should talk about not today because I don't think we know what we're talking about we definitely don't yet is building things on of banks I think that's super interesting but what do you mean by that so like what simple did and like what the what's the name of this company man's oh man spell it ma n zi l Manzel okay kind of like what manzil did a building a building a front end on top of someone else's back end right which is the bank I think that that's really interesting simple calm it's my card I didn't know they did this at first this is kind of what dropshipping is so where you build the layer that says I'm gonna get the customer to a landing page and they buy yeah but it's just gonna place an order with this other manufacturer and they'll ship it directly to the super effective I like that with banks because like simple they did this I mean it's it's a little different the card is all white and expanding like looking yeah and their app is really good and so it's kind of interesting I think this is kind of what Breck's is doing is totally weird they're layered on top of MasterCard I love these things I really like that [Music] you

#thehustle #curlyhair

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
okay let's start with an idea um curly girl hair so you guys in trends did a post about napped the natural hair movement yeah that's a big big thing and [Music] mixed race mixed race and black women and so talk a little bit about what was in the report and then I'll tell you sort of what I've seen separate from that it sounds like you're more interested in that you tell me what okay alright so so I'll start with so my sister-in-law got has super curly hair and I've never seen Shawn he's Indian I'm Indian and she's Indian and she's got super curly hair and curly hair it takes a lot of maintenance right like gets humid boom it's frizzy and you have like there's an episode of Friends where Monica's hair is like an afro that that happens or it's flat or you want to straighten it or whatever it's a lot of maintenance of curly hair and so she was telling me she's like yeah I downloaded this like I joined this thing I bought this PDF that's called the curly girl guide or something like that and it's his method to fly taming your hair and getting because I told her was like your hair looks great nowadays it's like what do you been doing and I just thought she would say like oh I use this other product she's like no there's like a 12 step process every time anybody with curly hair cuz my man anywhere else so my wife if you're I guess see there's my wife's black she's halfway he's also not here even if you're watching yeah so he's half white half black and she buys a lot of this stuff as well right and so like there's a whole thing of like you know when you go to sleep you need to wrap your hair in a certain way to sort of like whatever the oils blah blah and so then and like some basics that you just don't do so like she you know she had curly her whole life but didn't know oh I'm not supposed to use shampoo in the same way that most people use shampoo and so she was telling me about some of these differences anyways opportunity I was like I like these businesses where you could put out content and information that just helps people and and then sort of on the back end sell the kit that's like oh by the way like if you just want to push a button and get the solution I have the kit that has all the [ __ ] you need because she spent hours researching all the different products that like what is the best version of this oil I'm supposed to have what is the best version the shampoo for me and so anyways I think there's an opportunity to do this curly girl hair kit because there's a huge number of women that have curly hair the spend is in a multi billions per year in the US for how this gets treated and there is this natural hair movement where it's less about doing these really damaging things like permanently straightening your hair or you know weaves and whatnot like now there's a sort of a natural hair movement and so people need content like education plus the tools this sort of the hair care kit to take care of the hair okay I love that Henry can you give me a favor on a new tab type in reddit curly hair so there's a whole subreddit one of the ways I like to look at validation and ideas for different companies is I like to look at the engagement and size of a particular subreddit how many subscribers does the subreddit have I can't read that from here use that use that mic you got Henry what are you doing that's pretty good I think actually for a curly hair and in particularly because reddit is mostly men right and this is a woman's focused curly hair subreddit with exactly so great way to sort of validate the demand and the community aspect to this where people are sharing information recommending products to each other the other side of this is it photographs great so you know before and after I believe is the best ad that you can do before which is a photo after which is a better photo and you don't even need to show your product you just need to show whatever I took gave me this outcome I was here now I'm there so my wife loves this subreddit okay so here's further validation okay so particularly so I think that the angle here is you have to go at Missa tee or race-specific yeah so whether it's Indian I have no idea if Asian women suffer from this but if they do go do that I know from firsthand experience that mixed race women or whether they're white and black or any other combination suffer from this as well right and further validation is Fenty Rihanna has that brand that sold to the Louie Vuitton company or was it called El LVMH LVMH they and you could read about the deal I think it was valued at 800 million dollars and her a lot of her thing is towards yeah mixed races and then another idea here and everyone knows about this woman but Kayla it's new it seems this thing it's it's yes what's her app this is your wife doesn't why do I have does it yeah I sound like an idiot cuz I'm a guy and I don't pay attention yeah this whole segment is like Bros trying to talk about you know products they don't understand but I'm fascinated I'm interested I'm trying and everyone loves to try so Kayla's thing I heard that's a hundred million dollar of your company it is the fitness app itself that's like crazy and it was just built off her Instagram following so that's crazy i management started with she started with the same thing beach but the bikini body guide I think was her content that she just put out yeah and then was PDF and a PDF have got circulated everywhere and basically she allowed there like paid PDF to get bootlegged and just shared everywhere and what that did was it just gave her tons of awareness tons of marketing and and then she launched the app which you couldn't bootleg and you had to pay for and then BOOM and the most interesting part about her thing was she so she's like mainstream popular and typically when things are mainstream popular maybe sometimes like people who think they're cool can think it's kind of lame and Sarah's a Ivy league-educated New Yorker and she was like oh I love this PDF right so she has access to all types of interesting things and she still used it and I and I thought that was amazing that people really respected and liked it yeah she comes across very well if you've ever seen her content she's not like she's not hateable like I know that's cool oh and last thing diva curl there have you heard of diva curl bat no another mixed race shampoo maybe it's for black women but or maybe I don't know what the I figured if it's black women or mixed race woman that's what we use for shampoo and it was quiet for acquired for a quarter of a billion nice and there's some things on the opposite side like Tristan Walker who was I think either the co-founder or first employee of Foursquare left to start his own a frontier african-american men's skin care product company Walker brands Walker brands where it was like you know shaving stuff because you know the hair is different its course it's gonna the traditional shaving gear was causing problems and didn't work out went under and that kind of brings me to I don't know why it went under exactly I don't know if it was like just raise too much money and [ __ ] everything up [Music]

so I've been on the other side of the so so when we were doing our idea lab I worked this guy Michael birch Michael birch was is known as if you just google he's like one of the top growth guys in the world he sort of was doing an invented viral marketing before viral marketing was a word he did it because he didn't have money back in the day so he built one of the first address book importers where for this company called birthday alarm he had he was like and I think he did it before that at a Marinis company I forget what that was called birth homes before that so so berkland was the first one where he was like hey I want people to send this to their friends what if I just imported all the addresses from their hotmail and then I made it easy push this button to send it and he's like he literally told me at his house he was like I thought that ten days later like I thought there's no way they let this go for more than ten days and he's like it's now been 15 years and this thing still works and he's like so he was working on viral marketing cuz he just didn't have a budget so he's like I gotta use my customers to get me more customers and to explain it you didn't explain it totally clear but someone signs up for your thing it says do you want to invite your friends here's your gmail contacts click select all and send an email to all of them and so in this case for birthday alarm it was I make a calendar where I'm all in vite you I'll say hey say I'm can you add your birthday to my calendar I don't want to forget your birthday this is before Facebook cases by the way and so you would add your birthday to my calendar and they would hasten it would say hey Sam don't you want to remember Shawn's birthday that'd be nice like reciprocate and you bill yeah sure and then he would say hey Sam you got one birthday on the calendar but you surely got more friends than one so why don't you invite some other friends here let me make it easy for you would you like to import all your friends from hotmail and you're like yes and then and he added one thing at a time to make it more viral so he would add a prefilled message he's like oh there people are stopping because I can't think of what to say right so here's a pre filled message that I know works and then I just say sent and so then he got this thing super viral so you know birthday alarm grew to 50 million members with zero paid marketing 50 million and and then he's done this again and again since then with the social network Bebo and others so when I worked with them the name of the game was viral growth and so we did a charity campaign they're trying to raise money for charity water well we made a story a website that was just telling a story of this boy jean bosco with no water and then we said can we get this to go viral and so we did the same thing import import emails get people to send the story to their friends and raise money for the cause and we got it to go viral so I've literally been Bennett we're like nothing nothing nothing you'd come into work nothing no growth no growth no growth and you would just tweak the right thing and then all of a sudden that you know between overnight something would have double and the next morning it doubled again next morning double began and I remember it just going from zero to five million people signing up for this charity thing within like you know two weeks it was insane and so I've seen viral growth and how counterintuitive it is like you don't think you know we will yesterday we had 4,000 people so today we're gonna have I don't know 5,000 6,000 it's like no you're gonna have 16,000 then you have 32,000 and there's gonna you know it's gonna go up to the millions within a few days and so I've seen viral growth when you're talking about in the good sense from a product perspective now it's viral growth of an actual [ __ ] virus and so and it you can see actually in the u.s. somebody did a great graph where they mapped Italy where everything is on lockdown because Italy is started spreading like crazy and they showed Italy day one us day one Italy day two the u.s. day two number of cases and the bar graphs are like identical and the thing is we're just in like whatever day six and you can see by day 21 where this thing gets to if you don't like lock everything down right away so I am very fearful because I've seen viral growth I've seen viral spread and I know that it doesn't work the way I breaks our brains our brains think things go linearly but this goes exponentially and it's really hard to just comprehend an exponential spread and to take this story a different way than coronavirus which is that stuff that you're describing that Michael purchasing you can actually still get all these two cool plugins that auto automatically like allow people to share a pre-populated message to all their gmail contacts we use it and people still share yeah and the math works out where you know because you would think I would never do that wouldn't even all my content we had a lot of people doing it but people do it and what happens is you know 1% or less will do it but you look at the math one some people do it on an average they have 326 contacts so for every hundred people that come in you get three hundred twenty six people blasted out it doesn't work as good as that time because the email open rates are much higher than yeah but now people are like I don't know I never talked to Sam so if he's sending me this this is junk this is spam now people filter it but in certain countries it works like we were growing like we could do this like clockwork in India in India people still open it like they did in the US ten years ago and they forward even higher rates I don't care look forward everything everybody and so India Turkey all these little countries where we would see this crazy growth that you couldn't get in the US and or UK anymore they kind of suck because the monetary value in you know the value per user is lower there but it does still feel good to get like it definitely works and people are shocked by that yeah we did one through SMS I remember and over the weekend and went viral and like you know during the week Monday through Friday everything looked fine is growing but like not at a crazy pace we didn't realize the viral coefficient was 2 and so over the weekend it took off and started compounding on a big number and we racked up 120,000 an SMS 130,000 dollar bill and SMS is going through Kazakhstan I was like we don't even know we're growing we're gonna grow in Kazakhstan and it went crazy and turns out texting in Kazakhstan is super expensive and so $120,000 in two days we had to pay off that's crazy [Music] you

you know there's probably like ten blog posts that matter the most if you're gonna do a start-up one of them is the Paul Graham essay do things that don't scale where he's talking about with Airbnb early on and if you're kind of in the startup world just fast forward 30 seconds but if you're not you like the story if you haven't heard it so Airbnb is in Y Combinator they're struggling Airbnb he's not really working they have like 20 customers or something low and they go into programs office he's the advisor from Y Combinator and he's like okay so tell me how it's going and they're like well you know it's small and really growing he's like okay but tell me what have you learned from your customers you've been out there what you learn and they're like well you know most of our customer customers are in New York and they're putting their apartments up he's like they're in New York yeah like most your customers in New York yeah he's like what are you doing here like go to New York you need to go to New York now and like why are you in San Francisco if your customers are in New York so he sent him over there and what they did which is something that nobody else was doing was if you ever saw an apartment listing before the photos look like [ __ ] because it would be somebody on their crappy mobile phone at that time taking a photo of a dirty apartment and listing it for rent and so it was like the worst sales pitch and so they started themselves going in they said hey can we send up they would tell their customers hey we want to do professional photos of your place it increases bookings by 40% are you open to that and then they would show up as the professional photographer and be like hey by the way I'm the founder and they would take photos and the Airbnb listing started to look great and everyone told them this won't scale and they also thought this won't scale and to an extent it did because even now today there's a sort of fleet of photographers that will come and take photos of your place to list it because it was just that important and they found a way to make it scale I think that's a great story another thing that shocks people is I think even if you have hundreds of thousands of users may be as high as millions you could really I've done this with us I will just call and talk I only need to talk to about 10 people right and I can see the pattern that represents tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people right I could you could just tell you it's so like what you could do is a be test [ __ ] and wait if you're just starting you're not gonna it's not gonna be significant and that could work fine if just call 10 people you really get the information right totally I was talking to Emmett so Emmett's the CEO of twitch where I'm working and what you know being at a big company has all these different weird things that aren't really related to my core interests which is startups so I asked him it all the time just tell me about the early days and so I asked him I said hey when you guys were pivoting from justin.tv to twitch was that obvious he's like no dude at justin.tv like less than two percent of the watch time was on video games it wasn't obvious that this was the thing to do he's like I just liked it and I thought there was an option and he goes and then I talked to a bunch of customers and I said do you have your notes from that and he's like yeah I do and so he sent me his notes from the initial conversations he had with all these streamers all these customers and we published this no no probably not but I was reading through them and it was fascinating so first was just like first lesson was just go ask the founder CEO about the early days I bet you they have a bunch of resources that are awesome well he sent me the old pitch decks and stuff like that I think I sent you one slide which was my favorite slide the title of the slide because he was a progress update for their early investors yeah and it just said we're like a bulldozer in a field full of flowers and he's just there was a list of all the [ __ ] that got done that month I was like this attitude like if I said that today at 2:00 which it would be like what is this maniac saying like why is your slide so aggressive but that's how they were early on so then he had all these notes of his customer conversations and he always tells everybody had to it she's like go talk to people by the 6th conversation you'll hear the same thing over and over again it takes six phone calls basically to figure out the pattern and by the sixth one you'll know and you'll you won't even want to do 50 conversations you'll be like alright I can predict what this person's to get us a before they even say it after six that's awesome I think we've got ourselves another clip clip it what do you want to first of all share that deck with me again and also African ask him if we could make that pump yeah I will ask him actually cuz it's pretty cool what do you want to get what do you want to do the one thing I can share out of that by the way he asked three questions I said you know oh customer interviews is there a whole skill set to learn he goes no dude I had three questions I said what do you like about your current platform what do you dislike about your current platform and what will it take to get you to switch to twitch and that's what he asks every single customer and then he just heard the common things and he would build it and go back to me said you told me this is what it would take for you to switch two weeks later here it is are you ready and then sometimes are like no still using okay cool what's next we're just like you buried that three questions that's badass just to wrap that up if you want to learn about this stuff I think the best book I've ever read on this is called the mom test yeah I love that a jack recommended me that book yep it's fantastic it's the best tiny book to like the long blog post 50 pages in terms of your business life might change yeah a mom test [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
boom we're here coronavirus and all yeah the streets of San Francisco are empty you could have walked down in the middle of street and would've been fine yeah and we're in this studio and Sam's just coughing up a storm which is got me concerned salaries this may be my last podcast you don't know catch and kill you so this is for all the students of Stanford Harvard Syracuse that have been shut down there at home certainly just listening to the podcast in quarantine this is for you this one goes out to you yeah good luck all right what I want to talk about we got a bunch of words on the screen they all look interesting where do you wanna start pick one can we talk about I want to do things before we jump in yeah are we doing a plug of Jordan Harbinger podcast yeah but I think we want to talk to him about it right like we want him to be talking to us as the plug okay so we're gonna be promoting his podcasts and he will be doing it to us yeah scratch our back we scratch his back right so if you hear a plug from him going listen to his podcast he's actually helping us a ton and the second thing is I read every review for the podcast we have 600 reviews maybe 794 just check this more seven 800 800 they're all five stars except for like five yeah and that's cool I like reading the positive reviews and those five were from early on when you weren't even on the pod so really I take those I take those out no they were 2.5 stars and I like listening to negative feedback and I don't like following all of it but some of it the first was that the sound for the guests were bad a Greek fare we will listen to that in the second one and I hate this I don't hate it in that it bothers me but I just don't like I don't think it's bad feedback which is we were called Bros right and I don't really care about that because what's that mean how is that supposed to be like people use that as an insult I don't understand why that's an insult yeah it's an insult for sure to be clear it used to not be an insult but being called a bro is an insult and yeah I don't know is it the way we talk is what we talk about is it or we using the wrong words I'm not exactly sure yeah I don't take offense to that even though people mean it to be offensive so I don't care if people say that yeah I'm not a bro I'm a lover not a fighter you know I I got multiple angles I got gear what does the pro mean I don't know Henry what's a bro we need the gig you gotta go into the mic come on bro maybe we have to replace Henry with a female and then we'll get more credit for not being just a bro down no I don't care about being called a bro so then it's a compliment yeah kind of I don't know whatever I'm not gonna be liked I'm just trying to be me no well here's what I'm trying to do I'm trying to be B and I'm trying to create stuff that people want and if predominantly people think it's brony but they love it I'm okay with that yeah like for example I listen to the gel Rogan podcast Joe Rogan talks about his Carnivale call meat diet you know working out UFC fighting cage fighting hunting you know these are the cars like these are his topics because that's what he's genuinely interested in I like talks about it talks about other things to everything else and I like would people I like listening to stuff where people are interesting and they're interested in certain stuff and so for me the test with this podcast is what I want to listen to this and so the episode I just sort of think would I be interested listen to that podcast and if it's appealing to me that I'm sure it's appealing to other people it's not gonna be appealing to everybody for sure and then the last bit of negative feedback we got which is we focus too much on the San Francisco Silicon Valley scene and I'm from Missouri by way of Tennessee you're from everywhere including Colorado I love San Francisco and I hate it at the same time I'll be the first to make fun of it but also I love all types of cool [ __ ] going on throughout the country so yeah that's probably fair it's interesting let's talk about it in fact I actually think personally I think we skew a little too far in the kind of like low tech ideas and I think there's a lot of interesting high tech ideas that don't require a high tech entrepreneur for example I don't know how to code but I've started to that tech startups in Silicon Valley taking venture capital money and worked with an engineering team where I'm the only guy in the room who doesn't know anything about engineering you can do that so I actually think that there's plenty of cool stuff that we're not talking about that I'm gonna be bringing more of so if you don't like the Silicon Valley stuff I'm sorry I'm gonna try to bring more interesting technology to the table because there's a lot of it out there I feel like we haven't been talking about it as much the way that I describe San Francisco and Silicon Valley is to me it's kind of like Hollywood but it's only only if you're trying to make like a like a big blockbuster hit right um I believe that you can make those anywhere it might be a little bit more helpful if you are physically in Hollywood because you not because the chances are necessarily higher but because you'll be around other people who have similar once and dreams and your baseline becomes a certain thing for sure but you can certainly make it from anywhere absolutely it's been proven all right let's talk about some of these things um let's start with I'll start with the Sequoia memo okay did you read this no I avoided it on purpose Thanks denial the best the best approach yeah I we haven't raised venture capital so it's a little bit different so Sequoia is one of the biggest venture capital firms here in Silicon Valley they are famous for back in 2008 I want to say they released this presentation called our IP good times and they basically they called an emergency meeting of all their portfolio companies they invited them to this dinner locked him in a room put this presentation up on the screen that was basically like hey the good times we've all been experiencing are about to end here's why most of you entrepreneurs you have not been a part of these cycles we've been investors through the dot-com boom and the bust and then this new boom and this was right before the sort of financial crisis of 2008 and they told them look money is about to become hard to come by we are going to have a giant financial crisis it will have ripple down effects to you guys to your customers to your clients to your investors and so you need to start tightening up anything you're wasting money on you need to stop wasting it anything if you haven't raised money if you don't have twelve months in the bank you need to go raise money right now to sort of be able to endure a downturn and they just released another one which is the new Sequoia memo so that was 2008 now they released a new one and they basically like look this coronavirus stuff is a this is a once in a hundred year virus and there's this it's happened in China which is like when you shocked China you shocked the global supply chain and also now that travel is gonna stop a whole bunch of business is gonna come to a halt that stock markets gonna go into a panic because we've been in a ten-year bull run and that's about to sort of end anyways so they told them the same thing change your spending habits you need to tighten up raise money if you if you have an offer out there take it don't worry about valuation just take and get the money in the bank and and you know you need to go into a sort of survival mode you need to change gears and that's what just came out which i think is very interesting have you made any adjustments to your business not yet but I live like this anyway I'm kind of a cockroach in the first place yeah and I actually think that me living this way has kind of been a consequence it has been is hurt me more than it's helped me actually I think it made it so I wouldn't spend enough money which if you have a machine that turns a dollar into more than one dollar dump that dump the truck your money truck like what ad spend or what do you mean yeah I mean look if you have a funnel where you are a product where if you just spend more on marketing or spend more on engineers or spend more on content creators and it turns that new customer into more than what you acquired them for right then if anyone had a little machine that turned one dollar into one dollar one penny the name of the game is throw as much money on into that machine as you possibly can as fast as you can and I've had those machines and I didn't capitalize on it and so I've lived this way all the time and I think it actually hurt me a lot but in times like these bring it on yeah you don't need to adjust we haven't changed how we've done things just because we're always tight yeah and your company's in a good position to like just now before this we were looking at a company's P&L and it was like cash in the bank 220 grand or something like that psyche - sure a couple months away from insolvency you know if that is the case whereas you guys are in a much better position yes I do I am I do have a little fear I don't know how I feel about this Corona thing when it means what it means for business I do think that I'm on the side of I think it's bad but I don't think it will be as bad as I think or as I originally thought right I I guess I just have faith I have a lot of blind faith that it will work out which so I've been on the other side of the so so when we were doing our idea lab I work to this guy Michael birch Michael birch was is known as if you just google he's like one of the top growth guys in the world he sort of was doing an invented viral marketing before viral marketing was a word he did it because he didn't have money back in the day so he built one of the first address book importers where for this company called birthday alarm he had he was like and I think he did it before that at a Marinis company I forget what that was called Birkin was before that so so Berthillon was the first one where he was like hey I want people to send this to their friends what if I just imported all the addresses from their hotmail and then I made it easy push this button to send it and he's like he literally told me at his house he was like I thought that ten days later like I thought there's no way they let this go for more than ten days and he's like it's now been 15 years and this thing still works and he's like so he was working on viral marketing cuz he just didn't have a budget so he's like I gotta use my customers to get me more customers and to explain it you didn't explain it totally clear but someone signs up for your thing it says do you want to invite your friends here's your gmail contacts click select all and send an email to all of them and so in this case for birthday alarm it was I make a calendar where I'm Alan vite you I'll say hey say I'm can you add your birthday to my calendar I don't want to forget your birthday this is before Facebook cases by the way and so you would add your birthday to my calendar and they would haste and say hey Sam don't you want to remember Shawn's birthday that'd be nice like reciprocate and you be like yeah sure and then it would say hey Sam you've got one birthday on the calendar but you surely got more friends than one so why don't you invite some other friends here let me make it easy for you would you like to import all your friends from hotmail and you're like yes and then and he added one thing at a time to make it more viral so he would add a prefilled message he's like oh there people are stopping because they can't think of what to say right so here's a pre filled message that I know works and then I just say sent and so then he got this thing super viral so you know birthday alarm grew to 50 million members with zero paid marketing 50 million and and then he's done this again and again since then with his social network Bebo and others so when I worked with them the name of the game was viral growth and so we did a charity campaign they're trying to raise money for charity water well we made a story a website that was just telling a story of this boy jean bosco with no water and then we said can we get this to go viral so we did the same thing import import emails get people to send the story to their friends and raise money for the cause and we got it to go viral so I've literally been Bennett we're like nothing nothing nothing you'd come into work nothing no growth no growth no growth and you would just tweak the right thing and then all of a sudden that you know between overnight something would have doubled and the next morning it doubled again next morning double began and I remember it's just going from zero to five million people signing up for this charity thing within like you know two weeks it was insane and so I've seen viral growth and how counterintuitive it is like you don't think you know well yesterday we had 4,000 people so today we're gonna have I don't know 5,000 6,000 it's like no you're gonna have 16,000 then you have 32,000 and it's gonna you know it's gonna go up to the millions within a few days and so I've seen viral growth when you're talking about in the good sense from a product perspective now it's viral growth of an actual [ __ ] virus and so and it you could see actually in the u.s. somebody did a great graph where they mapped Italy where everything is on lockdown because Italy is started spreading like crazy and they showed Italy day one us day one Italy day two the u.s. day two number of cases and the bar graphs are like identical and the thing is we're just in like whatever day six and you can see by day 21 where this thing gets to if you don't like lock everything down right away so I am very fearful because I've seen viral growth I've seen viral spread and I know that it doesn't work the way it breaks our brains our brains think things go linearly but this goes exponentially and it's really hard to just comprehend an exponential spread and to take the story a different way than coronavirus which is that stuff that you're describing that Michael purchasing you can actually still get all these two cool plugins that auto automatically like allow people to share a pre-populated message to all their gmail contacts we use it and people still share yeah and the math works out where you know because you would think I would never do that wouldn't email all my content we had a lot of people doing it but people do it and what happens is you know 1% or less will do it but you look at the map 1% of people do it on an average they have 326 contacts so for every hundred people that come in you get three hundred twenty six people blasted out it doesn't work as good as that time because the email open rates are much higher than yeah but now people are like oh I don't know I never talked to Sam so if he's sending me this this is junk this is spam now people filter it but in certain countries it works like we were growing like we could do this like clockwork in India in India people still open it like they did in the US ten years ago and they forward even higher rates I don't care look forward everything and everybody and so India Turkey all these little countries where we would see this crazy growth that you couldn't get in the US and or UK anymore they kind of suck because the monetary value and you know the value per user is lower there but it does still feel good to get like it really works and people are shocked by that yeah we did one through SMS I remember and over the weekend it went viral and like you know during the week Monday through Friday everything looked fine is growing but like not at a crazy pace we didn't realize the viral coefficient was two and so over the weekend it took off and started compounding on a big number and we racked up a hundred twenty thousand an SMS a hundred forty thousand dollar bill and SMS is going through Kazakhstan it's like we don't even know we're growing we're gonna grow in Kazakhstan and it went crazy and turns out texting in Kazakhstan is super expensive and so one hundred twenty thousand dollars in two days we had to pay off that's crazy sucked the texting stuff which we haven't you want talked about supper mm-hmm okay you want to scroll up for me or whatever okay okay supper I I think it's supper comm what did they just raised was it forty million dollars today and a four hundred million dollar valuation total they've raised a hundred fifty million dollars in valuation it's a cool that's a cool service if you're a consumer how does work yeah so you want to reuse supper if you're trying to find an apartment you'll probably run in December cuz you're like it's a search engine to find apartments to rent yeah and typically for these new guys San Francisco isn't the major market it's typically more middle more where they have high-rise buildings which we don't have a lot here but basically if you google Chicago apartments or moving to Chicago or something like that jumper or apartment list mile the place where I used to work or a bunch of other things like that will come up and I'll be like here's 843 apartments available in Chicago click here to get information and submit your information ok great here's how they work which a lot of people have no idea how they work Henry I'm gonna explain to you how they work and you tell me if you ever heard this okay so they're lead-gen companies you know what a lead gen company is okay the way it works is a lot of people are shocked by this and it's actually way easier to start that most people would realize so the way it works is there's I don't know how many there are who do this but I know that there for sure four or five that do this that are big names and so just in the apartments but just in the apartment space so there's apartments com I believe there's rent comm and there's maybe two others that are quite large and then there's dozens that you don't even realize exists you'd have to google them and find them but what they do is they work with all the big apartment buildings so there's gray star which has probably millions of apartments then there's co star which has a bunch and then there's every apartment building that you have world star race star and then there's a Avalon Avalon Bay I think they're called there's a bunch of them and they have millions of units in what they do is they go to red calm and they go or apartments calm and they go for every person who signs a lease with us or who calls our our phone we're gonna give you a hundred bucks and so what supper can do or probably how they started out or what anyone can do is they go hey Apartments calm you guys are getting a hundred dollars per call will you give us ten dollars per email we give you of people who are qualified leads so what supper did I mentioned they didn't when they launched and I'll explain why I say when they launched is what they did was they go these places and they go alright give us a cut of the revenue per email and so the math works out that if we send you five emails basically people who said here's my email address here's my phone number I'm interested in a two-bedroom at this particular building apartments will will be like alright we'll give you $10 for that because we're pretty confident that for every five of these we collect one of them become a lead and so now we make fifty bucks in profit and so what supper does is they create a different funnel where they learn how to rank really high on moving to Chicago find an apartment or they are able to have really good facebook ads and they get all these leads and that's what their margin is and so the Martin margins for these businesses I know this first hand could be 60 to 70 percent gross margin which means let's see what's the math behind that you million bucks comes through the door you paid you know two hundred fifty K on search engine marketing yeah but you know the rest is because there's no cogs there's no there's no physical product you're selling so you have a very high margin product sixty-seven percent margin plus whatever content staff you have internally that's your other cost so it's just a legion company yeah and the interesting thing I've known a lot of people who have these lean lead gen companies I knew a guy who had a legion company for swimming pools so if you wanted to buy a swing swimming pool you'd Google by swing pool repairman or indoor ground pool indoor in-ground pool setup California or something like that he's number one he would he would be number one you submit your information and he would sell it to these people who go in services actually do the thing who actually do the work you're a middleman when your elite now there's pros and cons to this business the first pro is you could set these up really cheaply and you could start making cash flow very quick like if you were able to spend one month just building the site and creating the relationship with this person you could next day go out and start making cash so long as you were profitably acquire a customer right so that's great the second great thing is you could do this for most anything the best way I think to figure out how to do this is you figure out what has the largest total market size with also the largest possible cost per lead with also the least amount of competition and you do like a grid yeah like a great and so for example I've been bullish on truck drivers the reason why is I think that there's a whole lot of truck drivers in America the average truck driver makes a good salary let's say $50,000 a year therefore recruiters would be willing to pay like a hundred bucks per lead so I was like can I send leads there or you could do it for local services so I need a landscaper or I near need irrigation work done at my house right my home and someone will buy those leads for I don't know fifty bucks so you can do this for anything right you just have to optimize for what so my father-in-law's in the senior living business he owns a couple of facilities and the biggest thing for them his business looks great when he has high occupancy rates and it looks terrible if he gets high vacancy so low occupancy and so there's companies out there that do this for seniors if you start googling like you know you know memory care and Alameda California there's a company that will pop up right in the top of search and say hey we've reviewed the top 15 you know facilities here and come read about them or hey are you looking for this talk to our consultant just put in your email address here and we'll help you get land in a spot and so then they'll pay these lead-gen services a high amount because you know somebody who goes into a senior senior facility they're paying eight thousand dollars per month and they're usually there till end of life and so you get you know that very high lifetime value of that customer so you're willing to pay $1,000 per qualified leave who's looking in your area I don't know that exact number but high price and I have first-hand knowledge I know someone personally and I know the financials of a senior home living or senior living lead-gen business it made hundreds of thousands of dollars a month in revenue and a very good profit I know someone who did it for rent to own properties I know people who have done it for like I said swimming pools I know people who have done it for apartments I know a guy who did it for local home services and did about 60 to 70 million dollars a year in sales right and so that's the name of the game I also know people have done it for jobs jobs is another good one now like rigged up has done this they've raised money at two or three billion dollar valuation and they've done it for oil workers and the way the math works is there's actually way more oil workers in America than you think hundreds of thousands or can be hundreds of thousands and those oil workers the barrier to entry is relatively low you don't have to have like a master's degree in something so anyone can do it or a lot of people can do it and the salary is quite high a hundred grand a year in some cases so they're willing to spend a lot of money and so it's a really interesting company bit or a business rather and a lot of people don't know that's how it works now here's the downside the downside is lead-gen companies can be very transactional which means as a business you only capture value and make money the more leads you're coming in through there and often that means you only make money when you're spending money a lot of times u they suck at building brands so like I said you could spend something up really fast that means it can likely go away just as fast because let's say that um like if you create a URL that's like home senior home living California com that is not like maybe maybe someone just going to google that and they're gonna see it one time they don't think you yeah and then they're gonna get there and they're done they're never gonna think about you ever again and you have to pay for them again and so if you want more customers you got pay again right and so that's quite hard so if you can build a brand around it then that's where it's really interesting and the second thing is that you are dependent on the person buying elite so in my case I worked for a person who was doing Legion and they go alright there's a cap on this like we can only make a certain amount of money giving leads the way that we become a huge business is we get we make a relationship directly with the apartment buildings and go straight there go straight to them now the reason why that sucked is because the person buying the liege is like oh you're our competition now right you're out and they cut it off and their revenue goes away immediately right and so what thumbtack did I like thumbtack what they've done is they've built a direct relationship with the people so if you Google San Francisco wedding photographer and you see a wedding photographer on thumbtack they've built that relationship with them and thumb and that wedding photographer will pay thumbtack directly for a lead that's great because there's no middleman to cut out now the downside with that is it costs a ton of money to do this is like a really big total marketplace and so you likely have to raise money or figure out some scrappy way to get it done right but that's my rant on and the big version of these if you take it to its absolute max it's like Expedia or booking.com yeah right so what they're doing is they're saying okay cool you want to book a flight I will become the best at ranking for how to search for flights find a good flight here's some recommended trips and then we just the airline's pay us a commission and affiliate fee for every lead we're sending them and that is a notoriously difficult it yeah they've done well but they're hyper competitive and they're you know it's always contentious and then hotels is another one that's quite challenging if I wanted to make money really fast I would find a relatively boring one like trucking jobs yes I find interesting but most people do not so they want to enter that the flights and travel is a lot sexier and so it's hard give you another niche one I have a friend who created this business called a ply board and what he was doing was international students people I went to high school in China and when I when I was graduating in China everybody wanted to come to the u.s. to study everyone wants to come to u.s. colleges so internationally India China Indonesia Malaysia the best students all want to come to the US if they can so they want to come to the US but they don't know where the hell to start they don't know what the schools are they don't know how to apply they don't know how to translate there they are scoring on all these like you know aptitude test in Malaysia to like what the US schools want etc so there's a barrier there and the US schools love foreign students because they pay more like I think a foreign student who international student who's going to school at Berkeley will pay double the tuition as a local student not just to in-state student like a u.s. out-of-state student versus international the International and Allah knows you you pay double okay great like nine times as much going to school that's insane so basically what he was doing so he went to colleges and and you have all these small colleges that just need applicants cuz they don't have a brand name so yeah a lot of Stanford and Harvard they don't really care because they're getting so many applicants anyways doesn't matter but like San Jose State you know they were like hey we will pay you $1,000 per admitted student $3,000 per admitted student so he was getting three grand per admission in contract with all these different schools and then he just had to do lead gen on the other side for students who want to go to school in America which was actually a big market of people who are searching for what happened to it I still go in I don't know I haven't checked in with him lately but hope you're doing good Martin I hope you're doing alright International yeah I went to University of Sydney as well it was it was crazy we started I we should actually talk about that on another time because that's an interesting thing there but to get back to this Lee thing to wrap this up there's actually a lot and this is way bigger than people think and one of the biggest ones is credit cards Credit Karma I don't know what they do in revenue but they just sold for a billion dollars I but they did wonder I bet they did a billion in sales and what their hook was we're gonna get you to sign up for a report I credit a free credit report and we're gonna recommend credit cards for you use and they'll make $100 per credit card affiliate we get you they get now think about credit cards huge market huge referral fees very competitive nerd wallet does the same thing they're the bootstrap I think I don't know multi hundred millionaire yeah I mean but I think they bootstrap to like 50 or 60 million in sales then raised money so it's quite good now here's another company here's one more interesting thing you know the penny hoarder no I don't actually I don't wanna go through the penny hoarder the penny hoarder calm Kyle spoke at hustle con he's a cool guy he he's was a great success story still is but he started the penny holder and what it did was he would write about when he was poor he didn't have any money he would say I didn't have any money I was I was trying to pay my bills and so I would do things like drive uber or I would do coupon clipping and he would blog about it and anytime someone saw an article that he wrote about driving for uber he would make 2 grand per driver and so he was like oh this is cool watch I'm gonna blog about all the ways in which I can save money or make extra money and so he did that like through like there's websites where you can fill out surveys and make dollars I make a few bucks and he would talk about it and mostly middle America moms would see and be like that's great I'll make money on the side and I'll sign up and he would get an affiliate fee and he scaled this thing from zero to sixty million in sales completely bootstrapped in like six years I love this and here's the problem there's this other company called fluent media fluent I think it's called fluent fluent is a publicly traded company and they are performance marketers which means they when I'm describing but across tons of niches so someone will say like DirecTV will come to them and be like hey I'll give you $80 for every customer you sent us and they go great and they spin up these landing pages and fluent media does this with trucking as well they do a bunch of stuff if it's a big business publicly traded they saw Kyle's website and how much he was killing it cuz he talked about it a lot for PR which I mean it's good and bad good and bad and they just and they they ripped him off completely they created like the dollar saver or like something like very similar like the penny holder they just copy the website copied the articles and then they threw it on Facebook and they drove traffic to an article that said here are the hundred best ways to save money and they did the math too they could get a click for a penny or they could get a click for a dime and each person who came they would make 20 cents because that's the conversion rate of which I believe it up and so Kyle at penny hodor this is all public you can google it sued them and what they found out was fluent media according to the lawsuit hired one of the penny hoarders employees and they said yeah here's how we did it and so they just spun this up and it made a ton of money right off the bat yeah and so these are the pros and did you win the suit I think it's ongoing it's ongoing but uh for Kyle but this is why this is interesting because I and the penny holder amongst its crew a much its audience I think has a great brand and yeah a nerd wall actually at this point has a great brain at first nerd Walt was simply a you're just gonna Google are just gonna Google best credit card and we're gonna show up one and you're not never gonna remember us but at this point they're doing all this advertising and commercials and people like turn to the Nerds like it's working that's a commercial so really interesting business model I like Lee Jen but a lot of people didn't realize how that worked Henry was that interesting did you learn how it worked all right I got another one for you Manziel so this is cool this is one of my favorite reasons to do the podcast is that interesting people just reach out and tell me about their business so Manziel is this so this guy Sam reached out he listens the podcast what's his last name and so he was like hey I got this business you know would love some help with it or just would love to chat and so I said okay let's chat so get on the phone and I end up blown away by what these guys are doing so they teach me about something I've never heard of and is now very finite very very fascinating to me so what they do is manzil does Islamic financing what's that mean yeah we talked about not on the podcast but we talked about it offline cuz I was pretty interested in it so Henry do you know what Islamic financing is if you didn't know Legion I don't think you'll go this one so are you Muslim I'm not I'm Hindu well I'm neither but like my my family is Hindu so I didn't know about this but basically in the Muslim faith there's actually a sort of the advice is against traditional loans so interest which is known as like RIBA I think in the in in their faith is frowned upon in these so a traditional mortgage where you go to the bank you have your down payment you take out a loan and you're paying interest is actually not compliant with with their with their faith in their law and which is actually common and a lot of other different religions is that true yeah so I'm Catholic Christian and was raised that way and there's definitely rules regarding handling money and interests and things like that yeah and I think the the fundamental basis I'm going to kind of butcher this so I apologize but I'm just trying to explain as best as I understand it so so apparently your money you sort of fiat currency which is just not pegged in anything it's just a made-up concept the the belief system is that money has no value inherent value in itself and so you should not be charged interest for borrowing money which is this sort of abstract concept so they have loans or they have sort of agreements which can work as long as both sides are taking shared risk and getting sort of shared shared upside shared return in some way so there's damn Islamic I believe so yeah and his partner Mohammed is also so they were explaining to me that hey there's this big thing called economic financing and there's these like challenger banks and so if you ever heard the word challenger Bank check this out it's pretty pretty cool we know that banking is been around for these big Bank brands that are you know in every country there's there's big banks that are worth billions of dollars and recently over the last let's say five to seven years there's these things called challenger banks or neo banks they're called and so in Brazil there's a bank called new bank and you bank and brand new bank is worth 10 billion dollars it's one of those valuable startups in Brazil in the UK there's challenger banks oh my god I'm gonna forget this challenger just means a new one it's a start-up bank yeah and they're they offer different things so what these guys did was better digital access so mobile apps quicker ability to get sort of credit cards and debit cards spun up and so there's you know there's a couple of them that are huge now a few different multi-billion dollar startups done this well these guys have done is they've done this for a faith-based bank which is basically saying there is a set of customers out there in this case Muslims who are not being served well by the generic banks and we can make a bank that serves them better and the way we're gonna do it is you want to take a mortgage out you can either take a sort of mortgage out traditional mortgage which is not compliant or you can take one out that's compliant with your faith we've come up with a mechanism that is blessed by sort of the the village elders you know they're sort of leaders in the community that says yes this is you know I think sharni allows what's called seeing its compliant with sharni law and then on the other side this is this will this works as a mortgage you can actually buy your home and so these guys have this have this concept and in other countries this is apparently really big so in Africa Indonesia places where the Muslim population is the dominant population they've already solved this problem but in places like US Canada where it's just a minority of the population is is Muslim they don't have these banks yet so I love this startup idea because how are they doing so how they're doing so they're they spent a lot of time making sure that they can actually get it to be compliant and actually get the financial mechanism to work that took a while over a year maybe two years now they've gotten that to work and they have basically they have two sides of a marketplace on one side they have people who are investors because you know if you're gonna issue mortgages their average mortgages like $500,000 so it takes a lot of capital to start this business they don't want to be the one didn't want to go raise a billion dollars and then start issuing these loans they want on one side to have investors who we'll put in the capital to fund these loans and on the other side they want to have the borrow ease who are trying to buy a home who can pull from this pool of you know sort of halal financing you know this this financing that's compliant and so they have ten million dollars committed on the on the investor side 1.2 million in their bank ten million total and then and they're just every week they're trying to close more so I think which is a small amount but this is like just inbound interest this is not like they've never really done anything yet but ten million will let you let you do if you just do half a million dollar loans that means they can do whatever twenty mortgage is right now and every mortgage has a certain value so it's about worth about I don't know 20 K a year to them is that mortgage just in their fee that they get on top of it and so and on the other side they have all these applicants I think you know about a thousand applicants and these are what they call super prime applicants because these are people who are doctors lawyers they have good jobs they they have the money they have the means to afford their homes they're just looking for a solution that doesn't force them to compromise their faith so I really like this business little there's a working model in the UK there's a working model in in Africa there's working model Indonesia there's nothing in Canada where these guys are and there's nothing really in the u.s. where in America I think there's look this up I think there's like a couple million only to two million I want to say roughly that's pretty interesting I like that I think that there's a bunch of weird rules around banking I mean they're not weird they should be there but and so starting a starting a bank I think is it's so nearly impossible it's very difficult so what all the Neo banks do all the charter banks do not real banks they're not real banks they sit on top of BBVA or they sit on top of these other banks and they're just the they're the consumer-facing layer but the banking happens with their underlying partner and it's sort of like the lead gen model that you're talking about they go to these banks say hey I can get you a whole bunch more customers I'm gonna spend all the money during the marketing they'll be banking with you but we own this sort of relationship yeah and that's actually pretty common I use this thing my debit card is simple rightful I've heard of it yeah this is my debit card it's pretty cool I like it because the customer service I can just text and they're like you see these like young in Portland and they they're easy to chat with and they answer 24 hours a day they were acquired for a hundred million dollars and I was like he's like a freaking bank that's it yeah and I did not a bank yeah and it was what's called BBVA yeah that's who they use BBVA Compass I think it's me exactly they're under there's a few that are underneath all these now the very first there's a now one of the challenger banks got their very first banking charter banking license which is very rare if I forget their name but they just announced a couple weeks or last two weeks that sort of so now it's very interesting now once that seal broke because it was so hard to apply for this yeah I think we and they all want it Robin Hood wants their license Breck's wants their license it's just very hard for them to get I think you need 5 / 10 percent in reserve yeah you need a certain amount that's not it's just that there's no incentive for the government to give these out they're like you you kind of highfalutin you know tech startups do I really want to give this to you you've only been around for so long I don't know if they I have the trust in you so now the seals broken the first one got it we'll see what what that means but what I like about these guys is they're not a bank they're not taking your deposits they're just doing loan issuance so on one side they have the reserve cap they're their investment fund but they're using other people's money OPM on one side yeah other people's money to make the loans and they're the broker and they take one to two percent of the transaction fee and people are willing to pay a premium to have halal financing just like people willing to pay a premium for halal meat or for vegan or kosher meat you know whatever like right people are willing to pay a premium for things that are compliant with their faith I think this could be big and you wants interesting I think that they've had a hard time raising money from traditional VCS because this is understand hard to understand yeah you have to like you know most VCS are old white guys and you know it's the sort of cliche and you know I know they do look into it but I think that there's now there's the natural challenges of any high aspiration startup they have those they have the problems that any any started but that's really ambitious but then they also have the problem of like first they need to educate you about this problem like you saw how I stumbled through this explanation and I talked to these guys for an hour you know and that's where I am after an hour of really trying to understand it but you and you read this by FERC on your best so I ran her yeah I ran it by him I introduced them yesterday I said hey FERC on understands this he's Muslim he's an investor he's a technologist and he's an entrepreneur if he doesn't like this I don't like this see what did he say and so he so he's like I've looked into this she's like a lot of my friends really wanted this I tried to look at what options are available in the u.s. they suck they're really super high premiums is he practicing yeah like you know tenet to an extent yeah why I want to know is do really like like he doesn't pray five times a day but he doesn't eat pork right so he's like culturally he drinks but like his dad runs the mosque in San Jose and you know it so even people who are like culture who aren't incredibly devout are into this if he had the option he would prefer how all financing over not if it was convenient and he's like the problem with all the existing options they're not convenient they're not easy to use and they're very high premiums he's like if these guys did it conveniently I think this could be big so he's gonna talk to him we'll see like I'm not a practicing anymore are you guys Catholic you're Catholic for sure right do you eat meat on Friday I'm let me to I went to an all-boys Catholic High School I don't practice anymore but that's another thing I don't eat meat during Lent on Friday so I try not to so it's kind of it sounds like that's what it's kind of like we're it's like people it's a spectrum it's a you prefer it but not yeah you preferred especially if it's convenient for you you'd you'd you know the way Henry just said that a lot of guilt they're like yeah I should but I don't so there's you know if you can make it where people do what they want to do without lifting a finger then they'll do it you know that's great that's pretty cool I like that I like that thing or I like that angle of finding cuz I don't know anything about Muslim culture I don't know anything about Hindu culture which is you where you're from you I don't know you probably don't know too much about Catholic yeah it's kind of a way to like look at how other religions do things right another thing that we should talk about not today because I don't think we know what we're talking about we definitely don't yet is building things on top of banks I think that's super interesting what do you mean by that so like what simple did and like what the what's the name of this company man's oh man spell it ma n zi l manzil okay kind of like what manzil did a building a building a front-end on top of someone else's back-end right which is the bank I think that that's really interesting simple calm is my card I didn't know they did this at first this is kind of what dropshipping is so where you build the layer that says I'm going get the customer to a landing page and they buy yeah but it's just gonna place an order with this other manufacturer and they'll ship it directly it's super effective I like that with banks because like simple they did this I mean it's it's a little different the card is all white and it's a branding like looking yeah and their app is really good and so it's kind of interesting I think this is kind of what Breck's is doing right totally work hard yeah they're layered on top of MasterCard I love these things I really like that let's talk about uh how many minutes are we in we're we're about an hour in okay you want to we can answer some questions and what you want to do let's do one of these fun ones so let's do the rebranding words said this was in the hustle hustle trends trends hustle Facebook group which is like a source for entertainment and gold which go to trends CO and sign up and if you use the phrase million million you'll get Ranchos /my I believe that's it is it is it / million or it's a promo code both both will work at Ko / million or Transco you guys have this thing where you can sign up for a dollar which is pretty dope yeah it's working girl love it I love it okay so so so somebody the group the key scroll of I don't remember if I have their name should have their name too yeah there you go okay we don't have the name we should which might and will you finally the name of the guy who wrote this because I want to give him credit so somebody was just talking about like hey isn't it funny how people just rebrand stuff and like give it a whole new meaning so he's talking about msg he's like Oh MSG which was like got this really bad reputation for being a food out of a of whatever and just rebranded as umami and now it's just like foodie word that like is good and somebody came into the the comments with like a bunch of really funny ones you want to know another food one aioli aioli mayonnaise mayonnaise has a little garlic flavoring look it up look it up hey only is flavored mayonnaise look up ao Lee versus Google is aioli mayonnaise I've been telling you hey Olli is mayonnaise but there's like way more you have to do it in a separate tab you can't you can't do this because we have to over here he's right there what's the answer say it says it right there what's the top result what's it say is a only any different than mayonnaise am i off alright Henry wins okay it's not it's not exactly Mayo but I like the intent all right so let's go back to the dock yeah I love it so so this guy had a bunch of them for business which I like so ordinary you know when you skip you know I don't know I'm like this I skipped breakfast for years because I'm just lazy it didn't wake up early enough and now it's intermittent fasting it's like this health trend it's like oh I'm fasting till me and it's like yeah you skip breakfast okay Marlin Marlin was the original post and then who posted all these comments and it's a Logan Jeffrey J Logan had a bunch of them that were fire that I liked that's the reason I put it on here okay so when you just create your job because you want to travel now that's called dispersed retirements which I like when you're a grossly under employed writer or marketer now you're a digital nomad because you have to go live in some low cost area or a coach when you just like to eat beef and cheese because it's delicious and now that's called the carnivore diet or keto I call salami and cheese redneck charcuterie sleeping around online dating I don't agree with all these I'm just I'm relaying Logan's good ones when you quit your shitty business idea that was bad all along and everyone told you it was bad it's called pivoting I like that failing fast when you have a fear of commitment and therefore do not own anything and do not settle down you're now practicing minimalism so these are great and in general you know funny [ __ ] aside I think there's a lot of power to this I think is a leader you often have to rebrand stuff so that it's more palatable to your team and or to your customers packaging yeah you have to frame things package them up in a certain way we do this with our sushi restaurant where we realized that if we just described things better or differently with with it with better words people would buy more and we could charge more because people wanted to have sushi that was more sophisticated so when we called it you know whatever you know Atlantic salmon with blah blah rather than just saying salmon that was better or if we would create a whole new word altogether and put a little trademark next to it that was even better than using common words every once in a while I like there's certain things that they use the positive phrase and just generally accept it I like to use like a word that means the same thing but it's generally regarded as a negative just to [ __ ] with people so for example instead of saying like well we're gonna get the customer to do this I couldn't get them to buy by doing this or we're gonna influence them by doing this I like to use the word manipulate yeah let's manipulate I'm you get him to do this like like words that by definition work right just to kind of what happens if we call it what it is yeah so we're gonna manipulate up like I'm gonna manipulate this person to like you me like how you do that well I'm should be nice and charming and manipulate sort of influence with them and I love to screw people or like when political people say like well they have an agenda like yeah well so look guys I'm here to talk to you about my agenda which is to do like right of course I have an agenda I'm trying to get you to do stuff like yeah you're you're targeting like someone has a political agenda yeah sure right yeah they should have a political agenda I love you think those words Henry if you scroll up for a second so that's the end of this episode thanks for listening tell your friends make it all happen leave us a review we like that give us the real talk in the reviews because we read all of them and we liked it or tweeted us Sam's got 12,000 Twitter followers now he has surpassed me in the Twitter ring 11300 11300 counting so so he's winning great all right we're out of here thank you [Music]

would your biggest regret in the way you set up or organized or structured the company I wish I wouldn't have raised money and I would have just owned it all and why is that cuz I would be greedier and richer you didn't end up needing that capital it's hard to say because it worked it worked if I wanted to start fresh again I would have been able to do it I can start now what about advice a lot of people think oh this person is so successful right you raise money from a bunch of cool smart successful people either in media or not in media yeah so that was helpful was that truly like so did you get your sort of values worth on the advice component yes I'm not sure that that typically plays out that way but I think it works okay so look our network is so [ __ ] powerful me and you our network is so powerful I have I think 35 investors ranging from Tim Ferriss the founders of nerd wallet which is who knows what that's worth billions of dollars the founder of the Chive founders a bleacher report who else just look it up a lot of people and I text them I just braixen I'll say you get a lot out of it I'll tell you two things that you do that gets a lot first your investor updates what you send usually saying more frequently now I said quarterly but before I for monthly right 36 months I send up every single month every single month and the it was so well organized it was basically like hey here's all the key metrics you don't beat around the bush it's like this how much cash we got in the bank this how much we made this month there's how much the email list grew this is how much our open rate was boom that's number one number two and how was your second sort of the way that I set up as I go numbers I go just here's the numbers there's no interpretation right what all right let's get into it numbers boom okay then I go and then I do things that are going well things are not going well I need your help yeah yes or no yeah it was great and you sent that too so you did the work to keep them engaged and stay top of mind do not under under underestimate this if you're doing your business if there's people who are willing to help you out you got to find a way to stay top of mind and and part of it is you you share frequent updates and there's a very good sign if you're an investor if you're one of your companies stop sending their updates that company's about to die or they're on their way to dying and they go into a shell and Paul Graham has this great post which is just like as an investor when you see that you know it's time to go check in and as a founder ironically that's when you need to help the most yep so don't go quiet when you need the help the most that's when you need to be talking and asking and maybe you actually won't die if you if you could keep that going what other mistakes have we made so I always regretted the I think that the the normal way that people give out equity is a little too founder greedy so I wish I given more equity to my team and so like you know basically I wish I just negotiated it better between what do I get what are the investors get and what does my team get I think it was imbalanced I think some of what the investors got the team should have got some of what I had the team should have got because really like the people who are there as person four or five six really they're taken just as much risk as you are in a way like they were there when it wasn't obvious that this was gonna work and so for the all-stars I wish I had given more and next time my next company I'll do just that I will do you make sure that core four core five people I'll make sure it's not like like typically anaconda in the pool be so I don't know exactly what the pool will be but let's say let's go what's typical so typical company eighteen two co-founders you start 50/50 you're gonna raise some money they might end up taking 25 to 30 percent of the company depending on how it goes let's call it 25 percent and so you know as the founders you you've diluted down your rat I don't know my maths bad but let's say you're both at what is that 30 something of 35 percent each now and and so you you know that's where you're at and then your team the option pool they typically say is like 10 to 15% is your sort of option pool yeah so the first few employees might have like you know the key person might get like one to three percent and then everybody else is below that is below one percent essentially and I just think that's like a pretty hard skew so I would try to get multiple people in these sort of one one to four percent range I would try to have like my core my core team all be in the over one percent range for sure and whether that means I take the haircut or investors take the haircut that's what I would do if it's a tech company I think this is very different if you're not a high-growth tech company if you're in San Francisco again though I'd started wherever I live and so if I'm if I'm wanting to live here yeah I started here if I wanted to live somewhere else I started somewhere else so now you can start it definitely anywhere so it's just about your preferences I if I was gonna start again another thing that I would do is I would go and get a job somewhere and just make like when I started I hadn't I didn't I was always self-employed mostly I wish I would have worked somewhere made for a little while before you did it or you mean as I do something as a side hustle before you just get the experience yeah I think it would've been nice and it saved money that's interesting I wouldn't have thought you'd say that I think it would be helpful to understand how things I think if you did it for three months you'd be like okay I'm done it would have got it money away [Music] you

what up what's going on did we asked people to subscribe and unsubscribe to network I don't think it worked we got a bunch of videos people doing it thank you for doing it in my opinion that experiment doesn't like it doesn't move the needle too much I don't I don't know if that technique is a big technique let's answer five guys keeps growing organically but we didn't see a spike because we asked people to do it let's answer all their questions don't answer them today or I think next step Thursday because I didn't have I got a lot of all yeah the problem and I apologize to people who send me things on Instagram I don't check that ever oh yeah you know there's two inboxes on Instagram Facebook does that with her so I didn't know that that was even a thing and I had all these nice people sending me reviews you find like a year later yeah I didn't know that so apologies I listened back to one of the episodes which is a most uncomfortable thing you can i've not listen to one ever yeah and I don't blame you I listen back and you know you were saying you're very self-conscious now because we do the video and that's how I am about the audio because I listen to it and I'm like what the [ __ ] is wrong with me on my talking biz fast why am i breathing like that no I think you have a got you got actually have a great voice I think you have good cadence and someone at on the meetups asked me he goes do you guys cut out silence and I was like on the audio we do but you do you Shawn does that yeah oh I thought we didn't and he was like you guys are talking so fast yeah so he cuts out Ohm's Oz or big repetitions like if I say the same thing two different ways for no reason and then I think he cuts a little bit of a gap between us when he doesn't like it he's like a perfection I told him not to do it cuz it takes him like six hours oh yeah every time he's like makes a difference and I was like I don't know if this mix [ __ ] makes a difference I got confidence from it okay alright well if he's gonna justify it now that's crazy I just thought we were talking fast like we do talk fast but it's the in-between where he speeds it up and then he cuts out any like extraneous [ __ ] people like it you know I also got tons of compliments from Stu a few episodes back people liked him people like Stu yeah high approval rating people like he doesn't have to drop out of the presidential race like everybody else all right what do we got today a presidential did you want to talk about Bernie is that your first thing I have a thing up there but I didn't research enough but I'll talk about it just quickly so a bunch of people on Twitter were freaking out because Bernie's proposing this tax on vested shares that you haven't actually cash to him yet okay and tech people were like okay there goes the startup scene like well you know if you're on vested shares that they haven't actually received the prop like this company is not liquid and so there are some nuances like it's written here it's taxed on non qualified stock options of at least a hundred thousand you know if you have over a hundred thousand and stock stock options that are vested and your and employees making at least a hundred thirty K so it's not everybody and it's not all types of things so it's not RS use its ISO as I believe okay so I'm not an expert in this stuff at all and I'm not an expert in politics I know what I believe but I don't know the technical Depot well let's agree to talk out of our ass for so I'm not gonna talk about that actually but here's what I am going to talk about is starting a company and how it worked with us in this wool a lot because I do know that a lot of people think like oh the rich are doing this they don't understand things so when we started the hustle I saved up twenty five thousand dollars to start it with that twenty five thousand dollars I made sixty grand in profit in six weeks which is pretty good and the first year in business was roughly three hundred eighty thousand dollars in revenue and most of it was profit because I paid myself we were I think we were an LLC I withdrew $2,000 a month in salary salary and that's why I paid my bills my rent was cheap very cheap hundreds of hundreds of dollars a month and I lived off $1,200 beyond that beyond that it was very I lived very very very frugally and then we decided to raise a little bit of money I raised I think three hundred thousand dollars from people at a three and a half million dollar valuation you had to change from being an LLC at this point right yep changed an S corp I think it was an escort probably C course I don't remember see this is I'm not an expert in this yeah you want to be a c-corp if you're gonna take investment that's just like you don't have to study all the differences between them but if you're gonna take like traditional investment they're gonna want you to be a c-corp so we converted it costs five grand to do that at this point we probably had half a million dollars in the mmm $300,000 in the bank account I don't remember between 300 and 500 thousand by the end of our first year and we raised money at a three and a half million dollar valuation and then once we started doing stock options and stuff like that we signed up to Carta and they gave us a let's take all the 409 a yep where we got so that for nine a just values your company at some numbers yeah you guys had revenue so they probably took some standard before they valued us and you want it to be low at this stage yeah so they valued us in the millions of dollars of range I don't remember it could have been three and a half it could have been six I don't remember the number whenever these types of businesses are that's what they've done you want it to be low because that's what your share price is that's what your stock options are going to be if you're an employee you want to get in at the sort of low valuation so when it sells at a high valuation you get this sort of increase in value but if they if the 409a comes back high then you're not gonna get you know as much of a lift on your share and so at this point our 409 a is many tens of millions which is nice that's cool we have a valuable business but when we started it was single-digit millions which was still a lot I was 24 at the time I said I start with $25,000 and I was taking $2,000 a month I was not saving any money right okay I'm not complaining because it worked out but so on paper I was a millionaire multiple millionaire if I had to pay I think there I forget what this I don't want to like act like I know I'm talking about I let's say if I if I had to pay 20 percent in taxes on that multiple millions of dollars you wouldn't have I literally wouldn't have had any money to do it right even if I wanted to withdraw money from our business account I would have had to lay people off or right I'd like so when people say such certain people are hoarding money or something like that a lot of times it's not true and I have a lot of founder friends that have businesses that are on paper worth hundreds of millions of dollars right and they have tens of thousands of dollars saved that's a bank account yeah so they're not like RIT yeah I think people need to and this also happens if you're an employee you leave a company you usually have what they call an exercise when which might be 30 days 60 days 90 days I think that I think the normal 90 days so that gives you three months to come up with the money to buy your options or you lose them yeah and a lot of people don't have that money cuz like you know they leave one company it's a startup and now their shares are worth 80 grand or 180 grand and they need to go they want to go to a different job and now that you need to come up with an 80 or 180 grand to buy out their options that's not still a guarantee that that money's coming back and often people don't have that money sitting in the bank so they'll forfeit their options which is a true bummer some companies are being cool about it Pinterest a couple others I don't remember movie stripe they increase their exercise window to seven years or six years so they're like look we know this practice a little bit crazy it's hard to come up with that cash and you worked here you earned your shares so we're not gonna try to take those back you have the longer window because we might be private for longer which is kind of a cool trend so when I dub company should do that my w2 income so at this point I make money in eight or ten different ways I got loads of things that just it just has added up over time and that's great and I still pay myself a salary I pay myself not that much I'm not the highest paid person here yeah and I but my w2 salary we're gonna be four years old I've been working on this as a project since 2014 we're gonna be four years old officially in April I next month I my w2 salary and year one I think was $24,000 year to maybe 36 and then year three then I started going higher right because the business was established yeah but my w2 income historically has been low right quite low and so when I saw this and I saw people getting mad at rich people I'm like I bet people thought I was rich yeah and you wouldn't have qualified for this because it says you have to be making at least a hundred 30k but like what if I three years a tax on my stock now it would be painful [ __ ] hard yeah you'd be in a really tough spot so you know Bernie I like Bernie but this is a little bit crazy this will really screw up the way the startup ecosystem works but it can also adapt I'm not even gonna take a stand if I think it's crazy I just didn't giving a perspective of my business and that and and I think I I now I think I have a lot more cash than even most people who have companies that are huge what's your biggest regret in the way you setup or organized or structured the company I wish I wouldn't have raised money and I would have just owned it all and why is that cuz I would be greedy or and richer you didn't end up needing that capital it's hard to say because it worked it worked if I wanted to start fresh again I would have been able to do it I can start now what about advice a lot of people think oh this person is so successful right you raise money from a bunch of cool smart successful people either in media or not in media yeah so that was helpful was that truly like said did you get your sort of values worth on the advice component yes I'm not sure that that typically plays out that way but I think yeah it works okay so look our network it's so [ __ ] powerful me and you our network is so powerful I have I think 35 investors ranging from Tim Ferriss the founders of nerd wallet which is who knows what that's worth billions of dollars the founder of the Chive founders a bleacher report who else just look it up a lot of people and I text them I just pranks them I'll say you get a lot out of it I'll tell you two things that you do that gets a lot first your investor updates which you send usually saying more frequently now I said quarterly but before I for monthly right 36 months I send up every single month every single month and the it was so well organized it was basically like hey here's all the key metrics you don't beat around the bush it's like this how much cash we got in the bank that's how much we made this month there's how much the email list grew this is how much our open rate was boom that's number one number two and how was your second sort of the way that I set up as I go numbers I go just here's the numbers there's no interpretation right all right let's get into it numbers boom okay then I go and then I do things that are going well things are not going well I need your help yeah yes or no yeah it was great and you sent that too so you did the work to keep them engaged and stay top of mind do not under under underestimate this if you're doing your business if there's people who are willing to help you out you got to find a way to stay top of mind and and part of it is you you share frequent updates and this very good sign if you're an investor if you're one of your companies stop sending their updates for a bit that company is about to die or they're on their way to dying and they go into a shell and Paul Graham has this great post which is just like as an investor when you see that you know it's time to go check in and as a founder ironically that's when you need to help the most yeah so don't go quiet when you need the help the most that's when you need to be talking and asking and maybe you actually won't die if you if you could keep that going what other mistakes have we made so I always regretted the I think that the the normal way that people give out equity is a little too founder greedy so I wish I given more equity to my team and so like you know basically I wish I just negotiated it better between what do I get what are the investors get and what does my team get I think it was imbalanced I think some of what the investors got the team should have got some of what I had the team should have got because really like the people who are there as person four or five six really they're taken just as much risk as you are in a way like they were there when it wasn't obvious that this is gonna work and so for the all-stars I wish I had given more and next time my next company I'll do just that I will do you make sure that cool four or five people I'll make sure it's not like like typically in a comedy in the pool be so I don't know exactly what the pool will be but let's say so let's go what's typical so typical company eighteen two co-founders you start 50/50 you're gonna raise some money they might end up taking 25 to 30% of the company depending on how it goes let's call it 25% and so you know as the founders you you've diluted down you're at I don't know my maths bad but let's say you're both at what is that 30 something 35 percent each now and and so you you know that's where you're at and then your team the option pool they typically say is like 10 to 15% is your sort of option pool yeah so the first few employees might have like you know the key person might get like one two three percent and then everybody else is below that is below one percent essentially and I just think that's like a pretty hard skew so I would try to get multiple people in these sort of one one to four percent range I would try to have like my core my core team all be in the over one percent for sure and whether that means I take the haircut or investors take the haircut that's what I would do if it's a tech company I think this is very different if you're not a high-growth tech company if you're out in San Francisco again though I'd started wherever I live and so if I want to live here yeah I started here if I wanted to live somewhere else I started somewhere else now you can start it definitely anywhere so it's just about your preferences I if I was gonna start again another thing that I would do is I would go and get a job somewhere and just make like when I started I hadn't I didn't I was always self-employed mostly I wish I would have worked somewhere maybe for a little while before you did it or you mean as I do something as a side hustle before you just get the experience yeah I think it would've been nice and it saved money that's interesting I wouldn't have thought you'd say that I think it would be helpful to understand how things I think if you did it for three months you'd be like okay I'm done it all worked out you want to talk about some stuff yeah let's try out some ideas okay run the world I'll start there so cool perfect timing perfect timing so these guys been working on this obviously before this - I think female founders and what this is is it's a digital conference so especially with coronavirus and you've had major major conferences shutting down so Facebook's f8 conference done I only have canceled I believe GDC is done you know like I predict South by Southwest but this episode will air in a couple days I bet you they're gonna cancel yeah so tons of these conferences are closing and I've only this is a great experiment because I've always wondered why aren't there more digital conferences now we built a product called blab that was sort of like this people used it this way a bunch of podcasters through a conference on our platform and I just thought hey this is cool because you could be remote you can be anywhere in the world you can attend this thing and what does a conference have it has speakers cool you can stream that online no problem it has like exhibitors cool you could do that online if you wanted to and it has the networking and that's a little bit harder to do online but you could do that as well it's missing the biggest component though which is what serendipity yeah you have to engineer that serendipity into the product that's the biggest part these guys claim that they sort of have recreated all of that I don't know I haven't used it yet but the cool thing is we're now gonna find out because with all these conferences canceling run the world is taking advantage and they're going to all the conference's they're saying hey hosted on our platform we make this really easy for you they have a cool model where basically it's no money in they just take 25% of the ticket sales whose computer is up here can you Google run the world oh yeah pull pull it up and so they've raised a bunch of money from andreessen horowitz a lot of money announced it and Henry just Google about the world and the Beyonce song came up my friend had a company called little things which is the is that another song it's what's the boy band with Harry Styles though oh it's a what are they called five yeah run the world today run the world dot today is the URL so live events worldwide anyways I think this is cool and we're gonna find out if this is like they've been dealt the best hand for their product right now and we'll see if they can pull this off that's interesting do you think that like I think we should do one of these for the listeners like just like you do the New York Meetup I think we should just try just to take this for a test drive I think we should just do an impromptu one and hang out with people get let everyone meet each other I'm down I okay if we had to make predictions if this is gonna work so I would say the safe bet the safe bets always know the safe spots always know okay but if you had a hundred million dollars would you invest two million into this business I don't know who these people are and I haven't played with the products that's the caveat let's say I've met the people and I played with the product and I felt like they did the thing you said which is it wasn't just a live stream of content or a chatroom like there was some way to engineer the serendipity of a network of the networking in a conference or the discovery of new products right like so if I felt like they did something different besides just a teleconference like livestream then I would buy in but I got to feel the magic that's a stock photo so there's a Henry's pulling up a photo right now of a mug that says hustle we use that photo that's Henry was writing up a cease-and-desist like during the podcast that's great okay run the world internet conferences you're in or out I am going to say 51% in okay alright we'll take it so well here's old dude by the time this airs I'm gonna have setup to run the world conference the link to it is gonna be in the show notes and we will figure it out so go in the show notes right now if you're listening to this well let and get a ticket to attend our conference and we'll try this out well and then we'll let everyone decide is this cool or is this like one of those ideas that sounds good in theory but it misses the magic and never works uh Henry go to godaddy.com real quick pick a URL and we'll send them to that URL as well I'm gonna hate going with show notes okay either way we could just put it on our my first million podcast my first million Dom my first million podcast calm okay my first million podcast calm it will be a redirect to that you wanna charge for it yeah ticket will be whatever I don't know pick a number okay we'll make it cheap twenty five twenty bucks and what will be is what will it be we'll invite our friends so we'll invite some of the people that we think are the most interesting we will do a talk on hey how do we build you know well we'll get will do the things you do in the conference right so a couple speakers up fireside chat and then networking where people can meet each other okay and we'll limit it to 100 people yeah okay 100 people that some amount of money my first million podcast com yeah you go try it out all right tweet what else we got on the on the agenda oh I have one scroll down you want to talk about some book club stuff yeah okay so you sort out more use for this is hilarious one long-running Google Doc with just bullet points for every possible thing we might talk about yeah it's great okay so we were gonna talk I was gonna talk about this a few weeks ago okay so um when I moved to San Francisco I started a book club called the anti MBA and I did it because I didn't go to an an elite Ivy League school but I was always envious of those people because when I moved here I didn't know a single soul and I felt I always like stereotypes people I was like tall beautiful white teeth with Patagonia's and they had like lovely networks don't you saw all around yeah just like these like rich white people who that's all I was like right that's how I imagined it and it kind of was that and I was always envious of that so what I did was I create a book club meeting where we would meet every week and we would read one book a month and I would convince an expert how did you convince people to join this where'd you throw it up a cold email guy I just learned how to cold email people and I I did it online so each week we would have 30 people show up and I probably had an email list of 5,000 people who would I was not in person this is all online 30 people in person see Ava yeah a lot of my best friends I met this way 30 people my friend had an office and let me use it and we would just meet up and I would and I would read a week ahead of time and just make notes and lead discussion and sometimes do we'd have an expert okay and then I would send show notes or meeting notes to the list and people loved it I made close to no money off of it or I don't think I made any money off it I just did it for fun and it was very success successful and a lot of people said that we should make it a thing I think it's a stupid I thought it was a stupid idea but book clubs are actually kind of interesting so there's this business called Book of the Month Club it was started and I believe it was started in the 1930s at this point it's owned by it was owned by Bertelsmann which is a large publisher a multibillion-dollar publisher and then recently a private individual bought it for single-digit millions of dollars in in the 40s 50s and 60s this was massive I mean it was millions of people paid for so it was quite a large business hundreds of millions of dollars probably in the 60s and 70s it's gone away once Amazon came around a guy bought it a couple years ago and it's quite large still and what they do is scroll down a little bit this is 90 million users what the hell no that's Goodreads oh that's good region so book at the Month Club now has a hundred thousand active paying customers Wow which means they're in the revenue range of ten to fifteen million a year in recurring revenue and they the founder said in an interview he want his goal is to grow 5x a year for for the next year not consistently I don't know if that's I think that's bogus but Book of the Month is kind of an interesting thing I suspect I've always thought that it would would not work now my opinion has changed so Goodreads has a hundred million users there's this thing called Wattpad have you heard of Wattpad I've heard of it yeah Wattpad a lot of people don't know about it Wattpad it's owned by a guy in Canada and they have 400 employees it's a multiple hundred million dollar a year business I believe they it's a book club for it's not a book club it's more write on it you you write original stories yeah but it's their categories roman middle middle america romance novels so if you're a 40 year old woman you probably have heard a lot pad understand that's the most popular category or yeah buddy much all they do oh really okay it's basically for women who it's like men do video porn romance novels is woman porn basically and so huge business and now I'm quite bullish now on these book clubs yeah Reese Witherspoon has a book club my wife uses it my sister you so many people have you heard of this no sunshine some [ __ ] thing Oprah had hers but hers wasn't on paid membership but this is really smart like what you're describing I'm like oh this is good I think you gotta have probably not gotta have but it's advantageous here to have a brand like a Reese Witherspoon or whoever Jennifer Aniston or Gwyneth Paltrow or whoever or like the hustle could do a book club you could do a book club like I think that you have to have a bit of cachet to organize people around to get the energy going that initial energy so here's one angle you buy the rights to the book which is expensive yeah why would you do that well because I think the margins and books are quite small I've talked to Tim Ferriss about this he told me that he earns I he didn't say that he didn't tell me this but he told me I mean I think he does about a million a month in revenue off his podcast and he told me that he this what he did tell me he has made 10 times more money off the podcast and all of his books combined right so I I don't think people get paid a lot of money for books March's it might be a cheap asset you're saying yeah I think it's quite cheap so I would one-up my goal would be to buy the rights for the book and make it popular you know who have you heard of um there's this company that owns the company that owns Proactiv it's called I know what you're talking about it's the skin care it's a direct marketing they the guy who owns it it's a quite large business he got his start because he bought the rights to thinking Grow Rich oh really and he helped make it popular again oh wow through infomercials so that's what I would do is I would want to buy the rights to all the books and there's another company called Mentor box that does this and Tai Lopez is one of the owners so it's incredibly scamming I mean like you sign up for like $20 and then it's rolls into like a 400 month thing it's like [ __ ] stupid but book clubs are super interesting to me so would you do this like if you were gonna do this now how would you attack it what would you do so you buy the rights that you buy the rights if I wanted to bootstrap it no you can't how would you do it so what I would do is I would look at what you've I know me please vinyl me please is my friend's business it's a probably a couple million bucks a month subscription things so what you do is you give them $50 a month and they send you a vinyl once a month right and so I would do that but for a particular type of category so what I would do is I would create a Facebook group and I would say it's $30 or $50 a month and we're gonna read one book a month I'm gonna get one expert to come and talk about the book each week or each month we're gonna do it in a Facebook group and I'm gonna send you notes about the home and what category do you think you choose would you do the romance novel or would you do business or would you do so well just because I have such a networking business that I could just crush it off the bass yeah but romance novels I know this from experience cuz I've invested in these types of things romance novels have to have the highest liquidity PS and people consume them the most right so I like voracious readers 5 5 times the number of romance category is probably one of the most it's probably the most popular category on Kindle yeah I bet you it is so okay personally I would start here but if I even slightly was interested in romance novels I would and I like what this guy did buying the rights to the Book of the Month Club you know some a popular asset that's sort of decayed over the last thirty years and see if you can revitalize it on the cheap there's interesting businesses there's so many books that I love that are written in the 60s and 70s and you try to buy them on Amazon and there are hundreds of dollars because they've just been forgotten and they don't reprint them right I just try to buy a book the other day for that someone mentioned it on Twitter and it was $900 what book it was so I just tweeted about Agora that's the scammy company which we can talk about if we want but the it was all about copywriting was 900 bucks Wow okay yeah let's talk about Agora okay you want to hear about it okay so Agora is is what it's a b2b paid newsletter company yeah as absurd revenue go to my Twitter account okay so here's another interesting company I know this because I'm in this world and it's directly related to us yeah just yeah that's sampar yeah whatever that's fine okay so agora crazy interesting background so Agora was started by this guy named Bill Bonner in the 1970s he was a publisher he had a magazine about money and investing and things like that and then he decided to start changing how we did his marketing and he created a newsletter that would became quite popular at this point it you'll see it's the most popular one no up higher at this point they make it's rumored to be one and a half to two billion dollars a year and the way that they do this there it is they own 20 to 40 different newsletter publishers and what they do is is they buy a ton of traffic to their funnels their marketing funnels and right off the bat they'll sell you a $50 product right and once you buy that $50 product they now have a large database an email list of qualified buyers who are interested in a particular topic and they typically lose money on this first purchase so let's say that they have a book that's 50 bucks they'll spend up to two hundred dollars to acquire you meaning they'll buy 10 ads and they'll lose money on you but they'll make it up because on that they call a back end on the back end they sell you a $2,000 paid newsletter and this company in particular they even sell supplements and [ __ ] now some people think that they some people love them and when you own 20 or 40 different brands you're gonna have some legitimately great products right so what's their best product money map press.com or yeah money map press so this is for hedge funds for a financial trader no yeah some financial traders they're their typical audience is white men between 50 and 70 who's who who are conservative and believe it like the government's gonna come and like take your money I mean that goes like so I sign up some of their funnels and there was [ __ ] like if you go to Breitbart comm you'll see an ad that says like Nancy Pelosi's coming for your money and things like that and you sign takes you through one of the Agora and it's a five dollar book and then yeah and then you'll go through these funnels if now let's just get rid of the whole unethical part because you can learn from everyone who cares if it's unethical or ethical it's fascinating regardless and you could learn from it what they're experts at is copywriting and everyone in Silicon Valley not everyone but you know you get the point it's all about design its kind of look good it's gonna be aesthetic their websites are a blank page with text right not just text but like [ __ ] 5,000 words in a buy now button at the very bottom it's quite fascinating that is fascinating and I think you're you know you know that Peter teal quote where it's like what's something you believe to be true that for you would agree with you on yeah I feel like you know you might have many but one of them would be copywriting over design any day copywriting over design 100% and most people I remember when I learned the word copywriting so say what is it what is copy why does everyone keep saying this and like I literally was at work and people like hey can you give me some copy as a coffee what she just asked me go get a coffee for her like I had no idea what the [ __ ] she was talking about and and then I sort of learned Oh copy means text that's gonna come on the website and then through you I realized hey wait a minute the text that's on your website is essentially your sales man and sales gives you the money I probably learn how to do this how did I waiting deep on it it's the most important skill you can learn because I've spent years learning it if you just give me a blank page I will I will make money till I die right I will always have a job because I could do that now what I could do is do really unethical [ __ ] and scam a lot of people really easily but if you know how to copyright do you know how to persuade via the written word yeah I would say persuasion is the most important skill whether it's through the written word verbally you I don't know if there's some of you have a copyright variation copywriting just the form in which you learn it now the way that I describe it is if you're a good copywriter you understand what motivates people and if you understand what motivates people you can create products that they'll want that will appeal to people yeah and then if you are cut that is that's the when you do copywriting you just learn what motivates people and then you just happen to use the written word to write communicate yeah when when you mentioned the boron letters and then I just went deep on that that was like my foray into this so we'll do a whole section on did you read the copy right yes and then I started like doing all the things in it because I got obsessed so the boron letters if anyone's curious Gary Halbert is his name he's dead now he died of a heart attack she kind of hard to find it's hard to find but there's one link and if you get to it's like chapter one two three nineteen or whatever it's this copywriter who's one of the best copy writers of all time and what he would do is he was such a good copywriter that he kind of turned into a crook and so he would write these sales letters to buy like encyclopedias or and buy like [ __ ] anything just [ __ ] so the boron letters are the way it stars it's like he's writing to his son he's in jail he's in jail writing to his son and he doesn't start off by being like here's how you copy right he's just writing to his son and it's one by one and each one's a teaser every sentence teases the next sentence and every letter teases the next letter and then by the time you get twenty deep you're like this guy's a master it is awesome so read that alright what do you guys Sean a couple others okay so here's an idea so I was talking to my cousin and we were talking about like one of my cousin's he's young he goes on dates uses the apps boom boom boom and then like our aunts and uncles are always like oh my God look at him he's just swiping left and right he goes on dates it's like really foreign concept to them and so that was one data point okay just kind of notice wow my aunts and uncles they really don't get it when it comes to this online dating thing data point - I'm watching the debate and it was I watched so much [ __ ] online that when I watched traditional TV first of all it's so slow and secondly I start to see the commercials and I'm like oh this is what's being advertised to mainstream America like cars it's very fascinating so like Noom was on there which is like the diet like nutrition plan thing they do really really well you know I'm we should break them down later they advertise but the other one was some it was the this gray-haired woman comes on the on the screen and she's like Oh online dating where do I start and then it's like well open up your browser type wwm to RL it's like and then start clicking around like that was literally that was the ad was like how do I even get started as like here's how you get started online dating I remember the name oh come on it wasn't like a match or I'd never heard of it before so I started thinking and I was like you know there's so many people that are sort of in my sort of extended family and whatnot that are divorced and they're alone and so I was thinking about them I was like you know it'd be great if they found someone but the reality is they don't do a lot of online dating because it's so scary in foreign and it's not the online part that's scary it's the expectation that you then need to go meet somebody and so like let's take my uncle for example my uncle's I don't know 65 years old he is divorced he gets lonely his kids are all grown up everyone left the house and you know he doesn't want to actually like it'd be great if he met somebody who was awesome and they could just like be companions for there stood life but he's sort of like dude I don't want to get out there like last time I went on a date was 40 years ago like I think I'm just out of the game it's easier to be lonely than it is to put yourself out there so anyways long preamble for the idea the idea is a service that's for older people let's make it just 50 and up as a rule and it's called just talking and the expectation is you're gonna go out here with other people who are like you are sort of single might be alone looking for companionship but it's just talking you can't meet it's not their real names it's nothing it's just somebody you could log onto the computer and just talk to either through audio or text and you could talk to them continuously or you could switch and pick somebody else and talk to them but it's just companionship as a service for and it's not dating you're not gonna start going out with this person you're not trying to get remarried you're just getting the reps in you just don't want to be lonely at home anymore and honestly you can have a virtual relationship you know through this and it's because I was also watching love is blind so and I was like dude somebody should make an app that's just this now off the back of the idea and so anyways these are sort of some ideas what do you learn about it by I love it I love it whitter that's a winner what I would do is I would go and do research on the sex hotlines that used to exist that probably don't exist anymore right and I would want to learn how they work I bet they crushed so I'll shout out something like tangentially related so sex hotline related but obvious answer P so wonder sex that killed it then there's one startup out here in San Francisco called Papa have you heard of this Papa yeah Papa is grandkids as a service so it's just young people but you that will just come over to your grandparents house and just do stuff for them and like talk to them but like also do their laundry and like take out that trash I don't know if they're doing well or not they just launched it raised a bunch of money and because there's this huge aging population of the baby boomers and so there's this wealth of opportunities that are for the this the largest generation of people ever in America is now getting old and I forgot this woman was calling it the the the gray new world and you know for gray hair so she's like you know the gray new world opens up all these possibilities so one is Papa which is gang kids as a service one is honor because I know honor there's a huge shortage of caretakers for for the elderly and so honor is a on demand caretaker platform that you know track here are you going with caring for old people or helping people get laid I'm talking about just talking that's my idea but I was just tangentially saying there's some other businesses that are trying to help this population here what do they do never heard of that no jack invested in it and he says it's going well it's called a relationship hero relationship hero calm and they teach you how to do online dating okay just coaching for all my dating go can you go to pull that out that's how it started as it might be a little bit different for you this would be for younger people though maybe for whoever I think if you did just talking and you ran a bunch of Facebook ads you could get a lot of people to pay to be a part of a community of people where they can have these online relationships aisle expectation is you do not go offline I think it's great no I think it's great is because the way the way that you're positioning it is is as a marketplace those are notoriously hard to make but once you have them they're great yeah the reason why I like this is you can kind of fake it at first yeah so you can just hire people you can have some operators yeah better than providing that companion I think it's a great idea you could seed the marketplace with the operators yeah I think it's awesome we talked about only fans yeah that's training today on Twitter is it yeah worldwide because of what some strikes it got down I didn't get the joke I clicked on it and try to understand it and I didn't right I didn't get it one out of three Twitter trends yeah yeah it was a top only fans which we talked about only fans great business but I love just talking I think it I think that's a great idea thank you thank you for thank you very much no I think that's that's a winner all right I have a question for you now so before last week I think maybe was when I was with Stu but I I shared this anecdote or this this sort of advice which was if you're offered to see it on a rocket ship you know don't ask which seat just sit down and buckle up and this is just career advice which is if you're not going to start your uncommon flack for it did I yeah I thought people loved it well but what was what was the criticism based on it wasn't even controversial just stuff like titles it was just comments like people saying titles are important how much you get paid is more important things like that that's crazy disagree hard disagree okay so anyways the question was sort of that led to a different question which is what are the rocket ships of today and so somebody by the way took that idea and made of rocket ship newsletter for jobs or whatever but beyond that I was just sort of thinking just my thought experiment what companies that today are worth 1 to 5 billion do I believe will be multi hundred billion so what's it just as a way of phrasing it simpler what five billion dollar company today could become a five hundred billion dollar company in the future I say this because we have friends who bought Facebook secondary stock back in 2006 2007 when Facebook was valued at over a billion dollars and today Facebook's like whatever five hundred billion dollar company and that you know it was clear it wasn't going to zero it was clear it was a thing and the question but you could have invested then and got a phenomenal return and I have several friends who did I had a friend Alex oh no sorry Josh Buckley who's a good guy founder and British guy yeah British guy he's and so he he was telling me we were just hanging out one day he's like yeah I'm buying secondary stock of stripers my I can get and I was like what do you mean like I'm not doing that why why are you doing that I should do that and he was like yeah I just think stripes a great company and there's secondary stock available and I'm just buying it I'm like well what's the valuation it's already like a two billion dollar company he's like yeah but it's like trips gonna be big he's a guy thinks trips gonna be huge so I'm just buying up secondary and now so stripes Valley bound like 20 billion dollars so he took essentially like a no risk pet in my opinion and 10 next his money on a private company that was there was already a unicorn but wasn't yet on the stock market it wasn't doing like 10% a year you know that's a 10x appreciation so long story short what companies do you think have that potential that are in the single-digit billions today or less that you think could be a Facebook Google Amazon of our generation so a few years ago I answered this question and I thought it was Atlassian and I went in on that and it worked okay tell me about that what you mean it worked back then it was you just look look go ahead and relook go to a laughingstock you're busy today I invested lasting in stock it's not like I like yeah I'd let at last seen smoke with an 8080 there it is yeah and then go to all-time I bought at laughs max on the far right I bought it when it when it went public so what did they go up by it's like a 3x already so I 3x my money so I bought a glass Ian because I read their annual report I was like oh these guys are great their market caps now 35 billion yeah so I bought it right when it went out so that worked so well what do you think could get to the over a hundred billion it's very hard to get over a hundred billion how many companies are worth over 100 billion like very very few especially if you think about tech companies so some of the tech companies that made it Amazon made it Google made it Microsoft made it Facebook made it uber did not quite make it yet but it's given their Tesla made it like I think I invested in Tesla when it was at about this number five five to eight billion oh really and now it's almost 100 billion and so like that's that's a big lift of a company that it's out there it's not a seed same startup you're taking a bet on right it's a company that's out there and the other way to take the bet on it even if you're not an investor is to go work at one of these companies right so like Airbnb was a good candidate now it's valued too high to qualify for this everybody's like it I don't know 35 billion or something like that we'll see it what happens with this but it's not in a single digit billions anymore but when we when we moved to San Francisco we could have done that right when I moved as happens you I had a job offer at Airbnb when it was worth billion 1 billion maybe less I don't know there was only knows less it was dozen 12 right so so let's just say was that a billion which it wasn't but let's say it was yeah I would have made 10 million dollars it's 35 X so even if you had just gotten a sort of standard stock package which was like over four years you're gonna get 200 grand made five or ten million dollars yeah that's insane and I got fired before I even showed up to work so some other candidates that I put up here flex port I think as a candidate maybe you got some inside Intel that sounded like a juicy maybe well Ryan told me he thinks it's gonna be massive or to go bankrupt which is like how you gonna be when you that's how you some other this was harder than I thought I also tweeted this out so the most popular answers I got was air table and Carta and I pretty much disagree with both of those I don't know I and I asked these are smart people replying and I was like Carter why Carter we should get Carter response to this podcast by the way yeah why are they not I don't know you guys see a sponsor and I'm gonna I don't give a [ __ ] a bit people sponsor I'm gonna tell you the truth Carter it's the best option out there but it still needs a lot to improve right I use it I give you guys five grand a year I'm happy that I give you the money but it can improve yeah so err table err table it would have to basically replace Excel in the corporate world for it to do this otherwise it will not be a hundred billion dollar company how about gust oh gosh does a good one so I think there's a lot that are in the sort of either HR tech just you need to be a huge spotlight just oh and rippling ya go so rippling I think I would be 100 billion is a high bar but yeah so other ones I that I put up here so stripe but it's past this point so coinbase only if the big if bitcoin actually becomes like a bitcoin actually is the thing it becomes the global reserve currency then well it doesn't have the largest bitcoin sort of company the large bitcoin brand would be i think they become Bank of America can become Wells Fargo yeah but I think Bitcoin has to become that relevant for coinbase to be yeah I buy that open door is another one just because residential real estate is so big so if they actually have a working model they could become a hundred billion dollar company I don't buy that because what because Zillow and Trulia aren't that huge they don't do what these guys do though Zillow and Trulia they sell leads to brokers they're now trying to copy opened doors and now they offer what kokand are offers but open doors literally buying and selling the houses they're flipping houses at scale which is pretty crazy what else this was tough I know that's a lot but I put this on here I wasn't gonna talk about it initially but I'm like I want to bring this up I want people to tell me what I'm wrong about what companies I should be considering in this but I think it's a really important question because for me I'm gonna go try to buy secondary stock and all these company okay so I don't and if you're working you should go work at one of these companies a hundred billion is that's impossible I won't even I'm not gonna try to pick that because like only like a few hundred people or fewer a few hundred businesses have ever probably done that I don't know the number but that's really hard to say but if I had to make a prediction I do think that there will be some new search engines and I also think that some of the new chrome replacements could be quite large so brave is one of them what's another one I'm placing the browser yeah anything that are replacing browsers I think are kind of cool and could potentially be that big I think there's gonna be a lot of browser I think if any company nails a are they will they will be able to do this but that's not ways away I believe how about a zoosk Duke's self-driving car company yeah yeah so that was the other I I considered all the self-driving car companies cuz I'm like if if one of them becomes a success a self a successful self-driving car company the market leader will be worth over a hundred billion it's just more likely I believe is more likely to be Tesla or one of the incumbents rather they'll buy one of these companies rather than that company independently going from where it is today which is 1 billion two hundred billion how about this what companies are public now that could grow that much so I was talking to Moyes the other day and we were looking at stamps calm you know crazy undervalued and the next day we were like let's buy this the next day we didn't buy in time it went up fifty percent went up 50 percent it was coincidental just I saw the interesting stat over the last 10 years if you're just brought bought the fang companies at Facebook Amazon Apple Google in the ten years it outperformed all VCS or sorry it I'll perform even this sort of top like expected returns of venture capital so the public market if you just bought the five most popular tech stocks you did better as a twenty twenty four percent IRR over ten years okay well what what's public now that could I don't [ __ ] know that's a great question it's that's hard you got a really bet on industries what do you got sports betting good that's a good that's good and if the legislation keeps opening up that's a good call I would do sports betting I would bet on that industry that's a great call okay we ventured off into stock tips so I want to get back because we don't know [ __ ] about the stock market that's not our that's not our promise let's tell them something else that we find interesting what else you got you want to do one more I'll mention one of the cool company that's related to stocks actually public comps calm so public comps yeah he's just breaking down s ones for companies which like a lot of people like to do nowadays but it's just a good you don't have to do the research this guy does the research for you and he publishes it I like it let's do uh let's do let's wrap up with made renovation you talked about this in one of our very first podcast exactly so one of the very first ones was like hey I saw this ad I think this is awesome idea what it is if you don't remember because you're not a die-hard the what it was is it's a turnkey bathroom renovation so if you want your bath and so the ad was just a dope looking bathroom and it was like if you want this bathroom it's like five grand and you don't have to like because what happens today you have to hire a contractor you have to come up with the vision board of what you want to be you have to choose all these different materials then he sources it and then it turns out and then it's like that's a one-off so they have like four designs of bathrooms you just pick which one you want you want the old Victorian cool-looking one you want the modern one or you want the middle-of-the-road one yeah we said I wish barboursville and here's the price and you just push the button yes it's like actually some barbers do this you go up on the haircuts like three yeah I'll take the number three large you know you know no problem so that's what they're these guys are doing for bathrooms I thought that was really smart so it turns out this was not just like some random started this is Roger Dickie was starting this and he's a he started gigster he's done some cool stuff in Silicon Valley before so he's not a sort of Joker and they raised 9 million bucks and they came out of stealth and I was like I gave myself a little pat on the back that's a good one that's a good call that's a pretty good call I still things a very cool idea and I also think that anybody could compete with them because this will not be winner-take-all because you have to be doing local renovations look at that a city's they announced it this week good job yeah can I get myself a pat on the back yeah one of my first angel investments Lucy Lucy nicotine calm I think I don't even know what the URL is to be honest you explain what it is people don't know yeah so I invested it all your way all your friends are buying Lucy [ __ ] yeah money the bag yeah hey so one of my first angel investments I don't remember when this was three years ago the founder of Soylent Dave who's my friend Dave ran town run ten he started this thing and it was based it's basically a Nicorette so it's right anyways Nicorette nicotine gum and he told me about it and i was like alright well dave you started Soylent so you're pretty smart you scaled that thing up yeah I knew him well he's a good guy and it's an it's a big market its nicotine so I'm like okay well I mean this is retentions gonna be good yeah I'm I'm a nicotine user I like the gum I chew the gum and I like those shoes Nicorette yeah I like to my preferred lozenger so I'll put them in my mouth okay and but you don't smoke so you just do this just like a team I like nicotine it's I don't I don't smoke it's it's it's my that's my vice and and it's a monthly subscription yeah I was like yeah yeah of course you'll [ __ ] knock that one out the park really smart and they just raised a lot more money and so on paper which is completely useless on papers not gonna buy me a house or pay my rent but the evaluation went up significantly so I got a little my corner store guy has it at the front by the register and I said okay whatever is at the front by the register that's what's selling that's what wait we'll make money it's it really I I did I sent Dave a picture I was like no [ __ ] Henry although the guy the guy I asked him I said how well does this sell he's like he's pretty good it's not Jules but it's pretty good are the kids are buying Nick Lucy oh [ __ ] yeah yeah pay the taxes on it money in the bag I I think that's a 5 or 6 X so far I'm proud that would be a good investment I like that one that would be nice I think we were one of the first folks in on that one fucking-a I hope it works and just for the while it is awesome I it's totally luck so I'm not that much credit but awesome alright you want to talk about anything else uh no I think we're good I think we're good let's sit the save it we're gonna do another one in two days I got some other stuff for that all right thank you give us a review and share with your friends yeah tell your friends so yeah

okay yeah talk about Agora okay you want to hear about it okay so Agora is is what it's a b2b paid newsletter company yeah has absurd revenue go to my Twitter account okay so here's another interesting company I know this because I'm in this world and it's directly related to us yeah just yeah the same par yeah whatever that's fine okay so Agora crazy interesting background so Agora was started by this guy named Bill Bonner in the 1970s he was a publisher he had a magazine about money and investing and things like that and then he decided to start changing how we did his marketing and he created a newsletter that would became quite popular at this point it you'll see it's the most popular one no up higher at this point they make it's rumored to be one and a half to two billion dollars a year and the way that they do this there it is they own 20 to 40 different newsletter publishers and what they do is is they buy a ton of traffic to their funnels their marketing funnels and right off the bat they'll sell you a fifty dollar product right and once you buy that fifty dollar product they now have a large database and email list of qualified buyers who are interested in a particular topic and they typically lose money on this first purchase so let's say that they have a book that's 50 bucks they'll spend up to two hundred dollars to acquire you meaning they'll buy ten of ads and they'll lose money on you but they'll make it up because on that they call a back end on the back end they sell you a two thousand dollar paid newsletter and this company in particular they even sell supplements and [ __ ] now some people think that they some people love them and when you own twenty or forty different brands you're gonna have some legitimately great products right so what's their best product money map press.com or yeah money map press this is for hedge funds for a financial trader no yes some financial traders they're their typical audience is white men between 50 seventy who-who-who are conservative and believe in like the government's gonna come and like take your money I mean that goes like so I sign up some of their funnels and there was [ __ ] like if you go to Breitbart comm you'll see an ad it says like Nancy Pelosi's coming for your money and things like that and you sign it takes you through one of the Agora and it's a five dollar book and then yeah and then you'll you'll go through these funnels if now let's just get rid of the whole unethical part because you can learn from everyone who cares if it's unethical or ethical it's fascinating regardless and you can learn from it what they're experts at is copywriting and everyone in Silicon Valley not everyone but you know you get the point it's all about design it's kind of look good it's gotta be aesthetic their websites are a blank page with text right not just text but like [ __ ] 5,000 words in a buy now button at the very bottom its value fascinating that is fascinating and I think you're you know you know that Peter teal quote where it's like what's something you believe to be true that for you would agree with you on yeah I feel like you know you might have many but one of them would be copywriting over design any day copywriting over design 100% most people when I learned the word copywriting those like what does what does copy why does everyone keep saying this and like I literally was at work and people like hey can you give me some copy as a coffee what she just asked me to go get a coffee for her like I had no idea what the [ __ ] she was talking about and and then I sort of learned Oh copy means text that's gonna come on the website and then through you I realized hey wait a minute the text that's on your website is essentially your sales man and sales gives you the money I probably learn how to do this not am I waiting deep on it it's the most important skill you can learn because I've spent years learning it if you just give me a blank page I will I will make money till I die right I will always have a job because I could do that right now what I could do is do really unethical [ __ ] and scam a lot of people really easily but if you know how to copyright do you know how to persuade via the written word yeah I would say persuasion is the most important skill whether it's through the written word verbally you know I don't know if there's some of you have a copyright variation copywriting just the form in which you learn it now the way that I describe it is if you're a good copywriter you underst dan what motivates people and if you understand what motivates people you can create products that they'll want that will appeal to people yeah and then if you are kind that is that's the when you do copywriting you just learn what motivates people and then you just happen to use the written word to write communicate yeah when when you mentioned the boron letters and then I just went deep on that that was like my foray into this so we'll do a whole section on did you read the copyright yes and then I started like doing all the things in it because I got obsessed so the boron letters if anyone's curious Gary Halbert is his name he's dead now he died of a heart attack she kind of hard to find it's hard to find but there's one link and if you get to it's like chapter 1 2 3 19 or whatever it's this copywriter who's one of the best copy writers of all time and what he would do is he was such a good copywriter that he kind of turned into a crook and so he would write these sales letters to buy like encyclopedias or and buy like [ __ ] anything just [ __ ] so the boron letters are the way it starts it's like he's writing to his son he's in jail he's in jail writing to his son and he doesn't start off by being like here's how you copy right he's just writing to his son and it's one by one and each one's a teaser every sentence teases the next sentence and every letter teases the next letter and then by the time you get 20 deep you're like this guy's a master it is awesome [Music] you

whatever you want to give I had this blog post I used to try to blog about business back in the day and when we were doing our very first startup right out of college and none of my posters got read by anybody nobody cared but one post went semi viral and it was called the first curse advantage and basically I was saying how in a meeting the first person who who uses a curse word sort of establishes himself as the person who just doesn't give a [ __ ] about the there they put themselves in a position of power and it also builds a different level of rapport because you're obviously using informal language with somebody else and you're demonstrating that you're not seeking their approval in a way and so I always in meetings I do this I try to be the first to curse in a meeting what can I say I don't love that and I'm like because you don't like cursing in general I mean I actually when I hear myself curse I'm like a man I sound kind of trashy I agree I don't like when I hear myself do it and I think I'd do it too much but I've noticed in meetings it changes the dynamic like instantly and for better for worse but I've but I think the difference between being crude and freeing cursing actually so like saying [ __ ] I [ __ ] hate right my god you see that so I don't like when people say that quick quick story before we get into this I went I got married in September yeah and I had to go I got a merry Catholic Church and you gotta go meet with the priest ahead of time and I was really nervous cuz I don't I don't I'm not practicing I don't go to church and but I wanted I the whole wedding was they have to approve it and the whole wedding was on the line right so I had to like be a good Catholic and or at least appear like one and I remember I was sitting there and the guy was asking the priest was asking me and my wife my future wife about like so do you guys agree on children what do you think about birth control all this stuff or whatever he's asking and I would just say whatever I thought had to be so right and I was very nervous I was like yes sir yes we go to church like I just said all everything and then my phone rings and I was so nervous I go I go oh [ __ ] sorry really loud and then he looked at me it was like [ __ ] my bad I didn't because and I I was so embarrassed that's amazing yeah but he let it go he let it go good guy yeah he let it go I thought I made a joke about how I was asked him what school he went to and he said he had lost student debt and he said he's like yeah but there's a young guy young like in his 30s maybe late thirties and he said but the church pays for it and I made like a joke like ah so that's why you joined and you didn't appreciate that he didn't like that [Music]

#thehustle #businessmodel #traderjoe's

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
okay so there was a great write-up in the trends Facebook group by this guy Morgan or girl Morgan I'm not sure exactly but Morgan key and it was talking about hey the founder of Trader Joe's just died I think Joe I don't know how you say the last name but Joe from Trader Joe's passed away and you know so he dug into the model and said what is it that makes Trader Joe's work and there's a bunch of really fascinating things where they basically broke all of the rules and I thought it was just like a great example of of like you know when you want to do something different or you want to like make a splash in an industry like it pays to just change a bunch of the rules so some of the things that they do differently so they go through the rules so they most grocery stores have a ton of SKUs they're like oh people want all the options we got to carry everything that people asked for Trader Joe's has on average I think 4,000 SKUs an average per store will be 40,000 so 1/10 the number of SKUs the next thing that I thought was interesting was they over staff not under staff so every other grocer was trying to sort of have minimal labor costs and they go the exact opposite direction and try to provide like an experience for shopping they private label basically all of their goods so how do you okay great i over stat possible i over staff but that's like expensive so where do they make their money back they make their money back by not buying you know not by buying wholesale and selling retail they actually just private label their stuff and have a way bigger margin on their items so what's an example of that so like their tomato sauce for example they will have our salsa it'll be called Trader Joe's salsa and people will be like oh I love Trader Joe's salsa and it's actually the same exact salsa that somebody else carries they go straight to that supplier or manufacturer and they say hey we want our own line of this and so it's usually a junior Joe's isn't making it no they they go to supplier but they private label the that exact item oh I didn't know they carry it they can't they get a much bigger margin because they're cutting out the sort of retailer and they have all this pricing power to go to suppliers with and say hey we have all these locations so we are already a big customer from day one we want you to give us our own brand popcorn our own brand of this or I'm Brenda that and then on the other side that makes customers love it because people will get addicted to this and they think oh that pret well that chocolate-covered pretzel I loved I can only get it at Trader Joe's because there's no brand on it but they could actually get that same thing they just don't know the brand and it's from some other I felt that exact same way about a lot of their products and so there was a there's a few other ones that I thought were interesting I'm gonna dig it up but talk for a second while I just so you guys a quick story so we're talking about scaling i talked to max Mullen at house economy listen to this story he told me that when they first started who's max small max Mullen started instacart he goes he goes our first store was Trader Joe's and they wouldn't let us go in there and they wouldn't give us all their inventory he goes I took it goes it cost 25 grand I bought everything in the store we brought it to apartment took a photo took pictures of every single thing I loved it it was twenty five thousand dollars he goes one of everything was about 25 grand and he did that with Whole Foods and then five other stores that's amazing okay a couple other points that Morgan brought up so no data collection so they're not collecting data on their customers they don't do sales coupons loyalty or or advertising the biggest expense of their marketing is samples in the store so they go above and beyond on samples and don't do a whole bunch of other promotional stuff they expand it very slowly so they've about 500 locations after 50 years and so they really went sort of slow and steady with their growth sort of like in and out or whatever and are they owned by someone at the moment private company I don't think they got bought by a parent I think it's literally like owned by the original whoever's there's a couple people involved and so in the end their price per sorry their earnings per square foot in their store so they'll earn $2,000 per square foot revenue and like Whole Foods would do 1.2 K and then you know Walmart will do 600 K so they're way more profitable per square foot because of our sort way more revenue per square foot because of these these different changes they made to the standard model obviously I dig that I we should I don't know why we didn't that I think it's a 10 billion dollar company overall I thought they were owned by all these reason you might be right I don't know on that but shout out to Morgan I thought there's a great breakdown love it do more of that in the groups we love this stuff and we'll share the information because yet more people need to learn from this stuff so that's actually an interesting take which is what are the interesting components that make something special so we're doing this thing that we're gonna publish on Tuesday on hotels and I thought that that was really interesting and so it's not live yet so I haven't been able to read all of it but basically a lot of the largest hotel chains what they do is they don't actually own the property I mean sorry sometimes they own the property but it's all franchised yeah and so 90% of their money is made via franchising Hilton's Marriott's whatever yeah I had no idea yeah and so that's one of like the secret sauces which is you have to do franchising and it's really expensive like could be ten million dollars to start a Marriott franchise right very expensive that's not that expensive ten thousand that's cheap for sorry I said ten million oh okay yeah that's a lot it's crazy and so what we've been doing on trends and what I always loved doing which is what's like what's like the the thing that makes something special what makes it tick yeah so for example what software typically it's just what makes a great software business is like there's I'm just riffing here but I'd have to find the exact numbers but it's like are is the annual revenue per customer at least $5,000 can you make it so churn is only 4% a month and then there's a probably only one or two more rules but it's usually churn and can it be at least five grand a year for a SAS business retirement yeah and so I love seeing those like yeah you want so what investors do is they see so many deals and they talked to so many founders and they do this for a number of years they get to see how these play out they start to do what they call pattern recognition which has pros and cons the pros is great you can recognize a good thing when it's a good thing the con is if you're trying to make everything fit your pattern you'll miss the outliers and that's a that's a big issue but but it's worth it's still a tool in your tool belt that you should have so I feel like it should this should not just be investors that do this this would be entrepreneurs as well so you should be looking at different businesses industries breaking them down listening to podcasts like this or others and trying to identify the patterns of commonalities and try to characterize okay what made that business tick what made this have a different outcome than that what are the sort of minimum requirements on let's say churn or customer you know customer you for a SAS business to work and start to get these rules of thumb or like kind of common patterns in place in your brain yeah and what what I've been trying to do is figure it figure out those on on all types of things yeah and that's been exciting [Music] you

#thehustle #bookclub

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
we were gonna talk I was gonna talk about this a few weeks ago okay so um when I moved to San Francisco I started a book club called the anti MBA and I did it because I didn't go to an elite Ivy League school but I was always envious of those people because when I moved here I didn't know a single soul and I felt I always like stereotypes people is like tall beautiful white teeth with Patagonia's and they had like lovely networks that you saw all around ya just like these like rich white people who that's how I was like right that's how I imagined it and it kind of was that and I was always envious of that so what I did was I create a book club meeting where we would meet every week and we would read one book a month and I would convince an expert how did you convince people to join this where'd you throw it up a cold email guy I just learned how to cold email people and I I did it online so each week we would have 30 people show up and I probably had an email list of 5000 people who would I was not in person this is all online 30 people in person see Ava yeah a lot of my best friends I met this way 30 people my friend had an office and he let me use it and we would just meet up and I would and I would read a week ahead of time and just make notes and lead discussion and sometimes we would have an expert okay and then I would send show notes or meeting notes to the list and people loved it I made close to no money off of it or I don't think I made any money off it I just did it for fun and it was very success successful and a lot of people said that we should make it a thing I think it's a stupid I thought it was a stupid idea but what clubs are actually kind of interesting so there's this business called book-of-the-month Club it was started and I believe it was started in the 1930s at this point it's owned by it was owned by Bertelsmann which is a large publisher of multi billion-dollar publisher and then recently a private individual bought it for single-digit millions of dollars in in the 40s 50s and 60s this was massive I mean it was millions of people paid for so it was quite a large business hundreds of millions of dollars probably in the 60s and 70s it's gone away once Amazon came around a guy bought it a couple years ago it's quite large still and what they do is score down a little bit this is 90 million users what the hell no that's Goodreads oh that's good range and so look at the Month Club now has a hundred thousand active paying customers Wow which means they're in the revenue range of ten to fifteen million a year in recurring revenue and they the founder said in an interview he want his goal is to grow 5x a year for the next year not consistently I don't know if that's I think that's bogus but Book of the Month is kind of an interesting thing I suspect I've always thought that it would would not work now my opinion has changed so Goodreads has a hundred million users there's this thing called Wattpad have you heard of Wattpad I've heard of it yeah what Pat a lot of people don't know about it Wattpad it's owned by a guy in Canada and they have 400 employees it's a multiple hundred million dollar a year business I believe they it's a book club for it's not a book club it's more write on it you you write original stories yeah but it's the categories roman middle middle america romance novels so if you're a 40 year old woman you probably have heard a lot pat you're saying that's the most popular category or yeah buddy much all they do oh really okay it's basically for women who it's like men do video porn romance novels is woman porn basically and so huge business and now I'm quite bullish now on these book clubs yeah Reese Witherspoon has a book club my wife uses it my sister used so many people have you heard of this no sunshine some [ __ ] thing Oprah had hers but hers wasn't on paid membership but this is really smart like what you're describing I'm like oh this is good I think you gotta have probably not gotta have but it's advantageous here to have a brand like a Reese Witherspoon or whoever Jennifer Aniston or Gwyneth Paltrow or whoever or like the hustle could do a book club you could do a book club like I think that you have to have a bit of cachet to organize people around to get the energy going that initial energy so here's one angle you buy the rights to the book which is expensive yeah why would you do that well because I think the margins and books are quite small I've talked to Tim Ferriss about this he told me that he earns I he didn't say that he didn't tell me this but he told me I mean I think that he does about a million a month in revenue off his podcast and he told me that he this what he did tell me he has made 10 times more money off the podcast and all of his books combined right so I I don't think people get paid a lot of money for books March it might be a cheap asset you're saying yeah I think it's quite cheap so I would one-up my goal would be to buy the rights to the book and make it popular you know who have you heard of um there's this company that owns the company that owns Proactiv it's called God I know what you're talking about it's a skincare it's a direct marketing company they the guy who owns it it's a quite large business he got his start because he bought the rights to think & Grow Rich oh really and he helped to make it popular again oh wow through infomercials so that's what I would do is I would want to buy the rights to all the books and there's another company called Mentor box that does this and tie loop has is one of the owners so it's incredibly scamming I mean like you sign up for like $20 and then it rolls into like a $400 a month thing it's like [ __ ] stupid but book clubs are super interesting to me so would you do this like if you were gonna do this now how would you attack it what would you do so you buy the right so that you buy the right if I wanted to bootstrap it no you can't how would you do it so what I would do is I would look at what you've I know me please vinyl me please is my friends business it's a probably a couple million bucks a month subscription things so what you do is you give them $50 a month and they send you a vinyl once a month right and so I would do that but for a particular type of category so what I would do is how to create a Facebook group and I would say it's $30 or $50 a month and we're gonna read one book a month I'm gonna get one expert to come and talk about the book each week or each month we're gonna do in a Facebook group and I'm gonna send you notes about the whole and what category do you think you choose would you do the romance novel or would you do business or would you do well just because I have such a networking business that I could just crush it up the baddest yeah but romance novels I know this from experience cuz I've invested in these types of things romance novels have them have the highest liquidity PS and people consume them the most right so I like voracious readers five five times the number of bromance category is probably one of the most it's probably the most popular category on Kindle yeah I bet you it is so okay I personally I would start here but if I even slightly was interested in romance novels I would and I like what this guy did buying the rights to the Book of the Month Club further you know some a popular asset that's sort of decayed over the last thirty years and see if you can revitalize it on the cheap there's interesting businesses there's so many books that I love that are written in the 60s and 70s and you try to buy them on Amazon and they're hundreds of dollars because they've just been forgotten and they don't reprint them right I just try to buy a book the other day for that someone mentioned it on Twitter and it was $900 book it was so I just tweeted about Agora that's the scammy company which we can talk about if we want but the it was all about copywriting was 900 bucks [Music] you

#thehustle #100billion

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
I have a question for you now so before last week I think maybe was when I was with Stu but I I shared this anecdote or this this sort of advice which was if you're offered to see it on a rocket ship you know don't ask which seat just sit down and buckle up and this is just career advice which is if you're not gonna start your own cup for it did I yeah I thought people loved it what do you mean well but what was what was the criticism based on and wasn't even controversial just stuff like titles it was just comments like people saying titles are important how much we get paid is more important things like that that's crazy disagree hard disagree okay so anyways the question was sort of that led to a different caution which is what are the rocket ships of today and so somebody by the way took that idea and made of rocket ship newsletter for jobs or whatever but beyond that I was just sort of thinking just my thought experiment what companies that today are worth 1 to 5 billion do I believe will be multi hundred billion so what's it just as a way of phrasing it simpler what five billion dollar company today could become a five hundred billion dollar company in the future I say this because we have friends who bought Facebook secondary stock back in 2006 and 2007 when Facebook was valued at over a billion dollars and today Facebook's like whatever five hundred billion dollar company and that you know it was clear it wasn't going to see Rove it was clear it was a thing and the question but you could have invested then and got a phenomenal return and I have several friends of it I had a friend Alex oh no sorry Josh Buckley who's a good guy founder and British guy British guy he's and so he he was telling me we were just hanging out one day he's like yeah I'm buying secondary stock of stripe as much as I can get and I was like what do you mean like I'm not doing that why are you doing that I should do that and he was like yeah I just think stripes a great company and there's secondary stock available and I'm just buying it I'm like well what's the valuation it's already like a two billion dollar company he's like yeah but it's like Sharp's gonna be big you think I think stripes gonna be huge so I'm just buying up secondary and now so stripes Valley bound like 20 billion dollars so he took essentially like a no-risk pet in my opinion and 10x his money on a private company that was it was already a unicorn but wasn't yet on the stock market it wasn't doing like 10% a year you know that's a 10x appreciation so long story short what companies do you think have that potential that are in the single-digit billions today or less that you think could be a Facebook Google Amazon of our generation so a few years ago I answered this question and I thought it was Atlassian and I went in on that and I and it worked okay tell me about that what do you mean it worked back then it was you just look look go ahead and relook going on a laughingstock you're busy today I invested it last thing in stock I mean sound like I like yeah I'd let Atlassian spelled with an eighty eighty there it is yeah and then go to all-time I bought at laugh max on the far right I bought it when it when it went public so what did it go up by it's like a 3x already so I 3x my money so I bought a glass e'en because I read their annual report I was like oh these guys are great right their market caps now 35 billion yeah so I bought it right when it went out so that worked so what do you think and get to the over a hundred billion it's very hard to get over a hundred billion how many companies are worth over 100 billion like very very few especially if you think about tech companies so some of the tech companies that made it Amazon made it Google made it Microsoft made it Facebook made it uber did not quite make it yet but it's getting there Tesla made it like I think I invested in Tesla when it was at about this number five five to eight billion oh really and now it's almost 100 billion and so like that so that's a big lift of a company that it's out there it's not a seed same startup you're taking a bet on right it's a company that's out there and the other way to take the bet on it even if you're not an investor just to go work at one of these companies right so like Airbnb was a good candidate now it's valued too high to qualify for this Airbnb is like it I don't know 35 billion or something like that we'll see it what happens with this but it's not in a single-digit billions anymore but when we when we moved to San Francisco we could have done that right when I moved as happens you apply had a job offer at Airbnb when it was worth billion 1 billion maybe less I don't know there was only knows less it was dozen 12 right so so let's just say was that a billion which it wasn't but let's say it was yeah would have made 10 million oh so it's 35 X so even if you had just gotten a sort of standard stock package which was like over four years you're gonna get 200 great I would've made five or ten million dollars yeah that's insane and I got fired before I even showed up to work so some other candidates that I put up here flex port I think is a candidate maybe Messiah Intel that sounded like a juicy maybe well Ryan told me he thinks it's gonna be massive or to go bankrupt which is like how you gonna be when you that's how you some other this was harder than I thought I also tweeted this out so the most popular answers I got was air table in Carta and I pretty much disagree with both of those I don't know under a and I asked these are smart people replying and I was like Carter why card we should get Carter response to this podcast by the way yeah why are they not I don't know you guys see a sponsor and I'm gonna I don't give a [ __ ] about people sponsor I'm gonna tell you the truth Carter it's the best option out there but it still needs a lot to improve right I use it I give you guys five grand a year I'm happy that I give you the money but it can improve yeah so air table air table it would have to basically replace Excel in the corporate world for it to do this otherwise it will not be a hundred billion dollar company how about gussto Gusto's a good one so I think there's a lot that are in the sort of either HR tech just you need to be a huge spotlight dust oh and rippling ya go so rippling I think I would be 100 billions a high bar but yeah so other ones that I put up here so stripe but it's past this point so coinbase only if the big if bitcoin actually becomes like if bitcoin actually is the thing it becomes the global reserve currency then well it doesn't have the largest bitcoin sort of company the large bitcoin brand would be i think it just become Bank of America can become Wells Fargo yeah I think Bitcoin has to become that relevant for coin bits to be yeah I buy that open doors another one just because residential real estate is so big so if they actually have a working model they could become a hundred billion dollar company I don't buy that because what cuz Zillow and Trulia aren't that huge high they don't do what these guys do though Zillow and Trulia they sell leads to brokers they're now trying to copy open doors and now they offer what cookin door offers but open doors literally buying and selling the houses they're flipping houses at scale which is pretty crazy what else this was tough I know that's all I had but I put this on here I wasn't gonna talk about it initially but I'm like I want to bring this up I want people to tell me what I'm wrong about what companies I should be considering in this but I think it's a really important question because for me I'm gonna go try to buy secondary stock and all these company okay so I don't and if you're working you should go work at one of these companies one hundred billion is that's impossible I won't even try I'm gonna try to predict that because like only like a few hundred people I'll feel a few hundred businesses have ever probably done that I don't know the number but that's really hard to say but if I had to make a prediction I do think that there will be some new search engines and I also think that some of the new chrome replacements could be quite large so brave is one of them what's another one I'm placing the browser yeah anything that are replacing browsers I think are kind of cool and could potentially be that big I think there's gonna be a lot of browser I think if any company nails AR they will they will be able to do this but that's not ways away I believe how about a zoosk Suk's self-driving car company yeah yeah so that was the other I I considered all the self-driving car companies cuz I'm like if if one of them becomes a success a self a successful self-driving car company the market leader will be worth over a hundred billion it's just more likely I believe is more likely to be Tesla or one of the incumbents rather they'll buy one of these companies rather than that company independently going from where it is today which is 1 billion two hundred billion how about this what companies are public now that could grow that much so I was talking to Moyes the other day and we were looking at stamps.com you know crazy undervalued and the next day we were like let's buy this the next day we didn't buy in time it went up 50% went up 50% it was coincidental just saw interesting stat over the last 10 years if you just brought bought the fang companies so Facebook Amazon Apple Google in the 10 years it outperformed all VCS or sorry it I'll perform even this sort of top expected returns of venture capital so the public market if you just bought the five most popular tech stocks you did better as a twenty twenty four percent IRR over ten years okay well what what's public now that could I don't [ __ ] know that's a great question it's that's hard you got a really bet on industries [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
speaking of presidential did you want to talk about Bernie is that your first thing I have a thing up there but I didn't research enough but I'll talk about it just quickly so a bunch of people on Twitter were freaking out because Bernie's proposing this tax on vested shares that you haven't actually cash to him yet okay and tech people were like okay there goes the startup scene like what you know if you're on vested shares that they haven't actually received the prop like this company's not liquid and so there are some nuances like it's written here it's taxed on non qualified stock options of at least a hundred thousand you know if you have over a hundred thousand in stock stock options that are vested and your and employees making at least one hundred thirty K so it's not everybody and it's not all types of things so it's not RS use its ISO as I believe okay so I'm not an expert in this stuff at all and I'm not an expert in politics I know what I believe but I don't know the technical Depot well let's agree to talk out of our ass for talks I'm not gonna talk about that actually but here's what I am going to talk about is starting a company and how it worked with us in this wool a lot because I do know that a lot of people think like oh the rich are doing this they don't understand things so when we started the hustle I saved up twenty five thousand dollars to start it with that twenty five thousand dollars I made sixty grand in profit in six weeks which is pretty good and the first year in business was roughly three hundred eighty thousand dollars in revenue and most of it was profit because I paid myself we were in I think we were in LLC I would through two thousand dollars a month in salary salary and that's why I paid my bills my rent was cheap very cheap hundreds of hundreds of dollars a month and I lived off $1,200 beyond that beyond that I was very I lived very very very frugally and then we decided to raise a little bit of money I raised I think three hundred thousand dollars from people at a three and a half million dollar valuation you had to change from being an LLC at this point right yep changed an S corp I think it was an S corp probably C course I don't remember I see this is I'm not an expert in this yeah you want to be a c-corp if you're gonna take investment that's just like you don't have to study all the differences between them but if gonna take like traditional investment they're gonna want you to be a c-corp so we converted it costs five grams to do that at this point we probably had half a million dollars in the mmm $300,000 in the bank account I don't remember between 300 and 500 thousand by the end of our first year and we raised money at a three and a half million dollar valuation and then once we started doing stock options and stuff like that we sign up to Carta and they gave us a let's take all the 409 a yep where we got so that for nine a just values your company at some numbers yeah you guys had revenue so they probably took some standard really value to us and you want it to be low at this stage yeah so they valued us in the millions of dollars of range I don't remember it could have been three and a half it could've been six I don't remember the number whatever these types of businesses are that's what they've done you want it to be low because that's what your share price is that's what your stock options are gonna be if you're an employee you want to get in at the sort of low valuation so when it sells at a high valuation you get this sort of increase in value but if they if the 409a comes back high then you're not gonna get you know as much of a lift on your share and so at this point our 409 a is many tens of millions which is nice that's cool we have a valuable business but when we started it was single-digit millions which was still a lot I was 24 at the time I said I started with $25,000 and I was taking $2,000 a month I was not saving any money right okay I'm not complaining because it worked out but so on paper I was a millionaire multiple millionaire if I had to pay I think there I forget what this I don't want to like act like I know I'm talking about I let's say if I if I had to pay 20% in taxes on that multiple millions of dollars you wouldn't have had I literally wouldn't have had any money to do it right even if I wanted to withdraw money from our business account I would have had to lay people off or right like so when people say such certain people are hoarding money or something like that a lot of times it's not true and I have a lot of founder friends that have businesses that are on paper worth hundreds of millions of dollars right and they have tens of thousands of dollars saved that's a bank account yeah so they're not liquid are you I think people need to and this also happens if you're an employee you leave a company you usually have what they call an exercise window which might be 30 days 60 days 90 days I think that I think the normal 90 days so that gives you three months to come up with the money to buy your options or you lose them yeah and a lot of people don't have that money cuz like you know they leave one company it's a startup and now their shares are worth 80 grand or 180 grand and they need to go they want to go to a different job and now that you need to come up with an 80 or 180 grand to buy out their options and that's not still a guarantee that that money's coming back and often people don't have that money sitting in the bank so they'll forfeit their options which is a true bummer some companies are being cool about it Pinterest a couple others I don't remember movie stripe they increase their exercise window to seven years or six years so they're like look we know this practice a little bit crazy it's hard to come up with that cash and you worked here you earned your shares so we're not gonna try to take those back you have the longer window because we might be private for longer which is kind of a cool trend so when I dub company should do that my w2 income so at this point I make money in 8 or 10 different ways I got loads of things that just it just has added up over time and that's great and I still pay myself a salary I pay myself not that much I'm not the highest paid person here yeah and I but my w2 salary we're gonna be four years old I've been working on this as a project since it was a 14 we're gonna be four years old officially in April I next month I my w2 salary and year one I think was $24,000 a year to maybe thirty six and then year three then I started going higher right because the business was established yeah but my w2 income historically has been low right quite low and so when I saw this and I saw people getting mad at rich people I'm like I bet people thought I was rich you know yeah and you wouldn't have qualified for this because it says you have to be making at least 230 K but like what if I three years at tax on my stock now it would be painful [ __ ] hard yeah you'd be in a really tough spot so you know Bernie I like Bernie this is a little bit crazy this will really screw up the way the startup ecosystem works but it can also adapt I'm not even gonna shake ass today and if I think it's crazy or not I just didn't giving a perspective of my business and I bet and I think I I now I think I have a lot more cash than even most people who have companies that are huge [Music]

#thehustle #50plus #onlinedating

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
a couple others okay so here's an idea so I was talking to my cousin and as we were talking about like one of my cousins he's young he goes on dates uses the apps boom boom boom and then like our aunts and uncles are always like oh my God look at him he's just swiping left and right he goes on dates it's like really foreign concept to them and so that was one data point okay just kind of notice wow my aunts and uncles they really don't get it when it comes to this online dating thing data point - I'm watching the debate and it was I watched so much [ __ ] online that when I watch traditional TV first of all it's so slow and secondly I start to see the commercials and I'm like oh this is what's being advertised to mainstream America like cars it's very fascinating so like Noom was on there which is like the diet like nutrition plan thing they do really really well you know I am we should break them down later they advertise but the other one was some it was the this gray haired woman comes on the on the screen and she's like Oh online dating where do I start and then it's like well open up your browser type www.a and then start clicking around like that was literally that was the ad was like how do I even get started as like here's how you get started online dating I remember the name oh come on it wasn't like a match or I'd never heard of it before so I started thinking and I was like you know there's so many people that are sort of in my sort of extended family and whatnot that are divorced and they're alone and so I was thinking about them I was like you know it'd be great if they found someone but the reality is they don't do a lot of online dating because it's so scary in foreign and it's not the online part that's scary it's the expectation that you then need to go meet somebody and so like let's take my uncle for example my uncles I don't know 65 years old he is divorced he gets lonely his kids are all grown up everyone left the house and you know he doesn't want to actually like it'd be great if he met somebody who was awesome and they could just like be companions for there stood life but he's sort of like dude I don't want to get out there like last time I went on a date was 40 years ago like I think I'm just out of the game it's easier to be lonely than it is to put yourself out there so anyways long pier for the idea the idea is a service that's for older people let's make it just fifty enough as a rule and it's called just talking and the expectation is you're gonna go on here with other people who are like you are sort of single might be alone looking for companionship but it's just talking you can't meet it's not their real names it's nothing it's just somebody you could log onto the computer and just talk to either through audio or text and you could talk to them continuously or you could switch and pick somebody else and talk to them but it's just companionship as a service for and it's not dating you're not gonna start going out with this person you're not trying to get remarried you just get in the reps in you just don't want to be lonely at home anymore and honestly you can have a virtual relationship you know through this and it's because I was also watching love is blind so and I was like dude somebody should make an app that's just this now off the back of the idea and so anyways these are sort of some ideas what do you learn about it by I love it I love it Witter that's a winner what I would do is I would go and do research on the sex hotlines that used to exist that probably don't exist anymore right and I would want to learn how they work I bet they crushed so I'll shout out something like tangentially related so sex hotline related but obvious a surpise or sex that killed it then there's one startup out here in San Francisco called Papa have you heard of this Papa yeah Papa is grandkids as a service so it's just young people but you that will just come over to your grandparents house and just do stuff for them and like talk to them but like also do their laundry and like take out that trash I don't know if they're doing well or not they just launched it raised a bunch of money and because there's this huge aging population of the baby boomers and so there's a wealth of opportunities that are for the this the largest generation of people ever in America is now getting old and I forgot this woman was calling it the the the grey new world and for gray hair so she's like you know the grey new world hood opens up all these possibilities so one is Popeye which is grandkids as a service one is honor because I know honor there's a huge shortage of caretakers for for the elderly and so honor is a on demand caretaker platform that you know so your track here are you going with caring for old people or helping people get laid I'm talking about just talking that's my idea I was just tangentially saying there's some other businesses that are trying to help this relation right here what did they do never heard of that now Jack invested in it and he says it's going well it's called a relationship here relationship here calm and they teach you how to do online dating okay just coaching for all night having go can you go to really pull that out that's how it started as it might be a little bit different for you yeah this would be for younger people that would be for whoever I think if you did just talking and you ran a bunch of Facebook ads you could get a lot of people to pay to be a part of a community of people where they can have these online relationships aisle expectation is you do not go offline I think it's great no I think it's great is because the way the way that you're positioning it is is as a marketplace those are notoriously hard to make but once you have them they're great yeah the reason why I like this is you can kind of fake it at first yeah so you can just hire people you can have some operators yeah better than providing that companion I think it's a great idea you could seed the marketplace with the operators yeah I think it's awesome we talked about only fans yeah that's training today on Twitter is it yeah worldwide because of what some strikes it got down I didn't get the joke I clicked on it and try to understand it and I didn't right I didn't get it one out of three Twitter trends yeah it was a top only fans which we talked about only fans great business but I loved just talking I think I think that's a great idea thank you thank you for thank you very much [Music]

I don't think it's a small trip fine business and you could buy these businesses for cheap hmm find a business that's engineering less so someone who made the software built it okay and you could buy these companies for as cheap as $10,000 or almost ability to me don't matter but you can find there's all these quite like brokers who sponsor this is one of them you can find these widgets or whatever you can buy them for one times revenue and if it's too expensive for you you can put a small business loan you can put only ten sit down so you buy a hundred thousand dollar business that makes a bet for ten grand and if it's engineering lead the likelihood that the pricing is wrong is high yeah so you literally just need to buy a product okay and just change the number on command-f fine Yeah right like command-f dollars relax all right okay why put a zero like you know it's like $1 million $10 mother it's $10 a month making a hundred dollars a month and that's all you did people will [ __ ] and complain to you customers much [ __ ] and complain to you the numbers will likely stay the same except for the revenue will change yeah that is like most people are shocked by that no it's always surprising the price elasticity of most customers like if you have a good product not even a great product a good one an average products most people will pay so much more than you think but engineers on particular are always guilty of this absolutely that's the same thing to you if you are even a decent marketer or buying one of these businesses is a huge opportunity for you think is a you could just jack up prices you're so aptly pointed out and be if you can even get like one percent more efficient and acquiring customers which mean that and higher prices you basically build yourself a substantial flywheel that can really be a multi-million dollar [Music] you

#thehustle #uber #lyft

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
let's talk about this other idea that you had mention last time so uber driver revenue streams total revenue streams and lyft you know I I'm neither we don't discriminate yeah no I love them both right whatever's cheaper but for me I try to think a lot about their are resting assets that are currently sitting idle right and so how can you what's a resting asset a resting asset is something like how uber a scale because they have drivers that are sitting out there for themselves or people just driving around that want to make extra income so for uber for instance how can we take that a step further you have people that are online with uber that are currently waiting for rides and they have when they get someone in their car they have a captive audience there's been a handful of startups that if somewhat helped alleviate this because the big thing that has come out a lot lately especially with some of the new regulations coming in is that uber and lyft drivers driving full-time are making far less than minimum wage right like far less when you account for all the expenses and the idle times I think we had the stat here what does it say the average pay per hour in America for full time is 855 to 1177 on uber on uber yeah or all right yeah right yeah in America the average full-time for a driver full-year 36 525 a year right that's that's that's minimum wage right and so I think it's no one they're not gonna stop driving over they're not gonna stop driving left but how can you take something like a uber or lyft driver who for between 7 and 30 minutes has a captive audience right so how do you give them a 3 dollar an hour raise how do you help them make more money so people have tried this currently interactive media I think we there's a octopus interactive has done this everyone's seen it it's in all cabs in New York it's in a handful of uber screen on the back type thing you play a game yeah it's not targeted so you and me are getting in there and I guarantee you if we sat in there right now we're gonna get served personal injury call me if you've been hurt in an accident right has nothing to do with that right okay but that's one way one way another one that I actually liked was cargo it just helps them sell things right snack little snack bar exactly but to me what I've been thinking a lot about is how do you which is really big obviously the last handful of years which is really take office personalization so if you think about if you're able to truly partner with uber think about the type of information they have on you as a rider how old you are your frequent places that you're living even the micro targeting the geolocation of where you are we can make a lot of assumptions about you we could you know song we could probably assume your your well off maybe we can know that you have family or you're currently doing a lot of pools or luxury and so we can start to build a profile around you and with that type of information through like the stereo for instance how could we serve you very targeted direct ads right so advertising is one the one that I am really interested in I have a little bit of background in is in the music space and so for me it's like okay a music label wants to get their new artist someone that they've invested in in front of the right consumer especially in that first week where they want songs to hit that kind of viral effect right and so if you were able to build a music platform to partner with labels and over to actually serve direct music towards a very targeted audience and you could make money by playing that song right I think it'd be a great business yeah that's pretty interesting cuz I don't know how many rides there are per day but there's millions of rides per day and so those are all sort of audio impressions yeah you could use and I think if you played ads out loud that would be sort of obnoxious but if you're playing awesome new music you know that could be that could be really interesting where it's sort of non-invasive it's actually you know sort of behind the scenes yeah you don't even have to tell the writer hey this is you know you're listening to this because of X it's just there's what the driver has on yeah and the driver gets paid to have their radio on exactly specifically into a certain station a lot hooked into their app cuz a lot of the time either you're telling them what to change too or they're putting on something you don't like right and so now this is okay we think we understand you as an individual so we're gonna try to serve you music that you like right and I'm helping the driver make more money right yeah I like this idea a lot I think this is cool Firefly put the big kind of thing on the top of the Ebers is that is it Firefly that raised last week or was it the other one so Firefly raised prior and it may have raised again I don't know if they raised a huge round prior and like twenty thirty million bucks and then I believe lyft announced that they were doing this themselves so one of the ride-sharing companies announced that they're doing this themselves which is gonna be now to see what happens with that but I like the idea I also just generally like the underlying reason this was interesting to you which was something's changed so what's changed okay well now we have this fleet of drivers that are all connected using these apps that are on the road all the time that's new inventory we could do something with new opportunity that we could do something with and the second thing was hey the wages have gone down from making $25 an hour to $10 an hour they're gonna be very receptive to ways that they can get their earnings back up because they're being advertised to that hey you're making 25 bucks an hour yeah but that's not your true rate when you take into account everything and if you find a way to make the drivers more money even I I bet you I'm just gonna make an assumption here that if uber doesn't get a cut but they're keeping more drivers on the road that they will leave you alone yeah they will love you if I find any way to make drivers work exclusively like I think cargo is an exclusive partnership with uber right and so if you can help just them like their their driver retention yeah I I think could really take off yeah I like that idea [Music] you [Music]

you about it and then I went to being the Gary Vaynerchuk podcast and then I went to be on I didn't pop yeah everyone knows him as pump Tom yeah and his podcast it was cool did gary vaynerchuk's podcast first thing in the morning at 8:00 or 9:00 or 10:00 a.m. when I got there I was a little groggy from my flight because I took some medicine when I flew it went okay we'll see what happens so you walk in what what happened yeah so walked in so he has two offices in New York one Hudson Yards which I've been to before it's buzzing this one was a studio it's a little quieter but still pretty badass in Brooklyn Long Island City Long Island City is it is which I don't know if that's Brooklyn or not but it was awesome man and you guys know each other you don't know each other so it's just like for social I met but we had he knew who I was and obviously I definitely know who he is and he knew who our company was he he was totally nice and he was really low-key at first he wasn't like cocaine Gary yeah he was like you guys do a little chitchat small talk beforehand or you just got into me so here's what happened we sat down and there's like an audience there was like an audience of like ten maybe five or ten people me it was me and Adam on our side of him he had an entourage and we sit down and he goes all right go it looks at me and I was like I looked at add up I go Gary I think you're interviewing me he goes oh I am I was like right Adam like is that right yeah that's what we set up out of the safety blanket yeah it was like oh okay so tell me about who you are it was good it was a nice guy that's good to know yeah you know he's an easy target because he's so loud yeah I believe the screen went off there I believe that he is totally legitimate and a really good businessperson I think his company Vayner is really really hard to run and here he was currently the CEO oh and CEO but great business are being good business and he's totally legitimate he's like you can like what makes you say that so long you could put him in like the Donald Trump category of a guy who talks a lot and you're like I don't know this guy the real deal right he's totally the real deal he just talks a lot but what what were the little tidbits that gave you that impression right cuz I believe that I'm not saying you're lying whatever I asked him ago so how do you like working here I always ask employees I ask the front desk I go what what's what you know and you can kind of tell if they actually like it yeah and when he has 800 employees so the inn and the office space was it was really expensive real estate there was really nice furniture everything was set up professionally it's a real business right so you could tell what's legitimate and what is it once you go in there in this Hudson Yards office they had vaynermedia water bottled water the office was buzzing everyone had nice computers it wasn't it's not a start-up right felt like a legit operation totally for two hundred percent and kudos to him man he's talented and you did the podcast you know rate your performance I gave myself a c-plus okay and then because I was it was a I hadn't done any reps that day like I did a podcast later that day I had a Red Bull firing yeah all right I'm on it it just it just fell a little flat but Adam and his people said it was one of their favorite ones they've ever done and do you have a little prep routine you would do if but let's say before you get on stage before you do an interview how do you you know switch the light yeah well I typically will like you know how it is like when we're doing this thing I was in a piss I was in a shitty mood a minute ago and these lights turned on and you're like I got a little like snap out of it and what I do is I talk to the receptionist or I'll talk to the uber driver just to like start get out of your hand get my words going and getting a better happier mood yeah and that's usually what I do okay is that what you do no like everything I try to like study and come up with like a framework for how to do like a technique and so I picked up two things so I picked up one from Conor McGregor that he I was watching this documentary walk with the pencil in your mouth pen in your mouth yeah so this I tried it and it actually works fantastic so basically you take a pencil or a pen you hold it sort of horizontal sideways you bite on it so it's in your mouth you know sort of going out past your cheeks and then you just talk for one minute and what happens is because the pencils they're in your mouths in this awkward position your tongue has to really work to like flick over and under this thing to get to the spots it usually goes to so you end up enunciated way better I don't know if it's placebo I don't know if it really is like an actual warm-up for your tongue but this [ __ ] works I've recorded myself before and after and I can tell the difference and other I had other people listen to it I said Oh tell me which one of these sounds better and I don't know whether it's placebo or not if that one works for me the other thing is like a quick physical change so push ups a wind spring jumping jack a scream music whatever I am a big believer that that that the fastest way to change the way you feel is through changing your body rapidly and Tans works that's like a Tony Robbins ism Tony Robbins says this great YouTube video if you go look at if you're just YouTube young Tony Robbins and it's you know the same guy - 25 years he's in a tank top and he's given the speech and he talks about he goes before I get onstage you know people always ask me okay you're you're public speaker you do you do a really great job how do you do a great job of this and he goes because I don't make the mistakes most people do because most people are sitting in a low energy shell the body body posture sucks and then they just get up on stage if they don't warm up like an athlete would never do that and he's like I treat myself like an athlete I get myself in a mental state a physical state and he goes the second thing I do I don't try to memorize what I'm supposed to say because when you try to memorize what you say you're trying to prepare well what ends up happening is your mind is then editing it's comparing what you're saying versus what you kind didn't remember you're supposed to say as you give this other whole thing going on in your head that takes you away from the moment third thing and this is the last one he goes before I go up there I convinced myself that the audience has to hear this like their lives depend on this information like they me I'm here to help and if I can get this across like even with this podcast for example it's like you know somebody is out there they're commuting they're you know they're they have this idea that they haven't taken action on they're kind of beating themselves up about it or you know they look around at the five people that they hang out with the most and they're just like these people are not like me and we're in their ear balls and they're like oh there are people like me out there and yes I should take some action and yes I should have some [ __ ] energy today and so he's like I just convinced myself that they have to hear this and then I'm here to serve them and I was like okay I do that just doing that has made me feel better there you go another thing that I did while I was out there is on Sunday night I tweeted out so when I fly I take a lot of xanax it's the only drug I do I don't do any alcohol and sometimes the night before I'll take it a little bit as well because I really hate flying and so on Sunday night I tweeted that I rented this Airbnb which I did and I'm gonna host a meet-up and I got 200 replies saying let's meet up right and that I couldn't do that so I only let 20 trend subscribers come and so the trend subscribers are also not 100 of you listeners or not 100% and listeners are subscribers but all subscribers are listeners right and they so I met I think at 30 ended up coming and it was [ __ ] awesome it was so cool this one kid flew up from South Carolina or something and I tweeted this on the meetup was Monday night I tweeted this on Sunday night yeah like there was no preparation like we all we did me and Adam landed and on Monday morning we went to the Mexican place next door and said hey can you bring over enough tacos for 20 people there's two or three hundred bucks and go buy some beer and we'll pay you more money and that's all we did and it was awesome yeah these people are [ __ ] fanatical is crazy it's nuts it's really odd who was the most interesting person so many interesting people one guy there was this one guy I forget his name maybe he's listening he was an older the eldest guy there which is not old but been his 50s or 40s and he built was it builds custom logic cards cars and through the trends groups sold 50 cars just another custom electric car yeah like I mean like he was making uh like they took a take a Prius or it took four no they took yeah they took like a some type of pickup truck and made it an electric delivery van oh wow for a cannabis company in LA cuz who else did I mean I mean I met all types of people one guy who sells fake boobs for a living so he sells his he'll be mower Fairchild he discover talk to you on Twitter no child hunter yeah yeah I see this guy on my Twitter all the time yeah he sells fake boobs yeah his boss invented like a better dude what's in his bio cuz I've looked at this guy's bio and he's not advertising this this girl a DD we're just sitting down a hunter came and we were just shooting the [ __ ] we're like her what do you do and this woman a DD she's nice I've met her before we were just sitting there and she's like well I sell breast implants and we were like what and we just start talking I was like so do you have like a woman who comes with you and like shows you like shows the buyers like you need like sales brochures like how do you have like how do you show that your boobs are the best and he was just like walking through this whole process it was crazy I had never heard of such a thing yeah I mean either but of course he came up from Virginia for this that's great alright cool so you can do more of that of what well you and I need to do more so what we can do is New York that we could get I we could have gotten 200 people yeah so we can do one in New York I think a cast or whatever we use tells us where people are right we got to go to Canada we got to go to Utah when we shout it out Utah I know I still get more the number of these friendly ass Utah you know citizens whatever they're called you tons reach out all the time like hey when you guys are here I got you so maybe like and it feels good to be taken care of like that does it feels great maybe great hospitality February yeah when you end of February we should do a thing where we could try to hit up like three cities in five days right [Music]

the other thing that's interesting is you were on Shark Tank so as a fan of reality TV me and Sam both watched the challenge probably the trashiest reality show love is blind yeah we didn't it all come out already then they just released I'm at episode 3 of that one good show pretty good show have you seen it do you know the premise it's actually pretty cool as a suit experiment or you cut off the show like no you don't get like eliminated survivor style do you just edit you out like you just not shown ever again if you didn't propose and so what ends up happening is it's 10 days behind a wall you talk to this person and you're speed-dating basically behind a wall so you're kind of like deciding who you like and then someone proposes through the wall so they're like can you come close to the wall please I'm on a knee now and I want to you know I see to marry me and then but the thing is that I thought that's where the show would end but then they like put them in the real world together and they're like all right you're gonna get married in 30 days and see what happens and it's pretty interesting good job Netflix ownership Shark Tank because tell me about how it came about you you applied many times one time how'd you get on once your honor before you okay I would say like so I we aired in November of 2017 the beginning auditions like a nine-month process of I would say so we applied and by me it's like a 50 page written application online or I tried to like use a PDF Editor so you write this whole thing up I write this whole thing out I will be honest I was I was a finalist at TechCrunch Battlefield about 16 the producers Scout they reached out maybe they reached out so it's kind of like if you're thinking about American Idol maybe whatever but you you either can get contacted and sort of in the front in the audition or you kind of wait line so it's not that I had necessarily a better chance but I did get shortcut to the question process so filled that out the obligation probably takes 40 hours and then you have to sign all their contracts and basically sign your identity and image away and then from there you do a voice interview with producers you do a video interview as well with the application that other video interview of your pitch and then from there the producers work with you for about four months together like what is your story what is your brand what is your strategy ultimately your what I think people don't realize human interest story it's a human interest story you are there to make good reality TV but it is your decision the producers will help you and advise you but this is your gig and it's up to you to decide how you want to display yourself and who you want to be on TV but so do you still remember do you still remember your opening because you probably drilled it like a thousand times I did I did and I will tell you I thought I was like really good and comfortable at public speaking and then I did this I was like okay I was really bad no I I did so I signed or I shook on the largest deal ever for a female entrepreneur in terms of valuation so yeah with Lori Grenier she is on board she's been tremendous because of QVC or what for me it was really at the time we had no brick-and-mortar retail presence and I knew that that was a priority for us to create a product it was like actually accessible and ubiquitous and that's actually in heights I've been are really gonna move for us but I felt that she would be invaluable in helping us to get you know those stories yeah she really helped with packaging and branding and making something that's accessible when you're trying to like sell a testing kit where either people think it's a DNA kit right where they have no idea what it is right being able to differentiate bout me of like 10 seconds to grab see I'm gonna be ready so the deal we shook on because there's the shake on it and then there's the actual - for the company and probably better for Lori and better because why does the deal change so normally there's like they do diligence and they might change it probably for their favor you're saying it better for you guys how does it improve I wanna make sure you project because your audio yours what you're saying is great I want to make sure we're getting it all so my audio paranoia just make sure your talk louder than you're comfortable talking so after you shake on the deal on the show a fair number of those deals I think it's something like over half never come to fruition at all and then another quarter or so actually change and then another quarter gets done at the terms that I think eat shark eat shark has a different approach so like I they're totally you then go into their management company right so you're going into Mark Cuban companies or Lori or nears companies and so it's not a I don't know what eat sharks processes I can say Lori's was super fair they go through very detailed diligence on everything but but you know what the show actually does diligence on you they have a venture analyst on board so they run diligence on you before you ever pay I I pitched I my valuation was twenty million post-money it was a line of credit deal at an eight percent interest rate for five percent of the company and was it like you know hey deal offer on the spot or do you have this like long pause where you like can I think and write this down well in my case every shark was out I actually knew I wanted either lawyer or mark green sorry Lori or Mark Cuban and so I was really excited about it and so I really did want to work with her and it was a good deal so I actually sat on the show because you're supposed to negotiate I said because it makes a good TV yes and so I said I know I'm supposed to negotiate but I want to take this deal right so I didn't you do have it is really what you see like you can exit you can talk about it with your partner you can call a lifeline or a friend they may edit that out or whatever else but you can take a minute to think about it what's something people don't don't see or don't realize that is different from having actually gone through it versus watching it what's it what's one big I think people know it's edited I don't think people realize how long the actual time filming can be from when you walk in and walk out to like what they edit down to five minutes so it varies but mine was probably an hour and they added it to seven minutes some people's have gone on up to two to three hours some are 15 minutes right and so I think you know it's edited to a degree but I don't think you realize how much discussion actually happens with money she has investing her own money it is in a fun structure but it's her capital you know I don't know I will say she is a prolific salesperson in the sense that like the top three or four companies from shark tank and I mean companies that have done like a quarter of a billion in sales squatty potty yeah those she has a relationship with each of those companies and is invested in each of those companies so I suspect quite a bit not to mention her own patent portfolio and the success she's like with products there's not an exit yeah so I don't know I don't know I don't know she takes that Saudi money no different right so like she does it just like an any VC deal is different right she's negotiating a deal with me right different I don't know what what terms are you know with the rest of our companies I do know she has put all of these companies on the map from scrub daddy to squatty potty these companies have incredible consumers she delivers how she delivers yeah I'm telling you I think every actually I don't have a but it doesn't seem I mean it does seem very popular apparently so I guess so Everly well question for you we actually get the test how do you actually administer this back three years ago right and it aired the night before Cyber Monday it was Thanksgiving weekend but my poor team they were wonderful they canceled all their Thanksgivings this you know a lot of work but um what we got about thirty times our normal traffic but we had an interesting experience we didn't have this tremendous like huge spike the night of in terms of purchases but we ended up doing about a million dollars in sales which at the time was a tremendously large number for us in like the four-day period after right the show so there's been a little bit of this interesting thing for us that I haven't heard many other companies have which is we doubled like we doubled in that week on a run rate standpoint and then we continued doubling the next month and we never had that decline right but we didn't have this spike in like the three hour period that we aired yeah yeah so and we did I mean we had to I mean at the time we were not set up for that scale now we don't even we know we've always been on stripe not WooCommerce not shopify bigcommerce we've built on it now and like totally customized it something else not I know this is one of the big ones that actually I think we should have gone to Shopify but we didn't gotcha so I shouldn't know I shouldn't name them because right back shout out to Toby Shopify yes exactly I like to think he's listening yeah so might be we're trying to get him on I was gonna say that valuation he also streams on twitch great guy oh so yeah so we saw really good traffic increase but it wasn't it was a very different pattern and Laurie warned us about that she said some companies it's like they sell out immediately and some companies it's just a slow slow burn so that was what it was with us but we did not crash which was essential [Music]

and so for people listening who are like okay great who's this person why are they joining the show give us the like 30 seconds about what's interesting about you so chic I'm the founder and CEO of really well we are based in Austin we are about to celebrate our five-year anniversary which is hard to believe but probably the most interesting thing about me starting this company is I started a company in the blood testing space in the direct-to-consumer space coming with no entrepreneurial background or healthcare background whatsoever and had every kind of in the box right you were a consultant right Sam's all about the pedigrees I hate it I don't care Sam's like Harvard ok I'm interesting that turns me on to being an entrepreneur when I was there but certainly like I was really on the corporate path and then had this idea when I was working at MoneyGram and left my job to do it and I can confidently say a hundred percent of people who know me was like yeah yeah so when I was five years ago I was working at money Graham I had a bunch of all these unexplained health symptoms this is super common which you hear from women in their late 20s and their 30s as they have chronic fatigue aches and pains they're not taken seriously at doctors and so I went to five or six different doctors on good health insurance and each of them ran different blood tests I never got my results I paid over twenty five hundred dollars out-of-pocket nothing material showed up or was communicated what do you mean never got your result so you personally didn't receive it the doctor looks like even if they called me like I missed the call nobody ever called they said anything's abnormal well like what does that mean you tested a hundred different things like just because something's not totally out of whack doesn't mean there's not interesting or useful information there so I sat down and I looked at the health insurance landscape and I thought man people are gonna have to start paying for all that in a more meaningful way than we are today and I'm at least confident that my covert of women between like 25 and 45 can't get the testing that they need right and I think I can solve that and to really start it out honestly not that it wasn't a big vision but it was a little bit like if you if you think about the first group you're solving a problem for that's what we lost for so today we have 35 different tests on every liberal comm on Amazon target CVS Kroger we work with Humana and we offer consumer initiated testing for everything from STI testing heart health food sensitivity etc basically is it every test it's like 90 percent of common test coverage doctor I've raised over 50 million dollars from five from Western East Coast feces that was after obviously having like three rounds of clawing my way through funding and then suddenly things did get easier and we actually grew from zero to see we did 40 million in sales last year yeah okay no coronavirus but fist pound for the for the 40 million but I'm hopeful there's progress no I mean it's combination of new customer acquisition and repute we have a really healthy repeat business because a lot of our tests are things like cholesterol it's not recurring we do have enterprise contracts that are recording for Medicare right but it's a mix of what I would call one-time repeat and then actual recurring contracts which is there's challenges there's good and bad I think when you have a one-time heavy business up front you have to build a good set of unit economics from the get-go so they're not just optimizing on this like promise of payback right right so that's been good for us on the other hand we've had to be super super disciplined in a way that I think some consumer brands how about that right so you're based out of Austin you do this d2c at home tests that then get sent to a lab a partner lab they analyze it you get the full report it's like here's everything here's what's interesting about this you can share it it's like the way that it should be like if you didn't even you didn't have to like it invent this if you just ask the layperson you like how should this work that's the description and then you just made that like happen in real life [Music]

something that has made a huge impact on me and I think more people need to take advantage of it which is transparent numbers so basically there's a group of people out there who believe that transparency is good and they share all of their revenue they chair they share their every metric about their business as deep as everyone's salary their bank balance churn how much it cost to acquire customer how much a customer stays on for everything some are a little bit less will they'll share how many customers they have how much revenue they have what the bank balances more people should follow these businesses I for one and totally against that I don't think you should ever reveal that but I'm happy they do and yeah and so some examples so thorough so first of all my friend encore what's encores last name he runs teachable I remember his last name if you google it can you tell me on course last name founder of teachable okay so he reveals on Twitter the valuation of every round what is it Matt Paul yes no I said nog Paul NOC Paul he reveals the valuation of every right every time they just really 20 million bucks yeah duh whatever 100 something really good and he reveals how much revenue they have how many customers they have it's awesome yes I love that the other guy is Sahil Sahil from Gumroad shitty business seems like an awesome guy he reveals every single month yeah oh you could Google Gumroad founder Sahil it's on just Twitter if you just he doesn't have a tweet lane sitting after you don't even have to dive into the books so yeah here's Tom forty characters um Joel from buffer he does this they actually just switch so if you go to bear metrics comm or google bear metrics they have like 18 different companies that do this and it's pretty cool and Joel from buffer used to be on there there are 22 million dollar your company so pretty valuable and they were well they feel everything every employee salaries like name salary equity you know level everything and you know what they're changing they're showing less and less because have you talked to him do you know why it becomes problematic when you add more people yeah duh you know guy you know creates you know turns his kitchen into a man cave instead gets a girlfriend and it's like oh she doesn't like it it's like yeah oh [ __ ] man like I told you this like when you bought the plasma and put it on the fridge people don't like their salary being public people get upset when they see their co-worker who slacks off and works from home two days a week and they say because people understand that like different people have different situations it's not like so so they did it I think in a smart way which is they basically were like they use it as customer acquisition yeah it's part of their story because they got their ass kicked by HubSpot and so they like you know this has become a bit of a playbook for small business of business SAS companies which is look you know acquisition of customers is hard if my customer is a small business owner what a small business what would bring a small business owner to me what content could I put out there that would make a small business owner come so instead of saying seven tips to have more effective meetings they were like here's our here's our P&L for this month and sure enough a lot of people wanted to see that so a lot of people discovered their product through this and so you know maybe this lines up totally with their values and that's why they did it but I just def mom definitely it was a great way for people to discover their business I didn't use buffer but I read all their [ __ ] and if anybody ever needed a solution like buffer I was like Oh buffer you should use buffer why because otherwise I wouldn't have even known about them and so this was a pretty counterintuitive thing that they did and they were the only ones doing it and so you always get paid when you're the only one doing it if it's juicy yeah and so one more person who's doing it and his business is way better than buffer I love this guy's business so it's my friend Nathan berry I've met Nathan a while ago and Nathan has this company called convertkit they do close to two million monthly recurring revenue so 24 million he owns 100% of it it's right it's probably a hundred to two hundred million dollar company like it's really valuable because once customers are locked in it's basically a MailChimp competitor it's an email that seems high to two million a month you said - oh that's for sure how much they do know that part that twenty-four million a year so 24 million you think they're worth what ten times ten times that okay maybe throwing like a weed maybe people don't switch from their email platform yeah it all depend on the retention so can you pull up actually can you open it open up their their metrics so just as hi just Google like like bear metrics dashboard or something I forgot what the URL is but it's like something dot bear metrics comm and it's like their whole company it's like here's how many new customers we got here's how many people churn this month it's like all their graphs and you can use it for your company he even showed how much profit they make I think it's like convert kit it's like yeah here it is there you go so this I don't know if this is their business so this is like the example thing but it's like monthly recurring revenue net revenue fees this is somebody else convertkit yeah do convertkit bear metrics I've been convertkit revenue maybe I also use convertkit I actually I pay for subscription because I'm like this product is so [ __ ] powerful I don't actually have many sequences set up I have a sequence of one email right now which is not a sequence it's just an email but I think it's a great product I love convertkit I love Nathan Nathan's a great guy Nathan's only twenty six or seven years old we talked to we talked about the idea of doing a drip sequence to build a newsletter for women going through pregnancy and like week by week and I had a friend are sorry now random listener reach out on Twitter is like I'm doing this here's my kind of unique asset I have to go about this and how should I set this up and I sent them to convertkit I was like dude your problem is gonna be solved in like you know the next 90 minutes what are people leaving bare mattress um why can't you find it here you go 1.7 million oh is that it what's the URL yeah so 1.7 million monthly recurring revenue and you could just look at the turn so annual run right doing 20 million a year which is up 1.7 percent that's got to be how much this month revenue-sharing 5.1 percent per month it's not great either well it's because it's a small to medium business like if you're turning five percent a month that's like what's isn't what's the net growth so five percent a month is the churn what's the new business every month one and a half one half percent yeah so he's net negative then per month no I think that that churn growth month that growth number takes into account churned actually okay gotcha okay that's the but this is because it's the the average revenue even says so they make on average $60 is it $60 a month per user right and on the right one of medium business gonna have a how it's gonna have higher and compared to other SAS but if you're a real sicko you can just look at the live shame on the right and see every minute when somebody pays them it'll say like right now it says twenty million dollars paid by you know anonymous company dude he's got a lot of failed payments here and get on that Nathan what's going on you can't be failing is three out of the twelve payments here failed for he has a chart so these these companies are badass I you wouldn't do it no I think what about a part of what you do but email list size the revenue I don't want to share anything publicly I'll say like eight figures or write something no I just don't think it brings a lot of good either you know when a company's trying to raise or sell their business because like two months before all these articles will come out just like handing over they're handing over information why is that happening because they want to raise the ground they want to sell their company in the next six months I don't know I'm not a fan of it at one time when I when I did my first conference when I was younger it made like 60 grand in profit and I told everyone in the blog post and I hated the attention so I'm never gonna do it again [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
so uh did you watch the Tyson Fury fight I did I'm a I'm not a huge boxing fan but I'm a fan of greatness and I like combat sports and Jeff there we go I I was lucky enough I actually watched it with Sam and Sam is you know big boxing fan and I think I know a lot of Patriots fans would say the 28:3 is the greatest comeback story in sports I think Tyson Fury is the greatest comeback so I explained the Tyson Fury story so just so we can I'm gonna start at the end okay Tyson Fury knocked out Deontay Wilder in the seventh round Deontay Wilder is known as the baddest man on the planet right never never been defeated and he's he has a 96% knockout rate right 42 fights 41 knockouts exactly only person he hasn't knocked out was his last ice in fury fight so Tyson Fury started off he's this English boxer also known as the gypsy king he was eight weeks premature weighing in at one pound right okay almost didn't make it just from the beginning right one pound one pound which is crazy because if you see him now he's 69 1675 pounds yeah exactly exactly that in that slim form which we'll get into but his dad knew greatness his dad was one of those people that understood that this guy's gonna be a champion and so we named him Tyson after the great Mike Tyson obviously years go by years go by he starts training his dad was a boxer his uncle's a boxers everyone in his family his boxers and he gets to this point where he's like the next contender coming up he's 23 years old he gets invited into wladimir klitschko his actual fighting camp itself and kind of going back to you guys's point last week about hearing doubters everyone always told Tyson Fury you're gonna go to this camp but wladimir klitschko is the King right even you're there he's gonna batter you as a sparring partner and so he was training with me is like this guy's not that great I'm gonna get into his head these guys they weren't even boxing against each other this time not opponents so during the training camp itself they go into the sauna okay have you heard this honest or not sorry the story now yeah I'm excited this is maybe my favorite story in sports so everyone knows and everyone tell us ice in fury when we Klitschko is not just the King of the Ring why don't we Klitschko is the king of the sauna okay look everyone here Henry the photo what wladimir klitschko looks like this time he's a monster yeah he's enormous he's a Russian monster he's a Russian monster Ukrainian Russian monster so this guy's huge so they go into an Tyson Fury's everyone's telling him you got to get out of this on as fast no one who can last as long as them and he says I'm not even fighting this guy I'm gonna get into his head I want to beat him now because I know I'm gonna be champion later and people say I can't do something I'm gonna do it okay so they get in there it's hot it's really warming up five minutes go by ten minutes go by there's about a dozen people in there people are dropping on right someone's leaving another person's leaving about 20 minutes come in and it's only Tyson Fury in line with Coach go left so Vladimir Klitschko you know he stands up Tyson fair he's like thank goodness he's about to pass out why don't we Klitschko turns up the heat yeah so Tyson curry says I can't let this guy get in my head everyone thinks I can't beat him I'm gonna get up - he gets up you know what he does turns it up grabs the newspaper lady grabs the newspaper write another 25 minutes go by then legitimately as hot as the sauna can go and Klitschko finally leaves Tyson Perry win seems like I can't just leave right now he'll know about I was just trying to beat him wait a little bit longer basically passes out years go by three four years go by Tyson Fury's the number one contender Chris cares a champion which goes the champion he hasn't lost in something like 11 years 11 years hasn't lost right everyone's like Tyson Fury you cannot beat Klitschko Tyson Fury goes you know what I know all of you think I can't do this I'm gonna do it on his home court I don't come to the UK I don't want to fight you at Wembley I want to fight you in like Eastern Europe so they fight in Germany and then so in the pre-fight they do a face to face similar to how we are now Tyson Fury brings up this honor issue Klitschko everyone look at the clip is so like pretend like it didn't happen like he couldn't remember it and Tyson Fury says after the fight he knew that's when he beat him and he goes in and he batters right he batters Klitschko wins right becomes the lineal champion 3 3 class champion whichever by the way I love this lineal champion the lineal champion for those who don't follow boxing is just you're you beat the man who beat the man who beat the man who beat the man all the way back in time to the first man exact and so you have taken the champion you took the champion yes and nobody's taking you out yet Neil champion he's the lineal champ so this is 2015 so the thing was is that after this fight Tyson Fury didn't go on and actually fight Klitschko again right he balloons up to 400 pounds he's at the mountaintop he's like is this it is this it and he's hurting from everyone he couldn't do it again he can't do it again it is finally somewhat getting to him he becomes addicted to drugs he gets addicted to booze he's 400 pounds and everyone says I knew it I knew Tyson Fury was a bum right right and so finally something in his mind clicks 2017 this video comes out him jogging his face is monstrous size of a bass it looks like someone who ate Tyson Fury exactly and he there's this video everyone's gotta see it and he said he says it's like Deontay Wilder I'm coming for you and everyone says he's never talked about he's failed so many times he'll never come back yeah and little obviously he fights some he comes back he drops a hundred and fifty pounds it was a draw the first fight time comes back they're like you know what Tyson Fury is he's not coming back it's gonna be the WWE thing he got his payday he's gonna go drink again comes back obviously this past Saturday knocks out actually knocks out the nachus knockout artist a hundred percent no one thought he could do it right and so I just thought it was this really interesting story for a lot of the points that even we were talking about last week or you guys were talking about last week when it came down to people saying no right people not wanting to see success happen everyone wants to see you blues and he took that as energy came back like four separate times right from the brink like four separate times and made it happen I just thought it was just I can tell you're kind of like me in that maybe the thing I respect most is someone's mentality yes their mental toughness and and I don't I don't even think I'm particularly great at this but it's something that I've decided is sort of the number one most important asset is how how is your mindset 104,000 mindset where things are good are you grateful or you're appreciative are you a giver to others yeah how is your mindset when things are bad yes are you resilient do you do you turn the disadvantages into advantages and mindset is number one that's why you love fury yes doesn't matter that he knocked out my it matters how his mind worked he was at a point where most people break Angela Duckworth would call it grit right what this guy has right like when I read that book all I could think about was Tyson Fury yeah but it all comes down to mindset all the great leaders have it Admiral William McRaven is another great example obviously one of the greatest Admirals and Navy SEALs history on special ops history same thing he's a great leader because of how his mindset is right this is why sports is greats the metaphor it's the grand metaphor for life uh-huh who cares about these guys punching each other in the head or throwing a ball in a hoop but it is the great many real post a bunch of the things that we talked about I want everyone to go to the hustle and my first million everyone on Twitter and I want you to all look at these links and be inspired yes love it it was a great fight it was very dirty and he gave us a nice little ballot and Oh Mike he sings a song when he lands which is hilarious and part of like his marketability is that he's just like crazy character he was dancing before the fight yeah well there was stress you can he was literally dancing by the way super lame excuse by Deontay Wilder that his costume was too heavy and that's why he lost no you lost ghosts I got very punch in the head yeah [Music]

okay you want to get into some stuff you want about coronavirus or you want to yeah okay so I'm terrified of coronavirus and you know generically I'm terrified you know I was terrified without information and then I started looking into a little bit more so they don't even know about it can you explain what the yeah so basically there's a couple of these viruses they're influenza strains and so the flu flu yeah so basically a few years ago you probably heard you know SARS or swine flu and so you know the very first time I think SARS happened there was you know kid got this flu goes to the doctor's office they're like okay this is the flu and kid dies within like a very short amount of time they're like well that was odd that doesn't usually happen so they took a sample and sent it to like the CDC or whoever right like they sent it to some lab to say you know what do you see here there was this was a very unusual case the health deteriorated so quick that's not typical to the flu and what they realized was hey this is a new strain called I think it was like h1 and five at the time and it was like this is only ever found in animals this is the first time it's crossed over from animal to human and so that was bird flu when that happened and then so there's been these different sort of very very deadly viruses SARS which are which was very very popular MERS which happened in the Middle East respiratory syndrome is what's kind of what these Middle East respiratory I think syndrome is the what murder stands for and SARS is sort of the same thing and so the thing with these was that you know although there's a lot of hoopla around SARS and bird flu like SARS killed less than a thousand people less than a thousand total fatalities not a big drop in the bucket as far as the death bucket goes on earth coronavirus already killed like three thousand plus people so already much bigger than that the reason it's scary though is actually and for a while people were like oh don't worry the fatality rate is low fatality rates like I don't know three percent for this whereas four stars it was like super high I don't know I don't think it's that number but it's like majority of people who have it died where's with this three percent means you get it but you have a good chance of living but the big problem with that and the article that I read was called while you're probably why we probably can't contain coronavirus why you probably are gonna end up getting coronaviruses because this virus is dream Li contagious but has these symptoms that are very problematic so it takes a while for your symptoms to show up so you have it and you carry it for like you know 14 days without showing symptoms so you'll be spreading this around and not even realizing you have it then once you have it you don't just like deteriorate and like your health doesn't go to [ __ ] where they you know you're in the hospital they quarantine you it's like you know it starts innocent and it gets worse over time so the infectious period is so much longer that there's basically no way to quarantine this thing there is no way for us to contain this and so what the article was saying was like ironically because it is not as fatal and it's not as bad for you right away this thing is gonna be unstoppable most likely case second thing with that was I guess there's four like and you know typical strains of the flu which is why you can get your flu shot and still catch the flu every year so guys there's these four different strains and the vaccine doesn't cover or sort of all all the different variations and and so this guy's case was that most likely this is now just a fifth annual you know strain that we're gonna have to live with and it's just gonna suck it's a very very you know kind of a downer also I'm sure you know sort of the bio nerds out there gonna be like you know there's 15 million strains that's right but like that's the summary that I took away and if you want to just get the point that's the point and so what you have up here is d2c stuff so like my I looked at my portfolio yesterday as a [ __ ] so lost money yesterday off the stock market so crazy shit's happening all around so generically stock market you know people get paranoid bonds you know people flee to bond stock goes down that sort of thing other funny stuff happening you know zoom the conferencing software so the stock ticker zoom goes up 50 percent today but wait there's more it's the stock ticker zero om but that's not zooms actual handle zooms actual handle is ZM so people are buying the wrong stock because they think people are gonna be working from home and teleconferencing in and so they're buying zoom which does something else altogether so my small cam stock I don't know Henry check what the stock 4 zom actually does and it just tiny stocks I would jump 50 percent today and you know but you could actually predict this because this happened also at the IPO whoever bought zoom the other thing got his huge pop at zooms IPO because of this so we could have predicted this one I love when that happened but all kinds of [ __ ] up things some other things smart friends are basically saying hey if you need percents my smart friends you know people who actually read the real information and like understand how the world works they were like hey if you need prescription drugs you should start stockpiling because most of its coming from China and the supply chain globally is [ __ ] and like the world doesn't have that like friend friend of a friend basically how the [ __ ] do you stockpile prescription meds basically buy up buyer refills and and so the there's no global plan B for what happens if China gets sick or slowed down we don't have another like supply chain and so all kinds of things are suffering and I have friends that have d2c companies that buy their [ __ ] their back tuna and they're saying [ __ ] yeah months months backed up I was talking to a supplier yesterday and he was like even if we come back to work there's you know all the other factories that we depend on the printing factory the packaging guys and they're not coming like the workers are just not coming back because in most factories in China the workers don't actually live in that city permanently so for Chinese New Year which is when this happened so Chinese New Year's a month long holiday yeah well we have they all Chinese intern he told us all about it he goes he goes it's the largest travel day in the world right because every Chinese person everybody goes home and when they go home they go back to very rural areas and already there's this problem where they don't cut me and often they don't come back as you know they don't want to be living in some other city working in a factory but with this people are just not coming back and so there's no replacements it's like a very dire situation well and like obviously at a human level also incredibly dire situation so to turn [ __ ] into gold where's the opportunity here I mean what's gonna happen do you think that this is gonna impact a lot have long-term impact with China China making [ __ ] and you have to go elsewhere I don't know so there's a question of like so two two theories one is for stuff like this the people who are gonna do really well they didn't start now they started something too years ago a blog on being a prepper or whatever and today's your day you know like this is your month and so I don't think the I don't know how much I am interested in sort of like today opportunity also feels kind of [ __ ] up we talked about Judy the other day right the Judy sort of survival of their bags my friend Joe speiser bought something from like survivor kit calm and he got an email from them saying we have a hundred times our normal volume we apologized but we're gonna make it happen right so those the Judy thing that which the respiratory of demand those are not on the Judy bag but the respiratory masks are just like out of stock you can't get them and that's like the thing you need is like to protect your nose I'm a long gone no one can pounce on that yeah we covered this guy who launched a company called Judy yeah Judy it's a emergency kit yep an orange like emergency backpack ready big my wife texted me today and said what's going buy a bunch of stuff I feel the same way more people are doing this have you ever been in an emergency situation by the way have you ever like been in a city when like a flood happens or anything like that it's really bizarre how it feels no I was in Hawaii our honeymoon there was a hurricane in Hawaii oh I wake up a honeymoon when I was there and so we went to the grocery store we're first we go to the hotel and they're like hey um we have early checking available we're like well that's cool thanks because we're a honeymoon and they're like no we just have like a lot of open rooms I was like what's going on they're like well you have you seen the weather report like there's our hurricane this week of course I don't take the weather so I booked my honeymoon on a hurricane week and so we go to the grocery store and it's like the zombie attack has happened like all the water bottles are gone like the shelves are empty people are just checking out like four carts worth it's really like it's an odd eerie eerie feeling when that happens [Music]

and by the way when you have you had a job have you been employed let's say not like kind of like college-age but like since then or have you just done businesses of your own we had like an acquisition and I was kind of employed there but I but you haven't gone and just interviewed for jobs I interviewed once a couple times and I never got them what you interview for for fungal for Jack Smith my best friend I and I didn't get it they just didn't call me back tell you the guy who's like my best friend now I didn't know him I interviewed his job oh you didn't know him at the time I didn't know okay me and they didn't hire me and then two years later became best friends and you were trying to be a salesperson or what I don't remember I think so by the way I have a similar story I applied to stripe I think I might have told the story already so apology if I did but 2012 I applied to I I was gonna apply for a job for the first time in my life I'd started two companies before that I was like I'm moving to Silicon Valley I'm gonna get a job I'm gonna learn from other people rather than start my own thing and I only applied to jobs one was stripe and I got to the phone screen and I really had it made because the guy who was interviewing me his mentor in life was one of my former advisors in my startup and had written a blog post being like this guy Sean he's like he said it specifically he has the highest bias for action of any entrepreneur I've ever met he made a warm intro to this guy and was like trust me this guy's legit you should hire this kid [ __ ] did you not get that job and so I I thought I was cruising too and maybe that's why I didn't get it but I get to the part of the interview where he was like alright you know this job has a lot of sort of sales and persuasion stuff so you know we're peace software so I want you to you know we're gonna do a little roleplay you're gonna sell me a piece of software and he's like you could pick any software you like whatever you're familiar with you probably got creative or something and I was just like um I was like okay so I here's what I would do I would talk to you about this he said no no don't tell me what you would do like I'm the customer hello I just picked up the phone go and I was like [ __ ] and so I I was like hey you know I'm telling you about I picked Basecamp as my software big mistake because I don't even know Basecamp very well so I just like pull I just say they didn't call you back for that reason by the by the end of that roleplay he was just like yeah I don't think this is for you I'm just being honest with you like I just don't think you're you know I'm good for this that was eight years ago some yeah I was like probably 2023 year 24 at the time how [ __ ] however but I'm like I I blew it like it wasn't there bad like I definitely blew that interview how early of an employee would you have been so I think they were at like 50 maybe 50 people or less or a hundred people I see five million dollars well yeah I don't know how much equity I would have had to do the rocket ship thing I would have had to start in the crappy seat crush it and then get into a good seat to get equity but like I did that with uber and airbnb I had job interviews at Airbnb and uber first 100 people and one of them I got and one of them I got the offer but then they rescinded it cuz I lied about my resume and the other one I didn't get past I had a criminal record and I told my didn't oh alright don't come to work on Monday dude that's hilarious at least you had good eye for picking these companies and then I applied at bungle and they sold for 800 million dollars so I always tell people find out where I want to work at who will also deny me and then invest there okay let's start with where would you want to work at today if you were you back then where would you be applying today great question do you have an answer you want to go for a couple years ago I answer this I was like the only place I would be really interested working with his angel list at the time no I'd be horrible at a place to work and so I thought Angelus was doing really interesting [ __ ] and I think it's gonna be big and it did end up becoming big and this was like seven years ago this is a while ago ya know that would be a horrible place to work though because that wall guy was [ __ ] crazy really I don't know he seems like a brilliant genius so a great - but a horrible person to manage you if okay if I had to work somewhere I probably hmm probably just somewhere with really good managers most startups have horrible managers and when you were looking at uber Airbnb you didn't know the managers so you weren't using that criteria vent no but and I don't know if it would been successful Sara my wife works at Airbnb and she loves her managers and you know how everyone's like so what are you gonna do next they always say that and she's like what do you mean by whatever do anything next is awesome would be for a really long time right and I would love to have that feeling I would probably now look for a company that's I would go find all the most interesting biotech based companies so anybody doing something with genetics genomics modification anything like that I think that's a big wave that's coming I do try to be early they're self-driving cars if there's someone who's awesome there I do something in that if it's hard though it's really hard if I wanted to make a lot of money let's say I wanted to like Akari I'm gonna try and save hundreds of thousands of dollars in the next three years of work good work a face book or what well Facebook Google or an enterprise sales role at a super boring b2b meet enterprise software company right where the where the average deal is like three or four hundred thousand dollars a year right that's what I would so if I took my own advice I would look for who's a rocket ship so I would try to maybe like lambda school I think it's interesting I would just basically try to go find who's the fastest growing startup right now that's at maybe 50 people or 20 people or what are the ten people whatever they are I would go try to find them and then I would be like hey I'll come solve any problems you got like we'll figure it out I went to the sub stack office the other day they just raised 16 million dollars and funding you know how many employees they have five five I would that would be an interesting place to work [Music] you [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
what's going on with Boy Scouts Adam look at this up so Boy Scouts look it up on just Google Boy Scouts it's a everyone knows a Boy Scout is we actually have a lot of non-american listeners right I just remember that look at me I grew up in America but I didn't do Boy Scouts so I have a very loose understanding okay how about Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts when you're in between the ages of 8 and maybe 18 it's just like a after-school program and a weekend program and for Boy Scouts it helps you become a man it was it's an organization that's been around probably since the late 1800s it was rude to do it no I played sports inside my joke was you do Boy Scouts no I do sports so Mike my mom and dad made me choose between ice hockey and Boy Scouts I did hockey but a lot of my friends did like when I grew up I grew up Catholic so it's like altar boy Boy Scouts or how sports that's like what you choose and so you got a bullet yeah I got all my teeth I got my teeth knocked out from hockey but at least I didn't get that other and so Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts it's basically when you're a youth it's a youth group it teaches you how to be a man how to be a woman all right we got knots and sell cookies and all that good it's rooted in religion though which is controversial now that religions not as popular in America Boy Scouts what happened they recently got sued because of molesting boys is that right okay it's not just sued once like there's just like a litany of lawsuits and they were like what are we gonna do with all this they basically are declaring bankruptcy yeah it was a huge deal and so I was curious and so here's something that's interesting about Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts and any nonprofit all their financials are available yeah just look up annual letter annual report Boy Scout yeah any nonprofit you can go and see everything to see how they spend their money what they own it's really cool and so I looked up Boy Scouts and let me give you some stats here so they had a 1.5 billion dollars in assets membership right now they have around 2 million members that's at an all-time low in the 60 70s and 80s it was all the way up to 6 or 7 million members they make hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue think in 18 it was 200 million dollars in sales most of that revenue came from fees so you pay a fee actually Adam look up how much it cost how much does it cost to join Boy Scouts so and then they also make money from some merchandise and everything but the majority of their revenue comes from fees and then they make between 50 and 80 million dollars a year in contributions and gifts it's cost $60 a year so they receive 50 to 80 million in gifts or they give receive receive donations yeah and each Q 50 million what are they spending on here yeah so HQ includes so HQ and programming and all that stuff so basically their HQ oh so they have two million members so they have offices where their headquarters is and then people volunteer to lead troops and you probably give them a little bit of money like an allowance or something like that like a small stipend right and then they pay for all the programming so maybe kids gotta raise money to go camping and I think Boy Scouts will contribute a little bit of that so what's interesting here for you is it I'll tell you business ideas with the business and here's why so Boy Scouts I'm gonna compare Boy Scouts the Girl Scouts and then I'm gonna show you the differences in financials and then I'm gonna compare it to one other group that I think is actually doing it right and here's what I think I think that you could these new clubs these young men and young women clubs particularly young men clubs I think could be massive and can exist in today's world and so and you wonder what Boy Scouts base biggest expenses insurance insurance they pay a hundred and twenty million dollars for insurance they pay a lot of money because they're taking kids out into the wild yeah and that was wild to me that's the biggest cost okay so now let's compare this to Girl Scouts this is timely because Girl Scout cookies just got released Girl Scouts they sell eight hundred million dollars a year in Girl Scout cookies unbelievable crazy right crazy seventy-five percent of that revenue is there that's how much they paid twenty five take they pay 25% to the bakeries and I think it actually might at this point own the bakery bakeries yeah and then so that's their take the majority of that revenue goes to the truck the troops is they call it troops chapters or chapters and that pays for they do they give young women scholarships they just teach them how to be young women they do all types of programming and things like that and so here's a few ways in which they're different thirty six million dollars in dues so way less their membership Girl Scouts is about the same and they receive roughly ten percent of the gifts back that Boy Scout donations yeah so but Girl Scouts is a way better business right now I don't I'm not trying to advocate that these types of things necessarily should be for-profit businesses there is a place for nonprofit but let's just say that we want to make this a for-profit here's what I would do yeah Boy Scouts there they're the reason they're is this whole regardless if you're religious or not religion in America is not as popular it's so very popular but it's declining right it's not it's not growing it's not growing and Boy Scouts has a very religious component about it extremely and America like we don't have like Wars going on right now and when you turn 18 and like could join the military morale or two or the one Korean War Vietnam or even up until it late early 90s with the Iraqi war I mean there was there was a little bit of a rite of passage for a man you know you get a job you have kids or you go to war like there's like this like right a passage that allows that it's like alright you're you're the man you're a man now we don't really have that now right and I think that's actually a huge problem in young men's lives women have it a little bit because biologically they get their period I mean that's like you are by definition of a woman men that's why the whole thing of men you could be like a 25 year old boy or a 35 year old boy like especially in Silicon Valley there's these guys that they dress like kids still and they don't act like men and so I actually think that there could be a rite of passage a rite of passage is some type of group of like you're a boy we're gonna we're gonna help you become a man but you're thinking past the Boy Scout age you're talking about 18 no I think about younger no no I I think that you can learn that from age 8 to 18 slowly gotcha and so the best member would you do it so the best membership group I've ever seen and I've done a lot of research on this is a ARP okay and AARP what it is is once you become sixty years old I actually signed up for this because I want to see the marketing I was really interested in this there once you become sixty years old they mail you a thing an AARP card and they go you're in and you're like I'm in like yeah you just turned they find out how they works with the post office and they find out when you're turned 60 years old they send you a card that day nice and you get your card and AARP has 38 million members it's really cheap to become an AARP member like 50 bucks maybe less but maybe $18 it's really cheap depending on the tier you get and so but AARP makes one point six billion dollars in revenue so where's all that money coming from it's not coming from fees it's all coming from the backend so once you become an AARP member they go alright they partner with I think United insurance and a few others and they make what is it what's it up there a billion dollars a year from affiliates meaning you're now old we're gonna give you a discount on some insurance because we're pooled everyone together you should use the United insurance it's the best one and that's when they get they get their billion dollar cut it's a discount Club so as you as a member you pay a low fee you make your money back in discounts pretty much from day one they make their money by getting the vendors to offer them a cut for all these customers that they can drive to them yes and yes this is brilliant the first time you told me about this you were talking about can we do this for Millennials yeah I wanted to do this for the hustle and I was like why didn't you do this I've always thought this was your best idea oh yeah you must have learned something along the way that made you less bullish on it what was that I'm not less bullish on it but I'll explain that I know sorry I am a little less bullish but I still think it could be great so AARP it's like one of the it's might be the one of the largest lobbying groups ever so if you want to become president you have to like appeal so they appeal to AARP 38 million members you got to like you know elderly we're gonna make sure your area yeah and and AARP is so big they have like - what does it say oh sorry three three and a half billion dollar they have a hedge fund I mean like this is like a like this is how much cash they have and so when you think about what makes like a group like this passionate it's really similar to a cult right so I think what you need is you need like a common bond so what brings you guys together so for Girl Scouts it's you're a young girl yeah for Boy Scouts you're a young boy for AARP it's we're all 60 and so it's like we have to figure out how to get through this together you need an enemy I think oh so a good example of a really good group like this is the NRA right and so the NRA like if they say they're gonna take our guns they're gonna raise so much money off that so you need like an enemy another thing is you need a leader like a face and so NRA had that it was a Wayne LaPierre was the leader and like it's I'm not even a gun guide and I know his name and their other one one was um the famous actor Heston Charlton Heston and he had that phrase from my goal my cold dead hands like you're gonna take my that's the leader so you need that leader and then you need this mentality of us versus everyone and we're the underdogs and they're gonna come at us Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts actually could have a little bit with that Christian vibe but I don't know how you do it without the Christian vibe and then finally you need like rituals Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts all have that they have like the pledge you know and I don't know AARP does but when I'm thinking about this I totally think that you could create recreate some of these I think it would take a long ass time it would take a long-ass time I don't think you need all those things I think those are all like boosters there's all strengthen the whole thing and I think they come over time but I don't think they're prereqs right I don't think the pre-requirements you don't like I don't know who's the leader of who's the the charismatic leader of Boy Scouts I don't know like maybe there was one maybe it wasn't well I agree with you you don't need it but I think your point here is proving my point which is they're declining and there is a sure but I guess like they got to a certain size and mass so what I think you just have to do is sort of align a common set of people who have a sort of similar desire or desired lifestyle whether it's like you know Christian faith combined with you know learning life skills and will and being out in nature right Boy Scouts and and actually I think you can have this like Christian conservative group that would can crush it right because what I do every morning is I go to opposite news sites I go to HuffPo and then I go to bright part Breitbart you know that is yeah okay they have a smaller audience I bet than HuffPo every article has 5,000 comments right super engaged yeah so there's a big enough group there right so I think as long as you tap into any lifestyle that people care about I think you can create a group like this and so you have the sort of right combination of like benefits and like programming and rituals all those things I think are good and helpful I also think that these can happen when I saw Boy Scouts was going out of business I went looked up biggest Boy Scout competitors and they were all Boy Scout clones so they were all faith-based nature programming for young men and it's like okay well it just seems like there are other people who will want who have the same job to be done as they say like who want the same outcome but they put less value in let's say the religion component religious component or maybe it's less value in the nature component like they tell you my sister runs a program she has to daycare so she has to like childcare facilities that are like Ian home childcare facility so she took a she took a house she turned it into a daycare and or a preschool so one's up one's for younger kids one to preschool so she wanted to do a third the permitting was going really slow and so she bought this house but could the permits going slow so she did kind of a genius thing she created this program called nature kids she's like okay I can't do the prep I can't get the permit for my in-home thing they're just taking six months but I have this huge wait list of people who want you know their kids to be a part of something what if I made a nature-based program so she created nature kids she now needs no permitting they just go around through like the you know the parks and the the nature I hear they do they like learn about plants and animals and they do little exercises and they do outdoor painting and tree climbing and they're just out all day and parents love it because they're like yeah I want my kid to be out and not you know sort of cooped up or looking at a screen or all this stuff and so I want my kid out there in nature learning these skills there's no religious component to it she has a wait list out the door now it can scale like she could just create a franchise out of this like this nature kids thing is like a tiny speck but it's a comparable I think to what Boy Scouts is providing you know providing a certain so here's the two trends that this is capitalizing on the first is I don't know about you I bet I bet you fallen asleep catagories me but tech executives people who have grown up with the internet now and phones do you not want their kids do not what their kids do in this I'm the same way I bought this thing that locks potato chips in a seal like a time Locker right occasion eight and I put my phone in there okay so like I will I don't want my kids using phones

so a while back I had Xavier on the podcast and we talked about the junto group or the mastermind group that we were in and me and you that's how we met that or so that's how we got to know each other was being in a mastermind together and I'll start with a book club and so I just mentioned this on the podcast and I think I've had over 400 people and said hey if you're interested I can I have a playbook on how we run it like you know how we recruit people how we run the thing blah blah and 400 people have messaged me saying I'd like that playbook and so they're on this list of people and one of the things that came out of it was people really want to be in the CEO groups and these exist I think this stage is one that's popular they charge a bunch of money eighteen grand yeah eighteen million dollar your business crazy but like to me those feel like dinosaurs I remember when Vistage first called me and I was like this is a scam like do not call me for this and like I know people get value out of it but the amount you're charging for something that is like a very basic service seemed very odd to me so I actually want to do this out of the community of people who listen to this podcast who want to have you want to be in CEO groups I don't know if it's digital or we find you people in your cities because there's enough people who listen to this where we can create groups of eight in cities so if somebody wants to like take this idea and run with it I don't have the time but I think we can create a business doing that well and so this is what we're doing with trends which is don't charge eighteen grand its trends is three hundred dollars a year and we have a group and we found that group to be the most valuable valuable thing for people so if you want like a little taste of this sign up for trends but then we're considering the same thing which is how do we have a higher end thing which self-selects a little bit more right so yeah I'm I'm super bullish on these types of groups I feel like I understand how they work now the hard part is you got to really pick the right angle yeah that's the hard part but there is absolute need for this and I think it's only gonna grow as digital gets more popular right yeah digital detox is like the trend that that but you know all these nature base programs we talked about fall into [Music]

Kirkland brand sells 39 billion dollars of products so brand list people don't know they went out of business what they were trying to do was they were like look don't pay for the name brand you should just have high quality products and they should just be brand less and because we take away the name brand we can lower the price that was like the initial promise or the premise of the business awesome idea awesome idea I'm glad you said that because a lot of you are [ __ ] on them now because they like failed but I still think [ __ ] awesome idea and actually of course ironically brand less is a great brand and so I think that was really cool they raised a [ __ ] ton of money from Softbank like two hundred million dollars before they really achieved any product market fit and that sort of like was the death note for the company because it was just um the expectations when you raised two hundred million is you're gonna be you know a billion dollar plus company and if you do that too early and you haven't actually proven out your model you haven't figured it all out what expectations crush the business I actually so I didn't prepare because I just thought about this but what do you what's the biggest grocery store chain in America you think Albertsons maybe Safeway I don't know okay let's see Safeway can you look up try and find this just just a headline trying to tell me what the revenue or how many sales like generic brands for grocery stores or like the Kirkland brand or woke up how much revenue the Kirkland brand does well I mean I bet you it's astronomical and so actually I would I mean if you think about what brand list could become it is the generic the generic trusted Kirkland brand yeah I think and I think it's a great idea yeah the problem was that they raised all that money right off the bat I have a problem there was some incompetence with leadership I don't actually know this yeah Kirkland brand sells thirty nine billion dollars of products Henry quick with the trigger I like yeah one source what's the so you think he's lying you think he's making this up Wow thirty eight billion dollars in one year so so one thing I loved is I okay and that's just Kirkland Kirkland crazy so I listen to her on a podcast Tina Sharkey I think this one and she's like an Internet Oh G she'd been around with a bunch of companies all of which I think have not done super great but she went on this podcast she said this thing that I liked which was she was like think back to when you were a child and like let's walk from room to room you're in the laundry room what brand are you gonna see you're gonna see whatever ya tied you're gonna see whatever go to the pantry what are you gonna see you're gonna see fruit roll-up and Pop Tarts and all this stuff and then open up your fridge what are you gonna see and you see these brands and actually it's kind of like you've seen these stats where the S&P 500 turns over like I don't know 20% of the S&P 500 turns over every every decade basically the same thing happens with these are household brands these brands that seem like staples of your home right a lot of them are like like Minute Maid it's like [ __ ] Minute Maid you're out like you know now you know tang yeah Tang you know like these brands just like like they are not they can come and go generationally they don't all make it from one mom to the next mom and I actually believe that premise and she was like look the moms of this generation they don't want to pay for this like the consumer packaged goods and in the same way they want out no it's high-quality ingredients sourced you know ethically and you know they don't want to overpay they want to be you know value conscious so I liked a lot of premise I'm sad I didn't work but somebody I believe I believe you should just go out today and pitch I'm bran list without Softbank and I think I would I would invest in a credible entrepreneur I agree with you I think I had three people reach out to me that said hey can you ask can you introduce me to the people who are selling for a unless I mean I don't know them but I just tweeted it and I got an intro and I introduced three different people who are wanting to buy the assets now written what are the what are the assets what are you getting you get the name maybe a little inventory probably okay the name and email list and then unfortunately probably a bunch of an incompetent team right no disrespect but look at the couldn't pull it off there by definition well you'll you'll need to restart for sure right you'll need a clean slate and you need to lower the burn yeah I think it's cool I would charge of new membership they did a subscription because they started off with everything was three bucks I forgot to mention that that was like a key selling points like everyone's three bucks looks like three dollar store and people say the CAC was too high they cost too much to acquire customers that's probably true but like wish is doing it [Music]

it's like man this thing is doing 200 million you know impressions per day can you talk about app 11 because you said something so the other day I was talking to someone about businesses and I'm like when it's working do you know it's working what's that feel like and you made a comment earlier like it's the first time I've ever seen we're just this is what working feels like right what what what what was that like it's it's the feeling of like like when you when you're you know slamming on your brakes in the car and the car is kind of doing its own thing and you're like I'm not controlling the car it is just flowing on its own it's like it's that feeling where you know you're you build all these products and even at Apple oh and we did nine ideas before that I've done this for a long time where I'm just trying idea after idea I try to get people to use it you're looking for all these good signals and you're trying to spot it and then when it's really working it's not about spotting it it's so obvious that there's no question that it's working and so it's all the charts are flying up but then every day you're not even like man is it working or is it not it's so obvious like I got to do X Y & Z to solve you know these problems that are coming up kind of day in and day out and so it's definitely a feeling where the pull from the market is so strong that there's no there's no middle ground it's I always thought it was like oh it's I'm gonna kind of realize when I'm close to it but it's actually very binary it's like you're here and it's not working and you're trying to push into the market what you need to do but when it happens it just kind of takes off and you know I just I don't have really good analogies for yet except for that like it just it's like the loss of control the market is in control almost and you're just like trying to catch up and like you know get into that mindset of like okay great this is working we're gonna keep like pushing whatever we need to do to kind of support this case what was the revenue growth I mean you guys were at zero then was it like one month it could have been like 20 grand the next month it was like a million I mean was it that substantial it wasn't that crazy but I think the interesting thing that I learned was there you know there were a lot of players in the market where you'd go to this weather app right and the weather what do you like you know you never realized the scale of some of these apps even at that time it's like man this thing is doing 200 million you know impressions per day and I'm like a whether at like really like why is it so big and then you're not great if we get this customer these things can happen and so I think the weather the weather app does how many impressions I think I forgot which weather app it was whether it was weather bug or the weather app but it was like 200 million impressions a day like and I was like I was really surprised at some of the scale of some of these apps and like you know yes we had the best ad platform yes we made you know we made all these small tweaks to the product to like make it work better and we made our server scale and we did all these things but I think to me the fascinating thing was there were all these major players you didn't actually realize how big some of these opportunities were and kind of working at Apple oven I was like wait I want to go do this and like when I left there it was like I'm not like a huge fan of like ad products like naturally it that's not the product that I get excited about I love money so I like great it's a fantastic business I like that and then I was like oh I'm gonna go make these apps and games that are gonna go do this and actually that's how I ran into Sean I think he had checked out one of my games after AngelList was that right yeah I saw mine AngelList and I was like something doesn't add up either this guy's full of [ __ ] cuz who would leave this company that's crushing it like most people when you finally hit a grand slam you want to do the victory lap and people stay for seven years and then they write this cheesy letter about how great the journey has been and they're finally ready for their next chapter he basically left after three years you weren't even fully vest in right yeah I left a little bit on the table again I'm not complaining cuz everything's been fantastic and but it was something counterintuitive I was like why would this guy leave either he got kicked out he got fired he's not good bubble blah I was like or this guy's amazing he really just does love like his story was like I just love startups I want to build something that consumers use not really an ad tech platform and he was like I was interested in mobile because I saw how big these mobile apps were on our ad network so he locked himself in his bedroom it's like I'm gonna learn mobile in the next 6 months and he just built a bunch of Android games and then I saw him on Twitter tweeting back with people who played his game and I was like dude none of my developers all the developers I have in my company that are great none of them would ever go tweeted a customer and be like hey you know I'm gonna fix that bug and I can make this better hey what do you think about this sounds like there's something different about this guy what apps were you shocked at how big they were why their app does 200 no the casino game I mean that's not shocking is it um the size of it was definitely shocking just because you all assume they're big and they're addictive but then that and then candy crush in their initial rise was the first time in the industry where I heard like men like dis ting is a money printing machine it's like you know they would you know and not all this was at applo and i said once you're an ad tech you're like learning about the industry you're meeting other people and you're like hey these guys are willing this blanket pee but eight bucks for a user in the US and I'm like okay well that seems pretty expensive like why are they doing that like how much they make eight dollars what they're spending yeah I think at that time it was like hey if we're like a meal you know 18 to 35 or something it might be eight bucks or something like that and then on the other side I talked to somebody over there and I'm like they're like yeah dude we make like 20 bucks on them like in like seven days and I'm like and maybe those numbers are slightly off but like they were making a multiple to where you were like wait so you just have this machine where you just press this button and you put in money and you know seven days later three times more money come out and I'm like wow like how do I get that my bank account every single day to go do that well you guys had that a little bit with that blevins yeah I didn't have that right I don't know if you're this company you're vested you have a shared interest in the long run but you know me being me I was like I want that like I want the ability to have that and then the freedom to work on things that I'm really excited about and so I tried that obviously it's a lot harder than just you know one person in their bedroom doing it but what did Adam Apple of and say was he like this just we had no idea or was he methodical and an item is so fantastic at execution that is just like he's like a machine it's like you know when when the thing I really loved about him and the things I learned the most from him were like when you wanted to go do something like you know sometimes you're like oh man this situation isn't working and Adams the CEO of Apple of it yeah a CEO of Apple oven and you know you have these situations where it's like I got to go do the X or you really feel like you got to go make this move this deals bad maybe I was bad or this I was good or something like that I'll be what kind of weight on it a little bit after deciding and you could create some time what's a good time to do it for n was like okay we'll just go do this now like what's stopping us and then you know the other things like that were you know I started there as kind of an engineer and then very quickly he was like oh you could run this team you could manage the whole team I was a great we talked and then that kind of always been my experience that like that never really gets communicated and then it feels like cool I'm like the manager but not like I think a lot of people end up in that situation especially in companies and then like the next morning is like a meeting with the whole team he puts the org chart up and then every time we changed it the same situation happened he was so clear and effective with his communication and execution that I was like like I really need to be like that like that's what like I think a plus execution looks and feels like day in and day out and it's like it's not emotional it's very logical it's very quick and I think speed in these situations helps create clarity because when you arrive for the other way around clarity help create speed yeah or both right like you know and I think clarity in the sense if you delay it your team becomes unclear and then it gets a little muddy and then you're like wait what is what's going on here why is this guy kind of acting like that and that person not and I think just being very fast and quick in that execute once you decide you should go and execute it and I think that that's that's the thing that I learned is like how quickly can you do that and how effectively can you do that whether it's an email and I'm really not good at this it's kind of one of the reasons I pointed it because I see myself kind of like oh wait on this a little bit or send this email tomorrow I don't know open up this can of worms right now like and then it's actually that's the exact opposite trades like just go have a bias for action and and kind of go do that and so from him I learned just just an amazing amount in like how do you operate at this level and I mean since I've left they've grown so much that it feels like I was only at the 1% of it like I feel like I don't know 90% 99% of the story anymore because they've grown well beyond that they've expanded into other areas they're really big now from the revenue side they're really big now from you know what their marketplace is and they're very well known and you know I kind of get all the benefit from from being there a long time ago which is great for me but you know I'm sure there were more learning I missed along the way [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
we're good we're here welcome back thank you how was the big stage you went to New York yeah so what I did was I went to New York and I originally went to meet with some advertisers of ours and to be wining and dining or what yeah I'll tell you about it and then I went to being the Gary Vaynerchuk podcast and then I went to be on peasant pomp yeah everyone knows him as pump pomp yeah and I know his podcast it was cool did gary vaynerchuk's podcast first thing in the morning at 8:00 or 9:00 or 10:00 a.m. when I got there I was a little groggy from my flight because I took some medicine when I flew it went okay we'll see what happens so you walk in what what happened yeah so walked in so he has two offices in New York one Hudson Yards which I've been to before it's buzzin this one was the studio it's a little quieter but still pretty badass in Brooklyn Long Island City Long Island City it is which I don't know if that's Brooklyn or not but it was awesome man and you guys know each other you don't know each other so is just like her social climate but we had he knew who I was and obviously I definitely know who he is and he knew who our company was he he was totally nice and he was really low-key at first he wasn't like cocaine Gary yeah he was like you guys do a little chitchat small talk beforehand or you just got into me so here's what happened we sat down and there's like an audience there's like an audience of like ten maybe five or ten people me it was me and Adam on our side of it he had an entourage and we sit down and he goes all right go looks at me and I was like I looked at add up I would I go Gary I think you're interviewing me he goes oh I am I was like right Adam like is that right yeah that's what we set up out of the safety blanket yeah Gary was like oh okay so tell me about who you are like it was good it was a nice guy that's good to know yeah you know he's an easy target because he's so loud yeah I believe the screen went off there I believe that he is totally legitimate and a really good businessperson I think his company Vayner is really really hard to run and he heard that he was currently the CEO oh and CEO but great business are being good business and he's totally legitimate he's like because you can like what makes you say that so long you could put him in like the Donald Trump category of a guy who talks a lot and you're like I don't know this kind of real deal right he's totally the real deal he just talks a lot but what what were the little tidbits that gave you that impression right cuz I believe that I'm not saying you're lying I asked him I go so how do you like working here I always ask employees I asked a front desk I go what what's what you know and you can kind of tell if they actually like it yeah and when he has 800 employees so the and the office space was it was really expensive real estate there was really nice furniture everything was set up professionally it's a real business right so you could tell what's legitimate and what is it once you go in there in this Hudson Yards office they had vaynermedia water bottled water the office was buzzing everyone had nice computers it wasn't it's not a startup right felt like a legit operation totally for two hundred percent and kudos to him man he's talented and you did the podcast you know rate your performance I gave myself a c-plus okay and then because I was it was a I hadn't done any reps that day like I did a pilot a podcast later that day I had a Red Bull firing yeah all right I'm on it it just it just fell a little flat but Adam and his people said it was one of their favorite ones they've ever done and do you have a little prep routine you would do if but let's say before you get on stage before you do an interview how do you you know switch the light yeah well I typically will like you know how it is like when we're doing this thing I was in a piss I was in a shitty mood a minute ago and these lights turned on and you're like I got a like snap out of it and what I do is I talked to the receptionist or I'll talk to the uber driver just to like start it out of your hand get my words going and getting a better happier mood yeah and that's usually what I do okay is that what you do no like everything I try to like study and come up with like a framework for how to do it and like a technique and so I picked up two things so I picked up one from Conor McGregor that he I was watching this documentary of hawk with a pen in your mouth yeah so this I tried it and it actually works fantastic so basically you take a pencil or a pen you hold it sort of horizontal sideways you bite on it so it's in your mouth you know sort of going out past your cheeks and then you just talk for one minute and what happens is because the pencils there in your mouths in this awkward position your tongue has to really work to like flick over and under this thing to get to the spots he usually goes to so you end up enunciated way better I don't know if it's placebo I don't know if it really is like an actual warm-up for your tongue but this [ __ ] works I've recorded myself before and after and I can tell the difference and other I had other people listen to it I said oh tell me which one of these sounds better and I don't know whether it's placebo or not if that one works for me the other thing is like a quick physical change so push ups a wind sprint jumping jack a scream music whatever I am a big believer that that that the fastest way to change the way you feel is through changing your body rapidly with tan works that's like a Tony Robbins ism Tony Robbins says this great YouTube video if you go look at if you're just YouTube young Tony Robbins and it's you know the same guy - 25 years he's in a tank top and he's given the speech and he talks about he goes before I get on stage you know people always ask me okay you're you're public speaker you do you do a really great job how do you do a great job of this and he goes because I don't make the mistakes most people do because most people are sitting in a low energy shell the body body posture sucks and then they just get up on stage and they don't warm up like an athlete would never do that and he's like I treat myself like an athlete I get myself in a mental state a physical state he goes the second thing I do I don't try to memorize what I'm supposed to say because when you try to memorize what you say you're trying to prepare but what ends up happening is your mind is then editing it's comparing what you're saying versus what you kind didn't remember you're supposed to say is you give this other whole thing going on in your head that takes you away from the moment third thing and this is the last one he goes before I go up there convinced myself that the audience has to hear this like their lives depend on this information like they need I'm here to help and if I can get this across like even with this podcast for example it's like you know somebody is out there they're commuting they're you know they're they have this idea that they haven't taken action on they're kind of beating themselves up about it or you know they look around at the five people that they hang out with the most and they're just like these people are not like me and we're in their ear balls and they're like oh there are people like me out there and yes I should take some action and yes I should have some [ __ ] energy today and so he's like I just convinced myself that they have to hear this and then I'm here to serve them and I was like okay I do that just thinking that has made me feel better there you go another thing that I did while I was out there is on Sunday night I tweeted out so when I fly I take a lot of xanax it's the only drug I do I don't do any alcohol and sometimes the night before I'll take it a little bit as well because I really hate flying and so on Sunday night I tweeted that I rented this Airbnb which I did and I'm gonna host a meet-up and I got 200 replies saying let's meet up right and that I couldn't do that so I only let 20 trend subscribers come and so the trend subscribers are also not 100 of you listeners or not 100% of listeners are subscribers but all subscribers are listeners right and they so I met I think that thirty ended up coming and it was [ __ ] awesome it was so cool up this one kid flew up from South Carolina or something and I treated this on the meetup was Monday night I tweeted this on Sunday night yeah like there was no preparation like we all we did me and Adam landed and on Monday morning we went to the Mexican place next door and said hey can you bring over enough tacos for 20 people there's two or three hundred bucks and go buy some beer and we'll pay you more money and that's all we did and it was awesome yeah these people are [ __ ] fanatical is crazy it's nuts it's really odd who was the most interesting person so many interesting people one guy there was this one guy I I forget his name maybe he's listening he was an older the eldest guy there which is not old but minutes fifty s or 40s and he built was it builds custom electric cards cars and through the trends groups sold 50 cars just another custom electric car I mean like he was making uh like they took a they take a Prius or it took no they took yeah they took like a some type of pickup truck and made it an electric delivery van oh wow for a cannabis company in LA cuz um who else did I mean I mean I met all types of people one guy who sells fake boobs for a living so he sells his he'll be more fairchild he does ever talk to on twitter hunter yeah yeah I see this guy on my Twitter all the time yeah he sells fake boobs yeah his boss invented like a better dude what's in his bio cuz I've looked at this guy's bio and he's not advertising this so let's see what this girl a DD we're just sitting down a hunter came and we were just shooting the [ __ ] what do you do and this woman a DD she's nice I've met her before we were just sitting there and she's like well I sell breast implants and we were like what and we just start talking I was like so do you have like a woman who comes with you and like shows you like shows the buyers like you need like sales brochures like how do you have like how do you show that your boobs are the best and he was just like walking through this whole process it was crazy I had never heard of such a thing yeah me neither but of course he came up from Virginia for this that's great all right cool so you can do more of that of what well you and I need to do more so what we can do is New York that we could get I easily we could have gotten 200 people yeah so we can do one in New York I think a cast or whatever we use tells us where people are right we got to go to Canada we got to go to Utah when we shout it out Utah I know I still get more do the number of these friendly ass Utah you know citizens whatever they're called you times reach out all the time like hey when you guys are here I got you so maybe like it feels good to be taken care of like that does feels great made hospitality hmm February yeah when you end of February we should do a thing where could try to hit up like three cities in five days right maybe maybe so I got into this thing I don't have I told you about this this thing called reality have you heard of this No so basically you know Jewish people have birthright yeah and I don't know exactly how many the mechanics of birthright work but from what I understand all about it if you're Jewish you get to go it's paid by the sort of wealthy Jewish people around for all the Christians fundamental Christians Christians who believe that Israel's the land for Jews Wow okay didn't know that so basically that's a cool thing for Jewish people you're shaking your head are you Jewish Henry but you know about it you just stunned yeah I've never been more jealous than where my friends go on birth right and then come back it's like this mini study abroad yes great and so then I was like all right what is this you know how do I get more of this so they have this program called reality reality 20/20 if you want to look it up and it's basically you could be in these different groups you can be in entertainment it could be in technology you can be in whatever social impact you apply to get in if you get in I apply I've applied before I got rejected a few years ago this time I applied I got in and it's like a small group I don't know 30 people 40 people that get accepted and get to go it's not all expenses paid but it's like most expenses paid and so yeah anyways I'm going on this trip late May now and we're gonna see what this is all about to Israel and I don't think it you don't have to be Jewish this one's not like it's like it's more like you know Israel's right you know sort of gotta start up and kind of thought leadership and young people that sort of thing the future leaders I mean it's like a not in a bad way it's a propaganda thing it's like it's like a program yeah so I'm doing that but my question to you when you going it's late may so first scared of Quran of iris may not go I was going to Germany in May so we should talk about Crone advisor in a second but secondly why did you have all the good things why don't other people do this this seems like a great birthright seems great Jews and Mormons yeah Mormon so there's like the same thing but Mormons might be better now because they don't drink do Mormons have these perks like that like birthright or something yeah they have all types of [ __ ] dude and they're all real good at basketball and juice they're all like real similar well the thing I like is the sort of pay it forward thing I think Silicon Valley has this a lot where a lot of people who move here they hesitate to reach out to people because they're like well why would this person one help me I you know I have nothing to offer but like that is the culture of Silicon Valley is to pay it forward it is to help the like next person who doesn't know anything and I feel like Jews have this in their culture and I feel like Mormons have this in their culture you know I'm Indian I don't feel like there's this same it's not as strong for Indian people to sort of try to help out the next and I think part of its cos are such a big population you can't afford to do it there's like I don't know six million Jewish people on earth or something crazy and they run the world so I think you know with a small number of people you can offer this like much more high-touch help each other model I agree let me make one quick announcement before we get into it and I won I wanted to make this on the top of this maybe maybe my chop it up maybe our editor can chop it up but what I want to do is I've heard about these people say subscribe unsubscribe subscribe again alright and I want to test it so last time we asked our viewers for more reviews and we now have 550 maybe we got 500 400 reviews and in just a couple of days you guys are really active and they all sent me messages I try to reply to everyone to do I did now yeah I went okay so here's haven't got a reply I thought you did get reply so here's what I want people to do and the reason I'm gonna I want to do this is because I think people like seeing us succeed and they like seeing the journey yeah so you're gonna help us succeed so here's what you do if you have an iPhone you're gonna go to like the the menu where you can like turn your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth off and all that there's a button on the bottom right where you hit record okay record that that's gonna record your screen then go to the podcast app go to my first million click subscribe and then unsubscribe and then subscribe again send us a video of that happening and if you do also send us a question that you want and we'll answer your question yeah bake a Q&A and this will tell us the truth right because there's like we need to run the experiment need to know is this how is it does this actually work or is this just like a myth and if you send us your question ideally send it via Twitter yeah so everyone could see and can comment in that way it's easy so just record yourself subscribing and subscribing and then research gravity do it a bunch of times record yourself post that on Twitter tag one of us or both of us and then on that same thread ask your question and if you don't have a question that's fine too and then we're gonna look at the chart so we're gonna see what this does to the chart movement I think it's gonna actually boost the chart movement if I if the theory is correct you know I believe this is why podcaster to ask people to do this is because this should actually work and if it does here's what we'll do if this does work and people keep doing this what we'll do is with only the people who do that well like take a screenshot of our analytics and set it to them yeah yeah well share the data yeah no problem okay you want to get into some stuff about coronavirus or you want to yeah okay so I'm terrified of coronavirus and you know generically I'm terrified you know I was terrified without information and then I started looking into a little bit more so they don't even know about it can you explain what the yeah so basically there's a couple of these viruses they're influenza strains and so the flu flu yeah so basically a few years ago you probably heard you know SARS or swine flu and so you know the very first time I think SARS happened there was you know kid got this flu goes to the doctor's office they're like okay this is the flu and kid dies within like a very short amount of time they're like well that was odd that doesn't usually happen so they took a sample and sent it to like the CDC or whoever right like they sent it to some lab to say you know what do you see here there was this was a very unusual case the health deteriorated so quick that's not typical to the flu and what they realized was hey this is a new strain called I think it was like h1 and five at the time and it was like this is only ever found in animals this is the first time it's crossed over from animal to human and so that was bird flu when that happened and then so there's been these different sort of very very deadly viruses SARS which art which was very very popular MERS which happened in the Middle East respiratory syndrome and so it's kind of what these Middle East respiratory I think syndrome is the what MERS stands for and SARS is sort of the same thing and so the thing with these was that you know although there's a lot of hoopla around SARS and bird flu like SARS killed less than a thousand people less than a thousand total fatalities not a big drop in the bucket as far as the death bucket goes on earth coronavirus already killed like three thousand plus people so already much bigger than that the reason it's scary though is actually and for a while people were like oh don't worry the fatality rate is low fatality rates like I don't know three percent for this whereas four stars it was like super high I don't know I don't think that number is like majority of people who have it died where's where this three percent means you get it but you have a good chance of living but the big problem with that and the article that I read was called why you're probably why we probably can't contain coronavirus why you probably are gonna end up getting coronavirus is because this virus is extremely contagious but has these symptoms that are very problematic so it takes a while for your symptoms to show up so you have it and you carry it for like you know 14 days without showing symptoms so you'll be spreading this around and not even realizing you have it then once you have it you don't just like deteriorate and like your health doesn't go to [ __ ] where they you know you're in the hospital they quarantine you it's like you know it starts innocent and it gets worse over time so the infectious period is so much longer that there's basically no way to quarantine this thing there is no way for us to contain this and so what the article was saying was like ironically because it is not as fatal and it's not as bad for you right away this thing is gonna be unstoppable most likely case second thing with that was I guess there's four like and you know typical strains of the flu which is why you can get your flu shot and still catch the flu every year so you guys are these four different strains and the vaccine doesn't cover or sort of all all the different variations and and so this guy's case was that most likely this is now just a fifth annual you know strain that we're gonna have to live with and it's just gonna suck it's a very very you know kind of a downer also I'm sure you know sort of the bio nerds out there gonna be like you know there's 15 million strains that's right but like that's the summary that I took away and if you want to just get the point that's the point and so what you have up here is d2c stuff so like my I looked at my portfolio today is like [ __ ] so lost money yesterday off the stock market so crazy shit's happening all around so generically stock market you know people get paranoid bonds you know people flee to bond stock goes down that sort of thing other funny stuff happening you know zoom the conferencing software so the stock ticker zoom goes up 50 percent today because [ __ ] but wait there's more it's the stock ticker zero om but that's not zooms actual handle zooms actual handle is ZM so people are buying the wrong stock because they think people are gonna be working from home and teleconferencing in and so they're buying zoom which does something else altogether so much small cam stock I don't know Henry check what the stock 4 zom actually does and it just tiny stocks I would jump 50 percent today and like you know but you could actually predict this because this happened also at the IPO whoever bought zoom the other thing got his huge pop at zooms IPO because of this so we could have predicted this one I love when that happened but all kinds of [ __ ] up things some other things smart friends are basically saying hey if you need percents my smart friends you know people who actually read the real information and like understand how the world works they were like hey if you need prescription drugs you should start stockpiling because most of its coming from China and the supply chain globally is [ __ ] and like the world doesn't have that like friend friend of a friend basically how the [ __ ] do stockpile prescription meds basically buy up buyer refills and and so the there's no global plan B for what happens if China gets sick or slowed down we don't have another like supply chain and so all kinds of things are suffering and I have friends that have D to see companies that buy their [ __ ] they're back gonna and they're saying [ __ ] yeah months and months backed up I was talking to a supplier yesterday and he was like even if we come back to work there's you know all the other factories that we depend on the printing factory the packaging guys and they're not coming like the workers are just not coming back because in most factories in China the workers don't actually live in that city permanently so for Chinese New Year which is when this happened so Chinese New Year's a month long holiday yeah well we have a all Chinese intern he told us all about it he goes he goes it's the largest day in the world right because every Chinese person everybody goes home and when they go home they go back to very rural areas and already there's this problem where they don't cut me and often that will come back as you know they don't want to be living in some other city working in a factory but with this people are just not coming back and so there's no replacements it's like a very dire situation well and like obviously the human level also incredibly dire situation so to turn [ __ ] into gold where is the opportunity here I mean what's gonna happen do you think that this is gonna impact have long-term impact with China China making [ __ ] and you have to go elsewhere I don't know so there's a question of like so two two theories one is for stuff like this the people who are gonna do really well they didn't start now they started something two years ago a blog on being a prepper or whatever and today's your day you know like this is your month and so I don't think the I don't know how much I am interested in sort of like today opportunity also feels kind of [ __ ] up we talked about Judy the other day right the Judy sort of survival bags my friend Joe speiser bought something from like survivor kit calm and he got an email from them saying we have a hundred times our normal volume we apologized but we're gonna make it happen right so those the Judy thing that which the respiratory of demands those are not on the Judy bag but the respiratory masks are just like out of stock you can't get them and that's like the thing you need is like to protect your no they're not long gone no one can pounce on that yeah we covered this guy who launched a company called um Judy yeah Judy it's a emergency kit yep an orange like emergency backpack ready big my wife texted me today and said what's gonna buy a bunch of stuff I feel the same way more people are doing this have you ever been an emergency situation by the way have you ever like been in a city when like a flood happens or anything like that it's really bizarre how it feels no I was in Hawaii our honeymoon there was a hurricane in Hawaii oh I wake up any minute when I was there and so we went to the grocery store where I know first we go to the hotel and they're like hey um we have early checking available we're like well that's cool thanks cuz we're a honeymoon and they're like no we just have like a lotto in rooms there I was like what's going on they're like well have you seen the weather report like there's our hurricane this week of course I don't take the weather so I booked my honeymoon on a hurricane week and so we go to the grocery store and it's like the zombie attack has happened like all the water bottles are gone like the shelves are empty people are just checking out like four carts worth it's really like it's an odd eerie eerie feeling when that happens yeah this thing my issue here's an opportunity if someone wants to go for is you know how cool is it there's a political check is that what's called political political fact you mean like the fact-checking thing yeah I don't know so what you do is like did Bloomberg really say this right and it goes that's what I want for a coronavirus right now I don't know what true and what is it so there's a blog called I believe it's called the prepared calm it is exactly what you want it is plain English it's like here's the facts not the overreaction and by the way we'll tell you about the overreaction and why it's an overreaction but here's the facts what's presented in a calm calm way but site is beautiful it works great on your phone I tweeted at the guy who started like this is a like thank you for making this yeah I was like thank you for making this site because this is exactly what I need in this situation I feel like it's like it's cool I'm into this so scary situation yeah scary all-around best of luck to everybody yes for sure okay you want to move on yeah let's move on okay oh I have a few interesting things that happened as cool companies that we could talk about the first thing is something that has made a huge impact on me and I think more people need to take advantage of it which is transparent numbers so basically there's a group of people out there who believe that transparency is good and they share all of their revenue they chair they share their every metric about their business as deep as everyone's salary their bank balance churn how much it cost to acquire customer how much a customer stays on for everything some are a little bit less will they'll share how many customers they have how much revenue they have what the bank balances more people should follow these businesses I for one and totally against that I don't think you should ever reveal that but I'm happy they do and yeah so some examples so thoroughly so first of all my friend encore what's encores last name he runs teachable I don't remember his last name if you google on it can you tell me on course last name founder of teachable okay so he reveals on Twitter the valuation of every round what is it Matt Paul yes net said knock Paul knock Paul he reveals the valuation of every right every time they just raise like 20 million bucks yeah duh whatever hundred something really good and he reveals how much revenue they have how many customers they have it's awesome yes I love that the other guy is Sahil Sahil from Gumroad shitty business seems like an awesome guy he reveals every single month yeah although you could Google Gumroad founder Sahil it's on his Twitter if you just he doesn't have a tweet lane sitting after you don't even have to dive into the books so yeah here's some forty characters um Joel from buffer he does this they actually just switch so if you go to bear metrics calm or google bear metrics they have like 18 different companies that do this and it's pretty cool and Joel from buffer used to be on there there are 22 million dollar your company so pretty valuable and they were well they feel everything every employee salaries like name salary equity you know level everything and you know what they're changing they're showing less and less because have you talked to him do you know why it becomes problematic when you add more people yeah duh so I get you know guy you know creates you know turns his kitchen into a man cave instead gets a girlfriend and he's like oh she doesn't like it it's like yeah oh [ __ ] man like I told you this like when you bought the plasma and put it on the fridge people don't like their salary being public people get upset when they see their co-worker who slacks off and works from home two days a week and they say because people understand like different people have different situations it's not like so so they did it I think at a smart way which is they basically were like they use it as customer acquisition yeah it's part of their story because they got their ass kicked by HubSpot and so they like you know this has become a bit of a playbook for small business of business SAS companies which is look you know acquisition of customers is hard if my customer is a small business owner what a small business what would bring a small business owner to me what content could I put out there that would make a small business owner come so instead of saying seven tips to have more effective meetings they were like here's our here's our P&L for this month and sure enough a lot of people wanted to see that so a lot of people discovered their product through this and so you know maybe this lines up totally with their values and that's why they did it but death definitely it was a great way for people to discover their business I didn't use buffer but I read all their [ __ ] and if anybody ever needed a solution like buffer I was like Oh buffer you should use buffer why because otherwise I wouldn't have even known about them and so this was a pretty counterintuitive thing that they did and they were the only ones doing it and so you always get paid when you're the only one doing it if it's juicy yeah and so one more person who's doing it and his business is way better than buffer I love this guy's business so it's my friend Nathan Barry I've met Nathan a while ago and Nathan has this company called convertkit they do close to 2 million monthly recurring revenue so 24 million he owns 100% of it it's right it's probably a hundred to two hundred million dollar company like it's really valuable because once customers are locked in it's basically a MailChimp competitor it's an email that seems high to two million a month you said oh that's for sure how much they do so they do to me know that part so 24 million a year so 24 million you think they're worth what 10 times 10 times that okay maybe growing like a weed maybe people don't switch from their email platform yeah it all depend on the retention so can you pull up actually can you open it open up their their metrics so just as hi just Google like I bear metrics dashboard or something I forgot what the URL is but it's like something dot bear metrics comm and it's like their whole companies like here's how many new customers we got here's how many people turned this month it's like all their graphs and you can use it for your company he even showed how much profit they make I think it's like vert kit it's like yeah here it is you gotta zoom in there you go so this I don't know if this is their business so this is like the example thing but it's like monthly recurring revenue net revenue fees this is somebody else do convertkit yeah do convertkit bear metrics I've been convertkit revenue maybe I also use convertkit I actually I pay for subscription because I'm like this product is so [ __ ] powerful I don't actually have many sequences set up I have a sequence of one email right now which is not a sequence it's just an email but I think it's a great product I love convertkit I love Nathan Nathan's a great guy Nathan's only twenty six or seven years old we talked to so we talked about the idea of doing a drip sequence to build a newsletter for women going through pregnancy and like week by week and I had a friend I are starting a random listener reach out on Twitter is like I'm doing this here's my kind of unique asset I have to go about this and how should I set this up and I sent him to convertkit I was like dude your problem is gonna be solved in like you know the next 90 minutes what are people leaving barometric so why can't you find it here you go 1.7 million oh is that it what's the URL yeah so 1.7 million monthly recurring revenue and you could just look at the return so annual run rate doing 20 million a year which is up 1.7 percent that's got to be how much this month revenue cheering 5.1 percent per month it's not great either well it's because it's a small to medium business like if you're turning 5% a month that's like what's isn't what's the net growth so 5% a month is the churn what's the new business every month one and a half 1/2 percent yeah so he's negative then per month no I think that that churn growth month that growth number takes into account churned actually okay gotcha okay that's the but this is because it's the the average revenue even says so they make on average $60 is a $60 a month per user right and on the right of media business gonna have a it's gonna have higher turn compared to other SAS but if you're a real sicko you could just look at the livestream on the right and see every minute when somebody pays them it'll say like right now it says 20 million dollars paid by you know anonymous company dude he's got a lot of failed payments here and get on that Nathan what's going on you can't be failing is 3 out of the 12 payments here failed for he has a chart that says which ones fail so these these companies are badass so you wouldn't do it no I think what about a part of what you do the email list size the revenue I don't want to share anything publicly I'll say like 8 figures or write something no I just don't think it brings a lot of good either you know when a company's trying to raise or sell their business because like two months before all these articles will come out just like handing over they're handing over information why is that happening because they want to raise the ground they want to sell their company in the next six months I don't know I'm not a fan of it at one time when I when I did my first conference when I was younger it made like 60 grand in profit and I told everyone in the blog post and I hated the attention so I'm never gonna do it again okay so let's talk about pipe comm you know pipe comm I saw this and I was like dude this is awesome I was I came to the I came to a little scratch pad to write it down and you already had it written down okay so here's what here's here's let me set the stage here so when you have a subscription business I'm talking about software subscription but maybe it could work for all types of stuff what happens is you do one of two things the first is you say all right you sign this deal and you owe us $200 a month and so that is a $2,400 a year subscription service and the company that is your customer will pay you $200 a month what a lot of companies prefer to do but this is actually a lot harder as they say alright you signed one-year contract let's get all of your payment upfront right now the here's the balance here is do you want or this is what people think they can either get more customers and allow them to pay monthly right or they can get less customers but allow them to pay annually and get all that cash flow upfront and what what's it called pipe what they do pipe comm if you have a businesslike convertkit and they have a history of three years and it says look every month our churn rate historically is five percent pipe can go okay so you have all these customers paying you each month let's just I don't know how they discount it but they probably probably discount it a lot so they D rate risk it and this'll say well let's just assume that you're gonna have a twenty percent monthly churn right we're just gonna we'll give you all that money up front and you owe us as the money comes in with a little bit of interest right awesome awesome business so I've so many thoughts all right so a couple things first the financial infrastructure what's what's really going on here the financial infrastructure for software companies and tech businesses is being rebuilt so we already had investors right angel investors seed investors series-a investors blah blah blah but then you have a bank for startups Mercury started by you know some successful founders from Hayes app they started Mercury it's supposed to be a bank designed for startups and then you have things like bricks or ramp which we talked about which is like business credit card designed for startups because the legacy institutions don't understand how to value these companies how to assess risk or how to like fund and finance these companies then you have things that are you know like market places where you can buy and sell to buy and sell online businesses like quiet-like brokerage or wherever you have due diligence firms that pop up that specialize in software business like centrica then you have you know guys like pipe which basically say great you know you have a cash flow problem but you have steady we know you have a predictable book of business we will give you the cash upfront and we'll take a Vig off the top of that and so I think these are all really smart businesses each one at a different part of the financial stack yes we software technology Capacete we use it's it's pipe but for media and publishers and pipe has raised seventy million in funding they're kind of stupid because we use them and we have a million millions of dollars in credit from them and we won't leave them because it's a wonderful service but the reason why they're kind of stupid is because the markets a lot smaller right then software and the numbers are a lot smaller right I think pipe will be a multi-billion dollar company yeah or the one problem or that this is a lot of there's a lot of competition yeah I think the aggregate will be so for example this is also happening on the customer side right so companies like a firm or sessile or after pay consumers yeah that's on the consumer side but same same idea which is like they're trying to provide different financial instrument that like the traditional financial company like this the current sort of incumbents aren't really figuring out how do we help ecommerce companies sort of how do we help merchants you know turn their products into monthly payments for their customers but a firm came out and did it and you know fast bit our sorry not fast Bay after pay I think after Paisley's dollar company or something like that in Australia a firm is a multi-billion dollar company here doing the exact same thing and they're all fighting over these merchants I love this [ __ ] man I say [ __ ] the big banks I [ __ ] hate them yeah I hate him so much I hate having to talk to our rep they don't understand me right they don't understand so we're doing so Sean are the producer and editor for the podcast he had an idea so I asked him one day because I you know I haven't want to sort of my right-hand man so sometimes I just ping him with just random questions I said what's the biggest idea in your head right now I was like you know what's the biggest startup idea you got and you know he's 20 21 years old I don't know exactly how old he is busy young guy and so he goes well I've been a you know freelancer contractor for you and many other people for last few years and he's like why doesn't an a sort of fast pay or pipe exists for contractors like I have my invoice just give me the money now and then you wait to like when the company pays you take it and you take 5% so figure I did half the thing and I've actually heard this idea a few times before of like you know my wife was a you know a consultant you know and so she always got paid like this on a 30 or 60 day cycle and she would have you know 20 grand sitting and outstanding payments if she could just get the 20 grand you know headache free she would take nineteen fifty you know she would take 19 thousand out of that just to get the money now and not have to keep following up via email to be like hey have you paid it yet and like all that stuff and so the problem seems real and this is more of a question to the audience of like what am I wrong about what don't I get about this idea seems like a great idea on the surface what's the problem with this idea because I've heard it bandied around a few times over the years it's not a it's not a like super niche idea I think a lot of people could have this idea so what's wrong with it and I think that you can learn just as much from common ideas that don't work as you can from great ideas that do work if you start to identify why does this seemingly good idea not work why have people tried and failed over and over again there's a lot to learn as an entrepreneur yeah I'm taking that I so pipe coms out I'm loving those things all right yeah one thing hey Henry there's a guest downstairs would you mind letting her in and she's gonna join us for like the next segment yeah Julia what's up hi how are you doing well thanks for having me you're already my good books cuz you actually listen to the podcast not all the guests do I do my homework yes yes I I have a there's a bunch of employee fans great they found out and it was I mean like they'd been really gunning for me to have a chance shout out to them you have like that like corny name for your employees like yeah brilliant so that is literally a oh my god changed it yeah well but then everyone's like hey did you just like come up with that cuz that is not that great and so I think like you know someone better with words was like how about just Everly's yeah you're fired actually I could say something like that you know with bebo somebody tried to like do that and I was like thank god there's not a nice one because I don't want this Erica thing yeah Bieber's that minute by the way I'm followed by Justin Bieber on Twitter no big deal yeah so cross ten thousand followers and Justin Bieber follows me I do pretty without reply how many it's got to be one of those BOTS that's just funny zoo thing follow I don't know Henry Justin Bieber a number of followers will find out the only way this goes down for me it's not one of the top 300 thousand friends of Justin Bieber that's better than I would have thought I thought the number was gonna be like 10 million so for once okay so it's beginning so you have sell your Juliet I really well is your company name but your name's Julia cheek yes cool man thank you I hate my last name and so I'm always thinking like you know just totally rebranding it to something cool but then I know people will be like did you just change your last name to try to sound cool which is probably the least cool thing right I kind of got the opportunity to do that because I decided I had a choice to do Julia Taylor which was my maiden name or if I wanted to and I got married take on cheek yeah and it was just sort of unique because I did it you did it uh-huh okay great and so for people listening who are like okay great who is this person why are they joining the show give us the like 30 seconds about what's interesting about you yeah so I'm really a cheek I'm the founder and CEO of Everly well we are based in Austin we are about to celebrate our five year anniversary which is hard to believe but probably the most interesting thing about me starting this company is I started a company in the blood testing space in the direct-to-consumer space coming with no entrepreneurial background or healthcare background whatsoever and had every kind of X in the box of Y you would write write I was a management consultant and I went at Deloitte went got my MBA had a really traditional Harvard had a really traditional corporate all about the pedigrees yeah I hate it I don't care if Sam's like Harvard okay I'm in yeah yeah there's definitely some interesting ties I think that turned me on to being an entrepreneur when I was there but certainly like i was really in the corporate path and then had this idea when I was working at MoneyGram and left my job to do it and I can confidently say a hundred percent of people who know me was like this is definitely gonna fail there's no way it's gonna work so what's the call yeah so when I was five years ago when I was working at MoneyGram I had a bunch of all these unexplained health symptoms this is super common which you hear for Herman and their late 20s and their 30s as they have chronic fatigue aches and pains they're not taken seriously at doctors and so I went to five or six different doctors on good health insurance and each of them are in different blood tests I never got my results I paid over twenty five hundred dollars out of pocket thing material showed up or was communicated to me but he never got results on you I personally didn't receive my person was the doctor or even if they called me like I missed the call nobody ever caught they said we'll call you if anything is abnormal well like what does that mean you tested a hundred different things like just because something's not totally out of whack doesn't mean there's not interesting or useful information there so I sat down and I looked at the health insurance landscape and I thought man people are gonna have to start paying for all this in a more meaningful way than we are today and I'm at least confident that my cohort of women between like 25 and 45 can't get the testing that they need right and I think I can solve that and to really start it out honestly not that it wasn't a big vision but it was a little bit like if you if you think about the first group you're solving a problem for that's what we launched for so today we have 35 different tests on every liberal comm on Amazon target CBS Kroger we work with Humana and we offer consumer initiated testing for everything from STI testing heart health food sensitivity etc it's like 90 percent of common test coverage from what you would get from the doctor I've raised over 50 million dollars from 5-0 from Western East Coast feces that was after obviously having like three rounds of clawing my way through funding and then suddenly things did get easier and we actually grew from zero to see we did 40 million in sales last year yeah our third year in operation okay no coronavirus no coronavirus ya know where the for specially for the for the healthcare entrepreneur and we have to do i have to learn not to do that yeah you know if we did I think we I wouldn't be here right now do something else but um but I'm hopeful there's progress as we learned today from Gilead and a couple other companies I'm hopeful someone's closed on it unfortunately no it's I mean it's a combination of new customer acquisition and repeat we have a really healthy repeat business because a lot of our tests are things like cholesterol it's not recurring we do have enterprise contracts that are recurring for Medicare but it's a mix what I would call one time repeat and then actual recurring contracts which is there's challenges there's good and bad I think when you have a one time heavy business up front you have to build a good set of unit economics from the get-go so that you're not just optimizing on this like promise of payback right right so that's been good for us on the other hand we've had to be super super disciplined in a way that I think some consumer brands haven't been right so you're based out of Austin yeah this do you see at home yes test that then gets sent to a lab a partner lab they analyze it you get the full report it's like here's everything here's what's interesting about this you could share it it's like the way that it should be like if you didn't even you didn't have to like invent this if you just ask the layperson you're like how should this work okay that's the description and then you just made that like happen in real life the other thing that's interesting is you were on Shark Tank I was so as a fan of reality TV man Sam both watched the challenge probably the trashiest reality show yeah we did it all come out already and they just released it today episode three of that one good show have you seen it I don't think yet do you know the premise I do know the premise they put people in rooms and they don't I'm gonna have to get married shut up the show language now you're gonna get like eliminated survivor style do you just edit you out like a you just not sure never again if you didn't propose insolence of happening is it's ten days behind a wall you talk to this person and you're speed-dating basically behind a wall kind of like deciding who you like yeah and then someone proposes through the wall so they're like can you come close to the wall please I'm out of me now and I want to you know I see you marry me and then but the thing is that I thought that's where the show would end but then they like put them in the real world together and they're like all right you're gonna get married in 30 days and see what happens good job in flakes yes tell me about how it came about you you apply many times one time how'd you go on yeah so shark tank was an ink honestly I am a huge fan of the show I also a huge fan of my own experience and that's not I think what everyone has to say but I always tell people I think it can be a really game-changing thing for entrepreneurs if you do it the right way it is a lot of frickin work a ton of work so I once you're on or before your before you're on ok um so I would say like so I we aired in November of 2017 good no this is like a nine-month process of I would say the year of 2017 80% of my year was so we applied its and by we me and it's like a 50 page written application online oh no it is printed and written out I tried to like use a PDF Editor I mean it was like yeah like it was like a decade ago right the thing I write this whole thing out I will be honest I was I was a finalist at TechCrunch battlefield internal 16 the producers scout from three companies so they reached out so it's kind of like if you're thinking about American Idol maybe which I would never be but you you either can get contacted and sort of put in the front and to audition or you kind of blend in or wait line so it's not that I had necessarily a better chance but I did get shortcut into the application process so filled that out the obligation probably takes 40 hours and then you have to sign all their contracts and basically sign your identity and image away to ABC for in perpetuity but um and then from there you do a voice interview with producers you do a video interview as well with the application then another video interview of your pitch and then from there the producers work with you for about four months on like what is your story what is your brand what is your script and then ultimately your what I think people don't realize on sharing a story it's a human interest story you are there to make good reality TV but it is your decision the producers will help you and advise you but this is your gig and it's up to you to decide how you want to display yourself and who you want to be on TV but they can then decide whether or not to air you do you still remember opening because you probably drilled it like I did I did and I will tell you I thought I was like really good and comfortable at public speaking and then I did sounds like okay I was really bad and now now I feel comfortable yeah I did so I signed or I shook on the largest deal ever for a female entrepreneur in terms of valuation so yet with Lori Grenier she is on board she's been tremendous because of QVC or when for me it was really at the time we had no brick-and-mortar retail presence and I knew that that was a priority for us to create a product it was like actually accessible and ubiquitous and that's actually in hindsight been a really good move for us but I felt that she would be invaluable in helping us to get all of those stores yeah she really helped with packaging and branding and making something that's accessible when you're trying to like sell a testing kit where either people think it's a DNA kit right where they have no idea what it is being able to differentiate out me of like 10 seconds to grab so so the deal we shook on was a lot because there's the shake there's the actual deal oh yeah I can't disclose that Oh however we're different yes it was better for the company and probably better for Lori and better because honestly why does the deal change so normally there's like they do diligence and they might change it right for their favor you're saying it better for you guys it went that route so there was a and it's very case-by-case so what happens after the show is make sure your project because your audio yours what you're saying is great I want to make sure we're getting it all set my audio paranoia right here make sure your talk louder than you're comfortable talking so after you shake on the deal on the show a fair number of those deals I think it's something like over half never come to fruition at all and then another quarter or so actually change and then another quarter get done at the terms that you shook on yeah I think it really eat shark eat shark has a different approach so like I they're totally you then go into their management company right so you're going into Mark Cuban companies or Lori or Neer's companies and so it's not a I don't know what eat sharks processes I can say Lori's was super fair they go through very detailed diligence on everything but but you know what the show actually does diligence on you they have adventure analyst on board so they run diligence on you before you ever pitch I pitched I my valuation was 20 million post-money so that was a it was a line of credit deal at an 8% interest rate for five percent of the company and was it like hey deal offer on the spot or do you have this like long pause where you like can I think and write this down well in my case every shark was out and I actually knew I wanted either lawyer or mark green sorry Lori or Mark Cuban and so I was really excited about it and so I really did want to work with her and it was a good deal so I actually sat on the show because you're supposed to negotiate I said because it makes a good TV yes and so I said I know I'm supposed to negotiate but I want to take this deal so I didn't you do have it is really what you see like you can exit you can talk about it with your partner you can call a lifeline or a friend they may edit that out or whatever else but you can take a minute to think about it what's something people don't don't see or don't realize that is different from having actually gone through it versus watching what's one I think people know it's edited I don't think people realize how long the actual time filming can be from when you walk in and walk out to like what they edit down to five minutes so it varies but mine was probably an hour and they added it to seven minutes some people's have gone on up to two to three hours some are 15 minutes right and so I think you know it's edited to a degree but I don't think you realize how much discussion actually happens she has investing our money it is in a fun structure but it's her capital it's her mind that she's worth you know I don't know I will say she is a prolific salesperson in the sense that like the top three or four companies from shark tank and I mean companies that have done like a quarter of a billion in sales squatty potty yeah it's those she it has a relationship with each of those companies and is invested in each of those companies so I suspect quite a bit not to mention her own patent portfolio and the success she's with products she's a great team yeah and there's not an exit yeah so I don't know where is her I don't know I don't know well and I also don't know I eat you know is different right so like she does it just like in any VC deal is different right she's gonna go shooting a deal with me that's different I don't know what what terms are you know with the rest of her companies I do know she has put all of these companies on the map from scrub daddy to squatty potty's companies that have incredible consumer parlors now she delivers yeah so I'm telling you I think ever seems to me actually I don't have one but it does seem I mean it does seem very popular a pair apparently so I guess so every well question for you we actually get the test how do you actually so we got it was November we oh we asked you to be more than right and it aired the night before Cyber Monday it was Thanksgiving weekend this couldn't have been a better day all that my poor team they were wonderful they canceled all their Thanksgivings was you know a lot of work but um what we got about 30 times our normal traffic but we had an interesting experience we didn't have this tremendous like huge spike the night of in terms of purchases but we ended up doing about a million dollars in sales which at the time was a tremendously large number for us in like the four-day period after the show so there's been a little bit of this interesting thing for us that I haven't heard many other companies have which is we doubled like we doubled in that week on a run rate standpoint and then we continued doubling the next month and we never had that decline but we didn't have this spike in like the three hour period that we aired yeah we had a lot of traffic I think like a million yeah uniques yeah so and we did I mean we had to I mean at the time we were not set up for that scale now we don't even have to about it we know we've always been on on stripe not WooCommerce not Shopify we've built we've built on it now and like totally customized it it's not I know but it's one of the big ones that actually I think we should have gone to Shopify but we didn't so I shouldn't know I shouldn't name them because it's gonna sound bad for that yes exactly yeah so we're trying to get more I was gonna say that valuation right so which guy oh so yeah so we saw really good traffic increase but it wasn't it was a very different pattern and Lori warned us about that she said some companies it's like they sell out immediately and some companies it's just a slow kind of a slow burn so that was what it was with us but we did not crash which was essential stay tuned there there may be a there may be an upcoming and a waiting there so one of the Gloria potentially potentially we are actually in two years where the number I think we're number ten on the all-time best-selling list out of nine seasons those socks and then squatty potty's bombas yeah number one 250 million in sales yes people love it I'm gonna buy unlimited of the best stock yeah it was the thing I always told myself that's cool everybody do you love that yeah I love them but I need more that's yeah yeah I bought the whatever the like sixty pay or whatever like I do five hundred pairs of socks like laundry you know that's like one of the best taxi to do is what I did was I bought I only have one pair of underwear but I owned like 30 of them yeah one pair of socks are they on 50 of them yeah so I never matched socks yeah it's the greatest hat cover yes I've been doing since I was 18 should we let's say buy the product what do I shake do at home when I think physically have to do so this people are often surprised how many people we get to take their blood at home but that's often what it requires so like most of our testing is pricking your finger to draw a small sample of blood some are saliva summer urine but obviously there's a reason why they normally take your blood at a lab it's because you can analyze the most number of markers and the the broadest assortment of markers using blood so it's dried blood spot testing it's like a very frankly old-school model yes Quest LabCorp all of the labs have dried blood spot testing novel just means your your pricking a finger and your dropping blood onto a treated paper or a treated device that is then the blood is then drying we're not we're not we're a middle person which if you were a VC responding to me back in 2016 I was a marketing company yeah right and I think you know it's interesting when you're like oh well you're just a middleman or you're just marketing but I relieve us more as okay the labs are our manufacturing partners right you don't buy things directly from manufacturers typically right you buy them from a brand so we have seven different partner labs we work with probably the the one that runs the majority of our business is PerkinElmer which is a publicly traded life sciences company they're huge they're global and they've been really a good partner to scale and they have a lot of credibility they're the worldwide leader in dried blood spot testing so I know but you know what like for us in our space and we're in the medical space that's really important to have that that stamp especially with with all the failures that I've been saying here Sam's thoughts on testing samyak away I'm excited let's get a lot of them are [ __ ] yeah am i right or it depends and it's important and it's we do every test you know it's interesting well first of all so to correct you there's a major difference between a food allergy and celiac disease and then a food intolerance or a food sensitivity okay so but just for you know listeners ending it is important because even doctors just say allergy and sensitivity is the same thing I definitely interesting okay you know it's interesting we have become associated this food sensitivity testing in general has become associated with Everly well which I supposes like I'm proud of from a brand standpoint but on the other hand it's been going on for over thirty years and there's thousands of doctors that do both IG IgG IgA testing around the u.s. and most people that you talk to if you've talked to them about food intolerance say oh yeah I have that done at my allergist or I had done it nutritionist or at my general practitioner it has to be used in a specific contest context to be valuable and so I do think that is why it's really important that you keep people on how it should be used it should be used with an elimination diet it is not a be-all end-all it's a guidance it is something it is our test where we have more people quantitatively say it's changed their lives than any other test but and there's good research around it for that use but there's not good research around is saying like it's a it diagnosis you with an allergy it can just be used as kind of a black-and-white guidance of what you shouldn't shouldn't eat that's absolutely not true so I think there's a lot of misinformation I think there's a lot of different types of testing and the nomenclature gets mixed up for things that shouldn't be used for and I think it's great that I really well has been known as the brand for that but honestly we're offering a test that has been around for decades and needs to be used in the right way and if we can take the lead in educating people on what that should be then we'll do that sexual what we call it sexual health sti's and there's several reasons for that one right now our tests are too highly priced because the lab itself is expensive for us to run the tests so we I mean right now our single mark our STDs are a really good price between 39 and $49 it's also HSA and FSA covered so for some people that's a great solution but many people for obvious reasons want a comprehensive test and that test is I think 201 sti's it's STI is the clinical right yeah sexually transmitted infections is the correct nomenclature we call it sexual health testing because we think that this is something people should just be very active about for at home it's I would say it's probably us just from branding standpoint there's a couple companies specialize which to be clear should tell you how under-resourced and served this opportunity is because yes yes this is a multi-billion dollar opportunity I mean again if we're gonna riff lots of other people can come into this space there's a specific company that only does STI testing but they haven't been well funded they've struggled and we really believe that this is not only how you can fester closed public health gaps you also can get people on board to then use testing it from home over their lifetime for any other health issue as well people don't want to go into a clinic you don't want to go period and our solution you actually can not only get your results but then you can diagnose and treat through an independent physician if you have a positive if it's a relevant STI that can be treated so it's a full-service solution and what you're looking at right now is we have a really good business but if you look at the price sensitivity there's a certain age group that's gonna be willing to pay 250 to go get a test versus going to a clinic potentially customers properly in first touch or do you hope you lose money in them on their first touch and profitably on first touch that that is for me we're in Austin I'm a first-time founder we're building a sustainable business we didn't go out and raise money on this premise of just negative contribution margin and then hoping well it depends search for different categories that search has a ceiling it does have a ceiling even without right which total so for that category certainly search is great for us but Facebook / Instagram who was for a long time our largest acquisition channel and both by force and by proactively moving away we've really diversified which has been a good move for our business some TV we've had mixed success with we again because we are on this profitable unit economics from the beginning play we when we can't fully measure attribution and ROI on first purchase sometimes it's hard for us to want to invest so we've had mixed success with TV but we do believe it's important for brand building and category education no no engineering product clinical a lot of it goes into clinical and medical affairs so we have what we have a regulatory and compliance team that ensures that either the lab partners we're working with or new lab partners that were making sure that they're meeting the highest quality standards we're starting our own research studies to prove outcome data which will take time but we think is really important we do have obviously a healthy paid marketing budget but we're trying to hire more in-house around content SEO organic and those pieces as we start to actually build out like a healthy marketing and Jenin not just be dependent on this like paid social thing that we were the last few years know and that I think is a really good if you could I would have if I could have it's a really important question though said like you're a marketing company I'm like okay so it's what little this thing right see it with this cute little pink on it and then just start buying traffic what where's the I mean that's it that's how simple it sounds what was right we're done of the challenges beyond the like yeah well first send traffic to a landing page and right so we don't white label we actually fully intend construct and brand our kits and really what the lab does is run the sample that's the goal of the lab but there's also a really complex product from an engineering standpoint so not only creating obviously what is somewhat basic an e-commerce site but then a results platform that is able to speak with a third party physician network translate lab results that were often really messy and then be able to say that in a meaningful way to consumers and five years ago that was not as easy from a like a UX standpoint as it is today they also use a doctor yeah it's for regulatory reasons it's to make sure that you basically have a doctor in the process of saying okay I made sure that this test is appropriate for you I've made sure that if there are critical values so for example if you took our STI test and you had an abnormal you would have a physician call you and talk you through your next steps and offer you a telemedicine contact right and so there there are checks and balances in place you don't always have to interact with the doctor if it's just a normal result but there's certain like levels of escalation so but it is it is similar to minus FX except it's home kits and one SFX really kind of stayed on the quantified self her brand and never was able to scale yeah yeah it's still out there but it's interesting I mean there have been a lot of companies many especially after shark tank I would put it in a two dozen range that launched an Instagram create a pretty logo have a kit and then about six months to twelve months later you never hear from them again and it does speak to the power of brands marketing and experience may our NPS is a 60 we have a world-class customer base I think in this case first mover advantage really helped us in the category it doesn't cause us to keep winning but it mattered a lot here so exactly world-class would be like 80 or above right so certainly it's below that but I think how we view it as we look at other healthcare services and most are around a zero to a negative don't measure right right and so we feel good about it product rating is four and a half out of five stars on average and so we do look at that and say okay this has to be qualified it's a very favorable VC metric one that I think has sometimes limited action ability or limited kind of did data-driven decision-making right what do you do with it but we like it in terms of saying okay just benchmark well right right and you have this idea you're sitting at Deloitte and you have this personal experience where you know that's Loco like every entrepreneur has the stated story just like you know I was trying to get a test I just and behind the stories like our audience is very entrepreneurial and they feel this on a daily basis they have these ideas doubts they want to bet the idea so tell me like that oh yeah the idea that first couple weeks you know what was what was going through your mind what are you doing what got you over the punker like I'm actually gonna do this yeah I think this is important because I it is the real story right so I'm like oh I just had this idea and I we moved to Austin in a u-haul all those things are true but there's a few thing my husband and I in our dog there's a few things that I think are important it's not like I woke up one day and was like oh I'm gonna go do this crazy thing so I did go to Harvard and I was in this weird time it was during the recession in 2009 when everybody in my class in the class above me were becoming entrepreneurs and so you had Rent the Runway you had Birchbox you had guilt of years before stitch fix Oscar I had to unicorn founders in my section alone and at the time grabbed taxi out of Korea and then who was out coupang both in my section right so at the time it didn't feel that unique but I was being exposed to this day in and day out and so I had this kind of roadmap for how to go about it once I started thinking about becoming an entrepreneur and so I the reality is I probably spent two years on the weekends in my spare time not making any money but going through different industries different business models advising different companies on their business plans and seeing like what would really stick there's nothing I do but it's really like I look back it's kind of boring it's like over gravel I don't know I will I will sign it but it's it's like I would be very literal and how I would go about evaluating all these ideas and honestly Everly well was probably the craziest and the worst of the ideas for me to go and actually do given my background no I mean it was like travel luxury resale something like what the real real is doing I mean house decorating curation online like all kinds of different spaces where there's probably opportunity in any of those that you do it the right way yeah to be clear it's you know I don't know if I took an idea from them or if I if I actually came up with it but but um you know the match with Everly well was not necessarily one where you'd be like oh she's oh right it was not obvious but it was the one where like I realized really early on this is a decade-long thing so if it actually works you're in it for a long night no it's a couple years I mean until I had this health experience in 2015 and then I kind of matched the two together so this was early 2015 I ended up incorporating the company June 18 2015 I had dabbled I didn't both my parents are lawyers I didn't realize one that being an entrepreneur was actually a career choice in a path that you could like become good at necessarily mean financial success you could be a serial entrepreneur and actually make that a career and I also frankly didn't have a lot of confidence so it was interesting at Harvard because I kind of looked around and thought I think I'm just as smart as all these people who are like really founding successful companies so maybe I can do it too and I honestly did it just to see if I could do it I never like I truly couldn't even imagine having made a million dollars in sales and so I'm not sure I necessarily thought about what it would look like today I just thought it was a really big opportunity and something that I wanted to see if I could go do and that was how I made the decision as I thought I'm passionate I think it's a major thing I was in the FinTech space and I thought that was already really oversaturated by 2015 tons of apps etc and so I knew that this was an area I didn't care about I don't turns out I was a little wrong about that but um but and and you know I do think wellness FX is an example well I think they were just ahead of their time they were too early on the curve right and if it's a consumer brand you were you were right yes completely what opportunities have you and uncovered where you tell people man just so you know there's this huge problem in this industry I think we solved what other things yeah sure because I'm a total outsider but but but when I hear about yeah this isn't like price transparency which may seem obvious and I think there's a lot of companies that talk about in health care doing price transparency but they don't actually do it and even the digital startups trying to do it they can't actually tell you what something will cost in healthcare so we just go outside of insurance so that we can actually tell people what something will cost but if you were able to do this in a really big way and say hey we can accurately tell you your cost commitment for this service I think you would crush it and I don't with in insurance but I think there's a much much larger growing acceptance of consumers who are happy to pay for something in health care as long as they know what they're gonna get and what it costs and so I don't know that it has to be within insurance you also have this HSA NFS a space that's exploding in terms of people on FSA NHS a plans and then what they're using those dollars for I think there's an interesting play there of a company half-baked yeah man if you could be a so if you had physicians and you said okay I'm going to have you pay $50 any time you see the physician we're gonna own a pharmacy and any of your drugs are gonna be transparently priced and you can't use a coupon everything is the same price and it's all generic and then if you say okay and then I want to be able to get you know testing done and then they can tell you the pricing on that but here's the problem with it you have to actually own the supply chain and the services chain you have to be vertically integrated to do this because otherwise I know but my point is you almost build a system external to the system and you can do this at affordable pricing the reason health care is so expensive is because you're adding cost into the system through the insurers and those contracts then when you get the bills you're getting the bill for whatever they didn't want to cover that was intended like the provider billed the insurance company what they had hoped the insurance company would pay not at all what it costs yes some of them get stopped so for example like three years ago two years ago on on Black Friday we had a bunch of compliance limits with our banking system on spend in Facebook so I was like gosh I wish there was a product where you could actually get like a cash advance for social media advertising now now we're big enough to where we don't have to use a product like a Brack Sura but well like clear bank would do it right so but at that time if those solutions have been around we absolutely would have been able to take advantage of them and then of course they came out I was like oh that would have been a really good idea yeah but we really hit a bunch of challenges with that and it really can bring down businesses and then I think you know other places are how do you make like as you think about doing a startup I mean the amount of time we spend on contracts and HR and legal and template izing I mean there's so much cost in the system that I would love to take out of it in healthcare and highly regulated industries it's really hard to do things quick dirty and cheap and it's unwise you

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
okay I have some Bitcoin stories not as good as that but I'll share so 20 2013 I'm running monkey Inferno and so I basically it's me and I don't know 15 engineers and one one designer and one of the engineers are sort of IT security guy or ops guy Pete he was always talking about Bitcoin at lunch and Pete's also always talking about like a bunch of anarchist [ __ ] and so you know I just kind of bucketed it with that and Pete's like no you know these obstacles to hang out in IRC channels with other ops guys and this is all the talk about and so he's like no we should be doing something with Bitcoin and like we're in ideaa lab and so people are always saying stuff we should be doing I was like you know all right tell me about it and I think at this time they kind of just had it's like spike out of the sense into the dollars and he was like hey dude I've been mining Bitcoin on our servers like we made some money and I was like okay Pete but like we really need to stay focused on like business not like this thing that you're talking about so I'm like way off here but I start catching the buy start tracking it and it goes to seven bucks and I know what - like you know seventy dollars and everybody was like going crazy about it at that time which is funny because now it's at like whatever ten grand and and so we we start getting greedy and we're like all right we got to do we got to get in this Bitcoin game coinbase was out there like we got to get in there start a company and so we we start sprinting on this product that's gonna be like a coin based type of competitor but with a different angle and and then Michael birch is our investor gets word of it the lawyer basically calls him is like hey you know there's like doing a Bitcoin thing I think bitcoins for drugs and like I don't know what Sean's up to now and so he you know comes over for lunch unannounced he's just like hey what's going on I heard we're doing a Bitcoin thing and I was like yeah it's you know this could be the new financial system and I started like trying to explain it but I don't actually know my [ __ ] right so I'm knowing he's a hype cycle as well and so he's like I don't think we should do this I think it's a lot of risk he's like you know he's a billionaire so he's like you know you can lose the money I give you just don't lose all my other money by getting me sued because you started a crypto like exchange like don't do that and so he like he's like you know are you sure you want to do this and I was like and this is where I made the mistake I did have enough knowledge or conviction at that time to stand up like no we need to be in this game this is real and so I missed that but I did buy something and I made a pledge I was like ten thousand or bust because the daily jumps and drops were like so much I was like I can't even look at this because every day I'll be tempted to sell so I was like ten thousand per coin or bust and I thought that was my way of saying like I'm gonna be a billionaire like I mean you're gonna buy you bought coins you go outside so only at ten thousand or zero like it says I'm not selling in between and I thought that was such an outrageous number ten thousand a coin because it was at like whatever it just touched $100 and I was like you know ten thousand per coin that's insane and but at the time I started looking into it so what's cool is you can go back and find the original forum posts where Satoshi posted the Bitcoin white paper and you could see the reaction in those forums of what people are saying about it and you could read all these sort of like you know the correspondence back and forth it's really fascinating like if you're a nerd this is a this is a great three hours of your life and so so I got into it and then I got spooked which is a big mistake I go to a wedding in DC and my aunt who's like an old Indian would be like how do you how do you dig in the ground and she know she's telling me that she's like have you heard about aetherium like oh very good it's idiom very good I'm like wait you know what aetherium is I was like I know what a theory you don't even know what like your phone doesn't even work you plugged in like it's a cordless like it there's a cord in it it's like dude you ever you're it's like auntie at aol.com yeah exactly it's always like what's good about it auntie and she was like oh it's very you you buy it and it makes you money and I was like oh this is like what a bubble is I was like this is you know I've read about the dot-com boom and bust and I was like this is what happened people just thought you buy it because it makes money and that's what was happening and I had cousins quitting their jobs and becoming like crypto traders and they had like good jobs before this and I was like I gotta go and this was at 3000 oh I tried to sell everything luckily coinbase has like limits you can only sell certain yeah it's not great a day I was like 15 grand a week so I start selling I tried to sell 15 grand each week for I do that for like two or three weeks and by the end of it I'm like okay I've cashed out a profit maybe I'll just hold the rest I said I think I still had like half of whatever left and and then it ran up to 20 grand and then my mom's like dude your aunt knows more about this than you do like she was telling you it's good why did you sell and so and then it did bust eventually but like that's what kind of a lesson I learned dad ass you can't actually even when you do answer new financial adviser even when you know it's overhyped you don't know when it's gonna burst and that's like you know just a big problem I've held it the whole time I just said I'm just never gonna sell it I'll just I mean like if I ever have to pay rent but yeah I don't care I don't yell like forever now [Music]

anyone here a quick porn story yeah okay so I worked out of this like it never gave a nod of approval I work out of this office called the founders dojo and it was the greatest thing ever I'll tell another story about it but basically it was if you've seen the TV show Silicon Valley it was we had Erlich Bachman it was an Erlich Bachman type of guy named Dave who was a great guy but totally inappropriate and disgusting in a good way and the office was filthy and there was this guy I forget his name ritesh and Chris yeah and I remember and it was this little skinny Indian guy and he was crazy and awesome and he was like the stereotypical Silicon Valley hacker where he could get a job at any big company and make $200,000 a year but he was like no [ __ ] that I'm like nah I'm [ __ ] the corporate pigs right and so he would sleep at that office and Dave would buy them pizza all the time because he was like get one to be poor and do this thing and so he created a app or know a size a website that would crawl tumblr no I think all the internet okay for the fascists for the gifs that had the highest velocity of growth and so if a Jif launched popular gifs he would tell you right away which one's gonna be the most popular and then you would see it on the screen and it was called the worst drug the worst drug dot TV it's not there anymore and that sounds like a silly thing but that's not why he did it he did it because what he was trying to do was a find the fastest like technology that could find fast growing stuff and if you would go to the worst drug at Tom you could type in something like dog and the search feature would autofill like wicked fast like way faster and then you would click enter and it would be BAM a high-def Jeff there's a high death it was full screen and it was all screen laser fast so the technology is very like pod Piper like the technology wasn't like whatever pop Piper did it was the fact that it was all behind these scenes like a bunch of nerds being like yeah our gifs load the fastest and like look it's like HD and it happened in nanoseconds and he would spend nights and I would come back and it would be just a tiny improvement but we don't gather on it well so here's the cut this the the point of the story turns out the most popular gifs on the Internet 99% of them are super hardcore raunchy porn like real raunchy porn and so because when I went to the site it was all porn there wasn't like porn and then some basketball Cheers funny one it was only porn I was like this is a porn site and so at the opposite the dojo we would have these huge screens of like his work station and the way that he sat was everyone can see it and we kind of got immune to it but it was like the Rocchi should ever and we would he'd like guys check this out early the morning we would come in 11:00 a event which was early and he be rubbing his eyes and [ __ ] and he'd be like check this out and all eight of us would gather up as hi-def screen and be like and he would type in the word like like facial and like because like watch how fast it slows and we were just so immune we're like they're not even looking at the content like oh yeah wow you could like see the shine in the liquid like it was so funny we would have like these like lawyers come into the office and people who are actually are like investors who would try to raise money for the other companies and we would forget that this was on the big screen what happened this like what's this guy doing now on the site the site the worst drug got millions of millions of millions of visitors the engagement was stupidly like good he couldn't monetize it they couldn't use it so there were so many restrictions no ad network or a lot him to use it and so even though the site I think it was getting at least for sure millions I think maybe tens of millions of monthly uniques and it made zero money it only cost him a lot of money and the story ends with like someone in Bulgaria are laughs eeeh like this like communist ex communist country wanted to buy the site and it was all weird they flew him out there and he's like wait these guys are like mobsters and they ended up like bailing and they just shut it down because it what does he do now he works at Facebook I've never seen them transfer dodge that's his name Raj I've never seen Raj because that guy is gonna build something amazing or it's gonna be a very sad ending but either way it's gonna be not average not to use yeah he was he was like if you think of like this idea of what Silicon Valley is that was that right Wow [Music]

all right we're here Sam no that's not Sam that's - Wow no new friend of the hustle uh great to be in hustle tell the people who is Stu Stu is a friend of the hustle I actually met Sam through a mutual mentor Chris read let's shut up Chris read let's last mile and transmedia capital and work out of here I do work out of here it's incredible man I was working at a home and so was my partner and for the people that know me on the phone about twelve hours a day most of my things are just brokering deals and she kicked me out right here I am Sam took in one of the refugees like you guys talked about last time that's me yeah and we after the last episode you were you were listening in and normally after every episode we're like you know how was it to the people that were kind of in the room and it's usually like good yeah I liked it and you were like it was good but here's three things I think you guys could do better and I was like nice who is this guy no one likes a yes-man yeah no one likes a yes-man especially if you're trying to make something great you always wanna nobody also like to hate her you need an honest person you know hunter person and so you were honest I like that and then we started talking about I don't know how we start talk about ideas we just bumped into each other started immediately jamming on some ideas and I was like hold on this should have been recorded come by next week let's do this and also I am with Sam gone and we gotta say he's with the garyvee podcast and you're stuck with me so I don't know who's with you that well I'm gonna do that I'm not trying to be on one of those Instagram posts where it starts out with his signature on the screen his autograph at the start I will say this office now compared to last week we gotta say Henry put it in a ton of work this office looks a thousand times better than Gary Vee spots out Henry what you have a Twitter handle Henry Billings five you know chef returning the studio's incredible for everyone that's just listening at home what the studio used to look like is if close your eyes and a matte yet to wealthy guys went on Amazon and they search by highest price for comfortable chair and they bought it and right red chair and they found a broom closet and put it in there with some of their books and now it legit looks like a legitimate studio now studio yeah there's like the soundproofing [ __ ] on the walls there's posters behind us looks like a very like prestigious looking book that just says Sam remove my glasses it's like did like he died if we have a commute here shouts out to Sam come back save so Sam did the garyvee podcast and he did Pomp's podcast if you don't know pomp here you're not in the crypto world this guy he was always talking about Bitcoin so Sam's on tour right now doing a couple other things they did a meet-up of listeners and trend subscribers in New York I saw it it was awesome they're popping off did you see the feedback from that I saw the feedback more important I saw the videos like got some nice Airbnb like yeah you guys went all out for this we're spending that was cool it was really incredible I think what I loved about the hustle and what you guys are building here is the engaged passionate community yes it's the only way to build something successful is to be surrounded by people like yourselves and everyone that was there was saying hey it's not like you just go somewhere shake hands share a business card it's like businesses are coming off the back end of that right people are actually starting [ __ ] and you know I would say - I'll give you two principles that that these stories tell me about number one the most important startup commandment is is you to rather have a thousand people who love you than a million people who wanna just kind of like you you know who could forget about you if two weeks went by and what I love about spod cast even though we have these really aggressive growth goals I know we already did the hard part that we have thousands of people who just love this podcast and that this is my favorite podcast give me more and I that's pretty good but take that to your own business it's easy to be like oh it's only a hundred it's only a thousand it's only ten thousand customers right now but the real question is do they love you because if they love you you have a very high chance of getting the next 10,000 next hundred thousand people to feel the same way every great brand that we've seen especially in the DDC space customer centricity it's at the heart of what they're doing I don't know if you saw yesterday Moyes was saying about at the start 24/7 he was on the phones in the emails responding today personally yeah he's an animal it's a nine hundred million dollar visit and he brought this up when I did the interview with him he goes I forgot who we should mention like whatever the big old spice like the big deodorant brands Lee was going up against he goes they don't know who their customers their customers target target buys their [ __ ] and puts it on the chef if they wanted to get in touch with the people who love their product they wouldn't even have their email address they don't have their connection and he said he realized early on with you know he was doing D to C before D to C was the buzzword it was just called e-commerce back then and it wasn't super sexy to be doing but he was doing you know do deodorant sales and he realized hey I have this relationship directly with the customer I could talk to them they could talk to me I could send them more products and say hey try this out is this better I can write them a thank-you note that sort of thing and I that was the underrated at the time the big difference is if you go to Moyes and you ask him who your customers he's gonna give you a specific example and if you go to other competitors they're gonna show you a slide a demographic says oh this is Sarah the shopper right yes the shopper is between the ages of fifteen and fifty right and then all the marketing guys are gonna sort of not in class exactly yeah customer centricity but you again happy to be here love what you guys are doing yeah we're gonna get into a couple ideas the second principle that I think is really important so I just bumped into Stew just doing the podcast and I would say to two things come from this there's this phrase proximity is power shout-out Tony Robbins if you don't know any better and you want to build your network you want to be around more successful people you want to be more successful yourself one of the best things you can do is just get near them like I was just in the office you were in the office and boom connection made that's what happened with Mike Brown the kind of guy who was on the podcast earlier who does oil and gas in Texas we're just here we bump into each other I moved to San Francisco on a lark just for that I was like I just better go we're get in the mix I was in Australia I was as far as you could be from San Fran you know I was this they're on a different adventure for the Commonwealth yeah I'm from Canada so a similar story if you don't mind me say before what I'm doing now I helped found this company called Factory and then let it at the end and it was literally we were a handful of guys between Stockholm New York and Calgary and all we wanted to do was not just read in books about how success is made but meet them we wanted to get where people solving the biggest challenges in the world and actually come here so we moved use the Field of Dreams approach we said if we build it they will come win on Craigslist found the biggest house we could find put our money together got it shouts out 7-eleven Scott Street right and legit is the factory that co-living co-working space it was anything and everything you could possibly imagine I've heard so much about this that's us but all it was was a network of thought leaders entrepreneurs executives where we put on everything from workshops talk dinner's all we cared about was having the best people in the world your house yeah - tell us what is making you different what is making you tick how are you building products right because if you're reading books which is fantastic I do a lot of it I know you do you're gonna say hey product is everything no marketing is everything customer centricity is everything but really you have to go there find out for every industry for every vertical for every product what makes it different right and who the entrepreneurs are actually making it happen yeah and just get around him like you don't have to you don't have to figure up step two just get around it it's the fastest path to you know sort of improving your odds of success is get really close literally proximity you get near by other successful people work out of their office hang out with them go to a co-working space whatever it is get around successful people even there's a lot of people in this podcast I imagine that are probably living in like the rural states world Canada yeah you know people like we were cold emailing works yep like anyone that cold emails me I respond I know you guys are the exact same way even all these executives it's been really big on Twitter how fast the response time was it's like if you have a clear concise message and you either a want mentorship you want to ask a question or you want to give them a piece of feedback they will respond right and how not to do it is just hey can I get some of your time hey I'm Shawn love you get can I have a minutes or an hour of your time or can I get a coffee that's the worst way to do it 100% best way to do it is hey I'm Sean I'm whatever 22 years old I'm from this place I'm doing this interesting thing or I really want to do this interesting thing you I really appreciate the things you're doing I've shared out your blog post I've yet told my friends about your podcast would you take a look at my slide deck would you play around my product and give me two bullet points of what you think I could be doing better hey I'm gonna be in your city and you know the next event you guys do I will organize it for you tell them you're doing something interesting be humble about it and and then make it clear and simple a lightweight ask don't ask for time don't ask for coffee how many generic in males are you getting a week a hundred on a daily basis this is kind of how I measure the success of the podcast on a daily basis I get thirty to forty inbound new messages and that's across email LinkedIn and Twitter DM s LinkedIn I get to like three months later but like Twitter DM z-- an email I check every morning it's just about 30 or 40 unique people doing that not a huge number but for me that's like the best part of my day is that wake up alright who reached out who said that you know they like something from this they're doing something interesting they want to work together I'd invested now in two companies from the wild listeners I like in conversations with several others and so this has been a big deal for me Wow let's set them apart so the first guy I think some people might have heard him on the live show he was a super credible entrepreneur so he was like yeah I you know I currently you know right now I run this division of the self-driving department at uber and I'm leaving to start my own self-driving car company and here's what I'm doing differently than everybody else Wow so I was like okay to get to that position at uber you got to be pretty legit you have a unique insight that you can you can tell me very clearly and then the third thing was like as I probed the story just got better as I got to know him I was like wow more impressed yes as I saw what he had done more impressed and I was like okay here you invested yeah okay how long did he go from email to close so we met we emailed we met for lunch which is an hour by the end of the lunch I was like she'll just go work for this guy like I was and which is my like ultimate sign of I should invest and then I went and checked out their prototype I have got in the car and that was an hour and then the last thing I did was I brought my former co-founder CTO from Bebo who was with me right now at twitch and I said hey I need you to assess this from a technical point of view and so he went met the guys you know said a bunch of words that I didn't understand and walked away being like yeah I'm also gonna invest and I look great so that's my due diligence so I would say for individual hours over the course of about two weeks wow that's like did you see first round I think was first round came out and said that if they look back 10 years ago it took them nine weeks to close and if they look now it's taking them nine days yeah if you're an angel you really need to make decisions within two meetings you know the first meeting you need to be able to rule them out if it's an if it's an oh and if it's a yes you need to be really clear what that second meeting needs to be yeah and then you can do your own research outside of that to check out the market talk to a couple of competitors talk to some customers whatever you need to do to get comfortable but like speed is when you don't have pedigree if you don't have more capital than anyone else speed is your best asset I agree because everyone's gonna say that they can help and a smart entrepreneur knows like hey you're not gonna help that much yeah and B everybody says they help so how can I tell who's actually super helpful until you have a great track record then you're like okay this person was a part of these great successes already I agree with you fully just to go on that do you mind if I plug something really quick to it I'm going to actually I'm gonna plug the hustle okay so going into talking about investing how you move forward what's that first step did you read the trend support this week yeah I saw they were like I'm gonna invent they're gonna invest some money into startups that it came out of the community a hundred percent if we think about you know you talked to Sam a lot about it over the last four years when he got the deal flow he heard those first ideas that were coming out that are now billion-dollar businesses that he completely missed or that he could have helped earlier on and helped them get to where they are now much earlier right it's incredible do you know of any of those examples that you might not get Sam's I know a couple of them I don't know if I should share that's okay but there's some big ones out there and so I know these guys have been talking about it for a while it's like how do we help the community and like how do we be that catalyst so now it's not just for trend subscribers either it's like obviously shouts out to trends we want you to get on there and get those nice and ideas right but for anyone listening I want you to email Henry act right Henry be at the hustle Co your best business idea and if it is chosen we'll give you $1,000 Henry's $1,000 will also find any resources that you possibly need to help this thing scale that's pretty good all right I like it it's like did you read atomic habits I've read about a third of it so far so what really stuck out what these guys are doing great here and on what I want kind of every entrepreneur to hit on is understanding the difference between motion and action every lunch brewer thinks they're in action but legitimately they're talking about the idea talking about it you with the idea tweeting about the idea but how are you taking that forward and so the big thing here it's like I want to help you in trends and you want to help them go from motion to getting into action and if it's a thousand dollars that it's gonna be that catalyst that's what makes sense so what's the difference motion action okay talking about it think you're not actually doing anything but action is what action is putting up that first page calling customers actually go trying to sell them something rapid prototyping it like putting it into acts like not blaming anyone else but legitimately putting it into action to try to turn this into a real business right so use this as your excuse obviously the thousand bucks not gonna make or break your situation but just treat it as the catalyst to take the thing you that's been in the back your mind and bring it to the forefront take some action on it I want to see all the ideas and as the trends community will all vote on them like it and we're gonna we're gonna also follow track and show the community the progression of the kind of things that are in it cool okay we got some topics that we wanted to talk about so what do you start so uh did you watch the Tyson Fury fight I did I'm a I'm not a huge boxing fan but I'm a fan of greatness and I like combat sports in job there we go I I was lucky enough I actually watched it with Sam and Sam is you know big boxing fan and I think I know a lot of Patriots fans will say the 28:3 is the greatest comeback story in sports I think Tyson Fury is the greatest comeback so I explained the Tyson Fury story so just so we can I'm gonna start at the end okay Tyson Fury knocked out Deontay Wilder in the seventh round Deontay Wilder is known as the baddest man on the planet right never never been defeated and he's he has a 96% knockout rate right 42 fights 41 knockouts exactly that only person he hasn't knocked out was his last Tyson Fury fight so Tyson Fury started off he's this English boxer also known as the gypsy king he was eight weeks premature weighing in at 1 pound right ok almost didn't make it just from the beginning right one pound one pound which is crazy because if you see him now he's 6 9 6 275 pounds yeah exactly exactly that in that slim form which we'll get into but his dad knew greatness his dad was one of those people that understood that this guy's gonna be a champion and so we named him Tyson after the great Mike Tyson obviously years go by years go by he starts training his dad was a boxer his uncle's a boxers everyone in his family is boxers and he gets to this point where he's like the next contender coming up he's 23 years old he gets invited into what Klitschkos actual fighting camp itself and kind of going back to you guys's point last week about hearing doubters everyone always told Tyson Fury you're gonna go to this camp but wladimir klitschko is the king right even you're there he's gonna batter you as a sparring partner and so he was trying to go things like this guy's not that great I'm gonna get into his head these guys they weren't even boxing against each other this time not opponents so during the training camp itself they go into the sauna okay have you heard this honest I'm not sore the story now yeah I'm excited this is maybe my favorite story in sports so everyone knows and everyone Telus Ison Fury Vladimir Klitschko is not just the King of the Ring why don't Klitschkos the king of the sauna okay look everyone here Henry post a photo of what Vladimir Klitschko looks like this time he's a monster yeah he's enormous he's a Russian monster he's a Russian monster Ukrainian Russian monster so this guy's huge so they go into an Tyson Fury's everyone's telling him you got to get out of town as fast no one who can last as long as them and he says I'm not even fighting this guy I'm gonna get into his head I want to beat him now because I know I'm gonna be champion later and people say I can't do something I'm gonna do it okay so they get in there it's hot it's really warming up five minutes go by ten minutes go by there's about a dozen people in there people are dropping on right someone's leave another person's leavin about 20 minutes come in and it's only Tyson Fury Atlantic let's go left so Vladimir Klitschko you know he stands up Tyson fair he's like thank goodness he's about to pass out well I don't mean Klitschko turns up the heat and so Tyson tree says I can't let this guy get in my head everyone thinks I can't beat him I'm gonna get up - he gets something what he does turns it up grabs the newspaper lady grabs the newspaper right another 25 minutes go by then legitimately as hot as a sauna can go and Klitschko finally leaves Tyson Perry wins things like I can't just leave right now he'll know about I was just trying to beat him wait a little bit longer basically passes out years go by three four years go by Tyson Fury's the number one contender Chris cause a champion Klitschkos the champion he hasn't lost in something like 11 years 11 years hasn't lost right everyone's like Tyson Fury you cannot beat Klitschko Tyson Fury goes you know what I know all of you think I can't do this I'm gonna do it on homecourt I don't come to the UK I don't want to fight you at Wembley I want to fight you in like Eastern Europe so they fight in Germany and then so in the pre fight they do a face to face similar to how we are now Tyson Fury brings up this honour issue Klitschko everyone look up the clip is so like pretends like it didn't happen like he couldn't remember it and Tyson Fury says after the fight he knew that's when he beat him and he goes in and he batters right he batters Klitschko wins right becomes the lineal champion 3 3 class champion whichever by the way I love this lineal champion the lineal champion for those who don't fall boxing is just your you beat the man who beat the man who beat the man who beat the man all the way back in time to the first man exactly and so you have taken the champion you took the champion out yes and nobody's taking you out yet enjoy any old champion he's the lineal champ so this is 2015 so the thing was is that after this fight Tyson Fury didn't go on and actually fight Klitschko again right he balloons up to 400 pounds he's at the mountaintop he's like is this it is this it and he's hearing from everyone he couldn't do it again he can't do it again it is finally somewhat getting to him he becomes addicted to drugs he gets addicted to booze he's 400 pounds and everyone says I knew it I knew Tyson Fury was a bum right right and so finally something in his mind clicks 2017 this video comes out him jogging his face is monstrous size of a bass he's ready he looks like someone who ate Tyson Fury exactly and he there's this video everyone's gotta see it and he said he says it's like Gionta Wilder I'm coming for you and everyone says he's never talked about he's failed so many times he'll never come back yeah and little obviously he fights some he comes back he drops a hundred and fifty pounds it was a draw the first fight time comes back they're like you know what Tyson Fury is he's not coming back he's gonna do the WWE thing he got his payday he's gonna go drink again comes back obviously this past Saturday knocks out actually knocks out the nachus knockout artist a hundred percent no one thought he could do it right and so I just thought it was this really interesting story for a lot of the points that even we were talking about last week or you guys were talking about last week when it came down to people saying no right people not wanting to see success happen everyone wants to see you blues and he took that as energy came back like four separate times that's right from the brink like four separate times and made it happen I just thought it was just some I can tell you're kind of like me in that maybe the thing I respect most is someone's mentality yes their mental toughness and and I don't I don't even think I'm particularly great at this but it's something that I've decided is sort of the number one most important asset is how how is your mindset 104,000 mindset where things are good are you grateful are you appreciative are you a giver to others yeah how is your mindset when things are bad yes are you resilient do you do you turn the disadvantages into advantages and mindset is number one that's why you love fury yes doesn't matter that he knocked a guy it matters how his mind worked he was at a point where most people break Angela Duckworth would call it grit right what this guy has right like when I read that book all I could think about was Tyson Fury but it all comes down to mindset all the great leaders have it Admiral William McRaven is another great example obviously one of the greatest Admirals and Navy SEALs history on special ops history same thing he's a great leader because of how his mindset is right this is why sports is grapes the metaphor it's the grand metaphor for life uh-huh who cares about these guys punching each other in the head or throwing a ball in a hoop but it is the great many real post a bunch of the things that we talked about I want everyone to go to the hustle and my first million everyone on Twitter and I want you to all look at these links and be inspired yes I love it and there's a great fight it was very dirty and he gave us a nice little ballad Oh Mike he sings a song when he lands which is hilarious and part of like his marketability is that he's just like crazy character he was dancing before the fight yeah well there was stress you can he was literally dancing by the way super lame excuse by Deontay Wilder that his costume was too heavy and that's why he lost no you lost coaster yeah very punch in the head yeah all right so what else we got so let's do a couple of the ideas so let's go down we're gonna skip this one let's do a couple of the ideas that that we were chatting about last time so if you were here for the sports you got what you wanted if you were here for the ideas this is the time okay so what are some of the ideas that are interesting to you well last week when I was sitting in you guys mentioned that religion overall is declining and I didn't think that was right and so I looked at the numbers and actually there's 66 million people coming and I'm just gonna speak towards Christianity sure 66 million new Christians every single year right people being born into it people are converting and so on with only 26 million people leaving the church which means 40 million euro net net net positive 3.3 billion by 2050 right which is pretty incredible and I don't know on Instagram if anyone that's listening to the podcast follows but there's a lot of actual Christian entrepreneurs yes and Christian influencers so you have people like Karl Lance rich Wilkerson jr. vous Church even and let me ask are you a religious guy or are you interested in this from a just a curiosity and business point of view both okay so I like I'm part of a men's group like a men's Christian group and it's interesting and like kind of diving into the idea itself a lot of my friends have kids that are growing up every single way that the church traditionally engages with this younger this younger demographic is outdated right read the Bible read the Bible you know listen to me talk but sit down and listen exactly there it there's no way right now there's no media company coming out there's there's really nothing out there for new age consumers Gen Z's Millennials to actually engage with the church right so we're thinking this is not like this is an area where there's 40 million people every single year joining that's a pretty fantastic growth right billions of built-in customers and by 2050 obviously they're getting born right now for the most part or they're people like us it's like how are they going to engage with the church itself there's there's only a handful of companies that are somewhat looking into this but if we look at even the way that culture is trending look at Kanye West last album yeah legitimately a gospel album look at some of the brands that are really taking off right now fear of God Jerry Lorenzo right a Christian backed fashion company right but there's only a handful of them the opportunity is massive to create either a media company or you know you could be selling books you could whatever it might be to engage with those younger consumers so I got a couple ideas so someone in someone from the community like you said somebody who'd taken action he messaged me he said give me three months mm-hmm so give me three months what three months sent me a link and he and and not you know I hope he's okay with me sharing this Alaska me afterwards we could bleep this whole thing otherwise but he said give me three months and I'm gonna show you that I can get this business off the ground I'm gonna get on your show Wow and he goes what is that what's the business he goes tithing Wow so he goes digital tithing so basically let's give it a 10 LG venmo for churches so he goes there's this company called push pay that is currently processing four billion dollars a year of digital donations inside a church so instead of passing the hat around they passed I don't know the QR code around or whatever it is it's like you can donate to the church through through it out and Ty Lee is another one so push pay 4.2 billion that's they're processed amount they took 98 million Wow so this is a very simple FinTech company to build distribution you can tell how you would distribute it to customers through the churches themselves we have a high incentive because you know if your church you need to ask for money and then you grow or you don't ask for money and then you shrink and potentially close and if we think what this former church's perspective as well it'll help them with all their accounting right every week every Sunday Saturday whenever going to church they're accepting cash right someone has to sit down and like sit down you know is this tithing money is this for something else so just the accounting of it imagine how much more that'll be they said fifteen percent I was looking into a little bit fifteen percent of all donations now and the churches is digital but I bet that that's so I bet that that's already you know you know fivefold increase from where it was a few years ago and I bet it's gonna go further I think it gets to thirty forty percent over time and and so this is just churches and you know just one faith so there's a you can copy an existing model take it to another faith you could just compete against these so let's say tithing is one let's say you know surface area where you might go for what's another well just going on that that one point right there what is really interesting is did you see bird come out with payments this week yes do you think bird is gonna get it they're gonna have bird payments yeah at the front of all exactly about I don't I don't think I think bird is in the sort of last-minute Hail Mary type thing yeah okay okay well interesting what is another one the biggest one to me just comes down to engagement right you all have a passionate community of young people that want to be engaged with the church what we've seen a lot of is merchandise right so how can you physically show that you were engaged with the Christian or Catholic or whatever your church actually is right so influencer marketing obviously being big preacher sneakers is a really interesting instagrams that happening it's big preacher snake preachers well picture sneakers shows what all the preachers globally are actually wearing right now so it's like how can you create a brand directly for them themselves and that's a perfect bridge of like the faith and I know Gen Z yeah you know cross over there so that really gets me excited yeah so I like the media business idea I think that's a pretty straightforward one although probably not the most lucrative we had talked a little bit about beautiful Bibles or beautiful Bibles to talk about this I like this idea a lot well I'm just you think to yourself it's you if you have if you were a Christian or whatever your religion might be but let's just say for Christianity sake you go to someone's house I guarantee you their Bible has hidden away because it got passed down to them they got it for oral it's it's hideous but if you think of what is on I shouldn't say hideous but it's not the best looking book it's okay but if I think what is on people's coffee tables right now it's kinfolk right it's things that are going that they're buying that are beautifully bound that they're visual and so I think there's this really great opportunity to reinvent what the Bible actually looks like and create like the kinfolk of Bibles yes so number one most selling book of all time yes the Bible that's a good place to start VIP again you can print your own Bible so it's not like you're gonna go a reprint Fifty Shades of Grey and get sued yeah you can go Bri print this and it could work you can remix it so you can simplify you can distill you can pull out certain anecdotes I love this idea so the only reason I'm not doing this idea is cuz I'm not really just uh-huh but even me I'm just like would you listen no it's like I love how you just said pull out specific books yeah so Netflix didn't really a pretty interesting movie on the book of Mark right and so like how can you take some of the stories that were within there and actually have them come to double-click into that yeah I like that a lot so so I think this generally speaking taking the sort of number one most best-selling book of all time or if you look at the Gita or the Koran or whatever these are all in the top sellers of all time and if you can you know put a remix on it so aesthetically pleasing is where I would go with it first the other side of it is you know distilling it down for kids making it more kid-friendly or like you said going into sort of some of the lesser told or pulling out some of the anecdotes and stories and really bringing them to life 14 million new customers a year right do it as a youtube channel do it as a book I think these are I think this is really interesting if someone's doing this reach out to me I want to help you make this successful I put a lot of thought into to how you would go about doing this and I genuinely think it's really really really fascinating idea and this influencer preacher thing what's up with that it's so it's funny I thought a lot about it and guys in my men's group and I think it's a really great way to bring kind of the youth back into like Christianity for instance but they have millions of followers you know they're with Bieber all the time parlance is the first one I saw that was doing this I launched the biggest you got to think he was leading Hillsong right and if you dressed a little differently you could pass it Karl and that might be that might be my next movie we'll see if they reach I saw him and I was like skies looking this act fellow stylish fan funny fantastic speech speaks in like comments you know common tongue not like you know he'll use slang yeah and I was like no wonder this guy's friends with all the basketball players and you know musicians that everybody knows about he reformed Bieber 100% know it's really interesting and he's speaking to them on their level that is really the biggest thing and so people understand that this is like being I want to be a strong Christian let's say and I want it to be aspirational yet attainable I can be him right instead of like the typical preacher you'll see it a lot of the churches it's like you could look up to someone like Carl Lentz mean like that is someone I want to aspire to be right and there's also sort of a musical component so he's with the Hillsong Church I think and they put out like tons of great you know faith-based music I think that faith-based music is it was a pretty big space so here's a question I had about us right because I've rain storm these I broke some of them down have done a bit of research and so then I asked for some I believe in these ideas man okay but I'm not doing I'm not doing these ideas yep a big part of it for me is just time I got a lot I do the podcast every job I have you know other stuff going on so for someone like you entrepreneurial Christian why don't you do this idea I'm one of these well I'm in the same place as you I'm also dry limited it's all time limited I will do anything to help these get off the ground any of the ideas we'll talk about right it's like you want to see people take these really nice and interesting ideas that are big and help them come to life and so if I had more time on my hands I would love to help it and where do you stand on where do you stand on ideas where you don't have that same founder fit so let's take another so let's say I did have the time okay right I magically get 48 hours of my day so I can play with my baby I can do my job I can invest in companies I could do the podcast home I can do the side all cells I could do it all so let's say I had double the time and now I could now I'm not time restricted you know the second question for you should I do this and is this the right business for me because there's one thing to understand that at an intellectual level there's other things to really like love the product care about it and get into all those details so I think a lot of people come into this question of like yes should I go for something I'm quote-unquote passionate about or know about or I am the customer or should I do something that's sort of I see the opportunity it might be a great market opportunity but I have to figure out you know it's like our buddy Ramon who you know created the most popular soap opera soap opera blog in the world and never watch the so proper in his life and sold it for 9 million cash so I've seen both examples yeah where do you stand on this my whole thing I think I think entrepreneurs have to be at different stages in their life so for we're wrong Ramon was that he's not saying soap opera blog this is the hundred year brand this is something that when people say what did Ramon do to leave this earth he changed the lives of people watching soap operas right he said how can I especially where he was at in his life how can I make money right and he says this is something that could generate money tomorrow yeah and so now when you're talking about things that are really passionate that that you really care about where you like when you were building bebo when time slips away when you have that feeling you care so much about what you're building that you look at the clock and it's 4:00 a.m. you're with your co-founders and you said wow we're really changing the world it's a whole different place there you're trying to build a brand not just a flip but to literally make an impact right like so I think you have to look at yourself where you're at in your life can you take risks like you're saying I know you you've been successful so you have kids you have a family but it's like can I take this risk do I have the right time and do I care about this because it's if I just want to make money right now become an affiliate marketer right something like take one of these ideas that you could just easily flip around start making money tomorrow or do I want to build something long-term that is probably much higher risk but it's something that I want to really put my name to right so the framework I offer up here is earn learn or legacy which one are you going for right now and at different phases of my life you summed it up oh my god I've optimized for different ones when I moved to San Francisco I told you I just wanted to be near people yeah I decided at that time I had done two startups already I said next one I don't want to do myself because you know I've made these two startups happen with mixed results you know some good some bad I think I've done better than I thought I would do but I don't know what I don't know so I was like this next chapter is all about learning so I hooked up with Michael birch I was like this guy's done it before he's a billionaire he's built multiple successful companies great head of hair great head of hair British accent yeah can't go wrong and I said I want to learn so I said I don't want to just how can I my feces how do I pack 20 years of experience into the next four years of my life I love that and so I said I got to work with someone who's done it before I gotta be around really smart people and I got to work on a portfolio of projects so I get multiple reps and not just one yeah and then I found Michael Byrd she was dead before and an ideal abbyr he's working on a portfolio I've started ideas boom perfect laughs so I went all-in I was like this is what I want other times right now I'm in the urn face sold my company I'm trying to collect the check of America cash in the asset that we sold and collect the check yeah of course I'm gonna still learn things but I've picked you know there are other ways I could be learning more I decided this chapter right now I'm gonna cash in some chips I'm gonna earn and if we look at your earn as well going back to the first question it's you have a portfolio of bets you have you've made your money from selling your company you get paid I'd assume on the 1st and 15th from twitch or however the payment works and you've also made higher risk longer-term bets itself that could have a high payout at the right right and so you have multiple different streams of income that could be coming in that are gonna help you achieve the long term goals of the type of earning potential that you want to be hitting right and so if you're listening and the other one it's legacy and I've thought about this okay what would I do next would i optimize again for learning sometimes I'll just do a little experiment that I know I'm not gonna stick with beyond three months yeah but I'm like how hard is it to start a podcast yeah do could I grow that that's how this started as an experiment to just learn I didn't think I'd earn any money off this I didn't think it's good for legacy necessarily I just did it to learn and sometimes you know think about what's a project I wouldn't want to exit from yep it's a powerful question to answer but it's a powerful question Wow I absolutely love that that's incredible and you know it kind of what you're saying with that urn learn legacy a lot of the work that I currently do is with corporate still so I work with both like growth States Jarvis but mostly with corporates and when I help them kind of look at what is the future of the business look like we actually go through a very similar lens it's like how are we gonna make the next billion rights like what does a horizon 2 project look like right then what is the future of our business actually look like and who are the types of people that we want to be surrounding ourselves with network startups investors whomever it might be they're gonna help us understand what that is but not just help us understand and get those insights but help us build that like that's a lot of the work that I do right now that's cool I like that let's talk about this other idea that you had mentioned last time so uber driver revenue streams total revenue streams and lyft you know I don't discriminate yeah no I love them both right whatever's cheaper but for me I try to think a lot about there are resting assets that are currently sitting idle right and so how can you what's a resting asset a resting asset is something like how uber a scale because they have drivers that are sitting out there for themselves or people just driving around that want to make extra income so for uber for instance how can we take that a step further you have people that are online with uber that are currently waiting for rides and they have when they get someone in their car they have a captive audience there's been a handful of startups that if somewhat helped alleviate this because the big thing that has come out a lot lately especially with some of the new regulations coming in is that uber and lyft drivers driving full-time are making far less than minimum wage right like far less when you account for all the expenses and the idle time I think we have the stat here what does it say the average pay per hour in America for full time is 855 to 1177 on uber on uber yeah or all right yeah right yeah in America the average full time for a driver full-year 36 525 a year right that's that's that's minimum wage right and so I think it's no one they're not gonna stop driving they're not gonna stop driving left but how can you take something like a uber or lyft driver who for between seven and thirty minutes has a captive audience right so how do you give them a three dollar an hour raise how do you help them make more money so people have tried this currently interactive media I think we there's a octopus interactive has done this everyone's seen it it's in all cabs in New York it's in a handful of uber screen on the back a little tech thing you play a game yeah it's not targeted so you and me are getting in there and I guarantee you if we set in there right now we're gonna get served personal injury call me if you've been hurt in an accident right has nothing to do with us okay but that's one way one way another one that I actually liked was cargo and it just helps them sell things right snack little snack bar exactly but to me what I've been thinking a lot about is how do you which is really big obviously the last handful of years which has really taken off is personalization so if you think about if you're able to truly partner with uber think about the type of information they have when you as a rider how old you are your frequent places that you're living even the micro targeting the geolocation of where you are we can make a lot of assumptions about you we could you know Xiaomi could probably assume you're you're well-off maybe we can know that you have family or you're currently doing a lot of pools or luxury and so we can start to build a profile around you and with that type of information through like the stereo for instance how could we serve you very targeted direct ads right so advertising is one the one that I am really interested in I have a little bit of background in is in the music space and so for me it's like okay a music label wants to get their new artist someone that they've invested in in front of the right consumer especially in that first week where they want songs to hit that kind of viral effect right and so if you were able to build a music platform to partner with labels and over to actually serve direct music towards a very targeted audience and you could make money by playing that song right I think it'd be a great business yeah that's pretty interesting cuz I don't know how many rides there are per day but there's millions of rides per day and so those are all sort of audio impressions yeah you could use and if I think if you played ads out loud that would be sort of obnoxious but if you're playing awesome new music you know that could be that could be really interesting where it's sort of non-invasive it's actually you know sort of behind the scenes yeah you don't even have to tell the rider hey this is you know you're listening to this because of X it's just there's what the driver has on ya and the driver gets paid to have their radio on exactly specifically to a certain station a lot looked into their app cuz a lot of the time either you're telling them what to change too or they're putting on something you don't like right and so now this is okay we think we understand you as an individual so we're gonna try to serve you music that you like right and I'm helping the driver make more money right yeah I like this idea a lot I think this is cool Firefly put the big kind of thing on the top of the the Ebers is that is it Firefly that raised last week or was it the other one so Firefly raised prior and it may have raised again I don't know they raised a huge round prior and like 20 30 million bucks and then I believe lyft announced that they were doing this themselves so one of the ride-sharing companies announced what they're doing this themselves which is gonna be now interesting to see what happens with that but I like the idea I also just generally like the underlying reason this was interesting to you which was something's changed so what's changed okay well now we have this fleet of drivers that are all connected using these apps that are on the road all the time that's new inventory and we could do something with new opportunity that we could do something with and the second thing was hey the wages have gone down from making $25 an hour to $10 an hour they're gonna be very receptive to ways that they can get their earnings back up because they're being advertised to that hey you're making 25 bucks an hour yeah but that's not your true rate when you take into account everything and if you find a way to make the drivers more money even I I bet you I'm just gonna make an assumption here that if uber doesn't get a cut but they're keeping more drivers on the road that they will leave you alone yeah they will love you if I find any way to make drivers work exclusively like I think cargo is an exclusive partnership with uber right and so if you can help just them like they're there driver retention yeah I I think could really take off yeah I like that idea what else you got you had some other good ones last time so we touched on sort of how religion should be engaging with Gen Z whether it's under the beautiful Bibles or tithing or one of the other ideas they're living what are we gonna call this super driver radio network you know we need a higher a brand or from our name I have one name it is coming up for our next idea that I've come up with okay yeah but besides that all right so you can give us that and give us that name well you should see a lot of the domains that I own there it's just awful awful awful domains I should never be in branding but so the next idea that that I have that we kind of talked about I'm actually talking about it with one of my friends right now so anyone that wants to join this next idea email Henry be at the hustle dot go and you'll help connect us ed are you getting blown up today I'm excited to see how many he gets charged your phone so I'm really big into cloud kitchens you give a great summary of what cloud kitchen says do you mind yeah yeah sure okay so cloud kitchens I actually know this because I started one way back before this is a thing oh right idea wrong time but basically it is a restaurant without the physical restaurant so you now that there's all these delivery apps Buber eats post mates caviar or - or - GrubHub you just your storefront is a icon in the app that's all you need you and so there's all these shared kitchens like just giant warehouses think about it that way that are centrally located in the city but not super sexy locations and there's these giant kitchens that I've already invested in all the HVAC fryers fridges freezers you don't have to buy any of that stuff you can go rent those by the hour when we did it we paid 19 bucks an hour Wow to have access to this kitchen and so like think about that you know eight eight times you know 20 20 bucks an hour times eight hours a day that was our restaurant cost so we went from needing half a million dollars to start our restaurant to doing it for like less than 5 that 5 grand and we you know so you have this infrastructure that's a shared kitchen where normally Baker's caterers food truck guys that's what they normally use but now you could just run a whole restaurant out of that you just optimize delivery only and you live on the back of these giant of food apps and you just do pop-up concepts so you could be macaroni only you could be you know the fried chicken specialist the grilled cheese specialist you could be like ten different types of Asian cuisine are like the best pad thai ever whatever you create these little micro brands anyways a cloud kitchen is a kitchen as a restaurant that doesn't exist and delivers off the back of these super popular food delivery apps and so what you just said and you said how many platforms there are the number one question because whenever you look at starting a new problem or you starting a new startup sorry you look at is there a challenge here or is there a big opportunity and so with this one I took I looked at myself and I said what is the biggest challenge that these cloud kitchens face you see how much money Travis clinics obviously started I bet you he walked down the street and someone else has probably started one yeah and I guarantee you the biggest problem everyone has is how do you stand out how do you stand out as a cloud kitchen because you don't have a storefront so are you gonna put a lot of money into brand right is are you gonna stand out just on your logo or that your key dough and you do nice foods so something that I've been thinking a lot about which I'm calling are you ready for it clout kitchens is influencer based cloud kitchens okay and so if you look at the expansion of influencer marketing and not just influencers as a pay to play scheme that startups are or large corporates are working with to hawk their products but instead actually having these influencers build real businesses look at Kylie yep Kylie didn't sit there and build out the formulations herself she put a ton of work into it and like a hundred percent that is incredible what she did but she worked with a brand incubator who on the back end knew the formulations they knew how to market it they knew everything behind it and leveraged her distribution her name to make it scale the way they did same thing with Rihanna did it so what's happening in the beauty space what you're saying is could happen in the food space so who's a how would this work give me an example I'm just so in my mind it's someone you can do influence there's a handful of different ways if you go onto Instagram right now how many different food influencers are there thousands thousands Jo WIC Ella delicious you know all these different ones that like my partner for instance she we own every cookbook I feel yeah we own legitimate ly every could my wife's vegan so any vegan influencer like I know I know the name Aaron Ireland she's she sends me every recipe that this almond post which is a you know baking recipe a hundred percent I go on Instagram right now I guarantee you I have four messages from her from different food things that we should try right and it will say I eat out too much so instead of going in figuring out okay how do I build this recipe oh gosh I got a bike I got to make couscous I don't even know what it is instead it's like how can you leverage the name of this influencer help them with some of the recipes that they have on their Instagram itself create the menu create the menu and create all these cloud kitchens like across the country or wherever it might be so that everyone can have access to it I like it I like it a lot so this is sort of like the Gordon Ramsay he has several restaurants right like he's got his Bobby Flay has the burger bar Gordon Ramsay has his thing in Vegas and other places I feel like every somewhat decent Airport has a go Wolfgang Puck right and so or you guys talked about it with Lance Jimmy Buffett we're going to Margaritaville you're somewhere warm and so what is the Margaritaville what is the Gordon Ramsay what is that next generation working with these New Age influencers to actually create full menus online just in a cloud kitchen with none of the upfront costs and as you know how high the churn rate is on restaurants itself yeah your start-up costs are incredibly low all you need to do is find the right influencer the right demographic build out the menu with them write of things they're already building they have you're just giving access to everywhere then you grab off the shelf chefs essentially who can actually just implement and 100 cook the food on a daily basis right yeah trivial to find people who could do that I really like this idea because I just think it's a really fun idea and there's a lot of times where you have passion actually the music wants very similar there's all these passion areas that are just garbage businesses yes and this is you know food is another one where it's like great you love food okay what are you gonna do you're gonna be a foodie what does that mean you're gonna be a food blogger that's a little bit tough this is actually like a sort of cool novel way and again it's because something has changed yes these food delivery apps have have paid billions of dollars in customer acquisition costs yes to acquire hundreds of millions of users across the world you don't have to get you like you don't have to pay for the yeah you're not paying for the customers they're coming to you yes exactly so I like this a lot and I think you sort of can bridge these two these two worlds really really well so I like to say that my friend has this phrase which is that chefs are the new DJs yes that people just the same way people follow DJs now and will go to the clubs where they're at there's this is actually happening in sort of the food world look at what's what's that chef or what's that show on Netflix open to not open table chef's table chef's table like that Oh like that just took off right and so on yeah I I'm 100% with you the one thing I want to add is I want someone to do this yeah I don't just want us to talk about this anyone that is interested I want them to email Henry I'm not even joking we're starting this I have someone on the other end that is gonna help with this I'll help it get off the ground right motion to action I love it and again literally we did this when we did our restaurant we so we started a sushi restaurant yeah I don't know [ __ ] about sushi yeah I like that at Duke right I did that right out of Duke and we found a chef from the Food Network so we saw this guy who did the Bobby Flay challenge he beat Bobby Flay at a sushi challenge and he was super charismatic and he was obviously knew his [ __ ] about sushi and so we were like oh that guy we need that guy huh and so we literally partnered with this guy it was really hard to get him to take us seriously because we're 18 years old and there's a whole story about how we did that but we're part of the Food Network Chef and we created this this restaurant concept and then we ended up because we just didn't have money we did it as a cloud kitchen yeah because we were like look I don't want to sign a 10-year lease with a personal guarantee and that's what I needed to do to get a restaurant space so you know just getting resourceful we created this thing and at the time there was no post mates ubereats those didn't exist that was the missing piece we still had to go get customers to come to our website to download to order the food is this if that had changed this whole you know I wouldn't even be sitting here I'd be so running a sushi bar is this gonna be your legacy I feel like we just hit on something I feel like this is next now I ran away from the food industry because it's tough but that's just I was doing too much too many dishes every night that's incredible I love that anyone that wants to do it honestly Henry be at the hustle ko I love it all right so we got a little bit time let's see how we're doing on time okay we don't have too much time all right we have let's say one last thing is there one last thing you want bring up this is Stu's power our without the power our I have so many ideas hopefully you have me back I fully understand I feel like I yell into this mic as much as Sam so I'm gonna apologize everyone listening well we want to bring you back we want to have basically these recurring sort of friends of the house so there's certain people that are fun and have a bunch of ideas and it's not like when I was doing the interviews before you know you tell your story once I'm not gonna have you back to tell your story again like that's just too much nobody wants that but with this you know every month or every two months I want to be brain you know our guest friends of the house back as a recurring cast a character so that's the pregame plan count me in you can catch me at my desk about 15 feet from there but something that I've been thinking about a lot you're a big notion user right I use it I wouldn't call this a big notion user because I have a love/hate with it okay uh-uh app load so slow for me it does load low that's like a deal-breaker for me but everything else to don't but you guys made the website we made our whole website off of it honestly it's one of the most powerful tools I've ever used the hard thing is I tell everyone and everyone knows I'm an evangelist of things that I love I must have signed up 200 people on copper for instance I'm calling people everyone's like what CRM do I use I'm done with and like now you get on copper right now I've been taking any affiliate money for this by the way right and so notion is the latest thing I'm addicted my life journals in there everything my whole life is it what do you love about notion that you didn't get it what were using before Docs Evernote you name it I was using the whole G suite I was using obviously copper but I've actually poured it over a CRM into it cuz there's a lot of really great integrations I'm using a physical journal itself like you name a sauna and what what is it about notion that got you what got it was the ability to create it's legitimately a blank canvas where let's you be the artist towards your own personal workspace deep there if people that are watching this I'm crying yeah watching us so but legitimately the hard thing though what makes it so beautiful and what makes it so difficult is that you legitimately just end up on a blank page create fright and so I think the biggest opportunity notion has to of them so many times and I will continue to is that they have the opportunity to legitimately create the App Store for business templates and so if you go on notion dot SL for it slash templates they have a couple they've about twelve but if you want to become a power user you got to go on YouTube you got to find all the right channel right and so I think there's a really big opportunity for someone or for notion itself to become an actual template or sorry a an actual platform in an app store to create templates for notion right ready to go CRM ready to go ready to go whatever all the different common use cases at 100% I think it's something massive opportunity like they've raised what 10 million at an 800 million valuation and they have such an engaged community but nothing is tying them together right like people are hacking together templates I use it but it looks low ok you know so much information yeah that's probably what it is it's like so feature-rich said Melissa alright I like that notion you should pay us for that I mean they accept that so they that wasn't an ad read but that was better than an ad read yeah they did they actually sponsored the hustle morning newsletter today right yeah me and you didn't give me that much let's get out here all right do great Avenue where should people find you follow you twitter twitter at Stu Iverson follow me on there I put it in the show nos yeah I'm active DM me I'll message you back I promise you yeah that's we can find me nice okay love it we're out

what else you got okay so you have h q so H two died H is obviously yeah I thought like it could have been cool I'm like they could be like jeopardy jeopardy is huge so if you don't know what HQ was it was a mobile app it was a game show like Wheel Fortune jeopardy whatever but that was all done on a mobile app which was when I saw this product some our friend Eric who does tribe socks he showed me this happen he was like dude my friend went to go work at this company it's really interesting check this out he pulls it up so at 6 p.m. every day they would do the game show so you get a notification at 6 you open the app there's a host a live got you know live live game show host on live streaming and he would ask trivia questions that you would push the button and you have 10 seconds to answer you push the button real quick to answer if you got all 10 or 12 questions right you'd win the prize at the end which at that time it was there was 400 players and the prize was like $500 this thing grew like crazy they had games with over a million concurrent players and exactly over a million players and over I believe they had over a million dollars in prize money over time and so this thing had this run and they got tons of funding founders fund funded them ten million dollars in funding at a hundred million dollar valuation and then they had big-time brands launch stuff on there so they were like you know this game is sponsored by Nike it's all trivia about athletes and we're gonna drop this shoe the new shoe released it's happening live on HQ and that's the prize they were doing some interesting stuff but it was kind of a fad and which everyone knew which everyone knew because it was like games all have this hype cycle and then this decline over time they're not games aren't super super sticky most of them and this was definitely that so those big novelty grew like crazy viral product in many ways as somebody bakes products was very inspiring because it was like so simple yet so awesome right I actually fully product there I'm not trying to be hyperbolic but I felt like there was some revolutionary things for sure it was like oh I'm looking at the future this is this is what the future looks like I still think that's what the future looks like HQ dot for many reasons socotra calendars are so literally one founder died he overdosed on drugs the other founders they were sort of always infighting they were both sort of like kind of come across at least from the outside as a sort of like moody artists yeah one of them I believe started fine also Russ yeah yeah both of them they are both the founders of vine so definitely sort of brilliant guys in in a way but everyone says that Russ is a dick yeah in the and he had he got removed a CEO because he had some problems you know he was a dick or whatever the other guy got removed also never figured it out and the the game show host Scott became this kind of like cult sensation cuz he was the host everyone saw him every day and he tweeted out when it shut down recently he was just like this company died for one reason alone and that's the sort of incompetence and arrogance of the founders and I was like yeah damn that is like you don't usually hear that like everybody so PC and always just worried about the career know he's a comedian he ain't give a [ __ ] yeah he definitely did not give a [ __ ] cuz that was that's pretty brutal on the day that he shut down let's say can I tell you what I would do yes okay so I would I have no idea if they did this job I would have built this knowing that it's going to die and so it's like it's my thing is I'm gonna be a hit machine right and I'm gonna use this formula and I always thought about this with remember like cronut yeah okay you know how like these viral food things like these food things go viral I like one day sat down I'm like what makes them go viral so it's and I've like broke it down to a handful of categories which is like it's either of it's gotta be a food that's typically aside but you're gonna eat it in excess so for example only cookie dough and set it so ice cream that's just cookie done right or make the shot you make the topping the main yep so like one formula you could use yep another like or like fondue so likes fondue is typically an appetizer fondue only right another thing is you take the shape of it and you make it a ridiculous shape yes easy including small to big like there's Bob's Donuts is your sizing so you make something small big big small right the the fifth or fourth thing is color rainbow Raggles so you just take the color green ketchup Instagram a bowl yes yes and then I had a fifth one which was some mashups which is cronut right Kris oh yeah and then that was the fifth one you took their Doritos locos taco one of them the most successful fast-food thing in like the last 10 years was this Dorito locos taco and then every fast-food chain hired these eight I used to be like find me the next Dorito and so those are the five like categories that I discovered and then it's like okay so you just make it go viral by you you have to have distribution via Thrillist BuzzFeed and then eventually it's like well you just have your own handle and then yours might be okay and they're gonna have a small shop outside outside in Brooklyn or in Manhattan and you're just gonna you're always putting out bangers yeah you're just gonna [ __ ] knocking out the parking you're gonna have a line all the time and then three months later ooh that one shut down switch now we're doing cookie dough ice cream every season you come out with a new one viral sensation yeah it's like alright now we're to love this we're doing rainbow cake now or green ketchup and hot dogs like you just like is like okay it's so if I was I've always thought about like that's the way to go you just have a small you just are paying and you're banging these out and then for the ones that last hour hits like Crona it might be a hit I mean that's kind of like its own category now then you've that's like you're one of your tempo franchises right it's always available yeah that's what I would do and it's so with HQ trivia I would've on the same thing this is like supreme for food it's like you have this limited scarce kind of like out there thing what you're doing is you're making these these sort of wild concoctions on the food side using these five different yeah but it's all formulaic yes it's just like all in one of these five formulas Zynga and then you do a limited edition drop you basically say you know you tweet out at 1:00 a.m. it's live you get a huge line people cover the fact that there's a line and then it becomes a thing in a hipster town yeah this is so easy like Bagel Bites like pizza and bagels so this is went back when you were doing your hotdog stand if you knew everything you know now but you still needed to do hot dogs in you would end up doing something more like this like green ketchup like that are my stick to catch up with only be green right and what I did back then was I had what I did was like you just have a little shtick like mine was my onions I would boil them in coca-cola which a lot people do I would just tell everyone I did that right and so there's this is actually a famous copywriting trick which is have you ever heard of um a time like a watch like a like a wristwatch being described as like with quartz movement yes they all have [ __ ] quartz movement right they all do all of Abdul or like space-age aluminum they all that's not even a thing first of all like what's that madman it's like our filters are rolled or something like yeah and they're like well everyone's is and they're like well they don't know it right so space-age aluminum that that means nothing first of all all right first of all nonsense yeah it's a quartz movement every single watch has that right and so the idea here is you just take something that they don't know even though all the insiders know you just tell them right we did this experiment when we were doing the sushi restaurant where we took the descriptions of our food so it'd be like you know you take a Philadelphia role which is like this Americanized it's salmon it's cream cheese and it's cucumber in a sushi roll and then we would just so Dan Ariely was one of our advisors and he's the guy wrote predictable and so he would he told us like hey one of the reasons wine charges this premium is because they created a whole language around what they do you need to create a language around sushi so that people who start to learn about it feel like they know more and now they want to pay more so they can have the better thing just teach of what is the better thing and so we would you know we started just adding words as one experiment we would have one version of our website where it was all online ordering so is one version of our website would be the normal website then our a B test was the other variation was our Philadelphia role would be called like we called the Philadelphia role and then the description would be like Atlantic fresh you know never frozen salmon with you know Philadelphia Philadelphia Cream Cheese and a finely sliced cucumber and we would raise the price and we would get like more orders even despite the higher price that's crazy and so this is like a psychological thing around yeah that [ __ ] works yeah around the descriptions around things okay back to HQ for a second so they did try to release other games they came out with like a word scramble type game I think they kind of ran out of time and also they had built the hype too much and less until we learn when you build this much hype if you start to fail you death spiral way faster cuz the height the pressure of your expectations and hype will crush you well so that's what I mean is I would have built this company in networking that like we discussed that clog it and they're like well they're building it so it they're gonna just capture all the value upfront and then let it die right so if you were to built that right Oh like built that into it it would have been it could have been a company kind of like I imagine saying it does this which is they just have like they're like alright this game is only in the last 80 days maybe right so two quick ideas on this HQ thing so HQ died okay you know rest in peace but two things I could do if you wanted to make make use of this of the insights that were found in this I think you can do this on top of twitch or YouTube or any live streaming platform that already has audience so you don't need to be your own app you should just host create a channel that's hosting a show and give away the prize money and promote it in the same way and so I think somebody could build this on top of one of the existing platforms not enough to build your own tech and not have to acquire downloads of your app which is really expensive and I think if you just did this every day at 7:00 p.m. on Twitch I think a bunch of people would turn in second idea around this is maybe a the HQ format which is this live video streaming with this charismatic host and question and answer could be used in education and so I would love to see somebody create an after school game that parents actually pay $3 a week to subscribe to where your kid learned science through some Bill Nye the Science Guy type of host and it's trivia it's interactive and they get sort of points as they say I've thought about starting that company but I really think that that could work I think it might also have the sort of fade and interest but I remember as a kid I loved brain quest and I played all these like learning games and they were great and so I think this is a modern-day burr that's interesting that is quite sticky I think that as we get older I mean your kids not old enough so you'll imagine you'll learn this once she gets old enough but these things that we use as we're your kids were just huge yes huge I'm into that and you wouldn't need tens of millions of people because you're not advertising you'd be on subscription because parents would be like oh I don't often go drop my kid off at tutoring and I don't have to like learn this myself my kid already wants to sit in front of the iPad all day so okay here's an iPad game that I feel good about because you're learning it's kind of cool because it's live and interactive and I could play with you and I'll pay three bucks a week for that do you want to hear what I've been in that same category that I'll come back with some more research but I was just surfing around and saw is that but for allowance okay tell me more so a friend Ramones kid had I was like I was like hey Victor allowance does your dad give you allowance like he better be giving you some money right and he goes yeah but it's all in this app like what do you mean he's like well it is automated and I get $10 a week if I do everything and I have a list of everything I got to do and then it just sends me this $10 but it sends it into an account and I could use those on the the places that he's already approved that I could spend it on or if he wants I can get this debit card that it only works at a handful of places that's a great idea yeah I was like of course that's obvious that's a horse idea I get mad at myself for not thinking of it so I'm gonna go I haven't thought I haven't seen their financials or anything I've done I'm going to yeah [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
I for sure but I would bet you for sure they're in north of a hundred million in subscription revenue what do we got I want to talk about talk about this idea I'm gonna idea it's a company arsenic yeah they've been around for about four years now yeah I know I don't know how they're doing do you know if they're doing what they were doing okay basically the way that I knew some like media people who talked about them and knew them and I'm almost positive that it's run like it looks like it's run which is a bunch of kids who are good looking and rent the mansion and they just dude right so that debauchery so the idea is arsenic is essentially playboy for the snapchat generation and so they have a snapchat channel because you know the idea is like okay Playboy's big deal what would playboy be like today it would not be a magazine it would be you know a snapchat channel and so they created the snapchat channel which is perfect cuz it's like if you follow it you get it if not it's not on your face so it's not like like Facebook would be a little weird Instagram would be a little weird and they have email too and they just have this mansion and they have all these models and it's not porn but it's definitely models we're good looking and they just have one model like sort of take over the channel least as what it was three years ago I just think there's a great idea they raised three million bucks I don't know how they're doing so they've got books they do like tours I think that it could be doing a the ideas it's a cash cow I think hmm well I because they were getting millions of views back van on their videos I can only assume it's grown unless snapchat blocked him but they're not outside the bounds of what's not allowed that channel I was porn right no they don't lap horn but they nudity they don't if you're putting on your stories you'll get banned eventually if you're doing nude if you have a baby they don't do nudity what's that up for a private account you can eventually if it gets flagged they'll take it down like it's not in the rules to do nudity well that's far sign have you heard of only fans yeah love it so explain only fans only fan so basically what happened is on snapchat all these porn stars were putting up like porn yeah like softcore porn I don't think it was like sex but like pay me ten dollars and I'll let you follow me right and you'll fall on my account where I post nudes and only fans launched and what they it was it was a platform where they I don't think they started with porn but now it is that yeah yeah so just embrace it but basically if you I don't even think it's porn I think it's like web girls and webcam girls and you pay $20 however much they want you to and you get access to their private video feeds yeah it's like patreon but porn basically yes you pay you become a contributor and then you get their private photos and videos it's taken off has it yeah and the reason yeah because I was do it like who cares if I consume it or not from a business point of view that's how I know about we all care and I mean no surprise like yeah but so here's you know why I think these things take office the people who don't take care of the creators they they they for these types of things they they go away yes and so there's always demand so the demand is always there the question is does the platform allow the supply to do what they want to do and the big platforms don't do it it's not worth their brand and risk and all the stuff because the only fans I for sure but I would bet you for sure they're in North of a hundred million in subscription revenue and then they take their cut that's insane at one point in time well we had a we had blab like live streaming product and it wasn't working we had to pivot and we pivoted adventure to video gaming but I definitely laid out a case to the company that investor I was like look porn is the porn is where the source would be the best like these they're not [ __ ] on camera I don't think ok well whatever you want to call it like softcore porn or whatever but like going after the sort of the cam girl market is a pretty it's a big market and the websites that are there really really suck and so so what sounds like man said well we have kind of a heart-to-heart we're like is this what we want to build and my co-founder felt a certain way the investors felt a certain way what did FERC on want to do um he was like not down to that I'm so down with that yeah so I think it's you got to make a personal choice then I've had a bunch of entrepreneurs reach out being like hey we saw you did blab we've read your post mortem you guys got to four million users but it didn't work I have a very similar concept I think it's gonna work can you give me some advice I tell them from the bat jump I'm like this version is not gonna work consider porn I think it could work consider the cam girl angle because you know that's the one stone we didn't turn when we were considering you know where to pivot this thing to make it I would prefer do that because thick all these like patreon all the [ __ ] they're like we're gonna empower creators okay I'm behind that but even though a lot of times I think they don't but if you're gonna empower creator imagine this like woman who can just crush it by not breaking the law and just using her own body I'm philosophically I'm so in favor of that right yeah I think as a business person I'm definitely in favor of it I think it's just a personal possession I love it it's just like a human being I'm like yeah [Music] you [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
so on trends we released this on Tuesday two things we're interesting that our guys found more Steph and our guys so men and women found which we only have two people so uh so your guy and gal found that two things I'm like thinking about all of it first everyone talks about meditation being like the most popular like being a huge trend right now people searching for sleep is actually significantly more likes like sleep products and not and this it makes total sense because calm well I'm a subscriber to calm the stories they're pushing sleep like crazy yeah sleep stories I think was the breakout product for the breakout feature for that's crazy and so I didn't realize this until they like point it out and I'm like oh yeah that does make sense sleep is way bigger than meditation and meditation is huge sleep is also a lot of people search for it because so for meditation you're trying to teach a new habit sleep everybody does also for sleep a lot of you'll have problem sleeping so they will actively search for and pay for solutions that will help them sleep I pay for a bunch of them I pay for what's your sleep an Alexa app called the nature sounds and they have like 26 sounds and I pay extra money to combine them it's all my the one I sleep two is winter railroad and so what is that sound like it's it's a train going through the mountains of winter what's the winter part what is the sound of winter you hear like wid I love it you shared something very personal there I loved it I like sup played nature sounds or sometimes I do ship in winter because it sounds like an ice breaker and then I like to turn off in 20 minutes no this is also like one of these you know hackathon projects or some developers like okay watch this just say two words and I go search the internet for sounds and I smash them together and it makes an audio thing yeah like for cons next hackathon they should build this like I don't even know what it could be like chickens in China Street [Laughter] whatever says Sarah she doesn't like that she liked to sit down with it she's down with it so did you take any sleep aids like part like like a vitamin or supplement or CBD or something melatonin melatonin yeah that work helper yeah it does if I really can't sleep I'll take one of those units my computer died I think that one of my unit you know gel is that what it's called units off it's a it's basically like a mild dosage of nyquil without the medicine part oh that's good so okay so it's the way some people take nyquil just to sleep and so this is the just asleep part it's just I don't have a cough yeah just a light version you don't take that stuff I heard this phrase today I could sleep in a ditch so I just when I would decide to go to sleep I instantly fall asleep and I do not wake up at night ever and so I'm blessed you know I am typically like that as well but not as bad there's this guy that we should profile he he he's a Japanese billionaire or sorry Chinese billionaire and he started a so he's a he's a big shot now and he owns like half a bank and all his other [ __ ] and he got rich by creating a melatonin he just took melatonin and reprinted it and made it sexy and called it a sleep aid and whatever it got huge and then he launched the zynga of China and he ended up buying like the building that they lived in just like Zynga and or they worked it and it became this huge thing we'll have to do off to bring him up cuz I love him because he's reckless and he's built a fortune and lost it all like three times right yeah you love that I love those guys okay and then we also talked about a Do It Yourself perfume so apparently that's a huge community is Do It Yourself perfume and there's not a ton of companies in the space so what's that what's happening what are these people trying to do they okay you don't want to buy perfume they want to mix their own at home yeah so basically perfume is a huge business Paris Hilton a lot of people forget about her she has sold roughly five billion dollars of her perfume cycling back to the porn conversation earlier okay Paris Hilton yes yes and let's say her stuff cost $100 which it doesn't and it's typically ninety percent margin yeah incredible so huge fat margins and everyone now knows us and so the idea here is that people are trying to make their own perfume at home and it's got there's a lot of sub sub reddits around it a lot of communities who discuss different perfume like how to create your own perfume but there aren't too many companies that are making it easy to make your own perfume and formulas and things like that do that makes a lot of sense this is like one of those industries where when you hear about the winner later you're like oh okay was set up for success too for example a Warby Parker you know one of the reasons warburg Parker worked so well was that the existing eyewear eyeglass you know industry was all owned by this one conglomerate that had price pricing power and was marking [ __ ] up like crazy so they didn't have to like invent something to lower the price they just had to not be greedy and be like okay we can offer this at a fair price and still have margin and so and so you own Cologne I own Cologne and so what you're saying is basically cologne vastly marked up in the same way razors are super marked up and Dollar Shave Club came in but instead of somebody just making a Dollar Shave Club version of Cologne they're giving you a DIY kit and there's like probably reddit communities of home brewers for perfume yeah it's actually pretty great and there's an infinite number of recipes and scents so you're gonna and what we're gonna try a bunch is if you took it a step further an interesting sense could be sold already yeah so you could create a marketplace where you could sell your yeah you to just even to your own friends family you could create a kit for people to do this and make a better kit sure there's one that exists another idea you know we were talking about kids stuff earlier like my niece would love to mix her own perfume she would that would be like a great afternoon and my my sister would buy her you know this little kid-friendly perfume making kit and it's like one of the arts and crafts things that she gets to do and she makes it an Emeril who comes over she gets to show him show her show them there yeah I think you could do this for kids and me a big deal here's another angle that we found in trends is soap do-it-yourself soap big thing people want to make their own soap and what was the third one juice but we already know that's right juicing yeah yeah my pretty great I like that would have never known about that that's pretty fascinating to me in fact I'm gonna tell my sister to start this business with the DIY perfume for kids [Music]

I had never heard of this company that you showed me Heritage Auctions yeah I think that auctions particularly marketplaces I would love someone to criticize this because I want to hear the downsides I think that they are potentially one of the top like two or three business models auctions or more Oxford's and marketplaces marketplaces for sure yeah but auction style marketplaces I think they were they're one of the bests yeah you've seen a bunch of them yeah I think you babying this sort of classic yeah and I think eBay sucks by the way there's some one's totally gonna crush them I mean they're gonna be dead not dead but somebody told me this is half half information somebody told me eBay has had like a revival and they don't do the auction stuff as much anymore they're all like it's basically Amazon is yeah I can hate it but I hate it but if somebody said that their numbers have turned around I don't know if that's true well they're a behemoth they're not going anywhere anytime soon I mean they're like Google like you're like oh well they're sucking like okay I mean they're gonna last for another 50 years at least yeah so anyway I love auctions I like I'll and I love niche auctions and heritage which you pointed out they do that you got the you got that pulled up Henry and you could pull it up on your phone so they did 800 million dollars in sales so it's not on the screen so let's look at the top categories you have it on your phone yeah so coins I think was their top right yeah so they do I think 300 million dollars in currency right okay but look at some of the more interesting ones movie posters ten million ten million dollars in sales what was comics comics is on there yeah I just pull it up what's it say for comics Henry comics 50 sports 60 million more collectibles basically mm-hmm luxury real estate 19 million wine 10 million crazy right tons crazy and here's what I like about it this is a big idea we talk a lot in fact I have a pet peeve we talk a lot about these like small little business arbitrage is hacks little businesses this would be a big big company if you could get this right and so what so I love I love marketplaces and I love auctions I love auctions because there's a time component to it yeah and that urgency makes you buy more and what I think is even better and so for heritage auctions I think roughly half of their sales of a $10,000,000 sales are online and the other half are in person you want to know another in-person auction that's doing wonderfully Jackson have you heard of barrett-jackson what is the barrett-jackson is based in Arizona bootstrap done by one guy is that his name Barrett maybe Burt Barrett is dead Jackson is alive okay or it could be the other way around one of them is dead but what they do is they actually have a they put this on TV all the time I watch it all the time what they do is sell cars to classic cars right not all classic cars but just like rare or like interesting cars you can buy like a $10,000 car there but so they'll have a car on and they'll say like this Ferrari there was only 500 of them this it sells for $200,000 and they show it and you're like how awesome that sale just happened in three minutes that was great and so they do I believe 68 shows a year and they make hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue yeah it's a huge business and I love that and so another one is bring a trailer they do cars as well and the guy who started bring a trailer also started mailbox Gentry Underwood so he's like a but she's sold to Dropbox and so I like these auction places and first of all I like niche auctions so I like watches anything that's niche but but what do you what is another and I have one an idea idea what's a current marketplace that's very illiquid and hard to sell and you wish I could go away faster mm-hm houses is one luxury house they put on here because takes a while to sell a house in general and so open doors trying to make that instant as a market as a real estate company but not as much as an auction mmm I have a friend who did this with sneakers he had low doing that now I think it's working well did it as a 90 minute auction so he would say the sneaker goes live it's 90 minutes and we're gonna get you your guaranteed price or we they basically offer the seller they're like we will buy it at this price if the auction doesn't go higher so if you agree to that you start the process and it's 90 minutes what else I don't know what else yeah small businesses okay just flip my business and this is a maybe would just fall flat this is one of those it could be amazing or it would just be horribly idea but if I were quiet like brokerage who sponsors this or if I were another brokerage I would 100% have an event and try to gather a thousand people and we're gonna auction off these businesses my idea from yesterday the first dibs where you're auctioning future the future first a future first whatever you're gonna create I think that would work really well with this as well but business is the hard part is you have there's so many hard parts about it there's a lot of hard but one is just the diligence right so like when I buy the the movie poster or whatever if it has sort of the certification and the the person selling it sort of says this is authentic I don't need to look too much more into it whereas with a business you really have to sort of understand all these different components I think that's hard I agree it's hard but I think it's interesting right because like if someone just like if I knew Shopify apps or something and there's this gathering and they're just auctioning off a [ __ ] ton of them and it's kind of like a storage war or it's like which you know what you get but let's just find out like it could be fun to gamble tens of thousands of dollars yeah just storage units that would be interesting like a mystery box basically that you're buying oh [ __ ] yeah that would be really that would be really fun and and interesting is it have to be cheap enough that's interesting John it's someone doing store storage unit like blind auctions yeah yeah surely they have to be right I don't know but you can tell you some of these ideas together right so like what HQ showed where they did basically they took a traditional TV show and turn it into a live streaming mobile app where the game shows on on your phone this is the future of TV like you can do a QVC or I don't know what show you talked about you watch the auctions on but like you can that repair jacket but there's another one called but turn these into mobile live streamed shows and you can essentially sell these all through through you know you could take so one way to look at this Roadshow that's what I was thinking about right so one way to look at this is you you start selling some item that's not currently sold on the auction place might be hard because a lot of time has passed and sort of like you know the law of supply demand has pulled things that want to be sold this way into the market but maybe you could find a new niche or you just take the existing platforms and you make them smaller more lightweight and mobile focused you just win that way and so like I don't know top hat er yeah what an incredible company it's wish so it's a mobile app where you see a bunch of really cheap stuff from China random stuff it can be like a back brace and a ring and a you know whatever a poster - ooh dollar store crap dollars for well it's like the it's like the wish crap which is like random electronics and memorabilia items yeah laser pointers and class rings and like you know whatever but what they do is if it which is interesting is it's a fish the items start so you open up the app and you see all these things in it like you've never seen your adrenalin spike like this in a mobile app before all the prices are starting it like what are 50 dollars and they just start dropping and then somebody just hits buy and then they buy it and so you kind of want to wait to get it lower but you don't want to wait too long if somebody else is gonna buy it so top Hatters a start-up here in San Francisco and they do hundreds of millions of dollars for having a very good is a very interesting business I don't know how profitable it is how sticky it is blah blah blah but when you go into the app it's like a it's like being in like this high-stakes Chinese market does dollar auction like those penny auctions things it's a little bit all like a little bit like that but they but you don't have to buy credits and stuff like that it's more like wish but instead of that what they tap into is instead of browsing and picking they pick they like inject into your FOMO you know part of your brain and so you're like okay this item do I want it do I want it for 6 bucks 5 bucks 4 bucks 3 I'll take it and you end up buying a whole bunch of [ __ ] and it's just a bunch of moms who are bored at home that are just shopping on this thing and they feel like hey we're getting tons of value but like this is stuff you didn't even know you wanted you don't even want this is [ __ ] it's just [ __ ] and as I'm gonna download it and buy some stuff I'm like [ __ ] all the time how powders cool [Music]

#thehustle #drone #podcast

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
last episode we had your buddy here and we he told me about this thing where he had invested in the company that's doing drone window-washing yes I thought that was crazy fascinating and I went and researched in a bunch there's another competitor that's raised money and drones I don't think are the right words to describe it because when I think of drones I think of like a quadcopter these are things that like they look like the normal so when you're pulling up the scaffolding or when you're pulling up like the what do you call it it's like an elevator yeah an elevator up and the guys are standing on it wiping it looks like that but there's a robot on there that is doing it instead of people right so it's not flying you're saying it's not flying why do they call it a drone bin because technically it is robot drone means honor unmanned vehicle I think ok so technically the right and so another company called sky I forget was called they raised three million to do this and so this morning what I did and yesterday morning is I went to I googled Manhattan skyscraper window cleaners and I found like the top three four people and I called them today to talk to them and I got and I was talking to them and they're gonna call me back with some more details but my takeaway from this industry is incredibly uh segmented so like fragrance fragmented like small like twenty to ten to twenty million dollar businesses and there's probably five or ten of them in New York right so it's like the guy Brian from 100 GOT JUNK right this is how the hauling business was and you know before he sort of started aggregating all these small fragments and local players and you've always had this thesis which is you could do the 1-800 GOT JUNK model for other businesses yeah so I would do it for irrigation for lawn mowing for painting which is already happening and for landscaping right and it sounds like window washing is in that vein yeah so maybe you don't even need these freaking drones to do it but that's definitely a cool stick so the private equity play is you go you buy up these businesses they have a book of business they do recurring revenue probably with the same buildings and you say okay I'm gonna buy this five million dollar a year business for eight or ten million tell me ten million bucks or you do smaller ones you buy a bunch of $1,000,000 a year businesses and then you could bring in this technology to increase the efficiency so they're getting 50% margin you could get 70% and there's two playbooks to look at if you wanted to replicate this the first is dentists so PE right now is gobbling up dentists --is dentistry that's just dentists we have friends who are doing this yes you have like three like see ever looked into doing it and then like two other guys I think we know they love it and so what they do is they find a dentist that does two million a year in revenue and they buy the keys like sixty ready to retire in a few years and they buy it for maybe if it's like a three million dollar revenue thing they probably buy it for like a million dollars yeah but basically they'll buy it at like one I think one to two X Y Berta which is crazy yeah so basically they pay back your money in a urine yeah so they buy it for the dentist's a--'s salary right times two and they give him you know you still keep this little piece and you keep getting your salary but you don't have to run this business anymore in the sort of all the administration and marketing and they centralize it so they'll go buy ten of these dentistry's and then they'll put it'll be like okay well have one central office that's doing Facebook Ads driving traffic to all these will bring all your billing stuff into one central place cuz why do you need four people doing billing because health insurance is you know all complicated and so they centralized which makes each one more efficient and basically the dentist is already playing golf two days or three days a week and they're like look here's a you know accelerated retirement for you and the goal here is you just you kind of become a little bit of a just a marketing company right so we're well we missed the punchline though a couple of these roll-ups I think like in Canada seventy percent of dentists you know numbers wrong but something like that a huge percentage of the of all the dentist's office have been rolled up now in Canada and a couple of them have been taken public the roll-ups one for three billion dollars name um I don't know the names okay yeah because I'm because anyway if you want a Google dentistry roll up Canada it goes public I would do that and then the other model that you can look at for this is all people homes nursing homes like so many PE I mean this is like so my wife's dad owns three senior care facilities yeah and so I was looking into this cuz I was like wow this thing is a cash cow and I think it's soul-crushing that's the problem with it because he was like hey you guys want to take this over and we were just like oh the money is there but like it sucks I don't want this to be like my life you know like I think in general people want to avoid nursing homes at all cost and so getting into it earlier than you need to was painful but he's making money - how much does it make a month you know it depends on the size so so basically with the bottle is you go and you you can buy an existing nursing home but what he looks for is he says okay this is existing nursing home it's got 28 beds but it's permitted for 42 and so he'll either just buy it he'll build out the other beds and so and then the other thing is he'll buy things that are motels today so motel the room or the bed might rent for like I don't know 150 dollars a night and so that becomes let's call it 4 grand you know it's a month and what he does is for for senior care you're charging 7 grand 8 grand here in California for each bed and you can put two beds in a room and then you could do memory care special you know dementia ward on the bottom and that's like 12 grand and so just put all the [ __ ] up cells into it the problem is is that your up cell is a dementia ward you know so it's like all right clearly a lot of money can be made you are definitely providing but there's a service to people yeah you're not scamming people right scamming people it's but it is a it's a it's a saddening business to be in yeah and so for these so we're getting off track but let's go so so my father-in-law owns a moving company in New York and it's a medium middle medium sized business and it's done the same amount like let's say let's just say some number between 10 and 30 million in sales every single year and real profitable I go how do you make this bigger he goes I'd have to buy every one out and I don't feel like doing I got a good life and so I would you could do that for these window things and if I was one of these a drone window companies I would that's what you would do yeah [Music]

so what you got what's interesting to you okay so I'll start with one that we went go-karting a couple weeks back and so I'm really into kind of VR AR I mean you know this I've kind of gives you an oculus so you can you know feel my you gave him one great gift that's awesome yeah I was like John you got to do this you're never gonna buy one on your own you're gonna be a skeptic forever here you go are you using it yeah because he was telling me he's like there's just one thing your cuz I was skeptical I was like is there any good games like what am I gonna do with this and he's like dude you gotta try this PokerStars thing and I was like oh yeah what a VR poker why do I need that it is [ __ ] amazing have you tried this thing why done boxing I played all the games but I think gotta try the poker one it's incredible I'm gonna go buy an oculus just to play yeah seriously you should there are sold out so it's gonna be tough but you know maybe we can get you one too you really can't buy one right now they're out there totally from from Christmas they just completely sold out and then they haven't been able to refill it they said it was January than February now it's March and then they're talking about all these delays from China that's a good sign for VR yeah I mean they totally it's the first device where I looked at it and I said I can give it to somebody that's not a VR junkie and they would actually get excited about it and I think the poker one is great because you actually people want to build these really immersed experiences like boxing but actually you don't really want entertainment like that all the time I actually want more sit on the couch experience yeah and so you know some of the things I've been thinking about in VR say what can I build while I'm on the couch yeah and so we wouldn't go karting and you know when you go go-karting it's really about how quickly do you make these turns how fast are you how good of a driver are you you know how aggressive are you you know things like that and afterwards we're just kind of talking about some ideas and I was like dude it'd be cool if we could you know go to a go-karting place but it's like Mario Kart instead where you have these AR goggles over your head and it's not about quick turns and it's like a longer track where you can kind of like have some space but I you know would digitally go over this box and I now have a weapon but I could shoot at your car and if I hit you successfully your car kind of shuts down for a second and you're stuck so I think the real life Mario Kart is this like the sandbox thing so this would be like sandbox or like Museum of ice-cream it'd be a place you go put on this thing play with a bunch of fun big on your sandbox like laser tag it's like a laser tag do you think that sandbox is a big business I think sandbox is fantastic I mean it's hard to see if it's gonna be successful or not because retail has all these problems and having space has all these problems but if they retail well yes not retail but they're they kind of have retail spaces right like they want to be brick-and-mortar right yeah they want to be like in a spot where there's a lot of I mean just it's just an activity it's just like escape room or something it's like escape room but it escape remain I know I know guys who owned like 200 escape rooms are they awesome it's an amazing business because escape rooms are super lightweight you don't do anything you have a room if one person you buy the kit and you just keep like reassembling the room and you have these like very small fun big as that company well it's not one company but it's like like you can just own a different yeah but like rooms you can own a McDonald's franchise they still report revenues as one yeah [Music]

Zoho so Zoho has their own University and the graduates of that make up 15% of their work [ __ ] which is pretty insane so hundred so first follow up on last time I was talking about corporate universities I'm gonna keep talking about anything education cuz I just love it I had a lot of people reach out to me about that really okay so I went back to my notes I already had these notes but I just wanted to mention a couple of them so hamburger you that's the McDonald's 119 full-time professors I thought that was interesting there's I don't how you say this Croatoan Ville that's from General Electric so Kaiser just opened up their own med school which I find really interesting because it's what that's exactly what I was talking about where you want your own pipeline of doctors so you create your own med school then some companies do it more like training Apple University Deloitte University I think those are more like just a training program so you could be a better employee that's that's different another one that I thought was interesting so we talked about Soho Soho has their own University and the graduates of that make up 15% of their work flow [ __ ] which is pretty insane so a hundred they have a maybe they have more than a thousand people I'm not sure exactly how many total it is to Google IT support certificate has 75,000 graduated students which is pretty crazy so I think this is gonna be a big trend so it's the opportunity to be a company that can create these education so I think what you can do is so there's these companies that are called what the hell are they called I know one is called to you or something like that that's the name of one of their companies so there's a set of companies that what they're doing is they say hey university hey Berkeley you should have an online degree and 4 years universities we're not so interested in this and then they saw how much money gets made by online degrees and so they're like okay we'll take that money and so they don't want to you know Berkeley doesn't want have to sit there and build out an online degree portal that has like the technology the service acquire students like Berkeley doesn't know how to do any of that [ __ ] right so there's a couple there's three big companies that basically go to these universities and they say hey do you want to offer an online degree we think it brings this much incremental revenue to your University and we will run the whole thing for you so you don't have to lift a finger and here's the but we want you know 30% of the tuition revenue and right so what happened is all the university said yes so there's a billion-dollar company that's doing this that basically offers this to all the universities so this if you go look all these you know traditional universities now have a online degree or certificate certificate program that they offer and it's run by these other companies I forgot the name of what these companies are called there's like some generic term but I think you could be that for corporations and so I think you could go to a corporation and say hey would you like to basically have your own you know developer bootcamp or university for you know essentially we're gonna pop out people who are like management consultant types and it's good for your brand to get students early and anytime you hire one of them we take essentially a recruiter fee and we'll run the whole thing for you and so I think that's one way you could take advantage of this trend [Music] you [Music]

the companies that they own collectively I think do about 100 million in revenue I think that now that private companies are staying private for long and not going public as much what I think needs to happen is I think the venture capitalists a lot of VC firms need to start buying companies and just need to own them for the cash flow versus wanting something to go public or get bought and so what I think is gonna happen is I think a lot of these VC firms are almost going to turn into hedge funds or private equity funds we're gonna they're gonna buy and operate a lot more than they are now and that's related to that so I don't think VCS will do it but the sort of New Age VCS that are gonna be hybrids so like andreessen horowitz shifted their model where they're not a VC there now I forgot what it's called but like they wanted to be able to just own cryptocurrency theirs buy it and hold it so they needed to reclassify and then this guy Chamath he basically has a fund called social capital it started off as a traditional VC fund and then like he had to restart it for all kinds of reasons but one of the things he does now is he has this thing called ass pack which is his special purpose vehicle for taking companies public so you're a company you don't want to go public he's already public and he just acquires that you know it's taking your company I believe is up is that how the mechanics work so they just did this with Virgin Galactic and so it's like a fast track to being public and getting that liquidity without having to go and be you know your own independent listing yeah I'm into that I know Andrew Wilkinson is probably listening he owns tiny capital and they do they've been doing this the companies that they own collectively I think do about 100 million in revenue and he I think takes dividends and buys companies with the cash flow right and it's an awesome model but a lot of these companies like brand lists there's no cash flow right it's gonna be a cash sink it's one of these go big or go to zero and in this stuff in this case it went to zero yeah but at the same class fee it doesn't have to be but it's also that is also valid right like to do that do what like jet tried to do just like you know they never made their core business work sold for three billion dollars because they they went for the plough money and today try to get the and then be the first to have scale doing what we do I know it's a it's a model [Music]

all right we're good this is a podcast you know chris d'elia he starts he always calls his audience babies baby like okay baby let's talk I only watched his clips make sure to subscribe from this to this podcast and then unsubscribe and subscribe again so we climb up the charts yes we're climbing we were top 50 a few days ago when I checked top 65 and then we were creeping to 55 so I saw some good movement there it's like the movies where there it's like a band it's like climbing up the Billboard charts and they show like exactly number one the clips that we're posting on our social they're not getting as much traction as I wish traction like what are your views or comments or well I only care about views and comments in order to get more podcast right listeners yeah so I guess there you would need people essentially tagging their friends or you'd need to start showing up and discover yeah and it's so starting I also have noticed that when I I have a smaller following than our branded channels but when I share something it gets way more engagement than a brand so yeah people like following people and listen to people more I also don't ever share it so I should share it to that big nine thousand Twitter followers I got and you have five more me you have five hundred more than me but I'm gonna beat you in the next four days I think I also bought five thousand a long time ago me too they degraded they like go away cuz Twitter like bans the accounts but when I bought the five thousand I got way more followers per day same because people wanted to follow somebody who already has so I'm a virgin two hundred new people a day and I'm enjoying it I don't even check all right what do we got I want to talk to about talk about this idea Simon IDs a company arsenic yeah they've been around for about four years now yeah I know I don't know how they're doing do you know if they're doing well they were doing okay basically the way that I knew some like media people who talked about them and knew them and I'm almost positive that it's run like it looks like it's run which is a bunch of kids who are good-looking and rich the mansion and they just dude right so debauchery and so the idea is arsenic is essentially playboy for the snapchat generation and they have a snapchat channel because you know the idea is like okay playboys big deal what would playboy be like today it would not be a magazine it would be you know a snapchat channel and so they created the snapchat channel which is perfect cuz it's like if you follow it you get it if not it's not in your face so it's not like like Facebook would be a little weird Instagram would be a little weird and they have email too and they just have this mansion and they have all these models and it's not porn but it's definitely models we're good looking and they just have one model like sort of take over the channel least is what it was three years ago I just think there's a great idea they raised three million bucks I don't know how they're doing so they've got books they do like tours I think that it could be doing a the ideas cool it's a cash cow I think hmm well I because they were getting millions of views back van on their videos I can only assume it's grown unless snapchat blocked them but they're not outside the bounds of what snapchat allows porn right no they don't allow porn but the unity allowed nudity they don't if you're putting on your stories you'll get banned eventually if you're doing me what if you have a private they do they don't do nudity what up for a private account you can eventually if it gets flagged they'll take it down like they're not in the rules to do nude well that's fine have you heard of only fans yeah love it so explain only fans only fan so basically what happened is on snapchat all these porn stars were putting up like porn yeah like what softcore porn I don't think it was like sex but like pay me ten dollars and I'll let you follow me right and you all all of my account where I post nudes and only fans launched and what they did was it was a platform where they I don't think they started with porn but now it is that yeah so just embrace it but basically if you I don't even think it's porn I think it's like web girls like webcam girls and you pay twenty dollars however much they want you to and you get access to their private video feeds yeah it's like patreon but porn based yeah so you pay you become a contributor and then you get their private photos and videos it's taken off has it yeah and the reason yeah cuz I was doing like who cares if I consume it or not from a business point of view that's how I know about it we all care and I mean no surprising so I did yeah but so here's you know why I think these things take office the people who don't take care of the creators they they they for these types of things they they go away yes and so there's always demand so the demand is always there the question is does the platform allow the supply to do what they want to do and the big platforms don't do it coz not worth their brand and risk and all the stuff because but only fans I for sure but I would bet you for sure there in north of a hundred million in subscription revenue and then they take their cut that's insane at one point in time well we had a we had blab like live streaming product and it wasn't working we had to pivot and we pivoted adventure to video gaming but I definitely laid out a case to the company that investor I was like look porn is the porn is where that horse would be the bats like these they're not [ __ ] on camera I don't think okay well whatever you want to call it like softcore porn or whatever but like going after the sort of the cam girl market is a pretty it's a big market and the websites that are there really really suck and so so I was like you answered well we had kind of a heart-to-heart we're like is this what we want to build and my co-founder felt a certain way the investors felt a certain way like did FERC on want to do um he was like not down to that I'm so done with that yeah so I think it's you got to make a personal choice then I've had a bunch of entrepreneurs reach out being like hey we saw you did blab we read your post mortem you guys got to 4 million users but it didn't work I have a very similar concept I think it's gonna work can you give me some advice I tell them from the bat jump I'm like this version is not gonna work consider porn I think it could work consider the cam girl angle because you know that's the one stone we didn't turn when we were considering you know where to pivot this thing to make it I would for sure do that because thick all these like patreon all the [ __ ] they're like we're gonna empower creators okay I'm behind that but even though a lot of times I think they don't but if you're gonna empower creator imagine this like woman who can just crush it by not breaking the law and just using her own body I'm philosophically I'm so in favor of that right yeah I think as a business person I'm definitely in favor of it I think it's just a portion this person I love it as just like a human being I'm like yeah so you want to their body turn little ideas or trends off this so one there's this fund called vice ventures that is basically investing and we've covered in trends that other investors won't invest in because like investors typically if you're a VC your investors they're called LPS they are typically not just like rich individuals they're institutions so it'll be like a pension fund for firefighters in New York or this you know the school endowment will give you 20 members and so you can so they won't want their money going into certain types of companies this is why cannabis investments started to take off because only alternative investors investors you've had a little more freedom were able to go into them big investors knew they were good spaces but they weren't able to move on it as quickly because they had to worry about their help ease so five spenders came out and they were like look you know sex drugs alcohol whatever rightly they're basically like taking sort of this the seven sins and they were like we specifically look for companies that are doing businesses in this in these areas and we'll invest in them and I think it's a very I think it's a if you're gonna do a venture fund you could either just make another cookie cutter hey we're a seed fund come to us instead of all these other guys or you take a focus and build a brand around being different and I think it was a very very smart approach I like it Ivan but I invested in this company called Lucy yeah it's a nicotine replacement there it's basically nicorette gum we got to get wasn't I'm Dave Dave we have to get him on because when I met him for the first time through you after hustle con he spit off seven ideas and when we were just standing there talking and I was like I'd ask for one and he gave me like a dope idea and I was like you got more of those he goes yeah I got a list and he started reading off his ideas and they were fantastic so you might be listening we got to get him on the on the couch to hear of a quick porn story yeah okay so I worked out of this all like I were given nod of approval I worked out of this office called the founders dojo and it was the greatest thing ever I'll tell another story about it but basically it was if you've seen the TV show Silicon Valley it was we had Erlich Bachman it was an Erlich Bachman type of guy named Dave who was a great guy but totally inappropriate and disgusting in a good way and the office was filthy and there was this guy I forget his name ritesh and Chris yeah and I remember and it was this this little skinny Indian guy and he was crazy and awesome and he was like the stereotypical Silicon Valley hacker where he could get a job at any big company and make $200,000 a year but he's like no [ __ ] that I'm like nah I'm [ __ ] the corporate pigs right and so he would sleep at that office and Dave would buy him pizza all the time because he was like get one to be poor and do this thing and so he created a app or know a site website that would crawl tumblr no I think all the internet okay for the fascists for the gifs that had the highest velocity of growth and so if a Jif launched popular gifs he would tell you right away which one's gonna be the most popular and then you would see it on the screen and it was called the worst drug the worst drug dot TV it's not there anymore and that sounds like a silly thing but that's not why he did it he did it because what he was trying to do was a find the fastest like technology that could find the fast growing stuff and if you would go to the worst drug at Tom you could type in something like dog and the search feature would autofill like wicked fast like way faster and then you would click enter and it would be BAM a high-def Jeff there's a high death it was full screen and it was all screens laser fast so the technology is very like Pied Piper like the technology wasn't like whatever pop Piper did it was the fact that it was all behind these scenes like a bunch of nerds being like yeah our gifs load the fastest and like look it's like HD and it happened in nanoseconds and he would spend nights and I would come back and would be just a tiny improvement but we don't gather on it well so here's the cut this the the point of the story turns out the most popular gifs on the Internet 99% of them are super hardcore raunchy porn like real raunchy porn and so because when I went to the site it was all porn there wasn't like porn and then some basketball gym it was only porn I was like this is a porn site and so at the opposite the dojo we would have these huge screens of it like his workstation and the way that he sat was everyone could see it and we kind of got immune to it but it was like the raw chia should ever and we would he'd like guys check this out early in the morning we would come in 11 a of it which was early and he'd be rubbing his eyes and [ __ ] and he'd be like check this out and all eight of us would grab around this high def screen and be like and he would type in the word like like facial and like like watch how fastest loads and we were just so immune we're like looking at the convert that were like oh yeah wow you could like see the shine in the liquid like it was like it was so funny and we would have like these like lawyers come into the office and people who were actually are like investors who were trying to raise money for the other companies and we would forget that this was on the big screen what happened this was like what's this guy doing now the site the worst drug got millions of millions of millions of visitors the engagement was stupidly like good he couldn't monetize it they couldn't use it so there were so many restrictions no ad network or a lot him to use it and so even though the site I think it was getting at least for sure millions I think maybe tens of millions of monthly uniques and it made zero money it only cost him a lot of money and the story ends with like someone in Bulgaria are laughs eeeh like this like Communists X communist country wanted to buy the site and it was all weird they flew him out there and he's like wait these guys are like mobsters and they ended up like bailing and they just shut it down because it was guys what do now he works at Facebook yeah but I've never seen him oh my skateboard I had a skateboard and left at the office he stole it and I've never seen a getaway dude I've never seen it you needed transferred ROG that's his name ROG I've never seen ROG because that guy is gonna build something amazing or it's gonna be a very sad ending but either way it's gonna be not average not to use yeah he was he was like if you think of like this idea of what Silicon Valley is that was that right Wow okay that's incredible I like that story you were talking about okay we were talk about our snake real quick quick idea so what they're doing is the playboy on snapchat if that's working and I don't know if it's working so go look into it but if it is working in a big way I don't think that there's just gonna be one of those so like in the same way that there's all these porn brands right there's like girls gone wild it focuses on college-age things somebody out there could create arsenic for college or for different like whatever genre and so I just like this desert if I are that arse arsenic is not porn modeling scanty modeling more like playboy and Maxim current Playboy exactly so you could build playboy but of other genres and just or you could just literally clone them and I think it would be very low cost and I think you would be able to do a lot of you be able to drive a lot of views and I ultimately get a lot of sponsorships in the same way that maximum Playboy were able to make pretty big businesses out of what they do now they had subscriptions so I don't know if you would do subscriptions maybe you use only fans I'm not sure but we should figure it out yeah I I'm gonna look up the old new fan I'm interested in this uh III I have a lot of ideas I'm gonna come back a little more prepared on this because I think there is something there what else you got okay so you have HQ HQ died obviously yeah I thought like it could have been cool I'm like they could be like jeopardy jeopardy is huge so if you don't know what HQ was it was a mobile app it was a game show like Wheel Fortune jeopardy whatever but that was all done on a mobile app which was when I saw this product some our friend Eric who does tribe socks he showed me this happen he was like dude my friend went to go work at this company it's really interesting check this out he pulls it up so at 6:00 p.m. every day they would do the game show so you get a notification at 6:00 you open the app there's a host a live got you know live live game show host on live streaming and he would ask trivia questions that you would push the button and you have ten seconds to answer you push the button real quick to answer if you got all ten or twelve questions right you'd win the prize at the end which at that time it was there was 400 players and the prize was like $500 this thing grew like crazy they had games with over a million concurrent player I said except I was like a million and a half and exactly over a million players and over I believe they had over a million dollars in prize money over time and so this thing had this run and they got tons of funding founders fund funded that ten million dollars of funding a hundred million dollar valuation and then they had big-time brands launch stuff on there so they were like you know this game is sponsored by Nike it's all trivia about athletes and we're gonna drop this shoe the new shoe release is happening live on HQ and that's the prize they were doing some interesting stuff but it was kind of a fad and which everyone knew which everyone knew because it was like games all have this hype cycle and then this decline of they're not games aren't super super sticky most of them and this was definitely that so this big novelty grew like crazy viral product in many ways as somebody makes products it's very inspiring because it was like so simple yet so awesome and I actually felt like product there I'm not trying to be hyperbolic but I felt like there was some revolutionary things for sure it was like oh I'm looking at the future this is this is what the future looks like I still think that's what the future looks like HQ dot for many reasons socata founders are sucking literally one founder died he overdosed on drugs the other founders they were sort of always infighting they were both sort of like kind of come across at least from the outside a sort of like moody artists yeah one of them I believe started fine also Russ yeah yeah both of them they were both the founders of fine so definitely sort of brilliant guys in a way but everyone says that Russ is a dick yeah in the and he and he got removed a CEO because he had some problems you know he was a dick or whatever the other guy got removed also never figured it out and the the game show host Scott became this kind of like cult sensation because he was the host everyone saw him every day and he tweeted out when it shut down recently he was just like this company died for one reason alone and that's the sort of incompetence and arrogance of the founders and I was like yeah damn that is like you don't usually hear that like everybody's so PC and always just worried about the career well he's a comedian he ain't give a [ __ ] yeah he definitely did not give a [ __ ] because that was that's pretty brutal on the day's shut down let's say can I tell you what I would do yes okay so I would I have no idea if they did this not I would have built this knowing that it's gonna die and so it's like it's my thing is I'm gonna be a hit machine right and I'm gonna use this formula and I always thought about this with remember like cronut yeah okay you know how like these viral food things like these food things go viral I like one day sat down I'm like what makes them go viral so it's and I've like broke it down to a handful of categories which is like it's either of it's gotta be a food that's typically aside but you're gonna eat it in excess so for example only cookie dough instead of so ice cream that's just cookie done right or to make this ah you make the topping domain yep so like one formula you could use yep like or like fondue so likes fondue is typically an appetizer fondue only right another thing is you take the shape of it and you make it a ridiculous shape yes easy including small to big like there's Bob's doughnut and there's my neck which is rising so you make something small big big small right the the fifth or fourth thing is color rainbow Raggles so you just take the color green ketchup Instagram a bowl yes yes and then I had a fifth one which was some mashups which is cronut right oh yeah and then and then that was the fifth one you take there Doritos locos taco one of them the most successful fast-food thing in like the last ten years was this Dorito locos taco and then every fast-food chain hired these agencies to be like find me the next Doritos right and so those are the five like categories that I discovered and then it's like okay so you just make it go viral by you you have to have distribution via Thrillist BuzzFeed and then eventually it's like we just have your own handle and then you're gonna like these okay and then you're gonna have a small shop outside outside in Brooklyn or in Manhattan and you're just gonna you're always putting out bangers yeah you're just gonna [ __ ] knock it out the park and you're gonna have a line all the time and then three months later boom that one shut down switch now we're doing cookie dough ice cream every season you come out with a new one viral sensation yeah it's like all right now we're doing - we're doing rainbow cake now or green ketchup and hot dogs like you just like you use like okay it's so if I was I've always thought about like that's the way to go you just have a small you just a bang and you're banging these out and then for the ones that last in our hits like Crona it might be a hit I mean that's kind of like its own category now then you've that's like you're one of your tempo franchises it's always available yeah that's what I would do and then so with HQ trivia I would have on the same thing this is like supreme for food it's like you have this limited scarce kind of like out there thing what you're doing is you're making these these sort of wild concoctions on the food side using these five different yeah but it's all for maleic yes it's just like one of these five form is Zynga and then you do a limited edition drop you basically say you know you tweet out at 1:00 a.m. it's live you get a huge line people cover the fact that there's a line and then it becomes a thing in the hipster town yeah this is so easy like Bagel Bites like pizza and bagels this is wit back when you were doing your hotdog stand if you knew everything you know now but you still needed to do hot dogs in you would end up doing something more like this like green ketchup like that are my stick to catch up with only be green right and what I did back then was I had a what I did was like you just have a little shtick like mine was my onions I would boil them in coca-cola which a lot of people do I would just tell everyone I did that right and so there's this is actually a famous copywriting trick which is have you ever heard of um Oh a time like a watch like a like a wristwatch being described as like with quartz movement yes they all have [ __ ] quartz movement right they all do all of them do or like space-age aluminum they all that's not even a thing first of all like what's that madmen line it's like our filters are rolled or something like yeah and they're like well everyone says and they're like well they don't know it right so space-age aluminum that that means nothing first of all all lumen right first of all nonsense yeah and second of all quartz movement every single watch has that right and so the idea here is you just take something that they don't know even though all the insiders know you just tell them right we did this experiment when we were doing the sushi restaurant where we took the descriptions of our food so it'd be like you know you take a Philadelphia role which is like this Americanized it's salmon it's cream cheese and it's cucumber in a sushi roll and then we would just so Dan Ariely was one of our advisers and he's the guy wrote particular as well and so he would he told us like hey one of the reasons wine charges this premium is cuz they created a whole language around what they do you need to create a language around sushi so that people who start to learn about it feel like they know more and now they want to pay more so they can have the better thing just teach of what is the better thing and so we would you know we started just adding words as one experiment we would have one version of our website where it was all online ordering so is one version of our website would be the normal website then our a B test was the other variation was our Philadelphia roll would be called like we called the Philadelphia roll and then the description would be like Atlantic fresh you know never frozen salmon with you know Philadelphia Delphia cream cheese and a finely sliced cucumber and we would raise the price and we would get like more orders even despite the higher price that's crazy and and so this is like a psychological thing around yeah that [ __ ] works yeah around the descriptions around things okay back to a to you for a second so they did try to release other games they came out with like a word scramble type game I think they kind of ran out of time and also they had built the hype too much and lesson to be learned when you build this much hype if you start to fail you death spiral way faster cuz the high pressure of your expectations and hype will crush you well so that's what I mean is I would have built this company exacting that like we discussed that claw game and they're like well they're building it so it they're gonna just capture all the value upfront and then let it die right so if you were to built that right alike built that into it it would have been it could have been a company kind of like I imagine saying it does this which is they just have like they're like alright this game is only in the last 80 days maybe right so two quick ideas on this HQ thing so HQ died okay you know rest in peace but two things I could do if you wanted to make make use of this of the insights that were found in this I think you can do this on top of twitch or YouTube or any live streaming platform that already has audience so you don't need to be your own app you should just host create a channel that's hosting a show and give away the prize money and promote it in the same way and so I think somebody could build this on top of one of the existing platforms not enough to build your own tech and not have to acquire downloads of your app which is really expensive and I think if you just did this every day at 7:00 p.m. on Twitch I think a bunch of people would turn in second idea around this is maybe the HQ format which is this live video streaming with this charismatic post and question and answer could be used in education and so I would love to see somebody create an after school game that parents actually pay $3 a week to subscribe to where your kid learned science through some Bill Nye the Science Guy type of host and it's trivia it's interactive and they get sort of points as they I thought about starting that company but I really think that that could work I think it might also have the sort of fade in interest but I remember as a kid I love brain quest and I played all these like learning games and they were great and so I think this is a modern-day but that's interesting that is quite sticky I think that as we get older I mean your kids not old enough so you'll imagine you'll learn this once she gets old enough but these things that we use is we are kids were just huge yes huge I'm into that and you wouldn't need tens of millions of people because you're not advertising you'd be on subscription because parents would be like oh I don't have to go drop my kid off at tutoring and I don't have to like learn this myself my kid already wants to sit in front of the iPad all day so okay here's an iPad game that I feel good about because you're learning it's kind of cool because it's live and interactive and I could play with you and I'll pay three bucks a week for that do you want to hear what I've been in that same category that I'll come back with some more research but I was just surfing around and saw is that but for allowance okay tell me more so a friend Ramones kid had I was like I was like hey Victor does your dad give you allowance like he better be giving you some money right and he goes yeah but it's all on this app but I was like what do you mean he's like well it is automated and I get $10 a week if I do everything and I have a list of everything I got to do and then it just sends me this $10 but it sends it into an account and I could use those on the the places that he's already approved that I could spend it on or if he wants I can get this debit card that it only works at a handful of places that's a great idea yeah I was like of course that's obviously that's a horse idea yeah I get mad at myself for not thinking of it so I'm gonna go I haven't thought I haven't seen their financials or any doesn't I'm going to yeah when he told me that I was like oh okay obviously great right what else we got let's do rocket this let's do um let's get mood and then we'll just go down the list like what do you wanna keep going wait what's this rocket ship thing you want my dad or skip it will do that the end okay Do It Yourself perfume so on trends we released this on Tuesday two things we're interesting that our guys found more Steph and our guy so men and women found which we only have two people so uh so you're a guy and gal found that two things I'm like thinking about all of it first everyone talks about meditation being like the most popular like being a huge trend right now people searching for sleep is actually significantly more likes like sleep products and not and this makes total sense because calm well I'm a subscriber to calm they're Tories there they're pushing asleep like crazy yeah sleep stories I think was the breakout product for the breakout feature for that's crazy and so I didn't realize this until they like point it out and I'm like oh yeah that does make sense sleep is way bigger than meditation and meditation is huge sleep is also a lot of people search for it because so for meditation you're trying to teach a new habit sleep everybody does also for sleep a lot of you have problems sleeping so they will actively search for and pay for solutions that will help them sleep I pay for a bunch of them I pay for what's your sling an Alexa app called nature sounds and they have like 26 sounds and I pay extra money to combine them it's a lot my the one I sleep two is winter railroad and so that sound like it's a trick it's a train going to the mountains in winter what's the winter part what is the sound of winter you hear like wid okay I love it sure it's only very personal there I go Alexa played nature sounds or sometimes I'll do ship in winter because it sounds like an ice breaker and then Alexa turn off in 20 minutes nothing this is also like one of these you know hackathon projects or some developers like okay watch this just say two words I go search the internet for sounds and I smash them together and it makes an audio yeah for cons next hackathon they should build this like I don't even know what he could be like chickens and China Street was a Sarah she doesn't like this you like the sound with it so do you take any sleep aids like like a like a vitamin or supplement or CBD or something melatonin melatonin yeah that work helper yeah it does if I really can't sleep I'll take one of those unit to my computer to I think it died one of my unit you know gel is that what it's called units off it's a it's basically like a mild dosage of nyquil without the medicine part oh that's good so okay so it's the way some people take nyquil just to sleep and so this is the just a sleep part it just don't have a cough yeah it's just a lite version you don't take this stuff i I heard this phrase today I could sleep in a ditch so I just when I would to go to sleep I instantly fall asleep and I do not wake up at night ever and so I'm blessed you know that I am typically like that as well but not as bad there's this guy that we should profile he he he's a Japanese billionaire or sorry Chinese billionaire and he started a so he's a he's a big shot now and he owns like half a bank and all his other [ __ ] and he got rich by creating a melatonin he just took melatonin and rebranded it made it sexy and called it a sleep aid and whatever it got huge and then he launched the Zynga of China and he ended up buying like the building that they lived in just like Zynga and or they worked in it became a huge thing we'll have to do off to bring him up cuz I love him because he's reckless and he's built a fortune and lost it all like three times right yeah you love that I love those guys okay and then we also talked about a Do It Yourself perfume so apparently that's a huge community is Do It Yourself perfume and there's not a ton of companies in the space so what's that what's happening what are these people trying to do this okay do i buy perfume they want to mix their own at home yeah so basically perfume is a huge business Paris Hilton a lot of people forget about her she has sold roughly five billion dollars of her perfume cycling back to the porn conversation earlier okay Paris Hilton yes yes and let's say her stuff cost $100 which it doesn't it it's typically ninety percent margin yeah incredible so huge fat margins and everyone now knows this and so the idea here is that people are trying to make their own perfume at home and it's got there's a lot of sub sub reddits around a lot of communities who discuss different perfume like how to create your own perfume but there aren't too many companies that are making it easy to make your own perfume and formulas and things like that - that makes a lot of sense this is like one of those industries where when you hear about the winner later you're like oh okay was set up for success - for example a Warby Parker you know one of the reasons warburg Parker works so well was that the existing eyewear eye glass you know industry was all owned by this one conglomerate Nautica that had price pricing power and was marking [ __ ] up like crazy so they didn't have to like invent something to lower the they just had to not be greedy and be like okay we can offer this at a fair price and still have margin and so if you own cologne I own Cologne and so what you're saying is basically cologne vastly marked up in the same way razors or super marked up and Dollar Shave Club came in but instead of somebody just making a Dollar Shave Club version of Cologne they're giving you a DIY kit and there's like probably reddit communities of home brewers for perfume yeah it's actually pretty great there's an infinite number of recipes and scents so you're good yeah is if you took it a step further an interesting sense could be sold already yeah so you could create a marketplace where you could sell you yes you to just even to your own friends and family you could create a kit for people to do this and make a better kit sure there's one that exists well another idea you know we're talking about kid stuff earlier like my niece would love to mix her own perfume she would that would be like a great afternoon and my my sister would buy her you know this little kid-friendly perfume making kit it's like one of the arts and crafts things that she gets to do and she makes it an Emeril who comes over she gets to show him show her show them there yeah I think you could do this for kids and be a big deal here's another angle that we found in trends is soap do-it-yourself soap big thing people want to make their own soap and what was the third one juice but we already know that's right juicing yeah it was pretty great I like that I would have never known about that that's pretty fascinating to me in fact I'm gonna tell my sister to start this business okay so yeah let's get let's get into okay so a topic that we talked about yesterday that you wanted me to look into more was auctions auctions yes I had never heard of this company that you showed me heritage auctions yeah I think that auctions particularly marketplaces I would love someone to criticize this because I want to hear the downsides I think that they are potentially one of the top like two or three business models auctions or more Oxford's and marketplaces all marketplaces for sure yeah but action style marketplaces I think there were they're one of the bests yeah you've seen a bunch of them yeah I think they're a being the sort of classic yeah and I think eBay sucks by the way there's some ones totally gonna crush them I mean they're gonna be dead not dead somebody told me this is half half half information somebody told me eBay has had like a revival and they don't do the auction stuff as much anymore they're all like it's basically Amazon is yeah hate it I'm gonna hate it but if somebody said that their numbers have turned around I don't know faster well they're a behemoth they're not going anywhere anytime soon I mean they're like Google like you're like oh well they're sucking like okay I mean they're gonna last for another 50 years at least yeah so anyway I love auctions I like I land I love niche auctions and heritage which you pointed out they do that you got the you got that pulled up Henry and you could pull it up on your phone so they did 800 million dollars in sales so it's not on the screen so let's look at the top categories do you have it on your phone yeah so coins I think was their top right yeah so they do I think 300 million dollars in currency right okay but look at some of the more interesting ones movie posters 10 million 10 million dollars in sales what was comics comics is on there yeah and I just pull it up what's it say for comics Henry comics 50 sports 60 million sport collectibles basically mm-hmm luxury real estate 19 million wine 10 million crazy right tons crazy and here's what I like about it this is a big idea we talk a lot in fact I have a pet peeve we talk a lot about these like small little business arbitrage is hacks little businesses this would be a big big company if you could get this right and so what so I love I love marketplaces and I love auctions I love auctions because there's a time component to it yeah and that urgency makes you buy more and what I think is even better and so for heritage auctions I think a roughly half of their sales of a hundred million dollars sales are online and the other half are in person you want to know another in-person auction that's doing wonderfully barrett-jackson have you heard of barrett-jackson know what it's a barrett-jackson is based in Arizona bootstrapped owned by one guy is that his name Barret maybe Barry Barrett is dead Jackson is alive okay or it could be the other way around one of them is dead but what they do is they actually have a they put this on TV all the time I watch it all the time what they do is sell cars so classic cars right not all classic cars but just like rare or like interesting cars you could buy like a $10,000 car there but so they have a car on and they'll say like this Ferrari there was only 500 of them this it sells for $200 and they show it and you're like oh awesome that sale just happened in three minutes that was great and so they do I believe 68 shows a year and they make hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue yeah it's a huge business and I love that and so another one is bring a trailer they do cars as well and the guy who started bring a trailer also started mailbox Gentry Underwood so he's like a but she's sold to Dropbox right and so I like these auction places and first of all I like niche auctions so I like watches anything that's niche but tell but what do you what is another and I have one an idea idea what's a current marketplace that's very ill liquid and hard to sell and you wish I could go away faster mm-hm houses luxury houses pay they put on here because takes a while to sell a house in general and so open doors trying to make that instant as a market but as a real estate company but not not as much as an auction mm-hmm I have a friend who did this with sneakers he people are doing that now I think it's working well he did it as a 90 minute auction so he would say the sneaker goes live it's 90 minutes and we're gonna get you your guaranteed price or we they basically offer the seller they're like we will buy it at this price if the auction doesn't go higher so if you agree to that you start the process and it's 90 minutes what else I don't know what else you got small businesses okay just flip my business and this is a maybe would just fall flat this is one of those it could be amazing or it would just be horribly idea but if I were quiet like brokerage who sponsors this or if I were another brokerage I would 100% have an event and try to gather a thousand people and we're gonna auction off these businesses my idea from yesterday the first dibs where you're auctioning feature the future first future first whatever you're going create I think that would work really well with this as well but business is the hard part is you have there's so many hard parts about it there's a lot of hard price but one is just the diligence right so like when I buy the the movie poster or whatever if it has sort of the certification and the the person you know selling it sort of says this is authentic I don't need to look too much more into it whereas with a business you really have to sort of understand all these different components I think that's hard I agree it's hard but I think it's interesting because like if someone just like if I knew Shopify apps or something and there's this gathering and they're just auctioning off a [ __ ] ton of them and it's kind of like a storage war or it's like which you're not sure what you get it but let's just find out like it could be fun to gamble tens of thousands of dollars yeah just storage units that would be interesting like a mystery box basically [ __ ] yeah that would be really fun and and interesting is it have to be cheap enough that's interesting someone doing store a storage unit like blind auctions yeah yeah surely they have to be right I don't know but you could tie some of these ideas together right so like what HQ showed where they did basically they took a traditional TV show and turn it into a live streaming mobile app where the game shows on on your phone this is the future of TV like you can do a QVC or I don't know what show you talked about you watch the auctions on but like well that's rare jacket but there's another one called up turn these into mobile live streamed shows and you can essentially sell these all through through you know you could take so one way to look at it that's what I was thinking about right so one way to look at this is you you start selling some item that's not currently sold on these auction places might be hard because a lot of time has passed and sort of like you know the law of supply demand has pulled things that want to be sold this way into the market but maybe you could find a new Tanish or you just take the existing platforms and you make them smaller more lightweight and mobile focused you just win that way and so like I don't know top hat er yeah what do they double company its wish so it's a mobile app where you see a bunch of really cheap stuff from China random stuff it could be like a back brace and a ring and a you know whatever a poster of dollars.you dollar store crap dollar store well it's like the it's like the wish crap which is like random electronics and memorabilia laser pointers yeah laser pointers and rings and like you know whatever but what they do is if it which is interesting is it's a they sytem start so you open up the app and you see all these things in it like you've never seen your adrenaline spike like this in a mobile app before all the prices are starting it like what are fifty dollars and they just start dropping and then somebody just hits buy and then they buy it and so you kind of want to wait to get it lower but you don't want to wait to local somebody else is gonna buy it so top Hatters a start-up here in San Francisco and they do hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue a very good is a very interesting business I don't know how profitable it is how sticky it is blah blah blah but when you go into the app it's like a it's like being in like this high-stakes Chinese but those dollar auctions like those penny auctions things it's know that all like [ __ ] it like that but they but you don't have to buy credits and stuff like that it's more like wish but instead of what they tap into is instead of browsing and picking they pick they like inject into your FOMO you know part of your brain and so you're like okay this item do I want it don't want it for 6 bucks 5 bucks 4 bucks 3 I'll take it and you end up buying a whole bunch of [ __ ] and it's just a bunch of moms who are bored at home that are just shopping on this thing and they feel like hey we're getting tons of value but like this is stuff you didn't even know you wanted you don't even want it's just [ __ ] it's just [ __ ] and I'm gonna download it and buy some stuff I buy [ __ ] all the time how patter is cool we want to do one more or end it there let's do one quick one so I have this career advice so there's this great line I think Sheryl Sandberg said a while back which was if you're offered a seat on a rocket ship you don't ask which chair you just sit down and buckle up something like that that's her quote and I see people get this wrong all the time and so you're making let's say you're listening to this and you're making career choices so we talked a lot about businesses business ideas but a lot of people who are listening to this are not yet they haven't you know they have a job and they haven't yet you know started their own company necessarily so when it comes to job selection if you think about the companies you're thinking about joining I want you to classify them into cars rocket ships or titanic's and basically you got the goal in your career advice is not to look at the role you know like what is the job description say it's not even really to look at the compensation package although you know there should be a minimum there but you want to optimize for getting onto rocket ships and so a rocket ship is a company that's growing really really fast they've figured out what they're doing and there's still a whole bunch of problems to be solved and they're the right type of problems a bad problem is nobody wants our product we had to figure out how to get them to want it a good type of problem is too many people want our product we have to make sure we can keep up with this demand and so you want to you want to find a rocket ship and you want to take whatever roles you can get on that rocket ship you want to sit down you want to buckle up because what ends up happening in these fast-growing companies is if you're good and you kill it for even two months you'll get moved and promoted to a better spot because they'll be like oh this person can actually do something we have so many fires to put out okay we thought you were a junior but like hey junior you're now working on this thing because you're the best we got and we I've seen you problem-solve so far and so what a mistake people make is they try to pick a role that's a higher-ranking role initially or better competition initially but they join either a slow-moving company where they're not gonna learn it's not gonna grow or they join a Titanic which is just you know about to sink but hey I got the best seat on the Titanic you don't want that either and so my advice is find the rocket ship companies take whatever seat they'll give you crush it and then they'll move you up great I think that to add to the analogy a lot of people shouldn't join that fast-growing thing or do they want that fast-growing thing but they want something that's mildly growing is that what that car is yeah I think that's that's where yeah I'm speaking to the people that like someone that they're trying to max out but they're currently in the job track so if you're trying to max out and you're not starting your own business this is the next best thing in my opinion yes like not a lot some people a lot of you don't want a maxim a you have kids and they're like I want a nice life right I don't want a high-risk high-reward life right and to those people that advice doesn't apply right and I'm just guessing a lot of those people don't listen to the podcast cuz if you're that person you probably listen to like I don't know Bon Jovi on your way to work you don't listen to like a podcast about business and ideas and all that stuff sure I think we've self selected at least I think that's good advice and by the way when you have you got a job if you been employed let's say not like kind of like college-age but like since they have you just done businesses of your own uh we have like an acquisition and I was kind of employed there but I but you haven't gone and just interviewed for jobs I interviewed once a couple times and I never got them what you interview for for fungal for Jack Smith my best friend I interviewed for his job and I didn't get it they just didn't call me back I started a bag Jack tell you the guy who's like my best friend now I didn't know him I interview his job oh you didn't know him at the time I didn't know I'm okay they interviewed me and they didn't hire me and then two years later we came best friends and you were trying to be a salesperson or I don't remember I think so by the way I have a similar story I applied to stripe I think I might have told the story already so apology if I did but 2012 I applied to I was gonna apply for a job for the first time in my life I'd started two companies before that I was like I'm moving to Silicon Valley I'm gonna get a job I'm gonna learn from other people rather than start my own thing and I only applied to jobs one was stripe and I got to the phone screen and I really had it made because the guy who was interviewing me his mentor in life was one of my former advisors in my startup and had written a blog post being like this guy Sean is like he said it specifically he has the highest bias for action of any entrepreneur I've ever met he made a warm intro to this guy and was like trust me this guy's legit you should hire this kid [ __ ] did you not get that job and so I I thought I was cruising too and maybe that's why I didn't get it but I get to the part of the interview where he was like all right you know this job has a lot of sort of sales and persuasion stuff so you know we're peace software so I want you to you know we're gonna do a little roleplay you're gonna sell me a piece of software and he's like you could pick any software you like whatever you're familiar with all you probably got creative or something and I was just like um I was like okay so I here's what I would do I would talk to you about this he said no no don't tell me what you would do like I'm the customer hello I just picked up the phone go and I was like [ __ ] and so I I was like hey you know I'm telling you about I picked Basecamp as my software big mistake cuz I don't even know Basecamp very well so I just like I just I didn't call you back for that reason by the by the end of that roleplay he was just like yeah I don't think this is for you I've just been on with you like I just don't think you're you know I'll wait for this that was eight years ago some yeah I was like probably 2023 year 24 at the time how [ __ ] how early I'm like I I blew it like it wasn't there bad like I definitely blew that interview how early of an employee would you have been so I think they were at like 50 maybe 50 people or less or less you five million dollars well yeah I don't know how much equity I would I would have had to do the rocket ship thing I would have had to start in a crappy seat crush it and then get into a good seat to get equity but like I did that with uber and airbnb I had job interviews at Airbnb and uber first 100 people and one of them I gotten one of them I got the offer but then they rescinded it cuz I lied about my resume and the other one I didn't get past the I had a criminal record and I told my didn't they're like oh alright don't come to work on Monday dude that's hilarious at least you had good eye for picking these companies and then I applied at bungle and they sold for 800 million dollars I always tell people find out where I want to work at who will also deny me and then invest there okay let's start with where would you want to work at today if you were you back then where would you be applying today great question do you have an answer you want to go for a couple years ago I answer this I was like the only place I would be really interested working with his angel list at the time no I'd be horrible at a place to work and so I thought Angeles was doing really interesting [ __ ] and I think it's gonna be begging it did end up becoming big and this was like seven years ago so this is a while ago ya know that would be a horrible place to work though cuz that like all guys [ __ ] crazy really I don't know but he seems like a brilliant genius so a great person listened to but a horrible person to manage you if okay if I had to work somewhere I probably hmm probably just somewhere with really good managers most startups have horrible managers and it's like when you were looking at uber Airbnb you didn't know the managers so you weren't using that criteria van no but and I don't know if it would've been successful Sara my wife works at Airbnb and she loves her managers and you know how everyone's like so what are you gonna do next they always say that and she's like what do you mean by whatever do anything next is awesome would be for a really long time and I would love to have that feeling I would probably now look for a company that's I would go find all the most interesting biotech based companies so anybody doing something with genetics genomics modification anything like that I think that's a big wave that's coming I do try to be early they're self-driving cars if there's someone who's awesome there I'd do something than that if or it's hard though it's really hard if I wanted to make a lot of money let's say I wanted to like bigger I'm gonna try and save hundreds of thousands of dollars in the next three years of work I work at Facebook or what well Facebook Google or an enterprise sales role at a super boring b2b me enterprise software company right where the where the average deal is like three or four hundred thousand dollars a year right that's what I would do so if I took my own advice I would look for who's a rocket ship so I would try to maybe like lambda school I think it's interesting I would just basically try to go fine who's the fastest growing startup right now that's at maybe 50 people or 20 people or what are the 10 people whatever they are I would go try to find them and then I would be like hey I'll come solve any problems you got like we'll figure it out I went to the sub stack office the other day they just raised sixteen million dollars in funding you know how many employees they have five five I would that would be an interesting place to work okay who does better in the long term only fans or sub stack okay so for creating the owner's wealth only fans for creating a valuable company that could potentially sell for more sub stack by far so take both paths right sub types can either have to sell or go public and only fans Ohio might just you know spit off cash if I had were so where would I work know which business do you think Nets more more money in the end which business exploding pants because the likelihood that sub-sect is gonna succeed is low very low what if they do it right I think it could be really big yeah I was talking to that guy Hamish I think he came to here the other day okay cool I was trying to get him on this podcast I mean I already asked him he said no yeah he was like oh you know my first million I don't want to definitely told me to do it yeah I was like you're overthinking this dude you're just doing interesting things we just want to talk about your [ __ ] in front of munch people who are interested and he was like overthinking it a little bit nice guy but I went and met with him and their old co the CEO we could probably get him on there just engineering dorks they're cool right and then I think they're gonna have the same problem patreon has which is kind of an awesome product that supports a lot of people and people have it's a really valuable tool but they're taking a very small cut of a very small amount of money yeah and so what I'm trying to do is tell them to pivot and like guys will pay you a [ __ ] ton of money if you create paywalls for bigger companies right they're not gonna pivot they've raised their money and they they have their dream we're a few meetings in we'll see yeah I think it's a 10% chance all right that's pretty good okay cool we got anything else or nope we're cool we'll end it now all right thank you for listening

we good what's up what's going on nice to see you nice move let's start off by saying this I thought I asked everyone to give us a review I thought that was gonna impact the rate of the downloads sorry I think you're gonna have to move the back I can see it spiking cuz it's too close good yeah start again ok we're back I thought when we asked everyone to leave us a review I did so because I thought I was gonna help us with the downloads we're hacking this process I've learned two things the first podcasting is a wild west still apple doesn't give you anything that you need the second is I'm not sure that's the best thing to do we good that's right we can keep riffing we good alright so what do we think is the best way to get more reviews or more downloads which is our goal subscribe so subscribe but so basically a tell your friends be like yo there's a business podcast out there and B if you go in iTunes and subscribe that that spikes us in the charts so some people like to unsubscribe and then risa because that creates the like the charts say oh there's more subscribers today yeah I think that's the barstool trick so subscribe then unsubscribe and then resubmit a times because here's the deal if chart and I don't get to a hundred thousand listeners per episode of X weeks or months we're gonna start charging for this pocket yeah or we just get so bored or like impatient we were too impatient no we're gonna make it so you have to pay money to listen happen so you want to start talking about some ideas first of all I think we should start this the Twitter weight-loss thing we show that that's pretty interesting did you sign up for it I signed up I just ate a big old plate of veggies just now because now cuz I'm like oh [ __ ] this is starting so explain what this is okay so when you're on camera you predict this happens a lot but you get self-conscious but also we are both trying to lose weight our friend Justin is doing a thing where we have then what did you venom venom owe him money so he tweeted out hey I got an experiment for weight loss 30 days if you want in let me know and you had to venmo him 800 bucks I did know just did it right away just a pop mcpot commit myself into it and then he's gonna send us a blood glucose monitor and say 'then you for 28 days 20 days and basically the way it works is he's gonna send a nutrition plan and like an eating plan but if you and if you stick to it you'll be fine but well problem is most people don't stick to it so here's how it's gonna work if your blood glucose levels go out of the range like the healthy range the weight loss range that he's gonna prescribe for us so first it's gonna monitor your baseline then he's gonna say okay cool here's the range I want you to stay in if you stay in that range for the day he then moves you back 25 bucks for the day and if you don't he keeps your money I love it and he is doing this in a way where he's buying all of our monitors yes which typically cost I think $300 400 bucks if we stick to it by the end of this challenge we've paid $100 we've lost a bunch of weight and we got paid back all our money if you stick to it if you don't it's a hundred bucks now and then if you if you if you do it to the letter of the law you get this four hundred hour device for a hundred dollars and you lost your weight I love it sick deal and we should explain who he is he's the founder of this thing called kettle and fire he also I think is one of the founders of perfect keto yeah so - keto products basically yeah and I have no idea but I imagine his businesses collectively are in the 50 or 60 million dollar in revenue range so like he sees a lot he says he's at a hundred million plus run rate for his to product for kettle and fire and perfect where did he say that on his website oh good for him yeah I didn't know that which is very crazy for a keto product yeah so it sounds like he's thinking of a new business yeah go ahead and copy that yeah so I like it so what we'll do is when we get the device what a shout-out our blood glucose during the show I'm doing it I also use my body tutor where I take pictures of everything that I eat right and I send it to my so I ate that doughnut just now I'm gonna send that to them and they're gonna shave me you ate it well there's more out there I'll take a picture of it okay but all I've eaten today is a doughnut in an orange I'm good all right cool cool weight-loss idea I like it just amazed good stuff okay what's up what okay so last episode had your buddy here and we he told me about this thing where he had invested in the company that's doing drone window-washing yes I thought that was crazy fascinating and I went and researched in a bunch there's another competitor that's raised money and drones I don't think at the right words to describe it because when I think of drones I think of like a quadcopter these are things that like they look like the normal so when you're pulling up the scaffolding or when you're pulling up like the what do you call it it's like an elevator yeah an elevator up and the guys are standing on it and wiping it looks like that but there's a robot on there that is doing it instead of people right so it's not flying you're saying it's not flying why do they call it a drone bin cuz technically it is robot drone means honor unmanned vehicle I think okay so technically the right and so another company called sky I forget what's called they raised three million to do this and so this morning what I did in yesterday morning is I went I googled Manhattan skyscraper window cleaners and I found like the top three four people and I called them today to talk to them and I got I was talking to them and they're gonna call me back with some more details but my takeaway from this industry is incredibly uh segmented so like fragrance fragmented like small like twenty to ten to twenty million dollar businesses and there's probably five or ten of them in New York right so it's like the guy Brian from one hundred got junk right this is how the hauling business was and you know before he sort of started aggregating all these small fragments and local players and you've always had this thesis which is you could do the 1-800 GOT JUNK model for other businesses yeah so I would do it for irrigation for lawn mowing for painting which is already happening and for landscaping right and it sounds like window washing is in that vein yeah so maybe you don't even need these freaking drones to do it but that's definitely a cool stick so the private equity play is you go you buy up these businesses they have a book of business they do recurring revenue probably with the same buildings and you say okay I'm gonna buy this five million dollar a year business for eight million or ten million tell me ten million bucks or you do smaller ones you buy a bunch of $1,000,000 a year businesses and then you could bring in this technology to increase the efficiency so they're getting 50% margin you could get 70% and theirs to play books to look at if you wanted to replicate this the first is dentist is so PE right now is gobbling up dentists --is dentistry dentist dentists we have friends who are doing this yes you have like three like see ever looked into doing it and then like two other guys I think we know they love it and so what they do is they find a dentist that does two million a year in revenue and they buy the keys like 60 ready to retire in a few years and they buy it for maybe if it's like a three million dollar revenue thing they probably buy it for like a million dollars yeah but basically they'll buy it at like one I think one to two X Y bruh which is crazy yeah so basically they depend back your money in a urine yeah so they buy it for the dentist's salary right times two and they give him you know you still keep this little piece and you keep getting your salary but you don't have to run this business anymore in the sort of all the administration and marketing and they centralize it so they'll go buy ten of these dentistry's and then they'll put it'll be like okay we'll have one central office that's doing Facebook Ads driving traffic to all these we'll bring all your billing stuff into one central place cuz why do you need four people doing billing because health insurance is you know all complicated and so they centralized which makes each one more efficient and basically the dentist is already playing golf two days or three days a week and they're like look here's a you know accelerated retirement for you and the goal here is you just you kind of become a little bit of a just a marketing company and so we're well we missed the punch line though a couple of these roll-ups I think like in Canada 70% of dentists you know numbers wrong but something like that a huge percentage of the of all the dentist's office have been rolled up now in Canada and a couple of them have been taken public the roll-ups what four three billion dollars name um I don't know the names okay yeah because anyway if you want a Google dentistry roll up Canada it goes public I would do that and then the other model that you can look at for this there's old people homes nursing homes like so many P this is like so my wife's dad owns three senior care facilities yeah and so I was looking into this because I was like wow this thing is a cash cow and I think it's soul-crushing that's the problem with it because he was like hey you guys want to take this over and we were just like oh the money is there but like it sucks I don't want this to be like my life you know like I think in general people want to avoid nursing homes at all cost and so getting into it earlier than you need to it was painful but he's making money - how much does it make a month oh you know it depends on the size so basically with a bottle is you go and you you can buy an existing nursing home but what he looks for is he says okay this is existing nursing home it's got 28 beds but it's permitted for 42 and so he'll either just buy it he'll build out the other beds and so and then the other thing is he'll buy things that are motels today so Motel the room or the bed might rent for like I don't know 150 dollars a night and so that becomes let's call it four grand you know ish a month and what he does is for for senior care you're charging 7 grand 8 grand here in California for each bed and you can put two beds in a room and then you could do memory care special you know dementia ward on the bottom and that's like 12 grand and so just put all the [ __ ] up cells into it the problem is is that your upsell is a dementia award you know so it's like all right clearly a lot of money can be made you are definitely providing but there's a service to people yeah you're not scamming people right scamming people it's but it is a it's a it's a saddening business to be in yeah and so for these so we're getting off track but let's go so so my father-in-law owns a moving company in New York and it's a medium middle medium-sized business and it's done the same amount like let's say let's just say some number between 10 and 30 million in sales every single year and real profitable I go how do you make this bigger he goes I'd have to buy everyone out and I don't feel like doing I got a good life and so I would you could do that for these window things and if I was one of these uh drone window companies I would look at what you would do yeah yeah you you wouldn't necessarily go there Vesey and try to build this organically this is more of you take it you know you take some capital and you start rolling up these businesses and you already have technology for efficiency yeah and I know people who did this I put my friends from Nationals was just scam artists and they would do this for the locksmith industry they would do what and so so when you roll up the reason you roll up a company is because you want to get efficient operations specific basically if you own 20 different businesses you want to be dishing off of leads to them so they constantly have new business coming in right then and we're actually in trends we're running a report on hotels Brad is that gonna go live next week the hotel thing okay so we're gonna have a thing this is what Hilton does so they franchise out the hotels right everyone knows the Hilton brand centralize the marketing yes you said everyone knows Hilton they buy all the ads everywhere you go to hold kamaboko hotel then they dish it off to their franchisees so that's what what was I talking about to our locksmiths that's what locksmiths do in Nashville what was scary about it or you just think these guys generally dami about it is because they could rank really easily for Nashville locksmiths and they don't give you the price and then when they get there they just see how much money they can get out of here gotcha and then the locksmith who's like typically where I live there all Israelis and so they all would knew each other from Israel and they would come over and they would be like they would go to your house and you're in a pinch yeah really and it seems like the top ten Yury reviews you like the reviews and this one only okay the movies this ones are kind of good it's all the same company and they're all the same my friend owned it right and they would all it was all the same and then they wouldn't really tell you how much the price is and then you'd get there and they'd be like all right I've been checking at 200 bucks and so they've charged the lady there the customer $200 and then they would give the owner just like 20 or 30 dollars right so the owner was just a lead gen machine that's so funny when my sister had a baby and we the baby was at a party and would put the baby to sleep in this room it was like in this like the bassinet or whatever and we closed the door so there wouldn't be too much noise door gets locked baby's inside baby wakes up starts crying we realize the doors locked pretty panicking moment the window recalled one so-called locksmith right away Israeli I don't know if there's really so it's an Israeli thing this is in Francisco so maybe not maybe not as much but maybe it was person shows up it's like this is like we're indoors we're not this is not like your front door like complicated lock it's like a bedroom doorknob and they're like four hundred dollars and we were like no [ __ ] way and then they're like a chance well if they were like well it's $400 I can hear a baby crying inside don't you want to get and we were like you know just out of principle like no and then we just busted down the door with our shoulder and like got in good because that was just works outrageous no it was uh it was a good friend of mine did this he and he was from Israel and he told me he was Yale for some reason like it's a trade back in Israel and so we'll come here then we get all of our friends to come here and we dominate the market right like Indians in motels there's it's not even Indians there's a specific group of Indians Indian and Indians love million zone 70 or 80% of all motels and Dunkin donut area and actually families with the last name Patel also because they're like they're sharing there's a book about this I know what you Dennis so 98 percent of dentists I heard about this dental corporation in Canada that's it that's the so dental Corp has 168 dentists what was the revenue are they public there definitely was a three billion dollar roll up that I remember looking and then also I believe Blackrock Blackstone one of those two they or their heavy in this business now so as well maybe tomorrow or Friday let's have a roll up edition because I can list a whole bunch of companies that have done this and I'm crazy so you're saying rather than half talking about it in half knowing it we should okay gotcha okay let's move on and tomorrow we'll know everything about this industry you want to talk about uh can you scroll Henry okay so I we can talk about Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts if you want I'm interested in a little bit okay actually here's what I wanted to ask you about this is different than Boy Scout so we should talk about Boy Scouts is this zilean biers thing what happened yeah what is this okay so barstool just put a clinic on marketing on how to do marketing right okay so will tell me the story I don't know I don't get what happened barstool sports will will dumb it down barstool sports media company like ESPN or bleacher report but personality-driven and yes being after three beers base yeah it's just like comedy it's more it's like SNL it's more comedy and fiction than it is whatever journalism yeah yeah sometimes it is some mean everyone so although I have some amazing but yeah no it's it's just a bunch of like it's for the average man by the average man's but their tagline okay they have a guy he's a camera guy and Henry's a big fan so he knows to they have a guy a camera guy named Dana Dana was getting made fun of one day like 10 days ago for drinking too many beers and he set a line like he tweeted out and he said some line like I'm just a guy who drinks a zillion beers and he starts like talking about zillion beers over the course of a day and his boss Dave Portnoy was like dude you're a cameraman you're not a Content guy quit the zillion beers stuff yeah stop trying to make it a thing not try to make it thing and Dana goes Dave I bet you I can sell like thirty thousand dollars where the zillion dollar beer merch and Dave goes if you do that I'll give you 10 grand or something like that they blew past it then after a few days of this going back and forth it gets to the point of if you sell a million dollars worth of merch in the next five days I'll give you a hundred grand right he has across that he got 1.5 million and how long do you think that lesson so he created a brand essentially on the fly Zoey Peters brand called zillion beers and in ten days sold one point six million dollars in merch and throughout this process much the way in which they sold birch was pretty much all Twitter and so I was watching like as a marketing person I was looking Dana went from having a thousand followers on Twitter to whatever he has now maybe 150,000 followers on Twitter in 10 days and he would get into DRA like dry like a fights like so for example he met this girl on Twitter and she flew out and they started like talking about how they're dating now even though they just met and then the ex-boyfriend starts tweeting at him and he's like alright Mead you we're gonna get in a fight at rough and rowdy I put a hard grade online it's on that book that became a storyline there's like a dozen different story it's all just happening like a weekend basically yeah and everyone was following it in real time I didn't go out on Valentine's Day because I was just refreshing Twitter and just like reading about all of this it was amazing yeah that is amazing I saw it happening I didn't understand the full backstory yeah I I saw what happening I I don't even drink beer and I bought $150 worth of zillion beer Berg yeah just out of respect for what was going on it was great to support the cause it's like a it's like a rowdy Kickstarter that he did I love it yeah and so I think the takeaway here is like they bar still put on a clinic of like how fast you can do stuff yeah and people want to be a part of something and so it's one thing to just sell merch it's another thing to be a part of something which is like oh my god once it gets the momentum of we're going for a million holy [ __ ] we're gonna do it my boss bet against me helped me beat the man I think it like it just caught this wave of it wasn't about the merch obviously like none of it was about the merge it was about putting it into Dave's face right oh you doubted him we're all gonna get behind him and this guy Dana the guy behind it he's like a total bro but he seems like a really good person and it was fun watching him like be excited watching him win yeah and people he put his venmo out there and I've a mode him like 50 bucks people ven mode of money collectively he got like three grand and he went and blew it all out a fancy restaurant it was funny seeing like a redneck he at a steak minute have you seen this guy mr. beast do you know that is love mr. beast so if you don't know who mr. beast is he's this youtuber who's grown like crazy in the last like 18 months really no he's he's like a new guy but he's blown past how many subscribers but maybe tens of millions subscribers now and his whole thing is he's just like it just gives away money to people well like it does challenges but like he's typically he'll give away cars so for example he goes to a used car dealership and he buys ten cars which each car is probably five or ten thousand dollars right maybe he's in 40 or 50 grand on this thing and people come to buy the car and the and he acts like the salesman and the lady will be like all right this car looks good and he goes okay here and you give her the keys he goes no it's yours right and they film it and this the reaction it's kind of like that like it has a feel-good element to it cuz you see people who are like no way like what it's guilty he'll go to a restaurant and leave a two thousand dollar tip on a $10 bill and they're like people break down crying and then sometimes it's funny where he'll be like he'll take four frames he'll buy a Lambo and be like put your hand on this Lambo first person last person to have their handle this Lambo keeps the Lambo and they just for two days straight they just have their hand on this thing they're passing out and they you know he met he turns onto YouTube content and he's brilliant because he gets brands to pay for the whole thing so this one brand quit are quid or quick it's not the toothbrush it's like this like stickers trading cards thing online at least quid quid has given this guy you know they'll just put up the 50k he does the challenge he spouts out quid and they're happy for it because their videos are getting like millions of views and so it's way better branded content than usual and so he basically took brand money and parlayed it into being like huge which is pretty crazy yeah and he even do a thing where he raised a hundred million twenty million dollars for trees trim plant a tree and the founder of Shopify game 100 or sorry a million Elon gave a million yeah and he raised 20 million dollars in two weeks yeah and I have a friend who talked to him on the phone the other day to do a campaign and he was like what friend Jason said Jason Hitchcock shoutout to Jason so he was like you know talking to him and he when he kind of phone he's like yeah I talked to mr. B he's really cool like talk to his agent or whatever and he described he's like you know one weird thing happens which is didn't plan for this you know sort of success you get the success but the YouTube game is such that you kind of need to top yourself every time you probably getting exhaust and so he's like dude the stress of like okay we gave away a Lambo through this like crazy thing next week what do I do like okay it's just this constant bar raising which is really tough so when we first launched our company I get a phone call from Elizabeth Murdoch you know who is Rupert Murdoch's daughter yeah okay it's just a big shot and she was like hey you guys want to do these videos I'm launching this new thing and I need video content and I was like no that's not what we're trying to do but let's say friends and shoot the [ __ ] and she goes okay well I'll find someone else so she finds someone else to do it and they started a YouTube channel and that YouTube channel is now called yes theory I heard it yes they heard of it yeah they got five or six million subscribers and I've become friends with them over the years and they have a I mean they're like famous so like legit famous I don't I have no idea if it's a good business but I bet you they make they could each pay themselves a million dollars a year so pretty good for young people pretty good for anyone and each week they're having to do crazy and crazy [ __ ] and they've had to do this for three years now every video is like I went to the most remote island in the world rabbi cellar head it's three guys now and they're like taking turns over doing crazy [ __ ] like it's the crazy stuff was like I asked my uber driver if she wants to go to Paris and we went straight to Paris and went there and now they're like doing variations of that it's like oh my god it's like jackass if Stevo and the Jackass crew had YouTube and like they would have to do this every week like we were just lucky that they were lucky that the cadence was like you know seasons of TV or a movie because when it's weekly it's just insane which is why Casey nice tat and Logan Paul Jake Paul all these guys eventually pieces you know they do this daily grind for so long but they burn out like the content burn out is crazy for sure it's not gonna happen to us though well it's not gonna happen to us we just sit and do nothing and I don't like having to get on a plane and like or like Logan Paul you gotta like yell at someone or like go break up with a girlfriend every week I'm gonna go box someone yeah so I got a Rupert Murdoch story because you said Murdoch I'm so impressed with this dude so he gets a lot of hate because like his business practices and whatnot people think he's like a tyrant in a way he is and like the show success succession is basically about their family good show so we had this opportunity to pitch Rupert Murdoch so Michael who's my investor comes to me he says hey we got invited to this thing basically every year during CES Rupert Murdoch brings all the CEOs of his companies through News Corp so they own Wall Street Journal I think or you're a New York Post at Vox and Skye and then they own penguin publishing right I own realtor.com so he is the media mogul right like that's cool so basically once a year they all get together it's during CES they go to the Wynn and they rent out the entire top floor of Wynn and so all the rooms there are all the execs and they have the biggest suite the penthouse suite of the Wynn and what they do is they and I really admire this they go from 8 a.m. to about 7 p.m. every single day for two days straight and every hour is just they just bring in a speaker not like a speaker it's like a an industry leader from something and they just they just grill them so it's like you you start by just telling me a little bit about your business and there's 30 minutes of Q&A from the CEOs of all these companies because they're trying to figure out okay how do we play into this so when I was there it was like literally CEO of Google CEO of slack number three guy at Facebook just back-to-back-to-back the CEO of Google was the one getting grilled yeah he would go and he was explained here's what here's where we're going next year because these are big media partners for them they they want to have these media partners working with them so they'll say here's what we're going next year and but it's off the record right so it's more candid than you're ever gonna get these guys and I they told me you can just come for your slot you know this 45 minutes lot but rupert's there though but I was like I'm sitting here the whole day like this is why I didn't sit there because we were gonna present at the end of the day and so we had access I just sat there at 8:00 a.m. I'm there with my seat so here's what I noticed during the day a lot of the CEOs you know they'd be interested in certain people but for the most part you know they get hungry they go to the bathroom Rupert Murdoch I don't how old he is guys like 80s like he looks old and he is old and that guy sat right up front with a paper and a pencil did not get up did not take a he was the mostess didn't take a piss he was the most attentive he asked the best questions he was like a machine and I was like that's why this guy's Rupert Murdoch I was so impressed by this guy he's just endurance really and also just his level of focus where everybody else was wandering throughout the day cuz that's what you normally do and that's kind of contagious did he ask what I loved how the leader was like on point because it held everybody else like closer to that standard did he ask questions yes good questions yeah what's funny cuz if you're the CEO of one of his companies already maybe a billion some of them might be billion M Europe you're you're up there I don't know but yeah you may be doing super well if you felt I could be like your it was like the CEO of Fox Studios like oh yeah we make these movies for this year and it's like oh whatever you know Marvel like it's like these are big individual brands you're you're a big you're a big swing and dick yeah big guy so that was incredible I just thought that was really cool and I gotta give him props for that it was very impressed that's crazy okay a different one that's related what you learn from that thing anything else trying to think about what else was important I think another piece that was that was cool there was setting his company up for success cuz the media business I mean a lot of his stuff was he literally started with newspapers local newspapers and so very easily companies like that can miss all these shifts and become like extinct I think one of the reasons they haven't is because it probably has this learning culture and sounds corny but what he did was pretty badass was like we're here we're not gonna go tell these guys what what what the world is we're gonna be the listener we're gonna be the student here and and so I thought that was pretty badass that he set up he architected these days which was just you know action-packed with like top top people of the world coming and teaching them about the future and even us like why did he have us he had four startup slots you know there's all big companies they have four startup slots we were one of the starters thought you guys was right by him yeah cuz it was like okay you guys are doing something interesting was when we were doing blab it was like okay tell us about the future you're not big yet but you're growing and we think you're interesting and so tell us what you know that the big companies don't know and they would ask questions like very good questions like like that like what is the if we're us one of the questions he asked was what is what are we stupid for not doing like when you look at our business what do you look at you just say you are stupid for not doing this this is our Enterprise version of trends Brad is having that nice Cyrus that's what I learned from these guys I thought was pretty awesome guy that's badass who are the other three companies one was Alfred the skim was there oh are you told me I told you about this because I was sitting there Fox is an investor of the skin yeah yeah I was yes cool in fact I heard the guys in the back because I was sitting at the back when that was happening is like probably not the people who were doing it or they weren't investors at the time and they were just like like they were like yeah this is cool and all but and they were just like ragging on it in the back cuz they were just like look you know here's what the numbers are here's where it's not big enough yet for it to matter to us and but Rupert at the front was kind of like what do we not know like about this business he wasn't it's easy if we were a huge conglomerate to just look at everything and say you're small you mean nothing and that's what the guys in the back were doing but at the front Rupert was sort of like email interesting tell me more and like was going through these like you know you could tell he was searching for what he doesn't know rather than the guys at the back thinking they know everything and not really being open to learning something new from the people who are talking crazy Henry can you go tell him to quit making the dog park I could tell it's someone saying can you scroll this down yeah it's cool scroll that down and then tell them to my [ __ ] dog's bargain I know that it's like et like saying you know you want some food speak so he shot you could edit this go down to the list of ideas okay a little bit further or can you just shrink it a little bit there should be way more before you had others like a huge gap before you had the the auctions that's right that's fine okay deshaun we're back when did that part out so one other idea that's similar to something we were talking about earlier is this revenge against the spam calls have you heard about this yeah I tried to write about this last year because I bought one of these apps robocall yeah Babel caller amazing I did research on it huge business and that one of the reasons I know it's huge is because I did research on them and I try to find everything and immediately I knew it was gonna be big because it was so hard to find information on them so tell me what that business what what explain what they do first and I'll tell you about what this new guys doing that is interesting this one I think it was based in New Jersey they have many different apps one of them being Robo visor I think it's called and users like me pay maybe 50 bucks a year and if someone calls that's clearly a spammer it goes straight to their voicemail or if it is a suspicious one it just says on my voicemail it's suspicious like right this is a spoof call right and so I know to avoid and so so that existed and there's company called true caller that's huge internationally that does this true caller caller is like a universal caller ID we should do an Android untrue caller it's like it's like a whatsapp's it's gonna be like a whatsapp size to exit I think or like you know that's multiple billions of dollars on this thing called true color and it's not that relevant in the u.s. because we don't have the same problems if you have internationally with not knowing phones people switch phone numbers all the time there dude I get 10 spam calls a day so Apple started doing this but what this guy is doing is interesting so so this guy Joshua he has this company called do not pay I love this I signed up for it so I do not pay for those don't know is he follows me on Twitter so we'll make sure he sees this yeah so do not pay school so basically it's like you get a [ __ ] parking ticket so you know like you can actually contest a lot of these because either they filled out the form wrong and therefore you don't have to pay or technically you're just wrong you don't have to pay so it doesn't work as good as you think though and I'll tell you why there used to be a company called fix it yep and I knew people invested in it I used it in the way it would work is you would register your license and anytime your car got a parking ticket before you even got to your car the app told you and they automatically fought fought the ticket in San Francisco court and you would pay fix it half the price whatever you got back out of your yeah and they it would be fun they would always get it reduced right it was awesome San Francisco outlawed it it was just cramming the system right so these guys do something instead of a start it off with that which is you could fight tickets but it's like what else can we do what else is like they call themselves sort of Robin Hood they're trying to sort of take money and give it back to the and the guys like twenty years old very young gets a ton of press with this very smart that's how he grows but they have other use cases for example they have a credit credit card that you can use that automatically cancel your free trials so how much privacy calm offers that it's great product right and then they have a couple other ones one is where that were they they can test what is it they they've a couple they look for different things that they can test the new one that they came out with is we still get spam calls and so what they do is twofold there's this thing called the Do Not Call list or whatever they do not call registry and so they what if you download their app what they'll do is they'll sign your for the Do Not Call Registry but the problem is spammers don't care about the Do Not Call Registry they just call you anyways because they know that you're not going to take the time to like go and you know enforce this you're not gonna go fight you figure it out so then they ought to first they put you on the registry then when you get a spam call they give you a little credit card to give to the spammer and the scammer and when they give when they use those details they automatically generate paperwork to sue them for three grand and so there's like you can sue for three grand everytime they commit this mistake and so what they're doing is they're automating v like three thousand dollar lawsuit for for this robo call for this BAM call thing I just think it's a very smart model of like saving people money through these small hacks I like this do not know this guy has that's a great segment that we should go through more of small hacks that make big differences this guy what's his name Joshua something I think he's 21 he raises money from Peter teal a substantial amount 10 million maybe maybe yeah okay bullish or yeah bullish I think these are good I think there's enough people that are that don't want to be ripped off in music five ways they have like five things they can defend against and one of those is gonna be like a repeatable use case that that's gonna work okay I would say that I am bullish on the industry bullish on the product ideas the guy Josh seems like a loose cannon yeah which really usually goes the bad way but the great outliers end up being right massive and he's getting a ton of PR because he is what you're talking about he loves to go and champion the cause he's great for media the [ __ ] so he gets a bunch of free PR he's a huge controversial things yeah okay so on that note I have a note up here that says what Charlie Munger said about Elon Musk so it's directly related to what you just said so somebody was asking Charlie Munger hey you know what are your thoughts on Tesla what are your thoughts on Elon Musk because it's one of the most like polarizing companies he's one of those polarizing CEOs and so here's what he said I want to know if you agree with this or not so he goes he first said you know I wouldn't long or short the stock I think it's a great product and he said my most important comment was this you guys never underestimate the man who overestimates himself I think Elon Musk is peculiar in that he may overestimate himself but he's not wrong all the time and when he's right he seems to be right very big and and so he said that was the first thing I like that quote never underestimate the man who overestimates himself and then the second thing he said was they said would you hire Elon as one of your CEOs for a Berkshire Hathaway company and he goes no never he goes I want the guy who understands his limitations instead of the guy who doesn't you know I've learned this lesson in life that these weird guys who over it estimate this up they occasionally knock it out of the park but me personally I don't want to be around a guy around somebody who's in a lose lives in a state of delusion and who occasionally happens to win big I want a prudent person so I want to know your opinions on this I feel like you're gonna have a guy like I just said exactly that yeah so when I try to hire sometimes certain people I'm like a loose cannon here could work like I basically like you hang out with a lot of these guys like I love the wild card these like hackers cuz at Sean's old office it had an apartment and there he would meet a guy in the Internet and literally five days later the guy would fly from Germany and basically live in that apartment and literally it would never leave oh yeah I could see like yeah that German kid yeah ooh I bet you he could have been in that apartment for five days and he maybe only brought a book bag and a teacher right and then he overstayed his visa everything is crazy so I like those types of people yeah I for sure like them and I like being around them I don't trust any of them I expect that they will do mostly nothing but the one or two times that they pull through it's gonna be massive massive so I for you yourself would you say you're more in the bucket of you know kind of the delusional type who overestimates and themself but sometimes knocks it out of the park or you more the prudent pragmatic person who takes a realistic view and is sort of a steady hand and running a company which type are you that's a good question or do you have both gears I think what do you think Adam is clearly the second type right Adam is clearly the the pragmatic diligent steady hand not look not trying to swing for homeruns full-time I would say occasionally I'm fine betting at all if my business goes away entirely tomorrow because we bet it I wouldn't be upset so I would say I am closer to that wildcard one but not entirely right and then with hiring people it sounds like you hire mostly for I think naturally you hire mostly for the prudent steady hands it's a ratio so I think you need a few of these loose lose lose loose cannons right and that's where cool stuff comes out of but most of the stuff that they come up with is really dumb and stupid right and there's also an art to managing a wild card your firkin it's a wild card he's a wild card for sure and he's steady and he you know what I did with him he's not emotional and I'll bet it all we hired him and within a few like weeks I was like hey this guy is amazing and B this guy's a wild card like I can't handle him like I can handle most people in the company and so I said I literally separated him I was like look you need to work with people who are like you because when you work with these people they're gonna drive you crazy because they're so steady they're nine to five there are no highs no lows you're just getting what you get and I was like you will hate that style and so I said I want you to hire your own team and only you do the interviews nobody else is gonna give their input like or you make the decision you know there's a CTO you can hire outside what the CTO wants which was like pretty controversial at the time so I was like you hire your own team he hired all people who had either dropped out never went to school these hacker types that were just be up all night he'll because he knows how to manage the wild cards and so he hired a team of while hours basically I love those people so if you have them in your team or your company like make sure you're not just treating them the way you will because they will be very frustrated and you won't be getting the value of their like potential my friend Jack Jack my best friend Jack Smith he's one of them solos coming for 800 million dollars six months ago he got all the money I was like we couldn't do a thing he's like I think I'm gonna go and put all it like in some major bat he was like yeah I'm about to go buy that like and he had done that even before he sold that money he had a fair bit of money but he not that much in that but he didn't have any income right on a consistent basis he would bet all of it like at least once a month he would literally have like a few thousand dollars to his name yeah and seven figures on some like short or we gotta get Jack and consistently he always did that I I know I don't think that I take risky investment no I don't think my in are I don't think I'm that risky I put like 10 or 20 percent of my liquid assets into very very very high risk things where it's just probably gonna go to zero I don't think that's crazy yeah that's not too crazy especially given the age and earning potential you have going for yeah I don't I'll do some crazy stuff but no I mean I know people that will literally empty their bank account one thing right you have any friends like that um yeah I have I have friends it's not so much like empty their bank account on things but I have friends that once they get to conviction like sue Lee is like this and we should we should have him join us one of these times but he's the type where when he has conviction in something the question is not like he did he breaks all the rules if he's like usual investing and he'll go and try to like plow the money in own as much as he can create a competitor to it you know like he went when he gets his mind into something and he believes there's an opportunity he goes like into hunting mode like I remember we were investing in lamb to school and I brought this deal to the table and I was like hey I think it's great for these reasons and I set up the call and like but once he got to conviction you know the the CEO would be like hey yeah you're in I'm gonna send you the docs in a couple days and silly-- would ask me he's like where those docks let's get those docks let's text him again let's call him and I didn't realize like I think part of it is like as an investor it's easy to get squeezed out you never know what's going on so you're sort of an old state of paranoia but the other part was like when he knows what he wants he goes for it at a degree that I wasn't used to and then once I saw it I was like okay that's how you're supposed to go for these things well speak kind of Munger he once said he goes all I do is find in companies that I can invest in that required no diversification like the perfect investment is one where you don't you don't you don't do any divert diversifying you put all of it into that one and I always am looking for those which you normally will never find one but you try to find ones close to it yeah because they go for value investing so they go for essentially what they consider a sure bet where it's already the value is already baked into what it is I don't do bet on the future I'm getting it at such a mispriced moment that like yeah I want to take as much as I can of that asset because I'm I'm already sure it's worth that today and there's just mispriced by the market good what time is it all right you wanna do one more yeah so the spam calls thing was awesome I think we should do a case study in a couple of these some of them are big like tens of millions of dollars business emoted true caller true call excel on trends you go to transact go and sign up and we will have a case study on this in the next week or so and so you had something's at the top so we get well we could talk about we could talk about I think we should talk about this chest thing real quick cuz I think it's a good it's a good example business of a mistake a lot of people make some behind this exact thing one second so chess biz 12,000 mr are on 90 kids okay where'd you get this so in the in the Facebook group that my first million Facebook group somebody posted this so somebody pre off they posted is that hey I'm a 20 rolled college nearly drop out here I run my chest tutor calm my chest atutor calm it's an online chess academy we currently have about 90 weekly students it's doing 12 and a half km or our growth has been slow and as you can imagine chess is not really like this you know super wide sort thing its niche question he's like I really want to learn about a new high income scale or take on another high potential project but I'm not sure where to start you know I just feel like I'm capped out here and this was like such a you're not capped out yeah this was a mistake I would have made when I was 20 and so immediately I was like are you joking buying the business so it's a my chess tutor calm it's basically a coaching Academy for chess players young chess players and just doing 12 and a half thousand Omata they pay what's that you pay for the training basically is it like a digital training or you have a coach I don't know if it's I think it's coach I think they match you with a I think you know there's some revenue split here but I would say this you're 20 years old you have this chess thing that only on 90 students which is like 90 is basically zero you're doing 12 and a half K a month which is like extremely respectable for a 20 year old person who's been doing this thing chess is a niche yes but it's way bigger than ninety and in some of the comments here somebody was like hey like just so you know like the US national you know elementary chess tournament has 2,500 players that's the tournament that's a 2-1 tournament that's elementary school just us and so like you're not capped out by any means I mean do you think that this guy could get 5,000 people to pay for this yes totally I totally agree so what's uh what's the difference what's that revenue if he gets 5,000 people I mean let's just do that here soon and we get made fun of on the spot math sucks while you're doing the math Jason Lumpkin who's an advisor to me won't famous enough it's not famous but he says it and he told me he goes if you can get to 10 million in revenue you can get to 100 million in revenue right there's these benchmarks if he says I think if you get to 1 you can get there's a high chance you get to 10 if you get to 10 there's a high chance you get to 100 it may take a long time right it takes a long time but you want to do it and his thing is I don't sell early and this is basically saying don't quit early so what's it don't get a TD okay okay make it 140 bucks per kid and if you had five thousand students enrolled in this you're doing about seven hundred grand a month a monthly revenue as you know an online chess school and I believe this is achievable 100% now the question is rarely like a million a year can this be big enough typically it's do I raise money or not in this case rate if you are gonna raise money make sure it's under a million dollars yeah because likely don't raise anything yeah don't raise anything and if you could own this business and pay yourself five million dollars a year yeah and and also the question is like how do you get bigger because probably it's what you're doing the reason you're getting shiny object syndrome and trying to look for a new business idea is because you can't you don't figure out you don't know how to make more progress in this one and so you need to get with somebody who's a little bit smarter than you like I'll help you just message they do a session I'm going to the website know is it good looking as some of you wants to sell it yeah actually you're capped out [ __ ] it you should all this to me for 10 grand worthless okay here's the site you get business I think you should bail like what flex debate okay debate yeah this is what I'm gonna do I'm gonna dominate the grade school in a high school market with you so chess debate spelling bee spelling bee oh my god this is it yeah this is it yeah we're gonna call it extracurricular Inc and we're gonna dominate this it's gonna call it be called overbearing parent and over but yeah helicopter tiger mom Inc right and we are gonna this is awesome who's this guy what's his name i pre-op I think in the Facebook group so shoutouts pre-op get good food for thought and don't don't quit man do not quit this is awesome if you need help right yeah I don't know if you could hear Brad but he just put some good info basically sharing how big he wants to it and once in any money and wants this to be a cash flow thing I love this I'm very interested yeah I would invest if I'm getting like a monthly dividend but not if I didn't great idea another great one from the Facebook group was this restaurant refills thing I don't if you saw this so somebody basically said and I should find their name but they basically were like hey I own 14 kind of venues I don't know if it's bars restaurants something like that and they were like dude you know I pay Aramark $1,000 per month per location just to refill my toilet paper my hand you know like the bathroom like the toilet paper cut the toilet cover seats thing like just these like stock goods how big is it a thousand dollars a month per location for him how much revenue does ef I don't know he didn't share too much about his thing but he basically said he's refilling it every one to two weeks from them and so so so basically that one of the ideas here was if you were doing restaurant refills Cisco and air market these giant companies that do this service and they're they're very very big and I wonder if you could go in as a local player and differentiate on one of these one of the following levels a just not shitty service because air mark and Cisco are so big they're almost certainly giving shitty service to your average venue by now the other one is price and so like can you create a co-op or a group buying vehicle so that a bunch of restaurants say hey we're tired of paying $1,000 a month for this instead we'll pay $100 a month membership fees but get all of our goods at cost instead of with the markup and so you can have a membership model for that or you do something where you actually provide like a better service you know better quality products in some way like more higher-end stuff then than these things but I thought that was a good kind of like love these ideas where it just makes you think I'm not gonna go run and do these ideas but you start to see the world differently where you walk into it next time you go into a restaurant bathroom and you see the toilet seat cover you're gonna realize yeah this restaurant paid for this and somebody's restocking their toilet maker yeah I always see him it's called like American made it's a billion dollar we should look into them you want to know another one real quick Otis elevators right total monopoly on elevators been around for a hundred years family-owned probably makes hundreds of millions of dollars a year in profit YKK zippers well I told you about YKK zippers didn't I know I mean I just I just noticed in high school all of my zippers say YKK yeah and then the really good what do you know about them I don't know anything so I collect vintage leather jackets if it's a YKK then you can tell what year it's on a Talon zipper is even higher n so if it's a talons if it's really good right and that same category is a white cone denim so if it's from cone mill it's a great denim Factory in Raleigh North Carolina and so YKK Talon and cone mill denim it's like the high-end stuff that is the it's the accessories to all the high-end stores right and so they're just factories that have been around for 150 years and will probably exist for another fifty or hundred years you said you collect leather jackets I collect leather jet vintage leather jackets and denim how many do you have probably ten thousand dollars worth of leather jackets and probably five grand worth of vintage denim that I don't wear and I just I wear them sometimes okay so we'll do this as the last one the top thing we had on our list was this uh my heritage auction it's like auction place which I assume is for collectors and this is so foreign to me because Indian people don't collect like I'm not gonna collect an American I think like if I go to my aunt's house there's no art on the wall yeah tell me about collecting and how does companies doing 850 million in auctions this year I will tell you okay so in 2008 there was this guy who had a TV show called American Pickers have you seen American Pickers okay at the time have you heard of it I've heard of it but I thought at the time it was the second most popular show on cable it was number two behind Pawn Stars which is similar and the guy's name on the show was named Mike wall and I was a huge fan of mics and when I lived in Nashville I saw Mike walking down the street and I walked up to him I go Mike what's up man let me get a picture if you look on my facebook you see the picture I start shooting the [ __ ] with them and I'm like Mike let me work with you somehow and so turns out Mike is opening up a store Nashville and he lets me help set him up and work there and so what American Pickers does is they go to old barns typically in the South but barns people's hoarders homes not hoarders I mean it's not junk we call it junk it's not really junk it's like old motorcycles old cars neat stuff that's me old yeah and we'll buy it for $100 insult for five hundred dollars will buy an old car for five thousand dollars sell for twenty and I ran the store where we would keep a lot of the cool stuff I mean at this point he made so much off the TV show he just wanted to collect the [ __ ] because people love collecting it I would get people that would fly in from Australia just to touch an old gas pump the collectors were fanatical I would sell old gas pumps that don't work and are only for decorations and people be like is that gas pump the Model A or is that one the models see like they knew their art school maybe they would pay three grand because it's [ __ ] awesome I would buy that stuff I have signs that cost a thousand dollars a Mobil gas sign only just to look at it's cool because it's part of history and here's the even best part if you clean it or repaint it or try to make it nicer it loses all its value right it has to have patina on it the stuff with the good patina is best so if you have an old car and there's routine I mean patina it's like when you have a pair of jeans so like basically Levi's changed how they made jeans in the 1950s so any pair of Levi's jeans prior to before 1950 they used raw denim and the more you Wharram it would get these cool lines in them and that and the lines are called patina I so wear and tear and so a pair of Levi's pre like before they made that change to their modern process cost fifteen hundred dollars and if it has cool patina and it'll be two grand I see and so if it has any of this patina in it it's really valuable and so me myself if I find a shot jacket which is a brand a shot jacket my favorite air is the 1950s with the red liner or a buco jacket I'll drop 1,000 a 2,000 on it all day and so where did you buy these things online ever or no impress you you you can't buy them on eBay so what I used to do is I used to find jackets in America that were from the 1950s and I would put them on the eBay in the Koreans and Japanese would buy them because this a 44 from the 1950s in America is no longer a modern 44 it only fits littler guys particularly the Japanese and Koreans and they [ __ ] love that American that American [ __ ] they love it right and so I would I used to sell all my stuff on eBay but eBay wasn't the best marketplace for it so now there's a lot of niche market places and you're talking about which one you scroll up which marketplace top heritage auctions rayj.com here to talk ins auctions I've never heard of that up higher all the way up so they did 850 million dollars they said their biggest category is coins is it coins and I was like oh my god people spending tens of millions of dollars on like thousands of dollars worth of course by some points I own hundreds of dollars of coins to go down more and own coins yeah don't you think that I'm stupid do you think this is cool scroll up there it is it's awesome I love it so movie posters yeah so I own some movie posters so I live in San Francisco so I don't have too much room but if I lived in Austin Texas where offices I would have a warehouse and it would be full of stuff right now blows my might now I'm in the market for a 1995 Corvette which is and it's it's like compared to modern cars it's not that good but it's it's like a cool year right I'll probably pay twenty fifteen to twenty grand for it I get the cars thing I even kind of gets the the clothing jackets boo these are Red Wing boots i buy them for a very particular type of reason I own a pair of boots that are like the same brain but from the 1950s and it costs $800 I don't wear them they just sit there and I look at them and you feel good it's like a museum and the coins one that those are the ones where I'm just like what this is only get popular here's why I'm so bullish on this okay so you have some money now what was popular when you were let's just let's just imagine that you're 50 now yeah because nostalgia will be more important I think but what will you what would you let's see what categories of things what if I showed you a cassette tape a VHS tape unopened of home alone one of my favorite movies great okay how much would you pay for that right now zero dollars a lot I like to have now okay as art okay yeah I guess I would I guess I would do that I guess I see you there how much would you pay for that VH it's unopened completely unopened I mean I probably wouldn't buy a blessing I'm imagining I'm in that mother and $40 I'm yeah i pay 30 40 bucks to just have it there it's a talking point in the room okay now let's fast-forward 30 years would you pay $300 if you could find an unopened VHS tape and you have kids and I hope I don't this is a note to me when I'm 50 don't do it bro put you under jail by the point it's cool right it's cool okay I get it let's do another one what's a car you don't like cars is there anything okay here's another example that came up the guy who started oculus Palmer Luckey he's bidding online he tweeted this out he's like who is bidding against me so he was bidding 260 grand to buy this rare thing which was a it was a Nintendo made a playstation or something like that it's the made by nice anybody is a PlayStation I don't even what this is I don't want to look into it I don't want to research it's awesome he's like who the hell is bidding this up I'm at 260 grand surely there's no other nerd that wants this pissed I bought a pair of snapchat snapchat spectacles I've never even used them they're sitting it in my drawer right over here Oh future remember I was sitting there yeah I'm just holding I'm holding on to them my own little area about the Elon Musk flamethrower okay that's cool just never hope just don't even open it a lot of people just don't even over just sit there and it's just cool to have and then maybe in 30 years would you pay two or three or four or five thousand dollars for that maybe yes maybe this is why I'm saying it's awesome I think nostalgia is big money so maybe there's a company so just to turn this into an idea hey I think this is interesting and there's a whole brainstorm around how do you tap into either nostalgia or collectors and the fanaticism that they exhibit but a quick idea here is you've seen these these apps got like goat and and stock X like these like streetwear market places so goat is like a mobile only way to buy you know sneakers it's like I'm gonna buy these Yeezys for two grand I'm gonna buy these rare drawer for $1,800 and so I tweeted this out or retweeted this list of top hundred marketplaces by gmv so by gross merchandise volume and then goat was like whatever in the top twenty and you know that's how kids are basically spending that much on these like cool sneakers and the sneaker heads are spending so much and so I wonder if you could do a mobile like what they did was just make a slick mobile only marketplace for these rare items I wonder if you could do that and pick your favorite movie posters coins whatever clearly there's a lot of demand and it's just about making sort of a modern-day marketplace because if you go to this h8 com it literally looks like what I imagine a coin collector looks like then I'll imagine a website it looks like that it looks like a 75 year old you know website that never leaves it's bad I think this shit's gonna be way more popular with young people I think that what I would do is okay like what if I have a like I'm not poor now what what did that what was I into when I was like five six seven eight years old like I'll see whatever goosebumps and yeah slime from Nickelodeon if I saw the entire collection of goosebumps unopened I would love to buy that and just have it sit here yeah that's actually pretty cool okay I would buy that you see what I'm saying this how it works right or like imagine you grew up with like I feel like you're explaining collecting to me which anyone listens gonna be like duh what the [ __ ] but I really do feel that way I'm like what is motivating people to spend hundreds of thousands dollars I saw one of the posters movie are some one of the comics that was that just sold for 70 grand it's a one page of a comic and I'm like who is this person with too much money that is spending 70 grand on this one page a lot of people it's a lot of people and it's not 70 grand you have to think if someone's rich enough to spend 70 GS on this thing it's just like you spending $10 on earth right are you buying $100 $100 home alone thing it's like it's kind of a lot of money but like who cares it's fun right I also wonder if there's a market for for first dibs so like let's say you're coming out with something an album or whatever movie why aren't these companies selling the first like who wants the first copy ever made of this who wants the first hook great and just auctioned the first tibs and create a company that it up yeah just on the spot dude that's what I do I'm the [ __ ] Magic Man and so you you you create this first dibs thing because then you create new inventory that doesn't even exist yet you sell it today it comes out in miniature and I love it like crazy for this first dibs okay that's good we can leave on that oh no real quick so Sean and I are doing this all the time but I always have to plug this if you like doing this on your own time you got to go to trends Co doc wait trends that Co and buy a trend subscription and I think what we did was trends deco slash million and you'll see a big discount and I'll tell you one thing the sleep report you guys did I don't that was pretty interesting because you see these things that get hype but then you see the actual data it's like meditation gets all this hype watch how sleep is growing about how the sleep interest is growing and all the different products that go around that from beds to pillows to anti snoring to sleep aids to whatever so I like that article a lot and the group I've said this a million times like all the values in the group the group is amazing and I I really enjoyed so sign up but we'll keep doing this anyway

when they moved out they are making something like five or six hundred million dollars a year revenue when we started our company when I started this company the first office that I had did you ever go to that one I've been to it okay Craigslist so the first office I had we didn't have a lot of money and I moved we I started me and see Avon my friend week week old least in office in the Inner Sunset which is a non popular neighborhood in San Francisco but it's lovely it just looked like an apartment it was a house that they that was zoned mixed-use and when we went to visit it there was a sign that said Craigslist 1996 to 2000 and whenever we moved in 15 or 16 or 17 I forget my portion of the rent was $500 which was a lot of money at the time and because we had just said the business we only were making 30 grand a month and we move in and there was a desk still in one of the rooms and this was like a it wasn't a shitty apartment but it kind of was a shitty apartment yeah it was a three bedroom apartment less than 1,000 square feet and I move in and Craig from Craigslist Craig Newark he actually left his desk there and his desk was a kitchen table that was his desk but it was too heavy to move and so he just covered there so that's what I use and the Landlord I came in his name was Emanuel I believe he came in and I was like hey so crazy see here he's like yeah Craig started the oh he lived on the street in coal Valley he started the company here from 96 up until recently I go oh what was that like this again they're kind of like little celebrities in the neighborhood everyone knew about him and at a time when they moved out they were making something like five or six hundred million dollars a year president and this a whole apartment my half of the rent was five hundred dollars see Amos was like mm so we pitch one hundred dollars and it could only see at most 12 people probably and that was extreme that was the Craigslist team and I go home or they lightens I call they were a cool Craig told every one of you tippy interest like you might talk to me and I'd be like pretty what's your job here he would say he owns it but he's the founder he would say I need customer service for Craigslist nice and they were so DISA they were so cheap and frugal that in the lease it said something like Emmanuel had to give them pull up paper each month and every once in a while he would forget or not bring it one time and they wouldn't pay the rent until he got the toilet paper yeah if you just close your eyes and imagine the Craigslist website and then start to imagine an apartment or a house it looked like that it looked like the UI of the site yeah and if you google Craigslist office you'll see photos of it they had a big sign on it it was great and did you repeat him yeah so I hold the email them Craig and we talked back and forth I thought we were fun a little bit and I was like hey can you come and take a picture with me at the office and he never made it over but we did talk and I we correspond everyone so long it was awesome and all I'm doing to build how Craigslist makes money they make money only from jobs jobs is in cars all in certain markets yeah and then everything else free they make like five million dollars a year that way and they've never bought a company they only employ at this point probably thirty people so they just must it must be one most profitable companies in the world [Music]

we've been working together I don't know five six years now maybe six seven years getting towards seven I think it's one of those things where you just keep saying five years and you know no matter how long it's been but he has an interesting background before that very good background you want to give us like the give the highlights the highlights I grew up here in the Bay Area I got started just programming as a kid and so I had a unique experience where I worked at a.com when I was fifteen and that was kind of like well you're going to high school at the time or did you drop out I was going to high school I had just finished my sophomore year and I was really into computers and my dad was like hey I know this guy they need to hire some people they're looking to make like a website at the time they had a router for hotel rooms so it was like hotels wanted to put in DSL and kind of like good internet they're like oh you got a we needed this interface like the Linksys interface for your router now just the HTML side of things yeah an HTML at the time was really nothing it was like you could put some stuff and I showed my dad how to make a menu and he was like wow this is a groundbreaker there's no JavaScript how much were you gettin pay that 15 to do this uh if I had worked the whole year would have been about 120 km boom comm boom probably because they're hiring 15 year olds but right and then that happens then you did an e-commerce thing yeah and so that company didn't work out obviously spending money paying fifteen year old hunter 20k exactly and so I kind of was back at high school and then I'm bored and I'm really into computers and gaming and you know I had this idea that like hey people like to kind of trick out their cars like they like to put lights and you know fun things in their car like why don't people do this with the computers people are really passionate about it and so I looked it up and I found some forums online and people were doing this it's just there was nowhere to buy things there's nowhere to do things especially here in the US so I started a ecommerce store kind of accidentally I was like oh like these things are really expensive if I buy them in bulk I just get them cheaper also awesome I'll have some more cash on the side and I think we started eight hundred bucks of stuff in the corner garage and then within the first year we did a million dollars of Revenue Wow and it was like how old were you Oh 17 so Lee Shin high school at the time and so that was pretty crazy because it went from you know one corner of the garage to full three-car garage to living room family room like there's boxes everywhere my parents were super supportive of this obviously and so that was kind of the early days I would say and then we'll fast forward because there's a lot more of the story but we'll do the highlights so if I'm listen to this you know whenever I ask people over their background really what I'm trying to say is you people a sense of who you are and also it's kind of just like credibility said why should you be interesting what I'm you're trying to make you're trying to impress people yeah it's like this is the time to basically brag so I'll brag for you because you're a pretty humble guy you don't brag a lot so the other interesting parts are took a couple years off played poker professionally kind of in Europe traveling around that was fun when you came back did your own startup failed but then the next startup which you started with Adam and a couple other guys you guys tried and failed on a bunch of IT guys I think it probably nine ideas yeah it was about nine ideas across two or three years that we tried kind of you know one idea would see it was real serious we tried that for about nine months so then you're going through like three months chunks of like really bad right ideas and attempts and then and my favorite anecdote of this whole time because I think this is very very you don't hear people talk about this was sometimes when you guys were in between ideas or you just were it wasn't working what did you do you'd come to the office knew what I mean literally that's what you guys did at Monkey inferno we were due for like an hour these guys were just like that was the day did you think that was weird like Adam and those guys had had success I've part of you was probably like look if if these successful guys think this is all right this can't be too bad but like I would be anxious if we were doing that um there was some anxiety but they were super calm and collected so that well why am I worried well so Adam was a pretty wealthy yeah he previously worked on a couple of ad tech companies and they had grown to be pretty big I would say like no one was worth maybe 50 million and you know the one before that might have been in that range too and so he had done some stuff John who is the other co-founder there had worked at like VMware and he had worked at at products like that Goblin and they were self funding the company yeah they were self funding and so I cannot believe how I would be like no we're getting to work don't like my buddy the cool thing was you sat around you talked about things you how many people we were probably like five or six people got it so it was pretty small it wasn't I mean we had a good office in pole to a bigger than we needed but you could tell they're not worried I shouldn't be worried you sit around for a week you get some ideas then you go and work on him and it all felt pretty natural at that and the outcome of this was what yeah so you cracked the nut finally yeah so we had you know they had a previous background in ad tech we had made this product called Apple oven that was an app where you could see what apps your friends were using so it was like a social network where if you're playing candy crush oh it says hey Sam's playing candy crush and you should play too but we're like wow this is pretty interesting people really convert with this this would just be an ad product and then that kind of drove it and said wait we should just make a real network out of this and then we sat down we built that for a couple months and then it kind of skyrocketed after that and how big how big is it now they're really massive now it's been a while since I've been over there but you know a couple years back they had big liquidity event over one point four billion so and I think they've probably grown in multiple since then yeah I mean I heard that it sold like only three years effort started yeah it was really fast and it was doing like six or seven hundred million in revenue like some crazy number yeah it was magical to see what product market fit really looks like like I always thought oh these things are working no they weren't working and this was what working looked like and it was probably one of the best versions of it so maybe my views a little skewed on that but the first first month it was like man we just jump up to like 10,000 plus and revenue a day and then you just kind of keep skyrocketing up from that and like it's pretty crazy as an engineer too because now your servers are being hammered you're like running around all night like pulling all-nighters just because money's flowing and you got to kind of keep it up and so that was kind of crazy but fun so the the app 11 story is four million bucks and self-funding initially then they raised a small strategic round i don't know exactly what the totals but about five million bucks total funding right yeah I think that's exactly what it was and then the first liquidity events they sold a portion of the company to a Chinese company for over 1.4 billion and so that's like massive capital efficiency you were you know CTO kind of co-founder there so we met after that we started working together became you know you know really good friends and have built a bunch of stuff together and what I like about you which is why I wanted you to on the podcast is not necessarily we're not gonna talk too much about Apple of and that's just establish who you are you are like me you're an idea guy you always have a bunch of ideas you see interesting stuff but you're deeply technical but then get the business side and the product side too and there's very few people who do I'm definitely gonna ask about app loving and a little bit okay before we even get to the ideas let me I gotta tell you something real quick cuz this is related so my best friend started fungal which was a plug-ins competitor they raised sixteen million dollars when they got acquired they had 100 million in cash what is it self worth 750 half of what you guys sold for it very successful yesterday Jack was this was after you left okay so we have to apologize a little bit yesterday Lance Armstrong popped in and our episode got ruined kind of ruined or or made or made whatever it was hectic and we did this thing it was cool Sean you left Jack was here it was me and Lance and Adam and Jack just chillin right here and Jack's kind of savant II like he's like real smart but he doesn't pay attention to a lot of things and we were talking about the podcast and I was saying Lance how BIG's your podcast he said it's like whatever a hundred thousand listeners he goes it took me a long time to build that up you know after I got cut out or cut off and Jack was like what cut out what do you like what happened like Apple shut you down or something he goes no you don't like from the incident that happened seven years ago like I like everything dropped off and he goes jack was like what what do you mean and Lance later explained it Lance looked at me it he goes he's like is this guy serious I'm like yeah dude he's like a business of Oz what happens he doesn't know and he goes this is awesome say if you got a hankering for people like this Robbie he goes goes jack I basically went from hero to zero overnight like I lost everything and Jack was like oh okay Pro and I did like rub you know like it was hilarious that's amazing and if you jack did a whole episode and you can kind of tell he's like and the stuff he cares about he's so deep in those like Rain Man and then other stuff he's completely oblivious too which is awesome yeah it was it was so funny and Jack started your guys's compare maybe their first I don't know but competitors so it reminded me of that so what you want to do I want to hear some ideas you said you have a story or is that the story or you know I'll tell it tomorrow okay cool so we want to have guests that come in and bring their ideas stuff they find interesting so either little phenomenon they've observed ideas they've been cooking up something off their list I have on their phone whatever it is so do you have stuff like that you have a night a list of ideas he does or no I wrote down some ideas for this okay actually just keep them up here and like you know the important ones make their way out let's talk about the process where do you get a lot of like weird window ideas come to you usually when I'm not trying to come up with the night like in the shower shower driving just kind of around not really thinking about anything and then something pops up the second one I would say is like when I'm reading online like if you read something interesting you're like wait that's cool but it would be cooler if it was and then like that's kind of where my mind wanders I think that the best idea is you just steal all right yeah so like it's kind of like that you're like oh but what if you applied it like the way this restaurant industry is this restaurants working they should actually apply that to like Indian food and it would be way bigger right yeah it's like re mixing right it's like I want to sample some ideas real quick and then I want to turn it into my own right so what you got what's interesting to you okay so I'll start with one that we went go-karting a couple weeks back and so I'm really into kind of VR AR I mean you know this I've kind of gives you an oculus just yeah you can you know feel my you gave him one great gift right that's awesome yeah I was like John you gotta do this you're never gonna buy one on your own you're gonna be a skeptic forever here you go are you using it yeah because he was telling me he's like there's just one thing you're cuz I was skeptical I was like is there any good games like what am I gonna do with this he's like dude you gotta try this PokerStars thing and I was like oh yeah what a VR Poker why do I need that it is [ __ ] amazing have you tried this thing we see what I've done boxing I played all the games but I didn't got it for the poker one it's incredible I'm gonna go buy an oculus with supply yeah seriously you should there are sold out so it's gonna be tough but you know maybe we can get you one too you really can't buy one right now they're totally from from Christmas they just completely sold out and then they haven't been able to refill it they said it was January than February now it's March and then they're talking about all these delays from China that's a good sign for VR yeah I mean they totally it's the first device where I looked at it and I said I can give it to somebody that's not a VR junkie and they would actually get excited about it and I think the pokken one is great because you actually people want to build these really immersed experiences like boxing but actually you don't really want entertainment like that all the time I actually want more sit on the couch experience yeah so you know some of the things I've been thinking about it if you are saying what can I build while I'm on the couch yeah we wouldn't go karting and you know when you go go-karting it's really about how quickly do you make these turns how fast are you how good of a driver are you you know how aggressive are you you know things like that and afterwards we were just kind of talking about some ideas and I was like dude it would be cool if we could you know go to a go karting place but it's like Mario Kart instead where you have these AR goggles over your head and it's not about quick turns and it's like the longer track where you can kind of like have some space but I you know would digitally go over this box and I now have a weapon that I could shoot at your car and if I hit you successfully your car kind of shuts down for a second and you're stuck so I think the real-life Mario Kart is this like the sandbox thing so this would be like sandbox or like Museum of ice-cream it'd be a place you go put on this thing play with a bunch of frogs big on your sandbox like laser tag it's like you better be laser exactly do you think that sandbox is a big business I think sandbox is fantastic I mean it's hard to see if there's going to be successful or not because retail has all these problems and having space has all these problems but if I retail well yes not retail but they're they kind of have retail spaces right like they want to be fricking Mordor right yeah they want to be like in a spot where there's a lot of I mean it's just an activity it's just like escape room or something it's like escape room but it escape Herman I know I know guys who owned like 200 escape rooms are they awesome it's an amazing business because escape rooms are super lightweight you don't do anything you have a if one person you buy the kit and you just keep like reassembling the room and you have these like very small for the big as that company well it's not one company but it's it's like like you can just own a different price yeah but you can own a McDonald's franchise they still report revenues as one yeah primary I've never been in I would I will never go to an escape room that's my fear I don't want to guess I'm really cost of phobic I don't like lying I know I will never go in general VR or a our experiences are gonna be I think fantastic and you could see theme parks going to this like I heard about a theme park that has a roller coaster ride in VR where they give you goggles you're in this kind of mechanical thing but then you're actually in a dungeon and there's lava and like it's a totally immersed experience and I think that people are going to experience it first like that and I could totally see you coming up with all kinds of different content types and whether it's Mario Cart or escape room that's a great point so here's a cool model of this I have a buddy who worked at this company called two bit circus Weaver heard of them no so the guy that got the founder his dad started chuck-e-cheese is Nolan whatever the guys name is Atari guy I started Atari started chuck-e-cheese and his son started the thing called two bit circus and I love the concept I think the son kind of I don't know the guy but like my read on the situation is just sort of like a TD he wants to do a million things not really like executing on this business as he should but the concepts amazing they go city to city traveling circus like Cirque de Soleil or whatever and they pop up this thing and it's like a weekend thing where parents bring their kids and all the attractions are like digital wonders so it's like VR thing a big a hologram thing and they were doing really well every city they were going to they're selling out like crazy but he was also getting distracted they were doing things like a company would be like hey we'll give you half a million dollars to do our company retreat yeah and then boom the whole company Nick the CEO comes in and says hey we had to go do this corporate retreat and the company is like dude we need like one direction but can you Henry can you look up dave and buster's revenue and look up chuck-e-cheeses I bet chuck-e-cheeses owned by private equity makes a killing and if you've gone to a checking there's way down well where I'm from Missouri they were probably popular it's like we're like like trashy poor people go I mean it's pretty cool it's pretty wack like like I wouldn't go there because it was famous for like the parents would fight it was like Pee Wee hockey and chuck-e-cheese that's like where parents get drunk and fight what's the number by the way does it pick up Henry when he says no they repeat it yeah repeat what he said Dave Buster's three million Chuckie Cheese almost a billion dollars annual revenue but definitely ripe for like doing something new because these things are stale it's Chuckie Cheese public it just say it's a public company if like my stock well I want to see what the income is no I'm into this I think that these things are cool I think I'm terribly into it when I tried oculus I was like I'm gonna quit my company and only do this by the way random story i I found this YouTube channel once that was talking about all these old brands that are just gone to [ __ ] like a Chucky Cheese and here's like hey this guy just short stocks and he was like my short pic of the year is tootsie roll and he was like you ever met anyone likes tootsie roll I love him he's like people like tootsie roll all 35 and up he's like no kid wants to 0 they go out for Halloween go public they get tootsie roll they throw that [ __ ] away he goes Tootsie Roll has no other products it's just tootsie roll and their population is dying you know secondly the owner is like some 76 year old woman who will never sell the company so nobody can turn it around nobody can change it that company's just going to troll surprise it's another company and so it was like a short the stock so I watch this two-minute YouTube video and I was like I took out a short [Laughter] so another thing that I would do I love this I would also look Six Flags has had a hell of a turnaround positive so the guy who there's this guy named Bob Pitman and he was one of the inspirations for me starting the hustle because Bob Pitman was he created MTV when he was in his 20s and then he went started the thing called this thing called the pilot group which launched a loads of different email newsletters including Thrillist which is like a huge thing it's like a billion-dollar media thing anyway Bob Pittman was is now the CEO of I heart media and formerly was also the CEO of Six Flags and he turned it around and it there it does it's really good it's been around forever you know and it abscent flows but it's good yeah I think entertainment can always level up and when you're leaving the house to go do something the more immersed and more exciting it is it like that's what you want like I can get all the rest of the stuff at home but like that's why I think said what satin box is fantastic the only negatives I've heard is hey I've gone to it twice it was similar content but they're gonna rub that out they're gonna keep growing it I think it's gonna be amazing I love this spin-off of this idea for the lazy people that I have okay you got to go to this place and go go Carleigh alright what's the other why can I stay at home correct so if you replace the carts with drones and you let people sit at home on a controller and control these drugs real life drive drones are flying around this warehouse and I'm fighting you and again same thing is all digital so I can hit something shoot you your drone just like flies and brakes you got to go let's start over again hit of people who just go pick up ok alright I have I can add to this there's this guy I know I don't know if they're public so I won't I won't talk about him yet but anyway he's got what he what they did was in Vegas or in Nevada where it's really cheap they bought something like a hundred or a thousand a significant amount of claw machines you know claw machines like for arcade machine yeah and you download the app and you pay a certain amount of money and you can you control the claw machine remotely test and it picks up the item and drops it down to the thing and then you just get huge in Japan you just get emailed like I don't know if they I don't know what the mailing system is I don't know if you actually get mail bad thing or if it's a gift card that you get sent but I saw my friend doing this on his phone I was like what are you playing what game is that he goes oh there's a arcade in Japan and I'm controlling the claw so okay but here's how my buddy's building this business he's building it to be like like H he's building it to where it's gonna take off and they're gonna after all the value and it's just gonna slowly die I guess you've known fad basically is what you're saying like he knows it's a fad yeah which I love I like that those things but that's how he's building it do it on like wish product because they're so cheap that you could kind of like have some conscription thing where it's like hey you have to get one random which product but yeah that's a wish to do your browsing wish and after two minutes it's like enter bonus round you have the claw in our supply warehouse pick something up I'm into this I think it's cool alright what else you got okay wait hold on here's what we'll do actually in the next couple days I'll come prepared with some Six Flags and chuck-e-cheese numbers okay I'm interested in this I want to know what the start-up costs are of for sandbox VR and I was tweet at us if you like cuz we nerd out on like I wonder how that business does and we go look up the numbers and figure out who this guy is who's Bob Pitt man and how much income do they make I don't know if we're unique in that but if you like that stuff like either in the Facebook group just my first million or on Twitter tell us if that's like just be like more of that or less of that just be honest yeah cuz that's the weird thing with podcast you don't know what they want yeah what else so in general like I look at theme so it's like okay Apple releases a bunch of random devices so I'll call them ear pods not really random but this Apple pencil yeah it's a hundred twenty-five bucks it's expensive and like the iPad pro is expensive but then I'm like great this new capability is there what product exists for it and so you know recently I've been kind of playing around a lot with the iPad and I'll kind of try to show you guys I can hold the my card do you use a are you one of the like computer you get rid of computer only use ipad i'm i think that's weird i think it's [ __ ] weird it's i I like this in certain cases like what I'm traveling it's a lot better than me lugging around my laptop did work pay for that no this is mine so I just forgot I like to submit expenses reimbursement really bad was like like when we sold people how many unreimbursed things how much dollar amount did you have is like the tens of thousands yeah yeah we did digit range I should be better at that but you know Adam did that I had to pay him five granite-like submit [ __ ] life has been good to me so I'm not really not stressing anything yeah so the general theme is like new hardware comes out what can I do with this yeah that's the general diamond so one of the things I've been playing with is this app called flow and it's basically like this kind of whiteboard app right and so it's kind of hard to show obviously but the idea for me was you know you sit in a meeting room right and you you love the whiteboard you love getting up and movie yeah he does that [ __ ] I like to get my Steve Jobs on well he always has like analogies over [ __ ] he's like we're try to pull the racecar but let's start with the bicycle the idea was okay you take this kind of experience with the iPad and pencil but this whiteboard over here should just be digital right so if I want to show you something I just turned on here and it just shows up there you're like no no and you want to kind of feed off of it and like I said so for those who can't see what you're saying so you're spacing you got a little iPad in front of you a little tablet you're in a big meeting room if you you should be able to quickly sketch something or write something or draw something and it just used the whiteboard as a display like it's a TV correct and then it's remote friendly so everybody can get the same whiteboard experience cuz I mean what happens if your remote that happened to me yesterday I was remote conference again the guy gets up he's like here's what what here's what this really means he drew something on whiteboard I can't see and everyone in the meeting was like oh yeah that makes total sense I'm just the video ask you a bunch of people so do you know this guy named Wayne I forget his last name he sold something to Twitter yeah they're doing digits now mah mAh I think it's more anyway I was talking to him he said they're 100% remote and Isaac how do you do that cuz we're struggling with this whole whiteboard thing and he was like man there's this one app and they never update and that's kind of what we've hacked together to use this is a problem that yeah I think people are going to remote work both because there's really good talent elsewhere that you're like man this is a perfect fit but you're not here and that's not a good enough reason anymore and then the second thing is just caustic if you're in the city like people they kind of don't like you know they don't want to pay that much for their house so just basically making the whiteboard work for remote workers yeah or even if you're here yeah yeah like I still want a big view of it if I'm here like if we're all here we want to get that that's badass I'm into it so the pencil and the iPad I think is a good combination to where people will have that around I think it'll become more common now you can kind of connect all these together so last podcast I was saying meeting tech that makes meetings more effective and efficient because all like so many billions of dollars are spent in people's time in meetings do you know how cheap I mean your it would cost way less anything to make this you know that okay this is a screen this is a 55 inch I think out there we have a 65 inch TCL 4k or no waiting at the 4k 1080p you know how much that cost it's like no no it was like 250 or 180 it's like probably cheaper than this why that's the retail yeah like on Amazon I bought it for I think for sure less than 300 maybe less than 200 yeah I believe that screenings are really cheap and so where else can you put screens and I think you can actually enhance the meetings if somebody puts up slides I want to write over the slides that guy I think you unlock more capabilities than just supplement what you have today and I think that that's where this will become superior than us going to the whiteboard with you know those expo pens and kind of writing there right so meeting tech yeah I think we had it yesterday I mean I was but now you're getting it you you didn't have you I didn't have a good exam set a meeting in a box yeah I was trying to get to that but then I stumbled the initial thing I said meeting in a box and it sounded stupid to me my shark showed up like a chump in a box nobody wanted to walk around with the Bluetooth headset right we think we all agree you didn't look cool you look attacking look it was a known douchebag thing yeah yeah it was like having the cellphone on your belt yeah perfect and so I was like great people have a pause now and so what else can you build with this again apples unlocking capabilities and hardware so what software can you build and so there's two ideas ones minds one else's but I'll take it as my craft yeah exactly whoever says it it's theirs yeah by the way Apple or air pods what how much 10 million units X amount of time so what's that 10 bit is that 10 billion in sales yeah just multiplied by let's say 100 yeah yeah it would be a fortune 500 company yeah I agree it's fantastic and so one of the things I was thinking about it was great if I have these on all day can I just have this on cannot connect it to like my wife or like somebody right and so whether you do it for work or for a personal you always have it on there's no audio flowing but then if I'm like hey Sean what's up it knows do you have your ear pods on if it doesn't it tells me hey he's not there but you can record a message you'll get it later right but if you're there you'll just hear my audio and you still aren't on yet you're kind of opting again to be like yo what's up man like it's like how do you take the phone call away from like that and you're like I'm not gonna give this capability to everybody there's couple close people in my life like my wife did I'm gonna be like great I just want to have this on and this capability that's there and so it's like in the office they do this in the TV show oh yeah Jim and Pam Hammond yeah this is good cuz it's not it's not on when you don't want it on so let's say I have my earbuds in you have yours in and I'm walking around I'm at lunch I have this idea for the podcast I basically just say yo Sam what we should do is we should do this and then you basically receive but you're not sending back unless you say whatever the keyword like though you know how Alexa works right like it's like Shawn or whatever and that's way more lightweight than me picking up my phone and starting at the type or phone call like who wants to do that right so phone calls feel weird 100% right now yeah I I'm I'm less bullish on that in the first two okay okay the second version of this idea with ear pods was you know for us all right oh you're homie yeah one of our friends and we're doing small hackathon at the house and he's like coming up with this idea again for everybody wait wait you're doing a hackathon at your home like for fun yeah just for fun damn Eddie you do this like every week right weeks like so what do you guys do Jake's here Jake you did you go to the last one yeah we just kind of sit around a table we're on tough we're talking about ideas we come up with something and we just kind of try to make it usually you don't end up finishing on the first one but then just second when you try again the third one you try had any kind of [ __ ] nerds what you build what you build it the last one you me talk about it yeah so Jake Jake was making this thing where he was like it'd be cool if you could test your website from like locations around the world but it would like video record what it looked like and how it loaded so not only do you get this like technical got a number yeah and then you show people this is how crappy our website looks like from some random country or in the US and write what it looks like for other people and so that's awesome yeah that's really awesome everyone's kind of testing numbers but we're visual yeah what you care about is oh look how long that took to load look how shitty this look have you heard of user test is it user voice review their test testing you know user testing yeah I'm that's like a hundred fifty million dollar a year business a lot - my mom works at user testing really if it's that it's huge right big it's it's they're trying to go public and you know so that means they're at that scale where they're doing 100 hundred million plus yeah and all they do is there's someone in the Midwest who's cheap who recorders all right well let me look at your website okay I'm scrolling down I don't really know what that's been about laying confusion this is more about performance no but they but they but they there's both they're similar there are similar issues yeah and I think you know today he's looking at it like a performance tool like how do you kind of make it load well but I think you could totally look at it and apply some machine learning to it where it's like this doesn't seem to work well it's below the fold on these devices right like some of those things when you design it and you like put it together you're not thinking oh what does it look like on the iPad right and then you kind of just show it like that and then you have a video but also it could detect and say man this is like your main button that is going up down here and you know you could are you gonna do it the job Jake I like that project the okay so I already said this what was the other project so this idea was around cooking and you're like in the kitchen and you're like oh I want to like hear these recipes and things like that and so again your hands are dirty in the kitchen yeah what do you do you pull out your phone your laptop doesn't make sense right like and so the idea was you have your air pods on it kind of walks you through the steps and you can go next go back and it's like you know a little recipe the name that you came up with for it but I think you could come up with a better name for kitchen in a box I think you call that kitchen pods or something and I was like God that isn't right this house have you uh okay so aunt this guy named Andrew Mason you know you know that name Terri Groupon he a few years ago his second act he started this thing detour detour there it is they shut it down and he pivoted to D script the script a podcast thing and anyway detour it was awesome it was so cool this was before air pods so did you do well oh I used to do them all the time but I understand how it wouldn't be huge but I was a power-tool product not a great business yeah and so what it was is you know how when you go to a museum and you have a guided tour that sounds like alright when you get to this point press this thing and there and then you press the button you tell you about it you see this painting you see there's a small little smudge that you'll see up laughter that what happened he got angry he did whatever so what they do this but they do it for cities so it's guided walking tours interesting but you know you know this American life like you know how it's like really highly produced podcasts where you can like hear noises and they did that but it was GP it was work at your GPS and what they would do is they would say alright walk past the street past Bush Street keep walking and then it would play music and then it would tell when you got there and it would say now look down to your right you see that hole that was there that actually came here from this time and it's it's awesome it's so cool shut it down anyway what you're describing is almost like the cooking version of that activity version which would be significantly larger than the detour version cuz the detour because you cook all the time the detour version I would do it unlike a my wife is out of town it does suck to have your hands covered in food and then be like oh let me go to my iPad or my phone and like try to like scroll and click and zoom and like figure out this recipe how many tablespoons was supposed to be has there ever been a big business built of around recipes other than an ad based media company I'm not sure the problem with a lot of these ideas you start thinking too far ahead you're like I don't want to go do this thing because what does it turn into but I think generally the concept if you took guided tours like that concept and you said what else in my life could be guided that's interesting I think there's a couple of very interesting businesses there all right interesting totally interesting products maybe interesting businesses - totally interesting probably there's a workout version of this that's doing all right which is like you go to the gym and it's like in your ears and it's music app telling you what to do I use it all the time active you know what that is it's similar I use it on a [ __ ] basis I pay $100 a year for Ethan spoke at hustla con tens of millions in subscription revenue it's what you're describing but for working out so I think if you have a great product in a space where a lot of people are doing it you can come up with a business plan like 100 bucks a year that matches some I agree with you so people cook people go to the gym like what else are they doing day to day like I think guided meditation is another one bit oh yeah really there's the model right and so there's probably five others in that space but I think earpods made it different than Bluetooth headsets and headphones you know like so here's here's a lot guys everyone yeah that's why he gets the seat forgot it for meditation a lot of people don't like to sit and meditate like that just doesn't do it for them their mind races all this stuff and like the answer right now is like no that's the point do it and like sure that's that might be true but for a lot of people what it means is like [ __ ] this I'm gonna do something else and so there's all these other types of meditation like transcendental or whatever where you're chanting it's like a little more active and and there's all kinds of meditation hiking is meditation exercises meditation because you're controlling your breathing in a certain way you're clearing your mind space and you you know you're freeing your mind and so I'm curious if somebody can do this sort of detour version that's about walking and you know it's basically God in meditation but it's active not sit down on a pillow and do nothing for thirty minutes or whatever it is yeah like when I would do those detours you did him right I never did want to well we did well I did one where I went to the Castro and it was all about the AIDS epidemic and you got to know Harvey snow or snow what's Harvey Harvey Milk you know the gay activist that was like killed whatever he was a gay activist that was murdered and it was during the 80s when the whole aids thing was going on and the guy talking he was like now this is the last time that I hugged Harvey before he died and and then he's like now this house up here like these guys lived here and on top these guys live here they all died and I was like so emotionally right okay that gets me thinking you know I think this would be not I don't think this would work but like you know yesterday you and Lance Armstrong were both like the podcast I like best are these true-crime ones what if you did a true-crime version of the detour thing where it's murder mystery kind of creeps you the [ __ ] out as you walk around that's cool real crimes from your city yeah or you have to so we done trends we did a report on this these app what are those what are those calls again the you know I'm talking about give here we all know like these serialized video apps that [ __ ] the lady who started it she sold her thing to song if I man I gotta remember what it was anyway you you you get it's like choose-your-own-adventure okay for thriller not watching so basically we did a report on it our hypothesis was that actually the erotic novels romance novels it's the biggest segment you're talking about hooked hooked yeah yeah hooked right anyway I think it's a I I don't know if it's a great business but it's a okay one they scaled up revenue hooked was doing I think 20 million plus in revenue for yeah but I think return was stupidly high yeah anyway what we're describing is and when we did the report it was romance novels and thrillers had the highest here's the general print principal though like cooked is the modern-day goosebumps so when we were growing up we would read Goosebumps books and that was what hooked us as a kid and you love to read and hooked said well now every kid's got a phone what if we delivered this through this kind of SMS format but it sees like scary stories goosebumps style and and what you were talking about earlier with like you know chuck-e-cheese modern day if you're trying to brainstorm ideas this is one format to think about what did I love as a kid what's the modern-day version of that and because that's a great array more people's desires tend to stay the same yeah that's the tools of technology that updates and opens up new opportunities a good framework okay can I ask you about Apple Evan yeah I got one more idea oh go for it go for it I'll kind of plug a company invested into so I invested in this company called lucid drone I think I told you about it they have they basically created a drone that can window wash big buildings and so instead of sending like a five person crew and ask where did you find that there were a YC company so you know YC produces still fantastic companies I like these guys because it was like we got this you know it's not just drone tech and then guy nowhere but it's like then it's awesome application yeah specific application and then you think about you're like yeah five people hanging from a building or one guy working the drone from the bottom and washing it and all those legal yeah and so they're they're out there in a couple of cities I think there's gonna be small regulations they're gonna have to go but this makes sense it's a lot safer and a lot better when did they go come on saves you money if you're the building owner safer than having humans up there trying to wash windows sad way to lose a life what a bold idea great idea and what they did is they actually stopped so they tried to go to the building owners and they were like oh man the building owners are like well we have a service like you know it's too complicated so they went to the guys who were servicing the building they're like hey I could make your business more efficient so they're sending five guys out per job you can do five more jobs instead of renting this crazy scaffold you just release our drone and it's like you make their business more valuable you're not taking their business and then you don't have to go do all the building to building sales oh my god I love this one way of looking at it was oh we're gonna put those guys out of business instead said no you're my customer correct we make you more efficient exactly and I think that's some of the best tech I see is that it's not about replacing the whole workflow it's like how do we make these people more efficient how do we allow them to have more capabilities and then they can do more they can do a better job and that's kind of like I think what I look for in the emerging tech lucid drones Lisa the other genius thing about that is if you wanted to do this you would either have to go sell every building and and that's a lot of sales or if you go to the company like you said the company that already does the window-washing they might have already 50 clients so now one sale gets you 50 man that's badass we I'm big fans of boring things like window-washing I think it would that would be right my alley and to add this thing to it would be neat and never if you told me that someone had that idea I'd be like no it's it's really interesting into my spin off the remix of their idea was probably you guys I don't know if you guys you have a car right yeah I'm sorry great you guys both have car city but I never wash my car I never go to a car wash maybe there's no if I could just have a little drone this it's in my garage that can come up wash my car for me every so often or if you're in a place where it snows and how do I pour some water in the windshield so I don't gotta go do that and I can get into the car like that's what that's how ya like that you know this was like a huge failure cherry but those humans yeah this is a Roomba yeah no I'm not washes your car totally but I looked at like the background of why I was like that's so stupid who on earth think that was a good idea it's a big thing in a lot of different countries that and check this out bringing gas drink a yeah bring gas to you in foreign markets that's like the way that gas works so car washes I say well are funny I always have to correct or tell people I say funny get prepared car washing can you not say why can't say it's a Midwestern thing wash like it's easy are washing and giving the disclaimer no I can't say I can't say car why I know it's like El car cleaning if somebody says like what's your greatest weakness just make their way into my words it's it's a bit lesser thing a lot people say it anyway that's interesting but I never would have thought I'm I that's kind of cool but how on earth could you build a machine that does it I mean that's because the drone need to be pretty smart to do that or no no I think the thing I like about this technology space right now is a lot of the research work is done and so people have made drones that can fly that could follow you like there's literally sky do yep I say a thousand bucks do you go running in the woods yesterday like demo video and it follows you if you haven't seen this demo video search sky do that [ __ ] though it's amazing literally go you like throw the camera watch that one now the one failed yeah these guys say they can do it how about this go on YouTube and look up the users who are doing this and they're recreating it and you can see it works okay and so like snowboarding and skiing and stuff yes snowboarding is another one I mean a GoPro was like one step up but now if you got this drone that can call there I love this [ __ ] man drones and VR just we need a drone filming this that's just whoever's talking it just turns to them and just does the cut just picks up the right my I had one of the first DGI ones and it fell out of sky at a thousand feet ruined it but a lot of this technology there's been so much research work done that's moved it forward and I think it's at the spot now where it needs application engineers and not that seem you know you don't need to be a PhD with computer science and all these math degrees to go create this technology you take the work that they've built and they've kind of established and then apply it to these things and so drunk flying a drone is trivial enough building the drone is trivial now and then the software is easy to program a drone to fly object recognition and computer vision is easy now and so you combine these two that's called easier technologies now because of all the research work that was done and then you can kind of create this product from it and so I've built these small drones or like these little 4-inch drones they're a you have yeah yeah I programmed my own flight controller that one didn't work as well I used the pre-programmed flight controller that worked a lot better but I get really excited about these technologies when I without a college degree without a you know deep technical expertise can go and learn about it and I really just used Google like that's my source for everything how old are you I'm 35 you're one of the more interesting people I've ever met he's cool interesting interesting to you he just my interests align with yours but he's more intelligent and more technically savvy and he could actually make the things that I think I wish I could make yeah can you talk about Apple Evan because you said something so the other day I was talking to someone about businesses and I'm like when it's working do you know what's working what's that feel like and you made a comment earlier like it's the first time I've ever seen we're just this is what working feels like right what what what what was that like it's it's the feeling of like like when you when you're you know slamming on your brakes in the car and the car is kind of doing its own thing and you're like I'm not controlling the car it is just flowing on its own it's like it's that feeling where you know you're you built all these products and even at Apple oh and we did nine ideas before that I've done this for a long time where I'm just trying idea after idea I try to get people to use it and you're looking for these good signals and you're trying to spot it and then when it's really working it's not about spotting it it's so obvious that there's no question that it's working and so it's all the charts are flying up but then every day you're not even like men is it working or is it not it's so obvious like I got to do XY and Z - so you know these problems that are coming up kind of day in and day out and so it's definitely a feeling where the pull from the market is so strong that there's no there's no middle ground it's I always thought it was like oh it's I'm gonna kind of realize when I'm close to it but it's actually very binary it's like you're here and it's not working and you're trying to push into the market what you need to do but when it happens it just kind of takes off and you know I just I don't have really good analogies for it yet except for that like it just it's like the loss of control the market is in control almost and you're just like trying to catch up and like you know get into that mindset of like okay great this is working we're gonna keep like pushing whatever we need to do to kind of support this case what was the revenue growth I mean you guys were at zero then was it like one month it could've been like 20 grand the next month it was like a million I mean was it that substantial it wasn't that crazy but I think the interesting thing that I learned was there you know there were a lot of players in the market where you'd go to this weather app right and the weather app would do like you know you never realized the scale of some of these apps you and at that time it's like man this thing is doing 200 million you know impressions per day and I'm like a weather app like really like why is it so big and then you're like great if we get this customer these things can happen and so I think the weather the weather app does how many impressions I think I forgot which weather app it was whether it was a weather bug or the weather app but it was like 200 million impressions a day like and I was like I was really surprised at some of the scale of some of these apps and like you know yes we had the best ad platform yes we made no we made all these small tweaks to the product to like make it work better and we made our server scale and we did all these things but I think to me the fascinating thing was there were all these major players you didn't actually realize how big some of these opportunities were and kind of working at Apple of and I always like wait I want to go like when I left there it was like I'm not like a huge fan of like ad products like naturally it that's not the product that I get excited about I love money so I like great it's a fantastic business I like that and I was like oh I'm gonna go make these apps and games that are gonna go do this and actually that's how I ran into Sean I think he had checked out one of my games after AngelList was that right yeah I saw one AngelList and I was like something doesn't add up either this guy's full of [ __ ] cuz who would leave this company that's crushing it like most people when you finally hit a grand slam you want to do the victory lap and people stay for seven years and then they write this cheesy letter about how great the journey has been and they're finally ready for their next chapter he basically left after three years you weren't even fully vest in right yeah left a little bit on the table again I'm not complaining cuz everything's been fantastic and but it was something counterintuitive I was like why would this guy leave either he got kicked out he got fired he's not good bubble blah I was like or this guy's amazing he really just does love me his story was like I just love startups I want to build something that consumers use not really an ad tech platform and he was like I was interested in mobile because I saw how big these mobile apps were on our ad network so he locked himself in his bedroom it's like I'm gonna learn mobile in the next six months and he just built a bunch of Android games and then I saw him on Twitter tweeting back with people who played his game and I was like dude none of my developers all the developers I have in my company that are great none of them would ever go tweet at a customer and be like hey you know I'm gonna fix that bug and I can make this better hey what do you think about this sounds like there's something different about this guy what apps were you shocked at how big they were why their app does 200 oh the casino game I mean that's not shocking is it um the size of it was definitely shocking just because you all assumed they're big and they're addictive but then that and then candy crush in their initial rise was the first time in the industry where I heard like man like dis ting is a money printing machine it's like you know they would you know and not all this was at Apple eV and I said one turn at Tech you're like learning about the industry you're meeting other people when you're like hey these guys are willing this blanket pee but eight bucks for a user in the US and I'm like okay well that seems pretty expensive like why are they doing that like how much $8 what they're spending yeah I think at that time it was like hey if we're like a male you know 18 to 35 or something it might be eight bucks or something like that and then on the other side I talked to somebody over there and I'm like they're like yeah dude we make like 20 bucks on them like in like seven days and I'm like and maybe those numbers are slightly off but like they were making a multiple to where you were like wait so you just have this machine where you just pressed this button and you put in money and you know seven days later three times more money come out and I'm like wow like how do I get that I don't my bank account every single day to go do that well you guys had that a little bit with that beloved yeah I mean I didn't have that right like I don't have the senior at this company you're vested you have a shared interest in the long run but you know me being me I was like I want that like I want the ability to have that and then the freedom to work on things that I'm really excited about and so I tried that obviously it's a lot harder than just you know one person in their bedroom doing it but what did Adam Apple of and say was he like this just we had no idea or was he methodical and an item is so fantastic at execution that is just like he's like a machine it's like you know when when the thing I really loved about him and the things I learned the most from him were like when you wanted to go do something like you know sometimes you're like oh man this situation isn't working and Adams the CEO of Apple of it yeah a CEO of Apple oven and you know you have these situations where it's like I gotta go do the X or you really feel like you got to go make this move this deals bad maybe this hire was bad or this hire was good or something like that buddy what kind of weight on it a little bit after deciding and you're gonna create some time what's a good time to do it for em like okay we'll just go do this now like what's stopping us and then you know the other things like that were you know I started there as kind of an engineer and then very quickly he was like oh you could run this team you could manage the whole team I was a great we talked and then that kind of always been my experience that like that never really gets communicated and then it feels like cool I'm like the manager but not like I think a lot of people end up in that situation especially in companies and then like the next morning it's like a meeting with the whole team he puts that work chart up and then every time we changed it it was the same situation happened he was so clear and effective with his communication and execution that I was like like I really need to be like that like that's what like I think Plus execution looks and feels like day in and day out and it's like it's not emotional it's very logical it's very quick and I think speed in these situations helps create clarity because when you remember the other way around clarity help create speed yeah we're both right you know and I think clarity in the system if you delay it your team becomes unclear and then it gets a little muddy and then you're like wait what is what's going on here why is this guy kind of acting like that and that person not and I think just being very fast and quick in that execution once you decide you should go and execute it and I think that that's that's the thing that I learned is like how quickly can you do that and how effectively can you do that whether it's an email and I'm really not good at this it's kind of one of the reasons I point at it because I see myself kind of like oh wait on this a little bit or send this email tomorrow I don't want to open up this kind of world right now like and then it's actually that's the exact opposite traitor sake just go have a bias for action and and kind of go do that and so from him I learned just just an amazing amount in like how do you operate at this level and I mean since I've left they've grown so much that it feels like I was only at the 1% of it like I feel like I don't know 90% 99% of the story anymore because they've grown well beyond that they've expanded into other areas they're really big now from the revenue side they're really big now from you know what their marketplace is and they're very well known and you know I kind of get all the benefit from from being there a long time ago which is great for me but you know I'm sure there were more learnings that I missed along the way this whole monologue on app love and that's gonna be our clip nice that was a good one cool we should wrap for today that was awesome man for kind of works with me across the street so anytime we want to do this so we'll have people will put your Twitter handle in the bio and the notes of this and so people can get you know follow you get you know tweet at you whatever after this as well and we don't know I'm still uncertain as to how many listeners we have but I do know that last time I asked for reviews we got a few hundred of them and a handful of hours to leave 24-48 hours so if you like this one tweet at him you could say your hand on a second and then let us know and we'll we'll figure out what what what next to do yeah yeah my handle is a fur con or on Twitter that's fu our qan are awesome thank you

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
is that what they do that's what they do all right back before we get it so you know how I said leave reviews yeah I think we got two or three or hundred reviews off that yeah it's crazy and we promise about people cool [ __ ] we gotta like fulfill because people are like here's my receipt I left you guys good I got about a hundred messages of people with the reviews I replied to all of them last night I will sit on my couch I'm just the [ __ ] didn't I replied all them with the special gift I just left I yeah call them and basically that's a great video voicemail you know uh at YC they have this thing which is like you'd rather have a thousand people love you than a million people just kind of like you yeah and I think that's the one thing that that is now abundantly clear about this podcast is like we have these goals of like we're gonna grow this thing big but we already did the hard part which is you get a small number of people to love you or they're like this is my routine this is my favorite podcast and I've been listening to the podcast for five years and so that's very I don't have feels good feels great yeah I had a I got I was shown at him last night I got I don't know I mean at least a couple hundred feet like DMS on my Twitter people with the review exam I said them all video so review us the video or review us and let me know because Sean hasn't been doing it but at least if you let me know you'll get something back alright you know what's my fear and all this stuff so I have a fear that's crept up now the fear is I never want to be the smart person in the room and so there's part of me I'm sitting in this red [ __ ] throne and throwing out ideas that I'm admittedly saying are half-baked yeah probably bad ideas but they're interesting to me I want to make sure that we're learning doing this like I want to be learning stuff and sharing it I don't want to just be sitting here saying hey I got answers let me give them to you and so my commitment to myself really more than anybody else but I want to say it out loud because that commits me is you know as we do this it's not about oh I have great ideas let me say them or we're brainstorming great ideas it's we're gonna learn injury stuff by talking interesting people and doing research on things and then we're gonna share what we like we're gonna share what's fun what's interesting to us so that's my fear is you never want to be the Guru you want to be the student and so that's kind of my my little mini rant I agree I'm not trying to be a guru and I'm certainly not because some of the deems we get people are like help me yeah help me you know I'm like no no I don't know anything and me attaching my name to your thing does nothing like we got to do the work yeah and like you know I'll help you but I hate I'm not the answer I don't know yeah I'm not the right uh-uh and we could preface this by saying most of the ideas we get I just steal from other people yeah for sure of course all right you want to again what do we want to talk about you want to talk about can I'll talk about something that's happening recently yeah Brandis so talk about think about brainless and I want to talk about these new credit cards that are popping up yep all right pick one let's do it you go ahead brainless all right so brand list people don't know they went out of business what they were trying to do was they were like look don't pay for the name-brand you should just have high quality products and they should just be brand less and because we take away the name-brand we can lower the price that was like the initial promise or the premise of the business awesome idea awesome idea I'm glad you said that because a lot of people are [ __ ] on them now because they like failed no but I still think [ __ ] awesome idea and actually of course ironically brand les is a great brand and so I think that that was really cool they raised a [ __ ] ton of money from Softbank like 200 million dollars before they really achieved any product market fit and that sort of like was the death note for the company because it was just the expectations when you raised 200 million is you're gonna be you know a billion dollar plus company and if you do that too early and you haven't actually proven out your model you haven't figured it all out what expectations crush the business I actually so I didn't prepare because I just thought about this but what do you what's the biggest grocery store chain in America you think Albertsons may be Safeway I don't know okay let's do safely can you look up try and find this just just a headline trying to tell me what the revenue or how many sales like generic brands for grocery stores or like the Kirkland brand or woke up how much revenue the Kirkland brand does well I mean I bet you it's astronomical and so actually I would I mean if you think about brainless could become it is the generic the generic trusted Kirkland brand yeah I think and I think it's a great idea yeah the problem was that they raised all that money Ralph the bat I have a problem there was some incompetence with leadership I don't actually know this yeah Kirkland brand sells 39 billion dollars of products Henry quick with the trigger I like yeah well source what's the so you think he's lying Wow 38 billion dollars in one year so so one thing I loved is I okay and that's just Kirkland Kirkland crazy so I listen to her on a podcast Tina Sharkey I think this one and she's like an Internet oh gee she'd been around with a bunch of companies all of which I think have not done super great but she went on this podcast she said this thing that I liked which was she was like think back to when you were a child and like let's walk from room to room you're in the laundry room what brand are you gonna see you're gonna see whatever ya tied you're gonna see whatever go to the pantry what are you gonna see you're gonna see fruit roll-up and pop-tarts and all this stuff and then open up your fridge what are you gonna see and you see these brands and actually it's kind of like you've seen these stats where the S&P 500 turns over like I don't know 20% of the S&P 500 turns over every every decade basically the same thing happens with these like household brands these brands that seem like staples of your home right a lot of them are like like Minute Maid it's like [ __ ] Minute Maid you're out like you know now you know Tang yeah Tang you know like these brands just like like they are not they can come and go generationally they don't just all make it from one mom to the next mom and I actually believe that premise and she was like look the moms of this generation they don't want to pay for this like the this consumer packaged good brand in the same way they want out know it's high-quality ingredients sourced you know ethically and you know they don't want to overpay they want to be you know value conscious so I liked a lot on premise I'm sad I didn't work but somebody I believe I believe you should just go out today and pitch I'm bran list without Softbank and I think I would I would invest incredible entrepreneur you I think I had three people reach out to me that said hey can you ask can you introduce me to the people who are selling for unless I mean I don't know them but I just tweeted it and I got an intro and I introduced three different people who are wanting to buy the assets now written what are the what are the assets what are you getting you get the name maybe a little inventory probably okay the name and email list and then unfortunately probably a bunch of an incompetent team right no disrespect but look if they couldn't pull it off there by definition well you'll you'll need to restart for sure right you'll need a clean slate and you need to lower the burn yeah I think it's cool I would probably charge a met did you membership they did a subscription because they started off with everything was three bucks I forgot to mention that that was like a key selling points like dude I think everyone's three but looks like three dollar store and people say the CAC was too high it costs too much to acquire customers that's probably true but like wish is doing it yeah you know I don't know the economics but this brings up an interesting half-baked idea we got a DM from your friend about like businesses that are in the spot brand Lissa's in where they're doing essentially a closed down slash fire sale and you want to share the idea that Narendra oh sure this good idea this morning yeah that was a great idea okay so we got actually should bring this guy in I have an investment of a good friend of mine I called email them and we became friends he invested he started a company called webshots and i I think he sold it for eighty million dollars and then he bought it back yeah if those guys come bring him in he bought it back for pennies and then sold it again for twenty or thirty million dollars and then now has bought it back again and he was like you guys are you know what something would be interesting is if you could be like a graveyard or an unwinding service Undertaker Undertaker where you can just buy these dying things and that exists it's a service to basically wind down your company you take a fee and you do this sort of fire sale and I'm sure there's services out there like this but somebody could specialize in tech companies wind down both you have talent you have hardware you have you know assets that you're trying to fire sell off and then you have all the normal business closing stuff you got to do so you don't get like taxes next year because you have to actually shut down your company officially and nobody wants to do that it's not fun and investors want to make sure that that process is done with no like funny business so that they like maximize the value and this kind of reminds me of something that I want to bring up which is I think that now that private companies are staying private for long and not going public as much what I think needs to happen is I think the venture capitalists a lot of VC firms need to start buying companies and just need to own them for the cash flow versus wanting something to go public or get bought and so what I think is gonna happen is I think a lot of these VC firms are almost going to turn into hedge funds or private equity funds we're gonna they're gonna buy and operate a lot more than they are now and that's related to that so I don't think VCS will do it but the sort of New Age VCS that are gonna be hybrids so like andreessen horowitz shifted their model or they're not a VC they're now I forgot what it's called but like they wanted to be able to just own cryptocurrency just buy and hold it so they needed to reclassify and then this gotcha moth he basically has a fund called social capital it started off as a traditional VC fund and then like he had to restart it for all kinds of reasons but one of the things he does now is he has this thing called ass back which is his special purpose vehicle for taking companies public so you're a company you don't want to go public he's already public and he just acquires a stick you know of stake in your company I believe is that this is how the mechanics work so they just did this with Virgin Galactic and so it's like a fast track to being public and getting that liquidity without having to go and be you know your own independent listing yeah I'm into that I know Andrew Wilkinson is probably listening he owns tiny capital and they do they've been doing this the companies that they own collectively I think do about 100 million in revenue and he I think takes dividends and buys companies with the cash flow right and it's an awesome model but a lot of these companies like brand lists there's no cash flow right it's gonna be a cash sink it's one of these go big or go to zero and in this stuff in this case it went to zero yeah but at the same class fee it doesn't have to be but it's also that is also valid right like to do the do what like jet tried to do just like you know they never made their core business work sold for three billion dollars because they they went for the plough money and today try to get the scale and then be the first to have scale doing what we do I know it's a it's a model what's the other one you want to about credit cards um we couldn't mention it just for a second but uh ramp ramp capital right ramp let's ramp something it's based out of nearest Breck's but from New York yeah I'm into it it launched today okay so I went my company we do let's say eight figures a year in revenue we have not seven figures in cash well I have been using one big bank for a long time and to get us to raise our credit-card limit from 30,000 to 80,000 was a nightmare oh my god a nightmare yeah I had to go meet them in person two or three times I had to show that my personal Sam Parrs tax returns it was stupid I signed up to Breck's and I got three or four hundred some hundreds of thousands of dollars in like 12 hours yeah awesome and I told these guys in like yeah we can't compete with that oh okay all right this conversation is over thank you so I really like this new business credit card space and I explained how I think they're making money but ramp just launched and what they're gonna do what they said they're gonna do is they're gonna analyze all your credit card spending and they'll tell you where repetitive purchases are coming through and I actually mentioned this on the podcast three months ago I was like I'm telling you that businesses are wasting so much money by buying multiple subscriptions of things and I think something amazing can be built by helping you save a little bit of money right that's what this is that's like a side feature they have that's not like the main feature is the same like bricks right like it's like here's a business credit card well that's how they're differentiating Breck's is advertising says we will get you better rewards right and this is will save your money yeah and I think it's cool and I'm really bullish on those things and I think the way they work is whenever a whenever a customer when I have my credit card and I go and buy something the merchant pays a 4% fee and what Breck's does is they go to master car and they go hey you guys are getting four percent fee for all this stuff give us a cut of that and we'll create more credit card users right and I think that's how they're making money I'd imagine I think so I don't know I don't know for certain but FinTech companies are very intersting we should I know a couple guys are deep and FinTech we'll bring them on a lot of people are not deep into that and not go like well front and betterment a lot of people hate those like buyers all right I don't know how they're ever gonna get bought I don't know who would buy them we'll see all right what else we got up here let's sleep I feel like Sean when we come for the last few times I've been the one doing all the research and I feel like that you're the one who's done all the research I did some research this time so first follow up on last time I was talking about corporate universities I'm gonna keep talking about anything education because I just love it I had a lot of people reach out to me about that really okay so I went back to my notes I already had these notes but I just wanted to mention a couple of them so hamburger you that's the McDonald's 119 full-time professors I thought that was interesting there's I don't how you say this Croton ville that's from General Electric so Kaiser just opened up their own med school which I find really interesting because it's what that's exactly what I was talking about where you want your own pipeline of doctors so you create your own med school then some companies do it more like training Apple University Deloitte University I think those are more like just a training program so you could be a better employee that's that's different another one that I thought was interesting so we talked about Zoho so Zoho has their own University and the graduates of that make up 15% of their workforce [ __ ] which is pretty insane so a hundred people I'm not sure exactly how many total it is to Google IT support certificate has 75,000 graduated students which is pretty crazy so I think this is gonna be a big trend so it's the opportunity to be a company that can create these education so I think what you can do is so there's these companies that are called what the hell are they called I know one is called to you or something like that that's the name of one of their companies so there's a set of companies that what they're doing is they say hey university hey Berkeley you should have an online degree and for years universities were not so interested in this and then they saw how much money gets made by online degrees and so they're like okay we'll take that money and so they don't want to you know Berkeley doesn't want have to sit there and build out an online degree portal that has like the technology the service acquire students like Berkeley doesn't know how to do any of that [ __ ] right so there's a couple there's three big companies that basically go to these universities and they say hey do you want to offer an online degree we think it brings this much incremental revenue to your University and we will run the whole thing for you so you don't have to lift a finger and here's the but we want you know 30 percent of the tuition revenue and right so what happened is all the university said yes so there's a billion dollar company that's doing this that basically offers this to all the universities so this if you go look all these you know traditional universities now have a online degree or certificate certificate program that they offer and it's run by these other companies I forgot the name of what these companies are called there's like some generic term but I think you could be that for corporations and so I think you could go to a corporation and say hey would you like to basically have your own you know developer bootcamp or university for you know essentially we're gonna pop out people who are like management consultant types and it's good for your brand to get students early and anytime you hire one of them we take essentially a recruiter fee and we'll run the whole thing for you and so I think that's one way you could take advantage of this trend so vaynermedia does this thing called 3ds or I don't know what it's called something like that and it's ten grand and you go to their office for a day and you learn how their business operates so if you're an agency owner you get to hang out with Gary Vaynerchuk for an hour but then they also have like the head of each department for an hour and they come in they explain how their companies are run and you have book in a pot you have book in the box here can you answer this actually no special guests special guests just go out you can just go out here and answer it he's just outside well show who's coming in in a second but anyway was that saying you're about to say book in a box Oh book in a box Oh Tucker who's on here he is thinking about do the same thing as well where users can pay a fee and they can come in and see how the company operates so book in the box itself is a little bit different book in a box is you want to write a book this is book in a box we're gonna help you write it promote it do the cover work all that stuff and they do this for like high-profile business type of people who want to have their own book right and that business does good it's a good business yeah he bootstrapped it they have a he what's telling me he was like Amazon's gonna buy us for so much money that's like the joke that he has said and what they want to do which is different what you're talking about what our idea is give you exposure inside these companies to the like leadership of these companies at it yeah I take you on corporate tours yeah because book in a box what they're famous for is their culture is really good like their own company culture yeah interesting and so that's and we thought about doing it as well I mean we're not big enough that we have something to offer but it's kind of a cool idea is we're like I would do it for other companies I would pay money to see it like a bar stool did a thing where you could see how their how they operate their business I would pay money and go right and vaynermedia what if you guys want to research this if you want it like if you think that your company is special and people would pay money to do it to see how big of a nurse is they put all their events on Eventbrite and you could see which how many tickets are selling per event and you can actually reverse engineer this and see how much revenue it's bringing in I like it okay I have two ideas that are I've talked about this before I'm in a big company right now and it's my first time ever in a big two thousand person company and so I'm seeing all this stuff that I'm like either are problems that need to be solved of a big company that I never saw before or homegrown solutions that I'm like dude that could be a standalone company this little home we're on thing we built and so I want to share what one of each with you on the podcast today so without further ado the first one I'll do is something that I wish I wish we had now this is a I'll call it this is kind of a far-fetched idea but personally I think is valuable so of sitting a meeting in the way meetings work at any Amazon company I believe is you have this like heavy written culture so you write a doc you write a memo before you come in and it basically says you know here's that here's what we're here to discuss here's the context here's the potential solutions here's what we believe is a recommended solution type of thing right you you write a memo that basically does a lot of the pre-work of what you would normally discuss in the meeting and the first 20 minutes of the meeting are everybody reading this thing so it's silent there's like 15 people on a long board room Amazon you read the memo and nobody talks and then after 15 20 minutes somebody basically says like hey is everyone done anybody need more time and you're like now we're good to go and then it's probably somebody needs more time but they don't say anything and then and then you start the discussion and the discussion the problem with meetings is you've guys like me who are like want to say stuff all the freaking time and so they just talk way more than anybody else [Music] recording right here so if you're listening to this you don't have video Lance Armstrong just walked in as he does you know at certain times and Lance Lance you wanna pull up that chair for a minute just for a minute here you can take this where swing this around actually you know what take the take the ridge here I'm gonna sit on this we did not plan this so I know Neil Dempsey suckered me he said not sorry he just said me don't ever sit in here it by the way either oh this is what I do so Lance we were so we have this podcast here yeah every day three days a week at this point it feels like every day right well our goal is to get to a hundred thousand daily listeners yeah per episode right right and we're doing a good job yeah we're getting close good I bet you are you have a big big following a big following and so the back story behind this podcast is and now we're doing videos and we're chopping it up like you do with forward the forward the forward the forward and the move so the second one just you know yeah the tour one's called the move and so what we've been doing is as well do video you get I don't get you that'll get you to 100,000 quicker it's helping a lot and so what we've been doing so Sean had a company that he just sold to twitch and I've got companies and all we've been doing is scheming out loud and for some reason people love listening to it and how long are they maybe an hour they've been it's been working and we have like everyone's messaging saying they're starting little things that we've been ripping on good and we just I'd listen to a few I you know what I'd kind of get you I do get I'll occasionally listen to Rogen if it's if it's a guess that I'm interested in the whole thing or the clip no it's it he goes long man three-hour hours I'm like when I did it he was like it was like so how long do you think I'll be here he's like three hours like what I've never talked to anybody for three hours like oh I'm not talking for three hours I'm not that interesting but ya know so I'll get into these crime ones me too me too I got sucked into this root of evil yep that was just super [ __ ] up I've been listening to that one no yeah you try not to and then what was the other one that was just how do real killers you know that one no but they're all about serial killers right no there's one called serial killers yeah it's awesome we crashed about we were kind of crime I listened to all those ones as well the one dree and park ass yeah and they just one of them one of those companies just sold to Spotify auto-fire a couple hundred million bucks so did the ringer the ringer Bill Simmons just keeps making money yeah apparently I think he owned I bet you he owned the majority of that company Wow so he probably walked away with a couple hundred million bucks for him we got to get you off the lacroix have you seen the mine I just leave them here have you seen the new brand at Austin Waterloo what's water it's like a sparkling water but it's better so this is what the pack I'm an investor full disclosure well this is what the podcast is now they're crushing it there so what is it it's a it's look what is it it's sparkling water but it's it's yeah I'm sure they do I mean it's all the rage well from the Austin office it's on their their HQ is on is on comm is on e Cesar Chavez as well so from from where the Hustle is or at least where it's always not moved we moved into a bike shop okay so you guys used to be on Cesar Chavez you moved up but so they're still on Cesar Chavez which is where our studio is but now they're just they're cool guys are killing it you know how much did they raise they just did a new round it's 30 they raised I want to say I'm probably getting that wrong but they did 50 million sales last year they're gonna do 100 this year holy [ __ ] no they're they're knocking yeah it's it's it's it's lighter cleaner the can they have all these different yeah we're like it's like past era it's like a white well they have a lot of flavors now is probably up to ten or twelve but it's like a retro looking can yeah it's real sort of groovy looking they brought in the guy that ran smart pop and sold that off and so he's the CEO so they got real Austin has Bob Adventures is the big Cobb who ventures out of Austin that's the guy from the vodka company is that the T so he Clayton was was from D Patti he did sweet leaf tea deep Betty and then went and started Kabu with two other guys he's now since left but anyways he's still on the board at Waterloo and hi brew coffee which is a big advertiser of ours know how love would even what's wrong - boring what's wrong with you what's wrong with this guy he doesn't like making money you know there's probably there's probably some charity right down the street where you could go give them all your dough from twitch and give them all your time just like being an uncle you get all the fun stuff and not on move artwork yeah I mean we we we launched a fund and we almost you know probably 90% of the companies were super involved with well either through the board or being on the board or just they just need help I mean you know this I mean young entrepreneurs that they might have a great idea and and be smart people but they're gonna come across things they just need help navigating and-and-and or connecting them a minute within our honestly the worst companies need the most help and I can't say them the best companies never need my help and everybody else between the good companies that I really don't have any influence in I just get to take credit in the end and I was like I dig that honesty best companies truly like lambda schools probably the best one is done pretty well I'm like a needy girlfriend Silicon Valley companies doing super well and you know I'll text the founder to be like hey what's up you want to jam on ideas you want me to help you with this problem and he's like dude I'm just busy I hate I hate when investors ask what what I we won't tell nil when he gets here well I what I do is I set monthly updates and they're very clear and succinct and I'm very transparent and they're like how can I help I'm like you can't unless you have ideas and you can tell me how you can help do it but I don't like I can't think of anything yeah like it's like I don't know how can you help you and I mean it's like what you gotta come in here and write emails for me and do work for me I mean like I don't know either like do you need interests anyone I'm like who do you know I don't know that's I mean I think the intro part is big in our world and so you know in health and wellness fitness nutrition I mean it's it's you know I've been doing this for 30 years just as an athlete so I've gotten to know everybody I mean if if we make it invest these are just examples but if we make an investment in a company like amp human and they need and it'd be very obvious that they'd be connected to Strava and vice versa it would take them a month to get a call I think you're different though thank you Sam well that's your value is what that's our value yeah everyone knows that you know everyone I mean you're a celebrity like you could get touch with everyone but like if you know I'm an investor you're an investor it's like they don't know who I know yeah and I probably don't know that many people who they can't just call email yeah I mean is that what your angle is gonna be is that you have there's that and we call I mean we refer to it as the flywheel just cuz with you know now the one show the second show the move is about 15 million downloads a year and so you know once that started to really take off then I was getting all this interesting deal flow I thought to myself we should start of fund and invest in some of these companies and and then what happens when we reintegrate or occasionally integrate some of our companies back into that audience right that course sticky group of 15 million people and so that's that's what well here's Neil that's what we bring to it yeah so yeah I mean there's the connections there is the flywheel there's the audience and then we got a pretty kick-ass Advisory Board that we pull into whether it's you know researching deal flow or or sitting on boards some and we won't take up too much time this was impromptu so he said we're going to get a sandwich we already ordered you food oh yeah well Neil texted me this morning and he's like hey can I use the guys office I go yeah we got a conference room we'll take care of food so we already have everything for you though can I just say like all these parking garages around here with the sign on that says open I went into like three of them the dudes like we're full Ike well why don't you turn off the [ __ ] sign like you've got ten cars in here that now all have to back up cuz the sign says open which crotchy parking well I ended up parking right around the corner right here I hope that's the parking thing was yellow is a rental car yep what type of card you rent well hang on let's first figure out if I'm gonna get a ticket so the thing was yellow I put my card in bought an hour well I'll hook it up we'll make it happen no I know I got a good great garage down the street that I parked in okay well it's too late now I gotta go to the airport soon but I don't know what you really want to know what kind of car yeah they gave me a it's like a suburban kind of thing yeah I Drive that at home so I didn't mind I like I know where everything is I'm beckoned I can you know it's like my cockpit so let me let me run one thing buy it and then is Neil here so you were doing a thing so we've talked about hotels out here for I've been riffing on hotels I'm really interested in hotels yep because they're growing like the biggest hotels the top ten they're growing at a really high clip right now because young people are doing experiences more you George Hincapie has this thing called the dough mystique and you were doing a ride there where someone could pay a fee and hang out with you for two days yeah we call it a camp yeah and it's probably four days of riding right and something that's been interesting us me and I've been bringing up is hotels that offer more experiences yeah and so it could be as small as being filled with peloton bikes yeah which I have found myself going to more hotels just because they have a high quality gym are you did you see that his hotel or the dough mystique did it get increased bookings because of that because of that Hampton we sold yeah and well here's the yeah I mean it's an inch his hotels it's only I think 12 or 13 rooms so it's pretty easy to fill up so if we announced and what he and I are doing the same thing in my orc in September but at a separate hotel but obviously but when we announced that camp it just kind of fills up you know it would it be a different jam if it was a 200 room hotel and that's his problem right he can either sell he either has one room full our two rooms or he could sell 200 rooms right thirteen is a tough number I would love for that to happen and that's what I told you I think my phone's ringing by the way I think it might be Neil you can answer that he wants to come up that's what I told you I wrote an email to you one time I was like you need to become the Jimmy Buffett of weekend warriors right and you need to have a hotel where people could come and dude Jimmy Buffett I mean he's a new I guess I couldn't answer your call I got roped into a podcast Neil your your big filmed right now just say hi right there the camera will wrap up here in a second yeah but I mean Jimmy's he's branded everything whether it's blenders he's doing nursing homes now Jimmy Buffett is yes so I mean he's got I mean the one when I talk about Jimmy Buffett I mean if you think about a Jimmy Buffett fan like a Parrothead right so if it's the day of the show in Dallas Texas which I say that cuz that's my mom and stepdad go every time from the minute they wake up he's owning them right they're listening to Sirius XM they listen to his station right probably at some point pregame they're drinking his beer the landshark beer then they then he'd they buy the ticket which is again his they get to the show they're buying his schwag go back they pre gated they they they like pregame or tailgate out there they're using his margarita blender he's got everything and he has a think it's a hotel he's got his clothes closed right I mean why is why Lance Armstrong not the Jimmy Buffett of weekend warriors Hotel Jimmy Jimmy I don't know if you paid attention the last seven right you know we're getting back there but it could happen I'm curling you yeah like what the world that I don't want to live it is like I can like these UFC cannabis he's all in a candidacy yeah the coral reefer that's what it's called that's what it's called the coral reefer these UFC guys are kind of doing it where you could pay money and go and work out with them and live at their gym yeah layered him Laird Hamilton's doing it you know I did for a sec and I did now dancers no I just I don't know that's how you can I just I just didn't I don't know I wouldn't do cameo that's how you could tell which celebrity is broke by how much their how much they like Gilbert Gilbert Godfried charging $50 for two minutes flat this guy's broke by the way thank you nice nice people I talked to them you know when I great but nobody yeah but like it's like uncle Joey from full house is really hurt and he's only charging fifty bucks for a three-minute spot like he's broke I feel this is horrible whereas Snoop is charged at two grand he's the one who's doing good snoop charges two grand on cameo no something like that yeah I got TJ Lavin from or whatever he he's the max I got TJ Lavin to say hi to my wife for like a hundred dollars he's like no in the real world it's stupid but that's how you could tell who's broke is by what they charge on cameo the more they charge the more bro there or lies if they charge a little bit of money then they're really here and I set mine high and it was just you know it was two people I would anybody pay that anyways can i Neal and I were gonna go have lunch oh yeah well let you mean lunch with us are you're gonna keep podcasting I'm gonna wrap up here in a few minutes yeah so why don't you guys I don't want to take you see we were just kick lands I didn't expect to do this so we were just killing time thank you we'll talk to you yeah that conference room over there's all yours that was a good surprise yeah that was fun I don't know what's gonna happen with this yeah this podcasts gonna be interesting it's gonna either be great or not great and that could be in the between so okay so are you gonna wrap up cuz if you want to wrap up we can we can either do two minutes of more stuff no you do two minutes I don't know what can you pull up the sheet again is it Scott like this was a crazy for those listening Sean and I had this thing planned out and we're gonna do a norm up so no this is great this is life happens you you take life we had Lance Armstrong just show up and come and come into the Lance Armstrong walks into your podcast you do exactly what just happened get the [ __ ] up you let the data and you talk to Lance Armstrong for 10 minutes and you don't worry about anything else so if it matters I mean this is what our office is like we do get a lot of cool people coming by yeah the guy that Lance was with the gentleman you maybe just saw on camera his name is Neil Dempsey he won't ever tell me this I'm pretty sure Neil's a billionaire and Neil's one of my investors and Neil will have felt like a billionaire I felt that Billy energy will have him well I'll have him on the podcast sometime but basically he was in his he was trying companies and kept failing and up and his late 30s early 40s he was failing failing failing he's got a job at a VC and met this guy starting a coffee shop brought to the VC everyone laughed at him they said no this we're not investing this stupid so Neil invested to his own personal money into it and that company ended up being start Starbucks and so Howard Shola you have Starbucks says that Neil is one of the people he looks up to and he's one of my investors they named the stadium one of the stadiums at Washington in Washington is it Washington University or University of Washington they named it it's called Dempsey Stadium because he donated so he's a big deal that's cool this is that's legit our office that's a great story Wow how to follow that okay III think that we should probably kind of wrap it up and hope that there's some value in here for people okay okay a little bit let me toss out one idea because we go people ideas and let me tell us that one good idea which one okay I'm gonna do that I'm gonna do the one I started so I started off talking about ok these meetings or meetings or meetings basically are like the bread and butter of big companies and so I calculated we have on on every floor we have like 20 meeting rooms say and nine floors so let's call it 10 floors there's 200 meeting rooms and every hour let's assume I don't know 80% of its occupied so I basically did the math and saw how many hours and then you think oh every meeting is on average five people in it and so you start to realize how many people hours are spent in meetings and then when you look at a meeting while it's happening there's basically no technology so the only technology in a meeting is like video conferencing typically and I think that's kind of crazy and so I actually believe that there's someone out there who could build a meeting meeting kit of some kind that makes meetings more more effective more efficient and I'm not talking about like transcribing although that's one possibility what I'm thinking about more is like the ability to give so I'm imagining like a physical device and you push it when you want to say something so this doesn't reward interrupters and loud voices because you sort of buzz in when you're ready to talk so it just has a little light next to your thing that says Sean you sounds like you have some it ended at the memo thing that alone is worth it well the memo doesn't require any like there's no business there right like companies just adopt that Prince you know that song and here's why I think you're wrong is Axios is coming out with this and there's another new product called recess that just launched and all it is is a software sass it's a service you pay money and you get this internal emailing tool that helps you write internal emails better to your company and it tells you who read it and who didn't so it's more concise or what does it help yeah cuz actually was a super concise as is yeah I think I basically I think that there's a meeting tech that will sound really boring but if you just think about how much of business happens in meetings how many hours how much salary is spent every hour in these meetings if you could make a 10 percent lift and how good the communication was or how well that meeting ran that's a big big lift and I don't think anybody's really doing much interesting stuff there I think people only really worry about like how do you schedule the meeting and how do you conference into the meeting there's a lot of running the meeting meetings and only and those are successful but I think the meeting itself could use some improvement anyway so trying to throw in an idea here but this will be known as the Lance Armstrong podcast yeah well actually get them in here a real time this I hope I think we should publish this but we'll apologize that it's only I maybe yeah and we have a ton of ideas to go through for tomorrow you you have a few on here that I'm like you're curious about yeah so well we'll get them tomorrow all right Mauro peace out

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah alright what's going on going on everyone sorry about that I'm saying part this is Alex Cheung founder of hippie Lindsay rattle off a few stats but there's a few things interesting basically how many of you have used giffy right so they have 500 million people a day going to the website so the likelihood that you've been there is quite high so Gibby's pretty interesting not only because they have 500 million people a day coming to the website but they've done this in a crazy short amount of time so the site was launched in February of 2013 right yep you have over a hundred employees or about 100 employees base here but you've built this very huge website very huge brand very very quickly raise 150 million dollars so you guys have done a lot in a short amount of time so today we're gonna talk a little bit about that story but I'm a pretty I said this at my last Q&A I'm a very casual person and I want to make this about you all so I'm gonna have this iPad up the whole time and go to what's called a slide Oh slide Oh calm type-in hustle carnies and ask questions as we go and I'll be able to pull them up but first of all welcome hey thanks thanks for being here so tell us a little bit about give some contacts I already gave a little bit of contacts but give a give contacts as to what context as to what giffy is how big it is just so people have a little bit of a background of the company yeah so if he is a search engine so we are essentially a search engine but the difference is we are the only search engine and messaging so you know messaging is blowing up right now if you look at your screen use time it's probably all iMessage or messaging apps there has never really been a company or it or a product that has been able to create search inside of a messaging app and that's exactly what we've done we're in every messaging app in the world we're in snap Instagram whatsapp we not reach out yet sorry oh very soon someday except for the whole Chinese like situation going on right now we're in all the messaging apps we have the number one behavior we've gave people a search and messaging right now over we know that at least 500 million people use search every day in giphy and we serve about more than 7 billion pieces of content a day so we're at scale now and so we you know we we pretty much can hit everyone on the internet our reaches if you think about snap and Facebook and whatsapp they all have user reach and it's it's it's kind of peaked out because they've kind of maximized how big their products are going the the big difference that we've done is were a superset of all companies because we are embedded in every one of those apps so our reach is exponentially growing all the time so we can reach pretty much everyone on the internet at any given moment got it and so Alex and I have been chatting over the past couple weeks to prepare for this and I thought that his story was most it was one of the more interesting stories in of everyone I've talked to because he has a very unique philosophy and perspective on life you know someone like me I think I just wanted to I like building businesses they're exciting for me I tend to kind of stick for one thing for a while whereas your career you've jumped around you could you consider yourself you said you feel like a musician almost like a rock star and you're able to jump around I didn't say that what did you say so no so fire a rock star with Sonu well what did you say no I said it's like a bad okay I got really bad like indie rock band you know like playing over in Bushwick maybe Greenpoint every once in a while if we were cool enough so you said you're like a band sorry yeah because you're you jump around from project to project and that's not something that people typically say when they're raising money or talking to people and so your outlook is is significantly different from most everyone I've talked to or at least you admit it and they don't so to talk about like how this outlook came to be can you explain a little bit in like 30 or 60 seconds to your background and kind of how you got to to where you are now I originally an engineer so I'm a hardware engineer but so I worked in hardware I worked at Intel I worked at a bunch of different places and then I went to school here at Parsons and went back to design so I was a graphic designer and the fashion scene for a little bit but I found out you can't really make money at the graphic designer or actually like you can't make money at anything in New York and so then you have to go back into doing tech which is like the only place where you can actually make a decent living so with that you know if you're going on that you're the year-long kind of strategy it's really I mean I think everyone who's young knows I'm a little older than all of you I just maybe look a little younger but I'm not Millennials right now they do about a year maybe it's less actually like a lot less and then they'll jump from jump you know like it's called you know they call it the gig economy but it's really about trying to maximize as much as you can do in a short amount of time and then moving on which is exactly if you think about like bands what they do is you do an album you go on tour and they figure if no one wants to go on tour then you go on to do another album you and that may suck and then you keep doing it until you like get in a Volvo commercial and then you're making a ton of money and then you just end up doing that one song forever until you get really old and then go on tour so what we do is the way that I try to figure I've been doing startup since it's been 25 years since the early or late 90s and this is about my 12 startup I've been a part of a bunch of different startups that people have done I found it a bunch of startups and what you really want to do is you want to optimize for that first year you know I've spent a lot of time in companies trying being super stubborn and trying to get something to happen and you want to be a little bit stubborn but you also want to know when it's not the right time in place when your song is like not gonna be number one on the Billboard you know top 40s and so you usually try to put a year in which is kind of like how school works right it's your major you put a year in and then you kind of see where you are at the end of the year and if you can keep going then you do a year at a time so it's not when people young people say hey we're going to do this for the rest of our lives you're like okay if your company's still around maybe and then if you stand then when you grow up and you like have things that you want to do and you have to lay be a part of the world maybe so well the way that I like to think about it is you you plan for four or five years you plan for forever but you go in one-year chunks and you do as much as you can in a year and then you if it doesn't work you fold that and then you move on which is pretty much what I've been doing with my career for most of my life so I'll play I told you this earlier I was like oh I'll play devil's advocate on that because you're you said that you plan you you said I'm not gonna plan it too far in advance because I don't know if my company will even be around in a year but yeah where you guys are now you've raised 150 million dollars you're at scale the likelihood that you're gonna be around for a long time is quite high and you never know you're right but I would bet and a hundred and fifty one things 150 million things have bet that you're going to be around for a while when you're talking talking to investors are trying to raise money or trying to recruit employees do you tell them that you're only looking ahead one year at a time or you're only planning one year at a time like that because if I were wanting to invest I would be nervous about that no I think I would take the other way investors want to know that you have a one-year plan they don't want you to be like investors you got to remember VCS have a seven-year return window you need to return their money and they need to make 10x on their money because they're capitalists right so like I mean Jeff Bezos just said like last week that he was hoping you know he was waiting he was just holding on to until the eventual day when Amazon fails all companies will fail at some point someone's just going to come out and be better so what the VCS what they really want to do is if you follow Paul Graham's maybe it's my mind if you follow like YC Paul Graham's advise startups are all about growth and so if you're not growing then you're not a start-up and you're not doing something successful and you probably have a year to make so the way that I go into VC meetings is hey in a year we're going to be here and I usually put a 10 X number on whatever our KPI is and I'm like this is what I'm committing to and if we can raise the money we will get there and if you can get there then you're successful the worst thing a VC wants to see is hey in one year in five years we're gonna do this thing and then there's no plan for the first year and it's going to take us maybe four years to figure it out and then we'll figure it out on the fifth year they want to see growth right away and so if you plan your Li growth 10 X 10 X 10 X 10 X that's exactly what they want to see and if you can't pull that off maybe you get a little bit more time but if you can't pull that off for two years then you should probably sell the company or do some find something else because you just aren't there at the right time in place so I'd say VCS actually prefer you to optimize for the year so especially for the next round of funding but have a outlook for the future so you plan for the future but you really really operate in you're a year at a time so well then what would happen if your company didn't tenha I mean a lot of people when they're first getting started like I get I get asked this question all the time when do I know when to quit or how do I know when to quit and is that your metric is 10x growth I mean like if you didn't hit that would you what would you do yeah I think because startups are all about growth it's only there's only two things that you're optimizing for you're optimizing for traffic or people right like you're looking for user growth or you're looking for revenue growth and there's two types of businesses if you want to make an e-commerce company that's just a lifestyle business that's making money don't take any funding take the bare minimum you can and then you're just kind of chilling out and you're making money and that's totally fine that's like you know having a pizza parlor or having any kind of like operating business that's a totally cool thing to do and there's funds for that but if you're talking about high growth hyper growth startups unless you're making 10x gains every year your company probably isn't going to be on the hockey step curve if you follow that you know like everyone talks about the hockey though that's an exponential growth that's gonna be 10x growth every year so if you can't do that and when you're starting out then there's something fundamentally wrong about your product market fit or you're not operating correctly you give it a little bit of time and then you pivot or you either there's a couple options either then just start making revenue and then just build a business like a small growth business or you keep optimizing for trying to get that curve up if you can't get the curve up at some point there's something wrong right and that's when you have to ask yourself this is something that you want to keep doing or do you find something else when you were starting out was your goal I mean I'm sure it's many people's gold to find that 10x growth company but did you start it thinking I think this can grow 10x or did you feel like you just started something fun and fell into it so it's that's I look at it differently it's not like you have an idea and you think it can grow 10x like obviously anything can grow 10x possibly but it's more you just put the number on the board and you say what are all the ways you're gonna get there because if something was so obvious that it's gonna grow 10x naturally like someone would have already done it you know like someone's gonna pull it off it's like gonna be it's it's uh it's too easy of a problem to solve so what you really want to do is take the thing that no one thinks it's ever gonna be big like a gift search engine and then put 10x on the board and then figure out every possible way that you can get to that 10x and then that is when the creativity opens up and you're like oh like in our case it was like we did we actually did 10x every year for the first four years and it was like 10 you knows like three million people than it was 300 thousand three million 30 million three hundred million so we've been doing that every year and we got to a point when we were like there's no way that this is gonna do this without we're not gonna be able to hit 300 million until we get onto Facebook but Zuckerberg had just said that he would never put gifts on his platform like two months before and so everyone's like you're dead and we're like no we need to get this gifts onto Facebook and so we hacked this whole solution into Facebook through like a flash player where you could actually play gifts on to Facebook and we did it and then you see the 10x grow and then next year we were on stage at f8 with Mark Zuckerberg and he was sending gifts on the gift II platform and so it really is put the put the goal and then go towards the goal if that answered that question yeah it does when you when you did create that huge goal but something I've I don't know if you guys experienced this but when I'm working with team my team as CEO or founder I'm like I'll create these huge goals and there's immediate pushback of like oh that this can't be done what did you do to motivate your team oh yeah if you put these things there's two types of people they see that as we can't do that and there are other people that are oh that's a crazy goal I wonder how we get there and the people that we work with are the ones that are like I if you give me 1% chance off and it's possible we will figure out a way I like the low odds because the high odd things like those are boring want one they're boring and everyone's doing them I like if you're in Bitcoin right now lurking or crypto it's like a billion companies are doing obviously well now everyone's losing money but if it's like a gift search engine and no one really knows what you're doing and you put these goals it's a challenge so I think the startup people the people who are the boldest and the craziest are the ones that are going to see the 1% chance and go for it and then figure out the plan to get there and then have the team that is going to embrace that small chance of winning because being the underdog and doing something crazy like we are doing a large percentage of Google search traffic like we are like a multiple chunk of Google search traffic no one thought we could compete with Google they have 30,000 employees we have a hundred but yet we're competing every day and beating them and so I love that and you want a team that has that kind of challenge if you have a team that's like we can't do this you have the wrong team and your startup is gonna fail everyone just work at Google or Facebook because that's where people go when they give up so just a reminder if you do have a question just message me here and I'll pull it up guys like that talk to me a leg up they all work at Facebook talk to me a little bit about the very first six months of the company what was where did the idea come from and what was it what were the first maybe three to six months of trying to get users like so uh in the very beginning it was a project that a friend and I were talking about I had been doing I had done like six other projects and launched them and we added like a anonymous chat thing we had like a a non-profit like square reader thing we were working on we crypted some crypto stuff so this was just one fun project out of it's like if you're putting out an album this was just one of like the b-sides that we put out and it was uh ended up taking off and in maybe 15 minutes of it starting to get traffic we got offers from everywhere for funding wait wait wait wait what how did you even get how did they get that much traffic early on someone you know I actually just never meant it to go public I sent it to four friends just as like a fun thing for us to define just fine and we're like oh this will be our secret weapon we can now find gifts on the Internet when no one else can and then someone like sent it to a friend and they sent it to a friend and then it got on the cover of Gizmodo and then it got cover um of everywhere and then people were yelling at me because they were telling me it's soft and I was like I wrote this and like about that long the search engine was like three lines of code and so then in the neck the first month was just me working on it full-time just trying to get it not to crash we got offers of funding and then I was like okay we'll take a little bit I brought out all my unemployed friends to come work on it they were happy because they had jobs we ended up like we had work at home Wednesday's which is like not a good idea and so the first few months it was just us hanging out just trying to figure out what is this thing and we would you know we'd go to the standard and Mike have wasters and like this back when Rosa was still a thing and we would hang out and then six months into it we were like okay if we're going to devote the next year of our lives to this let's like commit to it and then let's think about the plan of what we're trying to do and that's when we put the 10x goal on the board and then we got serious and we started coming up with a strategy and you can exactly see if you look at our Google Analytics our traffic was like you know big peak and then they call it the trough of despair where in all your traffic goes away and it Peaks out until we for like three or four months until we got serious and then the traffic goes like that and it's been going that way since those first six months when we stopped eating oysters what were you doing to get that traffic up everything I mean like you matters what kind of for us in the very beginning it was SEO like we wanted to be synonymous with gif it was getting integrated into platforms it was pretty much every trick you could possibly think of to get traffic in the very beginning it's very easy to double your traffic cuz you're only talking about hundreds of thousands of people when you start getting into the tens of millions you have to change your strategy to something a little more drastic and wanted to start going into the hundreds of millions of people that's when you have to start picking backing off of the large networks so your strategy always change with every other goal and so uh you know our what we were good at was constantly changing the strategy for the goal that we put on the board so you have to be super adaptive because the internet changes every day huh when you are working with your team how often were you changing strategy every day so and how many employees did you have when you're changing every day because I got what I love doing is I love going to companies that I like or startups that are growing quickly and I like looking at the glass door we're job reviews on how to handle creepy what I like looking at what's what employees say it's like to work there because I want to learn what good CEOs are doing or how what bad CEOs are doing so I don't do that and one thing that most a lot of people complain of is strategy is constantly changing so when you were doing that how many people were you and how are you doing with that you know we in the very beginning there were five of us for the first almost year and then we went we doubled to like ten and then twenty and now there's a hundred and we used to reorg every month because when you have five people you can't just do one job you have to do all the jobs and so we would reconfigure for every strategy and so we kept reorg again we made it every quarter and now then we made it every six months and now we all now there's enough people that we do it about once a year and if you are that type it's a start-up you know we we are competing literally competing with Google and Facebook every day and we we don't have the resources to compete with them so there's no way we're gonna beat them on a head-to-head basis so we have to be a lot more clever and we have to change and we have to adapt because uh you know the benefit we have is work far more creative or so we think but we are much more nimble and we can change faster we can change our product in a day and they take that it takes some months or years to change their product so I would say you need a in a startup set scene if you don't have employees that are ok with that you're going to fail like it just is the nature of the game like there's you know people will come in and say hey we need a four year plan if you have a four year plan you've already failed because you that means you haven't it you're not adapting to the changes of market so we have to change all the time it's a fundamental nature of the company and so you know what we do is I think part of why what why people stick around to is you know in our company values we have all these crazy values one is the heart emoji we optimized for the company first so like we have this thing where it's a one of our sayings it's like product over people or people over product that's sorry that was from that was from Google where we optimized for the people in the company and when you optimize for the the environment of the people then all the products naturally end up showing up but when you optimize for the product you get a bunch of people that just care about their their careers and the product and not about the community of people that are actually working on it so if you ever watched Friday Night Lights it's like we are that Odessa like not that awesome well staffed or but kind of like attractive team and we just end up doing just better than everybody else because we're just craftier because we have to be and we like each other that's one big thing how so you have this very you may push back on this but you have this very family-oriented culture it seems like right yeah the difference between a family and a team is you can't fire your family so whereas on a team you can replace someone so how are you balancing this this culture with the reality that you have to make money you have to you have people you have outside investors to please so there are two types of bands both of them are on giffy like let's say there's like the Beatles who were a band and they stuck together as the as the music changed they went from like the 50s all the way to like 6070 they've got and they made crazy different albums if they all stuck together even though they had tensions they were a family so it was really about the people first and the music second and then you have bands like war like who knows who's in court they just get random people coming in and for that that's all about the music and not about the people and that totally works but that's why they can never change they could never not wear costumes and like do this whole thing because that's like the one thing they do right so if you're gonna be adaptive you have to really focus on the people of the company because you need to be able to change configuration pivot do all these things so we spend a lot of time on building the community of the of the company most of the first early employees were friends of mine you know people who know you know they're not going to abandon you for a job at Facebook or Google like we're all in it together like we always say like we either succeed together we or we fail together and if people aren't you know useful in when we grow we try to find other roles for the like we it's like people are going to we're gonna optimize for the people and what their best good at so any we've had multiple people large percentage of people move roles within the company over the last five years and we'll move people and we'll try to get them to the the best point they are one thing that we have is we have another value that we call post goofy because I think a lot of companies think that this is going to be your like last job ever and that's not true like everyone here has unless you're like just right out of college I have multiple jobs right that company that you were at last year is not or maybe four years ago if you're you five years ago was not the was not the company that you you're gonna be in in four or five years so are promised everyone is we are going to give you the skills and the training to be better and make a lot more when you leave the company than when you started so we we put that commitment on and people stay and we've had very little turnover over the years because and then when people are ready to leave I'm always surprised that people are long are sticking around longer than a year but when people stay for four or five years and if they want to leave her like great you know now go be fancy someplace else but say nice things about us and maybe not a Facebook or Google cuz that's giving up talked about the business model we actually didn't mention it but basically you have five hundred million people some of your what coming in coming to give you a day you you've raised all this money you said that you're starting to make revenue this year a lot of speakers we have who speak at these events our bootstraps so they're making money from day one you're a little bit you're not in that category so talk about how you're playing on on building the business and the very beginning you know it was you you you have a couple different like again you either optimize for growth or you optimize for revenue if you try to do both you're most likely gonna fail it both and you're not gonna get hyper growth like hyper growth like if you look at it making money is actually the easiest problem easier problem than having growth a lot of people can make money or have really good retention but it's really hard to get hundreds of millions of people to your platform so we optimized for growth for the first five years and that's where we got to and now that we have scale like we have more inventory in our platform than we know what to do now it's about turning on to the the second phase of revenue growth and that's what we're doing right now so we started in January and our business models very very simple the two most monetizable platforms on the internet are Google and Facebook one is us one is an ad network an ad platform based off of search and one is an ad network based off of feeds and so our business model is very simple we are search and messaging so and we also have feats in messaging so these are trending feeds so we just follow the Google and Facebook model and that's all we're doing we are the largest ad network and messaging right now no one's been able to figure out how to monetize messaging because no one's been able to create an ad network in messaging since we're in every messaging app in the world and we have the search behavior we can now build and what this is what we have built the world's largest ad platform for messaging so for you know the way to think about it is every possible message is a possible search and every possible search is a piece of media and every piece of media the potential ad so there's seventy eight trillion messages sent every year if you've monetized that at Facebook CPM that's that's almost a true that's like 780 trillion or a billion dollars in in revenue potential right there just in messaging and that's oh that's more than global advertising right now so messaging has the potential to be as big as the entire advertising ecosystem and that's all we're doing we just want one percent of that maybe to no big deal I mentioned this earlier with active when I was adaptive but something that I hear often is people say before they're starting something they get nervous about all the legal implications typically what I say to them is like you know you first need to create something a product that users actually want people actually want and then like if I were you I would worry about making sure that legally you're perfectly sound because the likelihood that you're going to get sued is a lot lower than the likelihood that you're going to create something that people actually want so focus on that first you guys are in a similar or aren't up in a field where I would imagine you get a lot of law like people threatening to sue you for copyright reasons is that no no no no no no no what oh you can talk about most San Francisco startups I won't name them they're friends of ours they all ride off of fair use fair use is cool and like there's a lot of legal precedent on it but once you start to try to monetize no one wants to advertise on your platform when you're using a bunch of weird like fair use kind of stuff that maybe they're content on the internet so I used to work at MTV on music videos on Midtown and I did a lot of the licensing on that side so day one we we we decided to be a hundred percent licensed content so we have a bunch of UGC content which is about 10% of our catalog but 90% of our catalog is all licensed so this is every sports league the NFL NBA all those all of the the movie studios all the pretty much anything that you see we have licensed so we have actual rights to distribute that and our users to use which is something that no one else in the world really has and that took us five years to get that's why we're totally from a copyright point of view we've we don't have problems because we work with the artists and the content providers directly because they see this as a huge win where here's someone that's not ripping off their content that's working with them directly and so this is why we get that it's easy for us to get advertisers because we've been so straight on board with that I we have about eight minutes left alex has specifically said that he may not answer every question but every question is he's game for any question to be asked so if you do have something that you you you want to at get ass or get answered feel free to put it up there because we've talked about how he's not afraid of any question can you talk about some of the let's states with this question advice for building the tech MVP so your first version has a non-technical founder you built yours in-house right yeah built myself yeah don't don't out like it's very hard to outsource your product because the life cycles are too slow you outsource it and then you like get feedback and then you outsource again you get feedback if you're gonna like if you have a small growth company where you just need an app that doesn't need iteration and you can make a little bit of money that's - oh it's right there - it's totally cool that's fine but if you're actually gonna try to compete on some hyper growth scale you have to have a technical co-founder like you have to be you need to build it in-house there's no way that you're gonna compete because you have to again you have to be faster and more clever than all the other people you're competing with and if it's a good idea which it probably is some YC company is going to crush you like day one so why even bother you know like every day people come out of business schools saying I have the greatest idea it doesn't really matter there's a lot of great ideas it doesn't matter until you build it like you just have to be able to build it yourself when you were what you've worked on a dozen or so companies in your career were you ever partnered with someone who wasn't technical yeah so I timed I would I pick to be like who cares like a lot of time it's like John and Lenin and like Paul McCartney right even though Paul wrote all the all the songs they both still get credit like I I was the CTO of half those companies you know because I'm the technical person a lot of times I have a business person cuz go figure like engineers and designers we don't really like talking to people too much like we spend all of our time locked in a basement working on code like we are naturally not social people and then will they come on stage and have to talk to people but I'd rather just be at home like working on stuff maybe watching some TV not that this isn't awesome thank you but so you you want a partner it's usually a technical person you want like a little bit of an introvert and you want an extrovert someone that goes out and does all the business meetings because you know that person is not building anything but the person building something doesn't have the time to go out and do all of that stuff so 80% of startups successful startups are done by two people or more YC almost never invest in a startup of one person but on the corollary side 65% of stars failed because of founder tension so like you're not gonna get there unless you have a co-founder but you're more likely gonna fail because of your co-founder so what do you do when you were working with some of your business co-founders what was one of what made you interested in working with them friends first like I I made the mistake in the long in the early days of just picking the smartest people that thought were cool and eventually what happens is you got a lot of money and then people get greedy or like people don't have different interests or you know you your your your professional careers diverge and there's nothing personal keeping you there together and so now I only work with friends because friends you know and people say it could ruin your friendship well you know if you're in it with a company and you're in your really truly friends you'll see it through like you'll see it through to the end right like I would rather work with me and also like if you're gonna work with work eight twelve sixteen hours a day you wanna hang out with your friends right like you don't really want to hang out with random people that left Google do you have a Facebook profile I do but I deleted all my posts like years ago so I had every profile but there's no content cuz like why would you be on social media right let's answer this top question yeah and this is this is interesting for me as well because you have this very unique perspective of this one year one year planning and you you uh you just have an interesting perspective and life style to me so what is your personal on game that was not that into I live in the East Village in a tiny apartment like to eat pizza and game when do you walk away you walk away when you're not doing interesting work when it's not fun anymore when you're not enjoying when the pain of going to work become so much that it's not worth and you everyone's been there and that's when you're like okay you wrapped up as long as you can keep going and you like hanging out with your friends and you're doing cool things keep keep doing and this is the longest job ever rap I never thought we would be here this is my sixth year working on this it's mostly because the community that we have is so good that I actually there is no other place I can legitimately say this that I would rather go work because I go to work with my friends every day and the the work changes everyday but that's much more interesting as soon as all my friends left I would be like okay we probably have to figure out something else well answer that most recent question in a second but before we do how you you're you're you're painting a very nice foot picture of loving to go to work how many times have you felt this is horrible I'm out of here I quit like every day but I mean that's that's the day that that means you care like if you just have our apathetic that means you don't care at all like it's better to care and be like okay but I'll get there tomorrow I think the difference is for me I've been doing this for 25 years and so like I'll always keep doing this is like this is like my thing you know like I I will do another one after this and keep doing it and doing it and if I can work with my friends so for me this is all about getting VCS to pay for my life so that I don't have to get a real job and I don't have to work at Facebook or Google because who wants to work in a carpeted office place that's so weird because carpet in New York is disgusting every feet outside so for me it's really about maintaining like just being creative as doing as much as I can do and if if I can get my friends to do it I'll keep doing this forever if you can keep going on and it's fun why not like a little where else am I gonna work probably I mean I'm really bad at making coffee too so probably nowhere let's address this question down here Alex about giffy ads right now I don't see a lot of advertisement or ads on Kippy but what happens if you take it to the limit and try to and try to it's right here this last time let's say you take it to the limit and you try to monetize as much as possible what's that going to look like that and how you think it how you think that's gonna impact users so the secret which most of you I think people don't understand is you have already been all sending branded content 90% of all the content our site is branded we just don't haven't charged for it so you've already sent an ad we just never got paid for it and so you people are like oh these ads are going to be disruptive guess what they're already all at like 90% of them are as we just haven't put a pay gateway on to wait what does that mean what why do you why are you saying their ads already because it's all branded content so most of our content comes from trailers from movies they come from McDonald's from like Pepsi from all these places they're all these brands are putting up content every day like the WWE does a really good job of putting up you know these promos for like things going on scenes this is all advertising for them we just haven't charged them yet I see we have for a few of them and we will for all of them not except for the ones we like because they're awesome because what's the difference between an ad and good content you know there is no difference in this world let's do maybe two or three more questions let's say answer this one about mistake so you've grown to over a hundred people now 150 million dollars in funding what are some of the biggest mistakes that you've made and what have you learned along the way I know there's a ton huh just the top two like every mistake you ever think you're gonna make we've probably made like like everywhere everywhere yeah what did they say I think I saw this in a fortune cookie the master is one that makes 10,000 mistakes like the the thing is if you're not making mistakes that means you're not trying hard enough and you're not actually progressing so I would say biggest mistakes have been making a gift search engine but that ended up being turning out pretty well I don't know I'm too big of a question like everything okay wearing today was a mistake and why why don't you or why do you dislike Google and Facebook so much and you dislike them so much so they came and offered a massive amount of money would you sell them matters how much money like it it always matters on how much money but know the difference between Google and say those it's fine I've worked at a large big companies but for anyone young that's trying to do interesting things you know they just have it is it is a different it is like it may be the way to put this if you're like an indie rock band and you just want to make good music there are these huge huge bands that kind of just take all the market share and like our monopolies and and we like working with them but I mean like I actually love Facebook and Google like we have a lot of friends there we work with all their product teams but we are just a different type of business and we're competing like we're competitive right and so I would say I don't really have a beef with the companies I Maura have if you're young and you're interesting I think you should try to do something else first and then go retire there when you're old and boring I'm gonna ask just one more question so go ahead and pull up the app and and vote on anything you want and I'll try to wait a second until we see some of the some of the top ones but before I get to that last one you can see all the amass ghosts you see a massive amount of gifts what's the favorite mostly what's your favorite one that you've seen that changes every like five minutes we probably like yes people can upload gifts on giffy they can upload we get millions of uploads well here to this what's the most popular one on the platform it literally changes every 10 minutes it changes on what what's going on popular what's going on in the world right now like a few weeks ago as ariana grande now it's cardi B now it'll be anything that's really going on pop culture it's kind of saying like what's the most popular thing in your head right now like I don't know I won't forgot it don't you have all-time stats yeah but but but popular for today or for all time all the time well all time is tough because all time is like you get the history of momentum if you go to youtube you know the all-time best videos are like it's not like it was like evolution of the dance for like years sure but there's a most popular one what's it for on your platform in terms of all-time most popular well for 2018 it was a car it was cardi B on Jimmy Fallon saying ocher you seen that and that and that's that was like the most popular of all time or of 2018 of all time it's you know probably some random cat gift that's been around for 20 years cat playing piano that's a good one okay last question when let's do the I don't think you could see here we'll do this one it's the most it's the most up voted the future of the business of the company what's gonna happen in the next one I know you don't like planning so five years I don't know probably have self-driving cars get gift fee like gift e pizza I don't who knows what's gonna happen in five years but the next thing that we're doing is we you know we went gifts we went stickers and really now that we're messaging we're really about bringing content and new formats to messaging so we launched a video platform three weeks ago at the Metro graph we'd had a premiere of a very short short 18 second or less video Film Festival casing nice dad and some of our friends from a moment the met were judges so in q1 we're gonna launch an entire short form video plot product which is basically the number one reason way people are gonna watch content and messaging so that will be something that you should watch for it's coming out very soon the future really is if we are search for messaging we are going to take a large percentage and our goal is to be 50 percent of Google search we're gonna be and then a hundred percent of Google search and then we our goal is to take out Google first from search so that we can be the old company that you don't really want to work at but that's okay cuz we will all be old and boring and so we will love our jobs and then we're gonna go after Comcast and take out all the media because no one watches long-form TV unless it's on Netflix anymore so we think content can be much much shorter all the great shows like The Today Show Good Morning America I don't know anyone that's young that watches those but there should be versions of it HQ is doing a good job of making game shows more fun but what about all of daytime TV that supposedly millions of people in Middle America watch but no one but no one here watches if you're here otherwise you'd be at home watching TV but I think the future really is going to be a combination of messaging and communication networks where media comes into that and it's going to be a big mix of a crazy world where new content is going to be invented new formats are going to be invented and the ways that people we watch it are going to be totally new and you can kind of see the trend this is why 18 T and Time Warner Verizon all these communication companies are merging with entertainment companies because the future really is when entertainment messaging communications search are all one platform so that's the long-term vision we we want to take out basically all of the people in communication and entertainment put it into one platform that's very similar to look with an MTV brand and make advertising not be horrible because advertising on the internet sucks so bad that it's really really painful and we have the one advertising format that actually doesn't suck that people send every day millions million hundreds of millions of time today billions probably billions let's actually wrap up with the quick answer to this last one currently what's stressing you out the most throughout your day stressing like what yeah what stresses you out oh man everything is seamlessly like things seem like they're going great the company does I mean you know you've got to keep the company everyone employed so my number one duty is to make sure everyone in the company is happy and they were currently employed and that we can get to keep doing that so that's a stress like the whole political climate peace in the Middle East I don't know I didn't eat anything all day so I'm kind of like a little dizzy I drank like three cups of coffee before I got here so pretty much everything in the world is probably stressing me out right now and then I'll go back to work and my friends will just chill me out and that's kind of work is more like the less the least stressful place of the world and then this whole situation going on here I think you guys probably stressed at me out a little bit too so maybe that's it well if only we could all be so light-hearted as you but I just wouldn't hearted I'm totally serious yeah that's my takeaway well look I appreciate you coming man I'm a huge fan of gippy maybe you'll be hanging out for a few more minutes before you head out but thank you for coming I know people still might have some questions afterwards will they be able to cut you over here sure I think so I'll be over there with my entourage turtle there they are right over here well look thanks for coming man we really appreciate it we've learned a lot and I and I appreciate you taking time

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'm John I'm the founder and CEO of betterment raise your hand if you've heard of betterment oh my god okay good so most of you raise your hand if you're a customer of betterment okay like a little less I'd like to get that ratio better but that's not why we're here today you're here to hear about my failures and experiences and understand how those might help you in your own entrepreneurial journey so I'm excited to talk about that I'll just say quickly for context betterment is an online financial advisor we take all the things a great financial adviser would do if you had one and we make them smarter faster cheaper and better for instance if you have a bunch of you know expenses and you've got your direct deposit coming in and you find yourself trying to manage your cash flow month-to-month in your bank account we'll do that for you automatically will sweep money back and forth where it needs to be to help you make the most of it or if you're planning for your family's retirement or your kid's college savings will tell you what accounts to open how much to put in each of those accounts and keep you on track to your goals that's what I mean by financial advice when we when we started back in the early days I had a had a belief that I would just kind of get to think about things and and and work on the product and my co-founder my first co-founder Sean used to say what you have to do John is you have to make it real as quickly as possible I would talk about all the things that I wanted to build and the services that I wanted to deliver and you'd say you know what before we can design all these like these graphs and things you just have to you have to make a sign up that people can use and do those basic things print your business cards and this advice has stuck with me really more than anything else I that that I've learned in the in the past many years when we would go to pitch VC's and early advisors and things like this the thing that made a difference with them was when we could show them something tangible right so actually having a sign-up process that worked and having a website that we're making it real for them it wasn't just a concept but it was a tangible thing made all the difference in the world and so when people ask me what's the number one thing that I should do to get my company off the ground who do I need to talk to just go out and make it real make it happen and and make it something that people can can touch and feel so people believe in your story at that time I was doing everything by myself I was I was coding I would I would get into these like 24 hour you know almost trance-like states of just trying to perfect a certain part of the site and I loved that time right like that flow that you get into when you're really working on something that you're passionate about and and and I was doing the engineering I bought like 40 legal books about securities regulation and derivatives and all of the things that I'd have to know to set up a regulated financial entity it was too much I took on everything and over time I I realized that I wasn't going to be able to do everything by myself and I started talking to friends and those friends started wanting to join up and sign up and help me and what I learned early on was the role of a founder is to try to have nothing to do you've got to build a team you've got to find other people who can take all that work off of you just this week I was talking to one of my senior team members and I said to her you know like this is gonna sound crazy but if I have work to do it's a really bad thing right you don't want to be relying on me for this deliverable right we've got to find somebody else to do this it takes an amazing team and you have to constantly be delegating we found you know fortunately people came to us over the years and the reason that they came to us was primarily for the mission from day one I was talking about how I wanted to change the world I wanted to build financial services around the customer in a way that they hadn't been done before and that mission that idea of changing a really broken industry resonated with people and that's why amazing people like Danny again or Alex pinky or all of our our team came to join us and left great jobs in you know big financial services companies where they had great incomes and a lot of job security they came for the mission and to me that that mission is the one thing about betterment that hasn't changed this is something I feel like we we got right from the beginning having a mission is so critical I believe to building your business in attracting talent and attracting capital and that passion that you feel about the mission is going to come through in every one of your conversations I see many of you smiling and nodding you feel that you know it and don't be afraid of that conviction I feel like some people it won't resonate with them right like they're gonna be like you're a little crazy like what are you doing but I think the right people are gonna be attracted to that passion and they're going to join your cause and that's gonna serve you for years to come you got to hang on to that I've been doing this 10 years now I've been building betterment for a long long time and it's been the majority of my professional career at this point an amazing spot to to learn a lot about growing and running a business but it takes constant energy to do that and one of the things that really keeps me going is coming back to the mission coming back to why I started that's coming back to our customers and that that helps drive me forward as well I mentioned that mission is important and customers are important customers is the is the other thing that really keeps me going just over Thanksgiving I was home in Dallas where I'm from with my parents and and I had coffee with a couple of customers their betterment we do this program where we send out emails to people in our hometowns and a lot of the product and marketing teams do this I I got so much energy from these conversations since it was it's amazing to connect with like real like random people you don't know and and hear their stories and in this case it was great because they they had no issues with the service they were like right you know just mega fans right they were so excited to be talking with me and sharing what they wanted to see on the platform that was new and they they loved the high interest smart saver account and they loved the account aggregation and so on it was great and I brought that energy back to the team now we do lots of things at betterment to try to build customers into everything that we do we do customer week where every single person in the company is on the phones with our customers this is a bit of a throwback to the early days when literally was a room of you know four to ten people as we scaled and at that time we had no customer service and there was just a phone tree and it was sort of like ring it one person's desk and then ringing the next person's desk and we would see like you know how long we could wait like with the phone's ringing before somebody picked it up but I was talking to all the customers back in those days and we all were and we all had this very close relationship with them and I loved that and and when someone was on the phone of the customer if they had a problem you knew because you're in the same room with them and and so you'd hear what customers needed from us all the time as we've scaled we're now almost 250 people and we're no longer all on the same floor we're not even all in the same building and it's harder now to keep in touch with our customers I get to do it because I can go and sit with the customer experience team anytime I want and and I still do customer week and all that but a lot of our team doesn't have that same access in like and memory and and an ability to connect so my new year's resolution for 2018 was to bring the customer to life within betterment we've done so much more this year to research our customers we've done more surveys more panels more getting out there and I just I think to me this is all back to basic stuff but it's a reminder to me of how important it is because I felt like as we were growing we're getting further and further from the reason we're doing this we were getting further from our customer in the early days we didn't have to do panels because like like many of you who are hustling and entrepreneurial we were constantly ourselves out talking to customers and I just I can't overemphasize the importance of that and those insights and cataloging them and acting on them you have a great instinct if you're talking to your customers all the time one of our values at betterment is is iterate to breakthrough we have this concept of constantly trying to improve things and I boil that down into this lesson of never settle I think it's possible to get to a spot where you feel like things are pretty good and the product is working and maybe maybe you're you're dominant in the market or you don't see any competition but it's coming I personally can tell you like we've been at this for 10 years now where the market leader in the space and every year there are new entrants there's new competition there's new people coming after us and they're doing interesting things and you got to keep your eyes open and continue to iterate and improve as a founder you'll you'll appreciate that you're never quite satisfied with what you've got always want it to be better right you're thinking you've got this long list of things and you may talk to people in your customers and they may say I love your product and I bet sometimes when you hear that you think oh it's it should be so much better if not if not what I want it to be yet and that that drive to improve you're going to feel that more than your customers are going to feel that you're going to feel that more than your team is going to feel that you have to help all of them feel that you have to paint for them the vision of what could be and how much better the service could be and constantly drive to improve it and iterate and make it better we have another value our first value is pursue happiness it's a little bit of a funny you know construction and pursue happiness and and and what it means to us is that we're constantly striving we're constantly going after something that we may never fully attain but we enjoy that struggle we enjoy the journey and we enjoy struggling together that idea pursuing happiness is about struggling and striving and I think it comes back to this this concept of not settling and always trying for more and that's been an important part of how we've continued to innovate and iterate and grow there's a counterpoint to that which is that you can constantly trying to do all these things and never get anything done and so the the last point I want to make on lessons that I've learned or things that I feel like we could do better is prioritization is key I'm terrible at this I always want to do everything and my team in every planning cycle has to tell me John we can't possibly do all of that you realize we're gonna break the company if we try and do this many things we don't have that big of a team we're you know we're already doing too much what can we stop doing and so we've tried different approaches of you know stopping things and and and they try to contain me but I just have this desire to do so much I mean we're in the the retail business we're in the b2b business we support advisers we're now doing cash management we've got all this personalization I'm just always trying to do more and you know a little bit this comes back to hiring a great team and finding people who can can support you in those areas where you're less strong I have a great a great management team who do contain me in this area and and you know can talk to me and tell me like what's actually possible we've got great product managers and project managers and product marketers who help us to strictly prioritize manage things and make sure that they get done I can't emphasize enough how important it is to to focus and without that focus and drive on what's actually most important we never would have gotten anywhere and those are my very simple lessons or learnings I should say from my past past 10 years at betterment and the things that have helped to drive us forward and and I love to to take your questions about anything that I've talked about today or anything about the the business or other things that that we've learned so should we be worried about the yield curve wow this is this is pretty wonky I have a really generic answer to all of these kinds of market questions people say what about China or you know that's something different every week if you're invested for the for your goals if you're thinking about the if you're invested for what's really important to you like if your goal is retirement that's probably 30-plus years out for for many people in this room if you're invested for you know down payment on a house that you got to make next year you're going to invest that money really differently you're gonna put that into into a savings account or a high-yield money market or something and as long as you're invested for the right duration for your goals you don't have to worry about the news the news is there to scare you and grab your attention and make you you know do things you shouldn't do it's not there to help you make the right decision and as a financial advisor I just constantly come back to the idea that make sure your your investments or align with your goals and you're going to be fine you don't have to worry about this kind of stuff I frankly think it's crazy that we live in a world where all of you are expected to be financial experts it's like if the dumbest thing you know we we have 401ks now and so you have to think about you know how you're invested for your retirement but this is this is like not something that everyone has time to do it's as though I said you should be responsible for your own health care you can have any drug you want have as much as you want there's no doctors good luck that's just like a dumb way that you never design a health care system that way but that's how our financial system basically works it's like here's a bunch of bad products go have whatever you want you know like good luck I believe the future of our industry of financial services designed around customers designed around real people is that you all and I most of it including myself shouldn't have to worry about this stuff that that we there should be intelligence that helps to manage your wallet that helps you to put the next dollar in the right place to make the most of it anyway that's what we're building and that's that's my long answer to should you be worried about the yield curve how do you find the balance between motivating your team to want to be do better and celebrating your team successes I love to celebrate successes I I think marking occasions is a must we have a lot of traditions at betterment and we celebrate occasions all the time we have we have these traditions I feel like help to help to build the culture they also help to let the team know how much you care about the team so we have four tentpole events we do our anniversary party every May we launched it TechCrunch Disrupt in May of 2010 and so that's our ante party we do a Thanksgiving which is most people's favorite event where it's a potluck and everyone comes and and and brings their own dishes and brings their families and so on and then we do summer and winter retreats we go skiing for a day in the winter and we do like a camp camp thing in the summer I really value this kind of stuff I think it's so important to get the team together to get out of the office to see each other in a different context one of our values is build relationships beyond the tasks what that means build relationships beyond the tasks of course if you're like in a project together you have to get to know someone but go beyond that go outside of it get to know them beyond the way that you work with them to me that's important to building a strong team where you have people you can go back to and people who will come to you even if you don't have an immediate need from them I think that's an important part of building a great company when we when we think about traditions we also do things like the betterment of betterment Awards where we have seven or seven values and we have seven paths one that goes with each of the values so like you know our value of embraced efficiency is one of those hats with like the drinking straws you know for like the beers up top because it's an efficient way to drink beer I guess I think that having in that recognition and we celebrate people who represent each one of those values I think that's an important way to to perpetuate your company's values and culture how much capital have you raised and why did you choose venture yeah listen I I have a ton respect for people who bootstrap businesses I think it's an amazing way to go if you if you've got that kind of kind of a business and that kind of a drive where you can can achieve that do it I knew starting out that to build a financial services brand that would reach millions of customers we would have to raise Bo loads of money like I just I had looked I looked at all the examples of people who'd built financial brands and like no one had done it for less than hundreds of millions of dollars right so I looked at Schwab I looked at ing you know you look at all these good so and so we we set out knowing that it would require capital it end up requiring a lot more capital than even I thought I mean we've raised two hundred and eighty million dollars to date we we still have a lot of that in the bank we continue to to grow and invest it but when I think about why did we raise it it was just it was we had to do it what was important to me was finding the right kinds of partners in raising it so there's like there's there's all kinds of inter capitalists out there they all have somewhat similar motivations but you know when you talk to someone if they share your values and if they share your aspirations and hopes for the company are our first venture investor I always talk talk about our first meeting was love at first pitch as we went out to the the best of our offices and we sat down with Rob's Davis who's still on my board today and I told him about the vision for betterment and what we wanted to do in the mission that I talked about earlier of helping customers to do what's best with their money so they can live better and he said that's great we've been looking for a company like this for two years and this is the best one I've seen I'd love to be in business together they had a long term horizon he's been invested for for eight years now and isn't talking at all about you guys should think about you know liquidity or you should be you know moving to find a buyer because they have a very long term horizon at Bessemer and that's the thing that was important to me in finding the right kind of partner all of our investors share that same long-term view and and that's important to us there are other reasons to hire other investors that obviously doesn't make that right for everyone some have great expertise in retail distribution or or other networks so so I chose venture because I knew we need capital and patient capital it would take a long time how did you choose your team early on how did they stick around do they volunteer intern or did you pay them my poor early team we my my co-founder Eli and I didn't didn't pay self salaries for at least a year and a half in the early days we really we went through all of our savings we'd put a lot of our savings into the company we hired a couple of a couple of friends I mean my my colleague from FMCG Anthony joined us and and then we hired a CTO Kiran who I knew through the Columbia Network we paid them not enough you know it was it was well below market like a quarter of what they've been making and we paid them in equity and then after they worked for us for like nine months we said so we're gonna run out of money and it would be great if you guys could put in some money so that we can continue to pay you and you know fortunately they did so we were really lucky to have people who were passionate about the mission and believed in it as much as I did and they helped us to to get through equity is something that we give to every employee of betterment I I think it's part of aligning the team around the around the vision and the mission and with that I want to say thank you so much for having me here it's a great honor to go [Applause]

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] sup y'all persley I don't know about you guys I heard there's a lot of Brooklyn people here right that makes me very excited I live five blocks away from here and I feel like there's not enough tech happening in Brooklyn so it's awesome to have you guys all here cool so who here has heard of teachable show of hands how bad who here is a paying customer of teachable there we go all right so pretty good pretty good so today I want to talk about the business behind teachable specifically how we learned to not entirely suck at growth so let's get started so at the risk of sounding a little bit douchey we had an amazing November our creators some of whom are here earned over 20 million dollars on our platform we as a company made one and a half million dollars in revenue last month of which about eighty percent of it came through monthly recurring revenue which is our creators paying us an average of $70 a creator a month or our M RR which was 1.1 million dollars so that looks pretty good right like look at that graph look at how beautiful we're gonna beautiful up into the right it is it's very easy to look at this graph and think everything was perfect it was always rainbows and butterflies and other beroun five things but no that's not how it was like it wasn't always that good twelve months in twelve months after raising a billion dollars in venture funding having a team of 10 people we were at only $10,000 in monthly recurring revenue like things were not working as well as they did after that and we were pretty concerned we were pretty concerned at the time it's not that we were completely flat what we were growing it was just very very very slow like when you zoom in on the first year like it again it looks up and to the right but the fact is at end of the day we were at only $10,000 in monthly recurring revenue after a year and we were we didn't know what to do we didn't know what we were not doing right we read all the blog posts did all the startup we were doing everything it was just not working at the scale we wanted to we could basically afford one engineer kind of that's our CTO Noah who probably doesn't approve of me using his picture here we could afford one person kind of one year and with 10 people like the math was not adding up we know what to do we were working really hard we're working far harder than than we frankly work now we were hustling but it wasn't it wasn't working like we were trying to grow as fast as possible do everything we could we were trying to follow the startup today have you guys heard it do things that don't scale we did all of that stuff like I was personally like uploading content for people we reached out to Y Combinator and like hosted their startup class on our website I was manually I went to Ryan holiday took his book we ourselves converted it to a course to try and make the business work we're doing all these things at once scaling we even started growth hacking which is a really stupid thing don't growth hack I'm really happy that word died and small side note on growth hacking gross I grew basically just trying to be smart asses about it and it never worked one of the things we tried is I thought it was really cool at the time but I built this bought that scraped all of you to me which was one of our competitors was a marketplace had other people telling courses so I built this bought it scraped udemy it found social media profiles for everyone who had a course on udemy right so now I have all these creators then I took another database cross-referenced it to get an email address for every single udemy creator which plugged into my gmail and it automatically started emailing people to check out teachable sounds cool right you know what the stupid bug did it email the founder of you to me that's the first person it found it the founder of you to me that's it actually email it's like hey Gaga I found you're teaching online awesome check out fedora recall did not work none of this stuff was working one year in we were still at ten thousand dollars in monthly recurring revenue but then we 16x the next year from 10,000 to 160,000 and that's what this talk is about it's really the framework we applied and that's what I'm gonna go over and they'll the framework we apply to 16x and the same framework that we still use today that's what this is about so here's what changed so we added a growth model what we call the every dollar model that has a picture of our team member Andy who actually built this model because I think a lot of founders come up here and talk about all the things the team members do as something dated like this is not my creation this is something a team member did and this entire story by the way this entire narrative is not my doing it's really the team of people we have working there I'm just here for my sense of humor my good looks my tight t-shirts that's that's the only reason I'm here to be added in every dollar model with the idea of being in the past actually hopefully what we did in the past in the past we had this epic Google spreadsheet that was our growth idea backlog don't take a photo of this this is the bad stuff don't take a picture of this the next thing is what you take photo of we just had this epic list of all the ideas we had that we wanted to work on we've prioritized them had owners we worked really hard to execute as many of them as possible our biggest metric then was how many of these ideas can be complete in a single month what we move to the every dollar model which I will explain is we try to account for every single dollar well actually no we started by setting a growth target work backwards and try to account for every single dollar so the easiest way to demonstrate this would be to walk through a real example that we used in August 20 team okay so the first big change we made is we stopped trying to grow as fast as possible this sounds counterintuitive but what we decided is we would pick a specific number and at the time it was about 30% was our desired growth rate month over month we were highly intentional about how fast we wanted to grow and then we work backwards to figure out what that looks like so in August 2015 we wanted to grow 30% we were starting at about $25,000 in M our our our turn was sadly 12% then which is really bad it's much much better now but then we plugged this in to some pretty basic math and figured out what amount of revenue we needed to add again this sounds obvious we went a year and a half not doing this and I guarantee there's a lot of people here that don't go through this kind of discipline so now our entire job becomes really easy now instead of trying to grow as fast as possible we have one simple goal ten thousand eight hundred forty three dollars in new monthly recurring revenue our marketing team our growths team had one goal now one goal like the whole thing became so much simpler and then we would take this number and try and build a bottom-up model and figure out where it would come from so at the time we had three things that were happening in August we would get about $100 of organic upgrades per day which should be $3,100 but $3,000 in organic upgrades we had weekly webinars to our free customers that we gave an offer to upgrade to a paid plan and that brought in about $1,000 per Thursday and then we were banking on an enterprise sale closing right so with this we had eight thousand dollars accounted for but obviously there's a problem like we still have to find twenty eight hundred dollars in revenue and this happened every single month this number we used to call it the RTBF revenue to be found this number is where we this number and the necessity of hitting this number is the single biggest reason we have every single marketing strategy and innovation that we have found has been us trying to work backwards to hit this RTBF number so I will I'll give you a few examples of how this apply to different stages but it was really applying this model figuring out how fast we wanted to grow working backwards to figure out what we already had accounted for looking at the difference and then focusing on how we make up the difference sounds really simple but that's been the single biggest reason and the single biggest reason we continue to grow so August for instance we realized we could add in a few partner promotions bring in affiliates and do a promotion to them so for instance we'll work with someone like you know theoretically a Tim Ferriss or obviously if a lower scale where they will promote teachable to their audience and that we can do three of those a month and make up the three thousand dollars so now we're going into August 2015 with some semblance of an idea as to how we're going going to actually hit these targets so the same way necessity is the mother of all invention hitting this RTBF number was where all of our marketing strategy innovation came about like in the past we were flying blind trying to like work off this big list of growth ideas but it wasn't as a discipline there's like okay I need to find two thousand eight hundred and forty three dollars and I will do whatever possible to find that amount and at different stages we've made this up in different ways right if you have revenue be found of less than a thousand dollars and by the way none of these strategies are what I want you to take away like you will have different channels that work for you but just the discipline of going through this exercise but for us this is what worked and under a thousand dollars direct sales I could literally find enough people email them and sell them myself that's under three thousand dollars we could do a big monthly webinar to all of our three users make them an offer to join a paid plan we could make up an RTBF of three thousand dollars pretty easily then five thousand dollars we had to systematize it a little bit we had to like add a weekly webinar we added a weekly webinar on Thursdays and we added one on Tuesdays and that reliably could kind of add 5k in RTBF 10k again partner promotions layer on top of this help does hit the like bigger RTBF number but at every single stage as the numbers grew bigger we had to keep innovating and find strategies to actually hit this hit this goal so we went inside into every month having some idea of how we were gonna hit our goals don't get me wrong we missed our goal 70 to 80 percent of the time but this exercise of preparing ourselves and coming up with a hypothesis for how we're gonna hit our goals ultimately fueled our entire growth engine so as RTF increased so did our marketing innovation here's a couple of specific instances of things we found only because of rtbf so a couple of years ago we raised the price of our lowest here which was our basic plan it used to be $29 a month we moved it to $39 a month and felt pretty good about it because we added a lot of new features the plan was better and we felt good that that was gonna raise our average revenue per user so in all the future months our organic upgrades would be a higher amount the problem with this is that wasn't gonna help us hit gold this month we still had a difference of about ten or fifteen thousand dollars to make up this month and the necessity of hitting that led to us running a campaign where we offered the old price to all of our existing users for a one-week period just because we needed to generate this like revenue bump that specific month so we ran this campaign it worked really really well we added about $20,000 in EM RR for this campaign and this is a strategy we've reused about three to four times since but the only reason we even found this strategy was the necessity of hitting this goal like the math wasn't adding up so we had to try something that had a chance in hell of hitting a five-figure RTBF number another example is what we call the summit but back in 2015 we had to make up a lot of revenue one November but we didn't we just didn't have time to schedule enough partner promotions or anything to make the whole thing work so what we did and it was experimental the time now to become a pretty standard thing a lot of companies do is we got about 15 or 20 partners and instead of doing one-off promotions we created this massive event where all 15 or 20 people are promoting this one big event we're promoting it we're trying to dot drive thousands of people to this event and at the end of the event we made a one-time offer to buy a teachable plan and again this whole thing when we tried it four years ago was a massive experiment we're just like we need to do something big like the math is not adding up there's no other way of hitting these numbers so we did this summit back in 2015 and it worked really well we had a $25,000 in monthly recurring revenue from this 2015 event but what's cool about the summit is this is scaled we did one two months ago and again our numbers are higher now and we added a hundred and thirty thousand dollars in brand-new monthly recurring revenue from this event like the scale is fully different now we had 60,000 people sign up we converted 2,000 paying customers but the only reason we even found these strategies was the necessity of hitting a very very very specific rtbf goal so necessity of hitting this is what led to our very very best growth strategies and the best part of this whole thing is the accountability you get because as I mentioned right like 70% of the times we missed our goals but what was cool is this quantitative model like this like now we knew exactly why we missed it like oh the enterprise sale never closed and the partner promotions didn't work that well so now I'm going to revise our model were going into this with a lot more data and I know this sounds some of this sounds kind of obvious especially for people that have never run a software company we didn't do this for a very long time there's companies I advise and talk to that don't do this it's sounds really simple but I've seen far too many companies die despite having arguably a more beautiful product than us when we first started out like better usability everything was better but they succumb to the fallacy of if you build it they will come we were very very very very intentional about all our growth ever since in the first year we weren't but ever since then we've applied this consistently and also the corollary to this is it helped us avoid what we call the great idea trap an example is we've wanted to have a conference call our creators call it teach a con kind of make it like this won't be as cool but definitely will also be in Brooklyn but every time we try to like spreadsheet this out and be like what do we need to invest in terms of like marketing team energy to pull it off and what is their expected ROI you could never prioritize it and there were a lot of projects like this that when we applied the the rigor and discipline of a spreadsheet that again we're getting the point where we don't have to have every project have a positive ROI back in the early days it was existential we wouldn't be here if we weren't growing so this discipline again it helped us avoid so many ideas that we otherwise would have pursued so this works really really well till about 10 million dollars in annual recurring revenue or about $800,000 monthly recurring revenue which was let's call it seven or eight months ago it starts breaking down at that scale a little bit just because planning one or two months in advance isn't good enough so we still use a version of this right now it just has to be a full year in advance where as you can see these are real numbers we can't do events all the time so we figure out when we're going to do four or five events a year load more growth into those months kind of adjust for seasonality we've got a little bit more sophisticated about it like model or churn rate going down and the goal of this is now we have a target we need to hit every single month we're doing a full year in advance cuz we can accordingly like now we have a finance team we have like budgeting processes there's all this other that you four deal with so now we have to plan this a year in advance but it's still a version of the exact same thing we just try and figure out when we're gonna push well in time so we can hire for it prepare for it and so forth and then again we have to work backwards right it's the same exact thing there's just more columns now there's just more channels the other thing that changes is organic becomes much more important because when you have to add $200,000 and 180 thousand dollars and so forth unless you're getting a good organic lift from your existing customers the math doesn't work out the other thing unique to where we are now is as you can see there our math is still not working out so sadly even though the whole premise of this talk is how we grew without paid next year is when we have to learn how to spend money if we want to still double year-over-year which is our goal but this stuff works and has worked for yours and I strongly encourage everyone here especially those running a software company but if you're only an agency can be applied if you're running most kinds of businesses working backwards from revenue and applying the every growth model can absolutely work so in conclusion right while we were doing this a lot of people both internally and externally thought this was kind of dumb they thought that we kept doing unsustainable things to hit a local target but guess what if you do something unsustainable repeatedly and if you sustainably can do something unsustainable for yours at a time there is no difference between that and like like that is a sustainable growth engine our sustainable growth engine was optimizing locally for months at a time for years at a time until we built what teachable is today so and this growth again just I don't think it needs too much for feeding but this growth is what built momentum it got people excited about the company it built morale frankly like operationally we were a disaster for yours when you're growing 30 to 40 percent month on month that's fine like people overlook a lot of stuff it helped grow our brand it's the only reason we were able to raise money my self-worth still hinges on how fast we grow and that definitely helped with that so this this is the singular reason we are on we are where we are today so my parting words are don't leave growth to chance guy only blows a chance reverse-engineer this this worked for us and it will work for you thank you cool the first question is from Carrie who says talk description said you did it all without Facebook ads is that true no paid ads ads at all how did people find out about you it's not true that we've used no paid ads at all but all the paid ads we've used have sucked like we've still not figured out how to spend money successfully and profitably like even the second question is what's our tack whenever we try and spend money cost us like five thousand dollars to acquire a customer we've not figured out paid acquisition at all how did how did people find out about us I mean as we brought up like we did a lot of these events we did a lot of partner promotions we did a lot of intentional marketing to get people to find our product so we had a free plan we had a free plan that got a lot of people to sign up and every single year we kept getting better and better at converting our free users to paying users like right now we're at about a little over 5% conversion from free to paid and we've kept growing that number every single time so converting free users the big strategy affiliates and partners or a big strategy also when you use teachable you end up creating a website that you in turn have other students coming to that says powered by teachable and that builds a kind of nice like organic loop so so yeah most of this happened without paid ads the paid ads we did end up spending money on have not been super successful strategically we still have to learn how to spend money to grow yeah and again like the fact that we can't spend money to grow in my mind is not a sign of strength at the sign of weakness like we should learn how to do that we've not been able to thus far cool the question is what's your CAC and LTV I can talk more than algebra or LTV or CAC is still as I said we don't rely on paid a lot every time we run paid acquisition or CAC comes super high but our LTV right now is about $800 and it's kind of trending to the thousand dollar mark so our LTV is looking good and it's continuing to kind of ride off there and how much you're on paid acquisition not at all but we do want to one learn how to get good at it and when we do it will likely be pretty social heavy because it's not a lot of search intent behind what we're trying to find can you share the everyday model online somewhere it's awesome yeah I'll probably all like tweeted out later or something that might be helpful I'm happy to do that how do you stress to ask your model to figure out what's working and what's not working and at what stage do you bite the bullet and in a particular strategy so the model I showed you right there at the end of every month we would basically look at what our assumptions were and we'd look at what the reality is and then accordingly decide what needs to change so for instance partner promotions are a great example because they've worked really well for a while and then they stopped working and a certain point when we consistently missed our partner promo line item for months on an end we're like okay this entire line item needs to go so the best way of doing this was just again applying this model looking at exactly which part of it like which parts are consistently missing the second example is at some point next week we're gonna kill our enterprise plan because our enterprise plans still after all these years has no product market fit to distraction for the business we're gonna kill our enterprise plan and again it's it's the rigor of like looking at this model and realizing that we've missed our enterprise targets or like pretty much every quarter that this whole thing is not working how has having a tweet go viral impacted your life I don't know ask that but so I had some tweet about hipster Brooklyn reached 17 18,000 people liking it on Twitter it's actually impacted my life quite considerably there have been a bunch of like random press outlets reaching out we found three people to apply for jobs at teachable because of some random Brooklyn tweet going viral so it has impacted it has impacted my life a little but mostly it's just has just been just been funny to look at also does anyone want to ask any questions like just in person it feels weird to like read the stuff off a screen right like anyone want to like just raise their hand as well and ask questions off off screen it's Andy still at the company yes Andy is still at Andy's led the company he's now working on all our affiliated partner promotions yeah he is not it he's not impressed with the specific picture I chose of him though but anyone want to ask questions like it again yeah so whose question is you talked about self-worth has have as having a successful company change your self-worth okay Wow honestly no like I think like you're I forget where I read this but you're always you're realistically always going to be about as happy as you are now like I don't think external outcomes really truly change it as much as I like to joke about my self-worth being tied to how fast we're growing I don't think so at all if anything the biggest thing having the business has added is it is really the team I work with has made my life more valuable it doesn't change my self-worth but my life feels more valuable for the team I get to work with every single day any questions in person yep kind of the his question is can you explain the unique metric you had I didn't quite understand it is that the RTBF okay so one more time the rtbf was at the end start of every month we would figure out how fast we want to grow and then we try and reverse engineer what are the growth channels we already know are happening because chances are you'll have organic upgrades you'll have some level of growth built in rtbf is the difference between the two so in the example for August 2015 we needed to add ten thousand dollars eight hundred and ten thousand eight hundred forty three dollars but we only had about we didn't have twenty eight hundred dollars accounted for this is a purely this is a very this is only a revenue model we do expenses separately like our finance team does expenses our growth / marketing team does revenue so organizationally expenses are done by a different Department and personally I was never involved with that because I'm not very good at that's spending money side of things so ah all right we'll take one last question here so very good question the question is how do you ensure that short-term RTBF does not come at the expense of long-term innovation you don't always try and do short-term one-off webinars to make the difference two-part answer one is at a certain point it did and that's when we realized we had to kind of zoom out and start planning things more in advance the second thing is we've always kept product strategy out of this so product strategy kind of applies at a different level where we try and think of strategy over a period of years but revenue in a period of months so the short answer is it definitely has and that's when we realize we have to zoom out but we also tried the opposite where we tried like kind of ditching this entirely and then we went back to not growing so we still found applying this was more good than bad we just have to get to a point of doing it further out in advance and forecasting a year out as well but that's a very good question because that is definitely a risk you can fall into but at that point chances are your company's already worth something you've already passed the like Minimum Viable like this is gonna be a business level all right cool guys this has been awesome thank you for having me [Applause]

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] how many of you folks have used plated before so uh some but not that many sent least we have a good opportunity to go sign up yeah to evangelize a little bit but in a nutshell just give the high-level description of what the company is or so for the consumer and happy I think we're gonna talk a bunch about the you know the business side for the consumer we we help you cook so we're a meal kit business we deliver all that portion ingredients you need to cook at home along with recipe content paper recipe cards video content etc got it and you guys have raised roughly 90 million dollars you have how you do you say how many customers you've had I think all that sorry I think all the lawyers will let me say at this point is a few hundred thousand okay and you guys recently sold a year ago a little over a year ago for a roughly roughly three hundred million dollars to Albertsons right correct so these guys have an amazing story because similar to give you when we're talking before it happened very quickly what year we use guys started started so I've won co-founder we started the business in the summer of 2012 and then sold in the summer of 2017 so five years which may be as quick I suppose in terms of you know venture backed companies it is but definitely didn't feel that quick and it never feels fast when you're doing it every day so I want to hear about the early story cuz you and I talked about it a few days ago week ago and you're talking about just the early the first iteration of the product I found to be kind of shocking actually it was pretty it's a pretty amazing story so walk me through where you were a few months before starting the business and what led you to let's say the the the first month of the company so that the kind of genesis of the company was we started out my co-founder nick and i knowing that we wanted to work together but not on what so it was team first an idea second which i think is a reasonably good way to go about it what a lot of the you know academics would tell you is the number one thing that kills startups is co-founder conflict I've certainly seen it you know with friends and you know sort of folks that run into so that part was very important to get right so then after we decided that we were gonna work together we sat down and looked each other and went well what now we need to figure out what the idea is and tried to go through a process of figuring out you know what was both interesting to us so it's kind of that you know p-word what are we passionate about but you know there's lost things that we were passionate about that it would probably be horrendous businesses so what are we actually interested in what do we care about enough to get up every day including the bad days and work on and then also you know where do we think there's interesting business opportunity and kind of figure out where the overlap is and we actually spent about six months doing that so going through looking at different ideas talking to people trying to be smart probably we're not that smart but trying to be you know effective at figuring out what was a good idea right testing by talking to friends and family by putting up landing pages all this sort of techniques that you know every is familiar with but trying to get that to a good sort of handle on what was a reasonable business idea and in part we were trying to do that to a level of confidence that we felt good about taking money from friends and family before we went and did that and launched the business and you basically locked yourself in a room for six months you said you and your your partner and what was interesting to me is some of the founders who have spoken today or spoke today they had this they kind of had they had a pretty good brand from the gecko or at least they had a they knew what they wanted to be early on whereas you did not start plate it did not start as plated can you talk a little bit about the very first iteration of the product I part of this was that we were just like broke AF let's this broke negative yeah but both so we met in business school which is a lot of fun but also really expensive and you know both of us were paying for it ourselves which is a way of saying the Citibank was paying for it I think we we tried did we put it together once we had something like a quarter million dollars in debt between the two of us so you know we had negative money we had some credit cards that again Citibank was also paying for that we used to fund the business so we were just putting everything on a credit card Nick at least was married so his wife kind of supported us in the sense that she was paying for him and you know we worked out of their apartment and I ate all their food but we had no money for anything including a domain so I think there was there was two things that we were doing one was just being cheap which was by necessity the other thing was we we were trying to be deliberate about starting the business and testing all of the getting although like obvious big mistakes out of the way before we you know bought and built the the real brand we wanted to mess up on a throwaway brand so we started out with Dinan fresh calm it's awful it's literal it's hard a ten dollar domain name yeah it was available I mean that was the basic search criteria go on GoDaddy you what can be buy that isn't you know it's available right but it's terrible it's it's it's too literal no good brands are literal it's everyone you know is it dining dying in how do you spell that it was just you know too long too many syllables etc but it was available and it was good enough to test on so he ran on that brand for three months or so during which he got through a bunch of milestones we had enough conviction to take some money from friends and family all of that turned out to be a lot harder than we expected it to be we raised that money enough to go buy plated which we had to negotiate you know not surprisingly somebody owned it they weren't using it so it was you know reasonably affordable and then build you know sort of branded any around it and launched that properly what was the Dinan fresh period like what were you doing what in what sense what were we doing was it it was just a basic landing page and you're driving traffic there through white Facebook ads or so it was a I mean it was a fully functional website it was ugly as sin but it was a fully functional ecommerce site it was taking orders for us that we were then fulfilling all of it was super scrappy we were doing it out of Nick's apartment but it was a site to go to place orders manager account normal sort of e-commerce functionality including you know kind of customer research so I would sit there on the laptop and chat with people and asked what they liked or didn't like her why they were gone you're just using like an o lark like a website plug-in that allows you to chat with anyone who visited the website exactly and where was the traffic coming from mostly Facebook in the early days now I don't know that's that helpful in today's context but back way back in the day of 2012 it's funny I say this to people now I mean we started we literally filed the incorporation papers in June of 2012 and the thing that people don't often remember was that in May of 2012 Facebook went public like Facebook was barely a thing then and they were still basically and in some cases literally giving away media you know there was some program you could sort of apply to and I remember the mechanics and they would just give you you know a fifty thousand dollar advertising credit so you know we were we were spending we didn't get that credit by the way but my point is just Facebook was very very inexpensive so we were spending five or ten dollars a day and that was enough to drive you know a hundred visits or whatever it was enough that we could do kind of user research in real time a hundred visits a day turned out to be what like 20 customers a week I don't think the conversion rate was that healthy but something like that so like tens tens a week tens a month for your first handful of month or for three months six months that's about right yeah probably three to four months and you're telling me about the early version of the of the meal kits how how are you creating the menu I'd tell everyone how you're preparing the the food well the the the theme to those answers and all of them is it was it was me and Nick doing everything and we no real experience in hardly anything I mean I I have a software engineering background I wouldn't claim myself as a professional engineer I could do it enough to build the site and such Nick was a marine and had some you know reasonable sort of operations experience but outside of that call it engineering and operations we didn't know anything about anything you know anything about the culinary part or the customer acquisition part or you know anything else so but we had no resources so we just figured it out so on the recipes part we were just writing them or finding them on you know sites recipes.com wherever you know we were just we were hacking it together we were finding recipes we were packing boxes at first out of his apartment you know we were just kind of doing whatever we needed to do to make it work so you're you're someone places an order that you have made up the menu you make it the menu daily or weekly or something like that weekly and you literally then just go to Whole Foods or Safeway or whatever you guys whatever the stores are up here and you're literally just individually packing packaging the ingredients and then taking it to the post office yeah we were we were hand fulfilling everything which I know a lot of you Congress companies get started that way just happen to be food but what was the like let's say you're packing chicken what was that wrapped up and so on the packaging front again something we didn't know anything about we you know we tried to be smart and certainly always erred on the side of food safety but what that meant is you know the early packaging design was like way too much you know it's it's an industry challenge even today you know the amount of packaging is something that you know we focus on but back the head like it was comical I mean you'd get you know a freaking refrigerator sighs you know delivery for you know a chicken breast it was wrapped in a bunch of you know insulation with ice packs and the sort of general concept was the same as it is today but a lot less elegantly and how long were you doing this out of your apartment before the apartment piece only lasted probably three months you know we pretty quickly but we knew that that was not scalable it was you know it was not the right thing to be doing for a lot of reasons so as quickly as we could you went out and found a warehouse space not that but like everything that took a couple of tries to get it right but we got out of the apartment pretty quickly and then so you guys are bootstrapping the company up until this point you are in debt are you paying for all this on a monthly basis with credit cards or yes so you know other options I mean we not for lack of trying we were applying for small business loans and pitching everybody and every other you know method that we could think of to try to get access to capital but we didn't have any and at that point like you're applying for small business loans you just said did you actually think that this is gonna scale to something with hundreds of billions of dollars in value or was it just man if we can get to like five hundred thousand dollars a year in revenue I'll be so happy so we I don't think we have we really had any sense of how big that it might get but we did you know both want it to get very big and also you know just in working through this the spreadsheet math which has its obvious limitations but working through the spreadsheet math of the business model it's very clear that I mean basically all e-commerce business models like I would say as a rule of thumb most ecommerce businesses need to be very large to be breakeven right there's exceptions to everything and my friends that have dropship businesses and things like that that you know that work but by and large e-commerce is a high fixed cost low variable cost business so you gotta sell a ton of units to cover your your high fixed cost so we thought they would need to get big and and that we were gonna have to raise money to get there so what happened between month let's say four and an eight I know you guys raised roughly four hundred thousand dollars and funding you raised a little bit of funding what happened between that period so probably a month three we had enough confidence to go and raise money from people now we thought that was gonna be like you go and pitch some people and yeah it's hard but we'll go do it it took us three months and about 200 pitches to get anybody to say yes and that first yes was a group of angels you know to the tune of about 400 grand which today is like a joke of a seed round I mean most like venture businesses are raising millions not that that isn't without its you know downfall as well but so he raised that four hundred thousand dollars from a group of angels and as individuals right people that have had some success before and were crazy enough to believe in us and then bought the plated domain built the brand went to plan this big launch which was its own special form of disaster so building up to the the launch you know we we were doing what we thought we should do which is try to get some press get the website ready get the inventory in order etc and then go try to get somebody to write about us so Nick my co-founder was was doing all the media at this point went out and got Thrillist in DC here in Boston to do they're sort of city specific pieces on us and you know we get all excited we're thinking it's just yeah this is gonna be it they'll write these pieces you know will be a billion dollars overnight and ride off into the sunset and about three days before the launch which was on Monday in October of 2012 we we start kind of you know hunkering down to get ready and figuring out start hearing some noise about a storm coming and for the folks that lived here in that time you probably remember that was when Hurricane sandy hit so it was literally overnight Sunday into Monday when that hit which just obviously devastated the area no power no internet no you know no cell phone service in most parts of the city we came within about three inches of our or one kind of sad that a warehouse being flooded out of business which would have I mean completely ruined us we had absolutely no you know backup money at that point survived that thankfully it's a fun story now in hindsight but it definitely came very close to killing the business and then went off and you know we're able to continue growing and eventually raise some venture capital money a sort of proper institutional Capital and how long did was that initial seed round supposed to last or how long did it last you so I don't think we really knew how long it was going to last we were just trying to stretch it as far as we could you know we had just been sort of beaten and battered by the fundraising process and and you know knew that it was gonna be hard so we were trying to stretch it as far as we could I think you know we probably would have estimated 18 months of runway it was probably more realistic more realistically half of that and in part because once things start working you know the marketing takes requires money even though it you know it's profitable on an roi basis you sort of you know you pay facebook and then it takes a few months to kind of make that money back is is anyone here in the hustles embassador group oh great a fair bit of people so I had a long post on there two or three days ago and I got frustrated talking to a couple friends who were trying to recruit a basically a co-founder to a company and and in this co-founder they're they're gonna pay the it was an $80,000 job and people weren't willing to take that because it was a huge step back and their current salary and even though they they said they wanted to start a company they're like yeah you know like I'm already getting paid like 150 you know I don't want to get paid 80 and it just pissed me off because that pissed me off but I was like man I don't think people quite understand when you start something you're early salaries are typically very very low for me the first year it was roughly like it came out to be like around 20 or 30 grand and the next year it was a little bit more than that and now it's reasonable but you're you're you're painters all very little early on and you had that same journey right yeah so I you know I think it's a it's a it's an important and somewhat nuanced topic you know I always feel compelled sort of say I think that it's a you know a privilege and I feel privileged to have had the ability to go do it even with all the debt that made it hard and all those things we still you know I was at a place in my life I didn't have kids you know I had friends I had a supportive family I knew I wasn't gonna be homeless and that safety net is something that not everybody has so I think it's important to acknowledge that because sometimes these things can get sort of glorified in a way they shouldn't that said yeah we didn't pay herself for a long time you know it was it's a similar kind of story you know 20 30 grand first year maybe you know whatever 30 40 grand the second year and by the way when you start running short on money and you can't make all a payroll you're the first person that doesn't get paid and that happened multiple times so you know I agree I think like it's a reasonable expectation for somebody starting a business to you know if you can't do it you can't do it and that's that's what it is and that's that's sort of reality sometimes but raising money I mean I do some angel investing now and it's it's a huge red flag but if somebody's trying to take a big salary out of it like it's not a good use of them what do you consider a big salary eighty thousand is definitely a big salary for you know the first year of a company I don't know where I don't know there's a bright line there but it's it's closer to 20 than 80 yeah I mean I think I think that it's easy to glorify this entrepreneur journey but it takes a long time to get to to get quote market market salaries you know what I mean and I think that when you and I were talking I wanted to bring that up because I don't think that people understand yeah I I don't think you know and and there's no sort of one place you can just sort of look for what a market salary is but I don't think that we were paying ourselves to market salaries until after we sold the business after five years let's talk a little bit about some pretty specific tactics so think basically after after raising your your second round I mean it was definitely like a it started to grow nicely and things were working well you guys ended up with roughly 1200 employees that things were going well but what got you those first customers very very early on and say the first 9 10 months yeah it changed very rapidly and I think that's the real answer to how to go find those customers I mean it's a common question and it's an important one and I get why everybody asks it but at the same time you know these things are really just arbitrage it's finding places where you know the media or the attention of people is underpriced I mean that's like in a nutshell what you're looking for whether it's influencers not that's exactly a secret anymore or Facebook in the early days or whatever the sort of new thing is so what we were doing the first ever customers were what we talked about a few minutes ago had a chat client on the website you'd come on you get that sort of annoying little pop-up and you know say hey what can I help you with and in the very early days it was just me you know so Nick my co-founder risk on it was not technical as it was officer doing everything offline the media and the operations and all these things and I was just sitting on a laptop doing everything there writing the code for the website doing the customer service everything in between and I would just literally sit there and talk to people on chat and it was very helpful you know certainly at times kind of frustrating but I would sit there and you know I remember the the earliest of those chats some of them would go for hours which I still kind of wonder why people were willing to spend hours talking to a random person on the other side of a chat client but they were very helpful in terms of telling me you know why did you click on that ad which is on Facebook generally how they ended up on the website and then tell me what you think of the website what you know does this make sense to you what parts of it don't are you thinking about buying are you not like what would it take for you to buy and then just building that back into the copy on the website the signup flow etc in his real time as we could now that obviously doesn't scale but over time Facebook in that first you know two years for us was a big channel we layered on other things and honestly the way I always sort of describe this to you know investors and other people is we we did it all in-house customer acquisition that is and it looks like a hedge fund trading desk it's all just sort of arbitrage of you know cost per click and cost per impressions and everything else and what are the tactics that you know other people are not using yet and every time Facebook have put out a new tool audience look-alikes whatever it was it would be great for a month and then like okay for three more months and then not work at all after that how did you figure out what you could spend early on to acquire a customer we just tried to be careful is that my best answer because we you know and again I think this is very dependent on the business model most ecommerce businesses probably ought to be breakeven on the first order we're a subscription and a low margin business so we kind of had to make a bet on how many times you'd order on what the lifetime value was so we just tried to be conservative in the beginning and not shoot ourselves in the foot and then as we as the business you know God got older and we started having more customers or any customers that had been with the business for months or years we'd have more you know informed view what about raising a lot of venture capital you guys raised 90 million dollars I asked I we have not raised any venture capital and and I'm personally I don't know if I actually want to ever do that maybe maybe not but when I asked you that question your your answer was different than most most entrepreneurs a venture funded companies which was 100% absolutely yes I will do it again whereas most people I talked to say like maybe and a lot of people say never again you said wholeheartedly yes yeah can you tell me about that decision-making process and why you're gonna raise money again in the future so I think I think it all comes down to knowing what you want to do it probably sounds cheesy but you know some business models require a venture most don't and I actually think and I I think a lot of the sort of topics and businesses that you talk about and cover are aimed at some of the non venture which is I think I'm a huge fan of like I think that that you know kind of bootstrap businesses or lifestyle businesses are don't get enough you know press get a bad rap sometimes like a lot of my you know like happiest most content friends are running those kinds of businesses and so I think that it's you know that they are equally as important equally as valuable I mean probably on average they're more valuable than mentor businesses right I mean that's no sort of secret that most venture businesses fail they're very binary at sort of a billion dollars or nothing so this is all you know don't sort of overweight what I'm saying some days I wake up and wish that I wanted to go build something that looked more like a bootstrap business it's just all the stuff that I'm I think most interested in and most and best suited to build which for me is kind of large scale technology products those are the kinds of things I'm most interested in what I've spent my whole adult life working in and those tend to be venture backed you know type businesses where you need to raise a lot of money to make it work there is no amount of like you know hustle that will you know that will they will allow you to build facebook without raising a billion dollars like it just does that is not simply possible so for me it's a no-brainer which isn't to say that it's always fun or always pleasant or anything else I mean having a big board and a bunch of entry guys to manage and go out every you know once a year or once every year and a half to raise money is a big distraction and has very real downsides including that it's no longer your business or just your business you're gonna sell a bunch of it you have managing other people's money etc but for a certain kind of business there's no option when you guys were starting out were there a lot of competitors - someone was asking that on the screen it's a it seems like a pretty crowded space now was it like that at then no is a short answer you know we were as far as we are aware the first company in the u.s. there was a company in Europe at the time that was getting started you that they started a bit ahead of us but we didn't you know we weren't aware of them it's an interesting thing just you know sort of waves if companies tend to get started around the same time there's something just in the in the media in the air or whatever it is that a lot of you know similar types of businesses started around the same time but it was not competitive because there was no scale businesses or was hardly anybody doing anything you know the sort of label of food tech didn't exist back then the closest you know sort of comparison that anybody had for us was Webvan which was not a good comparison we got we were thrown out of I can't even account how many people's offices I don't know why they took the meetings in the first place separate sort of topic but people would take his meetings and we'd start pitching and we get you know 90 seconds in they're like wait a second this is just web and get out of here it's like okay well thank you but so no and if you had a start over again would you start in this space now or is it too crowded um I don't think today that I would go start in this space at least not without a clever idea around how to differentiate yourself around how to build an audience you know it's not clear to me where and it doesn't mean it enough that these things don't exist I just I spent my day today running you know a medium-sized business at this point not looking at certain new customer acquisition channels but it's not clear to me where you go build a big audience you know in a venture sort of style through you know paid media through hyper-growth etc today because Facebook and Google to some extent was the way that it rate did that from 2012 to probably 2016 and that's you know largely gone what year so you guys were on Shark Tank what year was that we filmed in the summer of 2013 so they film it like you know like a regular TV show as far as I know anyway I don't know a ton about the TV industry and then air it throughout the season so filmed in the summer of 13 the season is you know September to May or what have you we aired in April of 14 how much traffic did it bring to your website a huge huge amount like we were talking I had a friend that was on there and she said that they had like a hundred thousand concurrent users at one point while the show aired is that what you I think I'll give you the rough numbers as I remember them and I should go back and look at these one day but you know so at the time we were we probably had you know you pull up Google Analytics and just look at the you know concurrent people on the site it was probably 50 on average if you just sort of looked at an average week so across you know 24/7 middle denied middle today whatever probably fifty people on average were on the site and back in 2014 shark tank still aired Friday nights so we had a big party in the office and you know had TVs up on the walls with Google Analytics and these sorts of things and within about three seconds of the segment starting they went from fifty to fifty thousand no and then the site crashed which is bad we had a we had a you know a backup site just like a static page like a cloud million thing yeah it was an email capture page so you know not like a dynamic ecommerce site just a flat page you couldn't do anything other than leave your email that came up thankfully that lasted six seconds or something and collected like 13,000 emails and then that crashed so we were on Heroku if that means anything to anybody so built on top eight of Amazon it was our hosting platform a time they told us it was the single biggest database like they'd ever seen and I say that not because it's anything to do with us I think it's just it's actually kind of interesting to me that that a lot of folks still ask and don't seem to appreciate just like how effing big shark tank is as a platform when we were on and I suspect it's gotten bigger I don't know but when we were on it was going into 11 million households on Friday night which is like 10 percent of the households in the US and that's before whoo and reruns in syndication and DVR etc so it's just I mean it's crazy and they don't they don't take any cut they don't get like an equity position in the company just for you being there or anything like that it's just free I mean if you say no it's free they used to so you may have heard that that's all gone - gone for a long time it's you know free quote unquote to go on and then you know you do whatever do you do with them a lot of the people who I've been I've interviewed two other people today neither of them have ever sold their business I think you're the first one I've spoken to today that has when you were starting this were you going into this like I'm never gonna sell this I'm gonna run this forever or I'm only building to sell which some people which is great as well what was your balance of building to sell versus building to last forever yeah so I agree both are great again just sort of like knowing what you want is a big task but important we wanted to run it forever so I built two two software businesses before this and my business partner had done some other entrepreneurial things but those those weren't really big hits were they no no they were they were much smaller yeah I learned a ton very worth doing but much much smaller businesses but the point is both of us had done enough things in our life I suppose that we just you know and maybe who knows we would have maybe things would have changed but we wanted to build and run the business indefinitely you know it was kind of what we wanted to do we both had some other jobs that we really didn't like you know we didn't want to have to go get another job we didn't necessarily you know want to go start in their business I mean there's early days are hard like I don't think there's any way around that so we were building it to run indefinitely the the the sort of flip side of that though is you know once you take venture money I mean really anybody's money but especially venture money you know that's a that's a professional agreement to return that money at some point and they've got their timelines and if you've never sort of heard it when you raise money from somebody their business model becomes yours you know their timelines their fun timelines become your timelines and you've got to give that money back at some point and if you and if you don't sort of know it like it's not just the the silly guy and the sweater vest it's not his money it's like teachers pension funds and real people it's their money so you got to give it back which means you have to have some kind of plan for either going public or selling the business you can't just stay private forever I mean there's exceptions to everything but it's very very difficult to do that so we wanted to run it forever but we were also making sure we were building relationships with the groceries and things like that and are there any regrets from selling it's been over a year do you ever say to yourself like that was too soon or are you like that was perfect timing or do you regret owning it's what you what used to be yours yeah I don't I don't know what perfect timing means I don't regret it you know it's bittersweet for sure it's a little like I mean I don't have kids so this is just what other people have told me but yeah sort of having kids that's go off to college or leave the house or what have you because it's not ours anymore you know I still I still run the business day to day but we're owned by Albertsons which is a big conglomerate of grocery stores it's arsons in Safeway and you know 18 other brands and they're a great partner and you know we get a lot out of being in that sort of family of companies but it's not really ours anymore and wouldn't whoa when you were starting this where you were you just looking for something that something that you were interested in that could go big I mean was your interest in building a big business or was the interest in mostly [Music] making sure that people consume healthy food yeah so that was that was a question on here I think we could most because they have a deep passion for the problem yes so the short answer is yes we were trying to solve our own problem both of us had had you know kind of finance type jobs working a hundred hours a week and eating seamless you know literally seven nights a week and not really loving that and then trying to cook and trying to eat you know a bit more fresh food and just having a bunch of challenges and doing it in a way we were proud of and it's easy to just you know sort of buy frozen stir fry kits but yeah we were both like Nick was engaged and getting married I was dating we were trying to you know him press signa thing other 's and and just take care of ourselves and we were having a bunch of challenges that we thought other people might have as well which is go to the grocery store we didn't really know we were doing how much do i buy what recipe am i making you know you probably screw that up or the grocery store doesn't have everything you're looking for at the end of the week half of its leftover you throw it away you feel bad about that you probably weren't that good of a cook like it just there was a lot of friction in that process that we thought you know we certainly felt and felt that we could solve for other people and certainly had a passion for you know the kind of broader kind of healthy living space and actually had a you know still do have a lot of plans for other product lines that kind of apply to that over time so you're talking about feeling bad for throwing food foods away when if you were to pitch this idea to me years ago before this was a real thing I would have said there's no way you're gonna be able to ship food and it'd still be healthy I mean everyone says that I mean everyone's shocked oh my god it still stays fresh early on you probably didn't have very nicely insulated boxes I don't know you probably didn't have all this the fancy nice stuff that you have now dry ice aha how are you figuring out how to get food from New York City to wherever you're going without going bad that seems like a huge problem it no problem it's a it's a challenge for sure it's probably less of a challenge than you might think so I mean that the short answer is it's not dry ice that's never been dry ice it's just sort of frozen you know ice packs that are largely water and cornstarch but in any case you know we were buying insulation and there's a it's reasonably you know sort of straightforward engineering ways to figure out that to solve this problem you know that our factor of the insulation like the sort of thermodynamics of it are not that complicated so the problem was never really keeping the food fresh not that it's a hundred percent but that's not the biggest problem the biggest problem is optimizing that sort of customer experience you know less packaging fully recycled look cetera and I actually saw it's up here down a question about sort of you know waste and these things know what what's up what was the question looking at this question here on recycling and waste and everything else and yeah that's it that's the next up question which is recycling it yeah so it's it's a good question and it's something that we invest in a lot but I think it's also worth you know kind of noting that it's a it's a different dynamic than most people including my family who were asking me about it to seem to really understand it first which is which is really this the waste you walk into a grocery store the produce that's in there first off is older than you think it is just because of their supply chain and something like 40% of that's getting thrown away and by the way that didn't show up like with farmer Bob in his bare feet it came on a truck wrapped in packaging that's just the reality you don't see it but that's what's happening so when we try to do you know kind of apples to apples comparisons and it's not fully straightforward to do that you know I would say and the in the lawyers you know won't allow me to I sort of make this claim on the TV commercial or anything like that but that the milk industry generally this is not just plated it's far more efficient than a grocery store in terms of food waste because you're throwing away close to nothing as a consumer of your mule kit we're throwing away 3% slow single digit percentages of the food contrasted to 40 percent of the stack of tomatoes and that grocery store down the street being thrown away before you ever see them and then you're gonna buy them and probably throw away half that's about the consumer average nationally as 50% of the fresh food that you buy gets thrown away sure everybody's had some version of that experience you open your fridge on Sunday and like well this is all rotten so on the food waste piece the industry is you know probably a lot more efficient on the packaging and the transportation you know we're probably less efficient because we're packaging you know individual portions rather than big portions but it's very hard to tell if that you know it is net-net actually any less sort of impactful and it's you know you kind of get into a lot of like wonky math around transportation and you know with the lettuce coming from California is it not is it how did it get here you know truck miles etc etc but I guess net-net it's something we care about we're working on but I think the state of it all is different than is maybe you know a parent of people at what point in in the company's existence did all these competitors come come around I don't know it's a gradual process you know I mean a couple of them started in the first year or two you know I think we we've done a lot of competitive research over the years and I'm very confident that there's really only ever been six companies that had any real scale so there's been a lot of you know small companies most of them failed to my earlier point you know it's not really a business that you can run profitably yet small scale so most of the competitors have kind of come and gone and you know and I think this is actually a pattern not a coincidence all six of those started with in the first call it two years of the industry and I think beyond that it was a sort of playing field was largely established and you had a lot of kind of long tail companies it entered and exited but nobody started sort of year three or after and got big so when you guys you guys were all starting out around the same time you've all scaled together when that's going on it's a dogfight for customers right I mean it's it's it you're going head to head with somewhat what you said five others six other people how ha what was your plan to to beat the other person to survive to win and how are you being different from others yeah so you know again this will this this may sound cheesy but I believe it the the point from for our business and I think for a lot of consumer you know type businesses not all it's not true for you know probably Facebook but for most businesses I think you should just ignore the competition you know it's about understanding who your customer is and serving that customer and as long as you're in a big enough market the company will succeed you know when I was raising money the example we would use all the time is Chipotle Chipotle is basically lunch they do a little bit of business at dinner but it's mostly lunch and it's you know mostly one product there's six ingredients or whatever the count is and yet that business does end and by the way they're you know they're not national they're in lots of places I don't know exactly how many zip codes but they're not in every ZIP code in the country and it's a four billion dollar revenue business and there's national competitors and regional ones and local ones and the bodegas in the corner and everything else and they still do four billion dollars top line like the point is not are they stealing customers from somebody else the point is do you understand your customer and serve them well and you know we looked at lots of examples and food like that I mean the grocery stores are in some ways a similar kind of story you know you know pick your favorite grocery store I promise you that's a big business I mean Albertsons a sixty billion dollars top line and probably a lot of people in this room have never been into another students so our our kind of internal mantra not that we always were successful at following it was the Amazon mantra focus on the customer let the customer root or they let the competitors sort of you know figure that out to them on their own so we only got a minute and a half two minutes left I want to talk about something that hasn't been addressed and I saw the question on here which is about co-founder relationships how long did you know your partner before you guys became partners and what was there there had to be but what were some of the breaking points and how did you guys resolve those issues so we knew each other for four years before and my other two businesses I also started with friends I think it's a it's kind of a high-risk high-reward strategy if you will when it works there's nothing in the world better than you know winning as a team and winning with your friends when it doesn't work is probably nothing worse than losing a friend over overwork but the way that and and I had a version of that in my first business I was 21 when I did it had no idea what I was doing probably still don't know what I'm doing but really had no idea back then and the the sort of co-founder relationship went sideways and you know it was not not good and I say I say now the people that I'm happy I kind of learned that lesson early in life but the way that I thought about it was a friend and a friend that I could do you know hard stuff with not just a drinking buddy but somebody that I could work with and Nick and I I don't think we knew we were doing it at the time but we we had some trial runs at that we did some volunteering in Haiti where we were quite literally sleeping on a concrete slab with mosquito nets and you know like physically hard mentally hard stuff that kind of proved to us at least in hindsight as we were making the decision to work together that we could do it and then the last piece and I'll shut up but we had complementary skills that's not the same and I think that's important because that's another one of the kind of common challenges I've seen people run into is you know you get two people who have the exact same bank rent you know background we worked whatever it doesn't matter worked at the same company together we're friends we're gonna go do this and we do the exact same things like okay well how are you gonna figure out who does what and you know only one person can run marketing only one person can run engineering etc and at some point like that's gonna cause a problem so for us it was we're friends we can work together and we have you know complementary skill sets Nick was not technical I was he was a marine he was better at the operations better a lot of that stuff and it just worked and it's not to say we didn't fight I think that's just part of human relationships but it worked well in last last question with the quick answer Josh seven years ago six years ago wanting to start something in today's era you know what would you say like don't make this mistake what mistake would you try to tell them to to avoid oh man here so there's a lot of them but maybe I'll just I'll pick you know solve a real problem I see too many people do where you know they try to start something because there's some nifty new technology or you know that the business model is too clever or whatever if you can't describe the real problem its solving for a real person very quickly it's probably not a good idea although half the fun of this stuff is there's exceptions to everything and somebody in here will prove me wrong gosh thank you very much we really appreciate you taking the time thank you thank you [Applause]

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right so Happy Hanukkah everybody so my name is Jojo and I'm the founder and CEO of unroll dot me for you for those of you who don't know what unrolled on me is we're a consumer app that shows you a list of all your newsletters from Facebook to LivingSocial to Groupon whatever you don't want it's a one click unsubscribe whatever you do want but you don't want cluttering up your inbox you've been combined into a single daily digest that we call the roll up and this is my unexpected journey and yes that is me on Bill Bell I love my designers do that and hopefully I don't regret it so I was a college kid living with my parents in Brooklyn I was studying philosophy at Brooklyn College and I thought that HTML was something you need to get vaccinated for I seriously went into this industry not knowing what HTML was but everyone starts somewhere you don't need to have an amazing degree you don't even need to finish college you don't need to have a tech background or come from a wealthy family and this is my adventure as an entrepreneur so chapter one it all starts with the idea despite my lack of tech chops I was always fascinated by the web I was amazed that you can build a website and millions of people across the globe can see it and at the time I thought it was like a push of a button I didn't understand what scaling was but that really fascinated me because if I wanted to open up a coffee shop let's say often a culprit coffee shop down the block from here I need one coffee shop here if I wanted to be in LA I mean it was so operational intensive to get over there so tech really fascinated me I actually started my first business in high school as a spammer not actually a spammer but my friend Charlie and I got together and I come from a very small Jewish community in Brooklyn and people wanted to advertise that to the community members but had no way of doing it online so we went out and we collected thousands and thousands of emails from people the community hustling in every way possible I through yearbooks to get emailed to had to sell the back of yearbooks I went to conferences and got people's emails from conferences and we if someone wanted to build an ad we had an ad and we sent an email from to them so I went from sending people emails for a living to helping people get rid of the emails and now back to our story the beautiful Jerusalem this is my best friend Josh and this is what brought us together and yes that is a blackberry how many people here had a blackberry at some point in their lives that's a nice amount so we were in Israel together we were about a hundred people and only two people in the entire school had a blackberry me and Josh so our rabbi came to I said guys I got a little bit of advice for you and you know when your rabbis telling you want to be a good Jewish boy you're gonna listen to your rabbi he's like Jojo Josh you both have blackberries and you both like business be friends oh you left all right we'll give it a shot it was love at first sight we figured out that our birthdays were both December 30th 1989 and we stayed up the entire night watching the first season of Gossip Girl later on we ended up going to burgers bar for breakfast lunch and dinner and we really became very good friends two years later we decided to that's life broken but we'll go with it anyways we decided to start a company together but instead of building one company our idea was we're gonna build 12 companies in one year because 99% of startups fail so chances are better if we build one company a month we had no idea how hard it was to build a company but we gave it a shot so we hired a couple of engineer's off of Craigslist and we thought we're entrepreneurs we're gonna make it happen our first thought it was called wearing social we connected to your social media accounts and helped you wear your identity so we took for example all your profile pictures and created a big Facebook like sign it failed pretty quickly but the concepts still cool and maybe one day we'll bring it back in actually so Josh and I were emailing a lot back and forth to try and figure out startup ideas but this guy would not answer any of my emails seriously he would get pissed at me if I'd answer one of his emails but we were sending ideas back and forth together and it just never got answered sorry I remember I called the guy yelled but I'm like Josh you want to start 12 startups in a year but we can't communicate because you're not answering my emails at the same time Josh went to a conference if someone told him help me unsubscribe with my emails do something to help me unsubscribe my emails and light bulb went off and that was the first logo of enrollment right the yarn ball I still love it and we have to bring the old t-shirts back because I don't have anymore it actually took us a full month to come up as a name for enrollment right we thought that we would have 12 startups in a year one startup a month and took us a full month to come up with a name it's impossible to find a domain name these days every dot-com is taken and we tried everything unsubscribe me unsubscribe err every single possible the domain name was taken if we wanted a dot-com and then we figured out okay you enroll in two emails and you unroll from emails and bam we just went for it first thing was it had to be simple I wanted every single person to be able to use unroll me no matter what device you use no matter who you are and no matter where you live but I really wanted to make sure that this lady could use it and that beautiful lady is my mother and she is the best and she is now a power user my mom has trouble turning on her computer but she is a power user so on one of our biggest outages everyone's emails are hanging their inbox my mom sent in a support ticket and if you can read it it says a lot of emails that I put in my roll up are coming into my inbox you know what my mom's complaining we're in trouble but at least she gave me up is Joe Joe's mom lol you know thank your mom and now was about looking at the competition who's out there what are they doing what are they all about so first we saw unsubscribe calm they were the biggest in the space they raised a few million dollars we get a download a plug-in what it was only worked on your desktop I was using email on my phone I wasn't the right solution fun fact James siminoff who started on subscribe calm and end of failing started ring years later and sold to Amazon for over a billion dollars this year so it all starts with email guys then there was other inbox aw they're always a lot better but it was all about moving messages from your inbox into another inbox folder and we still thought that wasn't enough so this was the first prototype of unroll made and this logo never went live the prototype never went live but it gives you the basic idea Microsoft Dell Apple you just click what you don't want right you click what you don't want and one click unsubscribe and then we get you to inbox zero and that was it that's where it all started now on to chapter two but let me grab a drink of water quickly but everything was great until it wasn't we decided to launch our alpha site and make an invite only because that was a cool ship back in the day I remember like five ten years ago everything was invite-only but we also use this our advantage and this is what we did the entire throughout the entire life cycle of unroll mate so we wanted to create buzz and we want to get a lot of press for our launch so instead of just emailing TechCrunch and Mashable and Lifehacker like hey we're launching a start-up with no funding but it helped people with email we said this is a closed beta and is invite only but the first thousand people that come via the TechCrunch article the Mashable article the Lifehacker article getting free and cut the line and this really helped us have a huge launch and it really was enormous we were covered all over the place right our servers crashed I didn't know what HTML was but I had to like come in and try to be an engineer to solve these problems and I would say it's like when everyone here is going to try and get press when you're trying to get think about a TechCrunch writer how many emails are getting is every day figure out what you can give them to get their audience excited that's more than just your product but there's always something that you can give to make your launch really successful and I remember you get on TechCrunch I thought I was that was it I'm gonna retire now I'm on TechCrunch you know it was invincible and then we went and decided to present at New York tech day a New York tech day is an amazing conference that had a couple hundred startups in science and a science fair like atmosphere presenting and we were probably the least impressive startup at the event but we came to win there were VCS there were judges there were reporters you know people looking for jobs and we're like what are we gonna do to stand out how are we gonna make it that every single person that is at that event is gonna be talking about on Romi and how can we be unconventional because everyone goes and they give out that you know the the credit card holders and the stickers but what were we gonna do that was going to be different so I had my friends come in and dress up in costume we had my friend Jimmy dressing up as a trashcan we had someone dressing up as you know that mr. spam I had a friend dressed up in like you know Captain Underpants costume to help kill spam and then we went one step further and we replaced all the toilet paper at the conference with on Romi branded toilet paper and seriously this was what everyone was talking about no one was talking about our startup no one's or any other stuff there talk about on Romi is crazy they replaced all the toilet paper in the conference with our toilet paper and we ended up winning we did it right again well I was that excited that I lifted up the trophy dropped it and has a big crack right down the middle but it's all it's all about the memories but seriously the next time anyone here is presenting at a conference we probably spent the least amount of money on that on that event all right we bought 20 rolls of toilet paper and went to Party City to get some costumes you think about doing something different that's gonna let you stand out right how do you be the the company that people are talking about at the conference so after the conference we were so hot we had 40,000 people on the waiting list I was ready to buy my Ferrari pop the champagne I thought Steve Jobs was gonna call me up and ask me to take you no charge and we decided obvious we weren't that cool but we decided to go all-in and I was in college I was I had my senior year I was actually studying for the LSAT I didn't actually want to be a lawyer and thank God I'm not because now I just get sued all the time and not what I want to do but like I'm a Jew in New York I faint every time I see blood so if I'm not gonna be a doctor I guess I'm gonna be a lawyer and it was time to do it I dropped out of college and I still have three classes left that I promised my wife I'll finish so I'll make it happen at some point but I was just too passionate about on Romi for it to be a side project all right it's very important to be passionate about what you're doing like you see that heart over there that's how passionate I still am about on Romi and what we were doing and now building the company with my best friends having a great co-founder is super important and being successful startup all right there are so many ups and downs there are so many things that you're doing and this is a person then when there are ups you're celebrating with but when the inevitable happen there are downs that you're bringing your you're bringing each other up it's very very important Josh trusted me with a product and I trusted him with the business and it really worked out well for us so make sure that you have a great co-founder when starting a company so again we were riding high until we talked to the guys with the money and it really her guys it really did they told us your startup sucks you can't make money this will never grow you guys have enough yet because we didn't we kept going for more days that you're not going to scale past a hundred thousand users you need a technical co-founder and I'm sure a lot of people here hear that and you don't need a technical co-founder because we didn't have one no one will invest this is the tool it's not a product and we kept hearing the same things over and over and over again and it was very very hard we always thought if you build it they will come you'll worry about everything else later but again we kept hearing the same things and imagine I had to go into the team and they knew we were had these VC meetings but Ida tell them sorry guys we're over 15 didn't raise a single dollar we thought we were on top of the world and now how do we overcome this we really believed in what we were doing I know this sounds obvious but if you have fully bought into what you're doing as a founder as an early employee for a start-up things will get hard there's no one has instant success in the startup world you're gonna get turned down from some VCS you're going to have points where like your servers just crashed and you have you haven't nowhere to go you're never done where it's like it just feels so hard what the hell am I gonna do take it over it if you believe in what you're doing it'll make this process so much easier so now into chapter 3 the breakthrough so we were scrappy and we were determined we were gonna prove them wrong we're gonna do it Everett took to make sure that we can go back to these VCS and show them everything that they said were a problem we solved at the same time we had to listen to their feedback you know vici they're smart they know what they're talking about they see thousands of startups a year but they told us so much you gotta build a product you gotta grow fast you gotta make money engage your users like we're four people on the team how are we going to do that and that's what we learned how important it was to prioritize correctly everyone has limited resources no matter if you're a two-person team a 50-person team a 200-person team you can't do everything you need to focus and you need to prioritize well so we decided to focus on two areas on making the best product possible and to grow to profess and we said if we have a great product and we're growing super fast we can go back to the VCS and finally raise around and that's what we did first we look at our data and we were surprised to find that people only unsubscribe from 30% of their subscriptions or like everyone's telling us that they have thousands of emails that they don't want and they want unsubscribe from all them so why are they only unsubscribe from 30% and we spoke to them and found out that people didn't want to miss the deals for all their subscription they were scared to hit that unsubscribe button but they still didn't want it in their inbox and that's when we came up with a concept of the roll-up so the roll-up combines all of your emails into one daily digest so instead of getting 50 emails you got one and you never miss out on a deal again that made us from a tool into a product the next thing was how are we gonna grow I was never a believer that people just share a product because they love it there are certain people that that are active on social and they're going to share things that they love but people like my mother people like my wife even like myself we don't just share things that we love on social media how are we gonna get there so we look for inspiration looked at Dropbox looked at the uber of the world the list of the world and they were offering you know if you share for every user you get to sign up for Dropbox is free space for you know oberon left you get right credits but we were a free product what were we gonna do and I also didn't like the fact that it was a it wasn't instant that I had to wait until someone actually signed up for me to get my credit so we thought very hard and we came up with a four share we thought what if instead of having a pay wall we had a share wall well users hate it can we get users to share and we said we were gonna try but we were nervous every advisor we had said this was going to be the death to unroll me they said people are gonna hate it you're focusing on growth more than focusing on the product it's gonna be the end of enrollment but we're like let's let the data give us the answers and that's what we did we found that at once the users see their subscriptions and also start from 5 newsletters that they felt the magic and they're willing to share at the time of launching the 4 share 90% of users who hit the share wall shared and I was like what are they sharing on Facebook or Twitter all right 50 it was 50/50 at the time but for every hundred users that was share on Twitter you would get one user in return versus every 100 use that was sharing on Facebook you would get anywhere between 80 and 150 users and return depending on how many we're sharing at the same time so we switch up the design and if you can see here we had to share on Facebook and then our other options this brought us from 50% sharing on on Facebook to over 80% sharing on Facebook took on Romi viral so when we were able to get one big burst you know a TechCrunch article a Today Show we had so many people sharing at the same time that it was at the top of everyone's newsfeeds if I had to pick one thing for the success of unroll me it's the for share we figured out a way to get majority of our users to share the service within the first five minutes of signing up alright so I made that sound easy but what would I do today if I was trying to die the next four share and you know across industries the first thing I would do is find the social incentive all right what can you give to your user that's going to incentivize them to share alright if you're a free product you know maybe you unlock features to share if you're a paid product I would challenge people here instead of doing the typical model of you know you have to invite someone and once they come then you'll get credit give them instant gratification you share you get a 5% discount you share you get $1 off I give them something right then in there because again the people aren't just going to share you because you have a great product you got oh you got to give them a push the second one is make sure when you before you push up to share you find the earliest time in the process of once you gain their trust right for us it was they see the magic of the subscriptions they start seeing that on Romi is working by pressing the unsubscribe button and now they trust us to go and ask them to share and they're more likely to share it so do some research look at the data and make sure that you're asking the users to share once they once they trust you and move beyond Facebook Facebook took us viral but Facebook is very different these days is much harder to go viral on Facebook right the algorithms have changed the usage on Facebook has changed look into alternatives like whatsapp Facebook Messenger look into you know just text messages and email so now on to chapter four after the four share we were growing rewriting thousands of users a day we had our first million users and things were things were looking good problem was how the hell are we keeping up our servers without being able to hire we were an unfunded team just had a friends and family around and trying to compete with hiring against Google and Facebook was practically impossible so we really had to think differently of who we were hiring it's all about the people right I am very passionate about my team I love my team and they're the ones that built unroll me not me right I help guide them through the process but building a great team is it the really way that you you could succeed just like I said you have to love what you do to me is even more important to love the people you work with and still to this day love the people with I work that I work with and it bringing you to work every single day our main philosophy I done Romy's [ __ ] resumes right I don't I never had a resume hopefully I'll never need a resume but we're not looking for the typical person I want to look for the diamond in the rough I won't want the person that's gonna go work at Google right we can't compete with that I want the person that maybe didn't study computer science in college right and took a coding class but really wants to do something different and really wants to hustle and work their butts off to take it to the next level and that's what we did out on row me and one of the perfect examples is Jack who's in the audience today Jack you're the best Jack was an intern for us and he ran part for us for years he's one of the most important people at unroll me and he did it the unroll me way he came in he worked hard he went from answering support tickets to you know sending t-shirts to to people on the you know to some of our users - seriously leading product and that's the way we did it and I would say same for everyone here look for alternatives look for different ways to hire people look for that diamond in the rough I take chances on people it's worth it and basically hire smart people you want to spend time with because we love to spend time together you know like we're a family or a family first you know we had a Thanksgiving meal together where everyone brought in a dish from their house it was a lot of fun and I can seriously talk about my team forever because they mean the most to me but I am gonna I'll move on on this one and get back to the story so we were doing pretty well in the tables really turned and remember all those VCS that turned us down every single one turned us down they all came back to us and the landscape changed the auger in our favor were we able to grow super fast now the value of having users you know email data start to really perk up right there are companies like slice that raise there was 30 million dollars to try and build the nielsen of online right companies like Procter & Gamble were able to see what Huggies is doing versus pampers at the Walmart stores but they weren't able to see what it was doing online so slice built a company to extract information from email receipts and help brands with market research data to understand how they're doing in the market and we were the one who the users so we ended up being the swing state so now we had to decide do we partner with one of these companies do we raise a VC round and try to you know monetize ourselves or do we get acquired and just focus on the user and we chose acquisition main reason for choosing acquisition is we want to do what we did best and that is user user user let someone else figure out the business model and seriously our acquisition story is like a freakin movie and I still can't believe what happened and how stressed I was because I was going on my honeymoon at the time also so it was really stressful the first company that we signed a letter of intent with we we're and due diligence for over three months and it wasn't a good fit now they're great people and I respect them a lot but we just didn't see eye to eye they didn't see us they saw said the number the number of users they didn't see the value in the team they wanted us to come in rip up the culture and do things their way but what really took it what really pushed it overboard was how they were treating our people I remember the first week after signing the letter of intent we asked them everyone on our team was getting underpaid because unfunded start up how much can you pay people so we said we need to get people to market rate and they kept pushing that conversation pushing that conversation pushing that conversation until three months after due diligence where they sent everyone their offer letters and it was like raising people by five percent so I got on a call to try and push that and change it I didn't work and they said Jojo as long as you come were happy so we decided we're team see you later and we walked away and that was hard because I had to go into the team and tell him this we were working on for three months it's gone we're walking away but we were in it together and we made it happen together so was at the end of the road what would happen next to unroll me we found the right partner we saw that a company slice got acquired by Rakuten seriously all we did was email the founder saying congratulation guys were so happy for you five minutes later get a phone call from harpy and Scot two of the founders Jojo Josh you guys still available or like I guess so like give me a number this with a Thursday give us until Sunday night and we'll have a letter of intent for you so first things first we gave him the salary numbers that we wanted everyone on our team to have and they approved it on the spot and said this is your team your decision we trust you and they went for it and then we gave him a number that we thought they wouldn't reach they said yes on Sunday night we had a we had a letter of intent and the rest is history and it's been amazing for us at Rakuten slice you know they really let us continue to be entrepreneurs even though you know Scott harpy Eric and Ben were founders that have done this multiple times you know they're all they're all teachers at Stanford they're now partners in Eric Schmidt's fund innovation endeavors have sold multiple companies but they trusted these 24 year old hustlers with no experience to run the company and let us do what we wanted to do they mentored us and they really let us grow into who we are today but most importantly they cared about the people and we were very aligned on the people and it's been an amazing experience for me so once we do post acquisition we went and finally launched our iOS app it's crazy that it took us like six years to launch an iOS app but we did it and we did the way that we always did at the unconventional way and we wanted it we came in to win it and we ended up being bigger than Gmail and snapchat for one week at the top of the App Store we were eighth overall in the App Store [Applause] so we went from not knowing what hTML was to 8th overall in the App Store and we have two joint project cross country with a slice team and the unroll me team coming together and building a product and it was really really awesome it's been an awesome adventure for us and unroll me is still going strong we have over 3.7 million active users we've been mentioned in the press over fifty eight hundred times and we process over a hundred and twenty-five million emails per day so now what what lessons can you take from this first one and I'll keep repeating this one even though I think you know I like it's pretty typical believe in what you do startup life is tough right major major roller coaster ride and if you don't fully believe in the company that you're working for once things get hard you're not going to be the ones that are able to like jump past it make sure you believe in what you do be unconventional I would challenge everyone here the next time that you're at an event do something different right if it doesn't work the next event do something different what's going to make you stand out and don't overthink it have someone freaking dress up in a costume I do your own version of the toilet paper is done I stand out there's so many startups these days it's so important to be able to stand out and share figure out a way to get your users to share in ways that people aren't doing take a chance don't just look at what's out there and do it that way take a chance and be unconventional and surround yourself by the right people most importantly I make sure that you work with people you love people that you're going to fight the battles with people that you're going to celebrate with people are you gonna cry with these are the people that you're gonna be with every single day you're from your co-founder who is like a spouse right to your team who's like your family to the people that eventually will acquire all of your companies out there make sure you surround yourself with people that you love thank you everyone again my name is Joe Joe feel free to reach out to me and guys because I'm not taking questions I'll be around for lunch so if anyone has questions you could tweet at me email me or just find me over here all right thank you everyone thanks for letting me speak

of light on all that dark I mean they were some holy so holy I had to get him out of that because we all know you can't survive that homeless and scared shitless I felt hopeless is then I met a drummer who had little money but he offered a song away from that and we had a little girl and she was truly the and we grew a family that was funny despite all the but I still thought money was a ticket out of that so I pushed through I sold out and I clogged for that only to find myself bankrupt again ya broke as like I literally didn't have so I screamed to God and I said I'm done with all that and there was nothing left to do but face my like I had to clean up that and I knew I had to change that I had to flip that script breakout and finally own my and I realized what I was taught about life was a big crock of that I was the one who attracted and created all that and I discovered happiness comes from inside and not from outside and finally I was happy and no one could take away that and that in itself was a miracle holy now here's where the gets really good see I had an idea there was a live issue I didn't like the smell of so I had to solve that now everybody thought I was crazy as because I'd follow my family around the house asked him when they were going to take his no joke I think please spray this before you ship and guess what it turned out to be the but I didn't have experience or even know jack-shit but I was creative as see I'd follow the hunt that seemed craziest then I got it energy is the real and following energy was the only I needed to know and I did not have time for so boy I practiced that so much so that now I am happier than and alive is and I've made a shitload of money while being turned on is [Applause] all by following what's resident is and yes sometimes I still get scared of and I still lose my but that does not stop me because my gut knows more than all that other and I can honestly stand here and tell you yes I am rich as but I mean rich in every way you can mean that surrounded by aliveness and being turned on is and I know following what's alive is the only thing even worthless so do you really want to be richest I mean do you really want to be richest yet they get your together by dropping that that's dragging you down stop worrying about outside and trust that only you know your trust it only you know your and dive into the that turns you on I mean focus on that lights you up and when that is resonant for God's sakes go for that and do not hold your back because you are worthy of and you are powerful as and you can change this because you are the did you hear me you are the and there is alive inside of you that holds the key to all that you desire and if you just tuned in and follow that that turns you on then you're going to be rich too no [Applause] so there's my story in a nutshell so you guys know me as the CEO of poopourri right and I've been in deep I've been in good I've experienced a whole gamut of and what you don't know is that I after my second bankruptcy when I was 38 years old I was done when I said I screamed to God and said I'm done with that like I literally was done I was like I never want to go back into business I do not want to be a part of that world because it's painful this is my second damn bankruptcy I keep falling on my face I don't want any part of that so I went on a spiritual sabbatical and I found peace within myself I had no desire for business and I'll never forget the day I was a dinner party and my brother-in-law said can bathroom odor be trapped and I felt this like zing up my arm and like everything went to hi-def and I'm like yeah it can be and I can do that with oils and of course he said really you think so I was like yeah I know so so I started moving towards this idea to today you see poopourri we sold 40 million bottles or even more we're a household name it's a breakthrough category creator but I never intended any of that all I was doing was following an alive idea so we're trucking along and I'm having a good time because remember I told you when I was back there I said I am NOT going back there I had the luxury of losing everything and I say luxury because we rarely have that time when we have a clean slate like I was wiped out wiped clean so I was able to rebuild on something different so when I came back into business I said I'm gonna do fun because what I know is you don't know when you're gonna lose all the and what's worse than losing everything is losing everything and realizing that you didn't even have a good time now I'm not joking like that's what really sucks okay so I was like I'm not doing it like literally if it doesn't feel good I'm not doing it and it wasn't any strategy it was literally like I am NOT gonna go back there I'm not gonna sell out I'm not gonna push through and I'm not gonna claw through that anymore like I'm done so I did it different there was sort of like this intuition that came in it's just I'm just not going back there so I don't care so I had this luxury and one day my friend calls me and he wanted to do a video of me he said where do you want to talk about I said I want to talk about success like it's boring here I'm talking to you guys about it Lia's yeah me there he is how do you know which idea to follow and I'm trying to tell him in my body I'm like well you've kind of like you're pulled towards and you know and you feel excited but you don't he goes I don't know what you're talking about I was like yeah I'm either so I started using my company as a petri dish I started going in and kind of really when we start making business decisions I was like how did we know to go make this viral video how did we know how to do that so I sort of was observing as we were operating and what I realized is that it seemed that the ideas we followed we were all excited about and passionate about seemed to work out they had some sort of weird resiliency and that was like why is that and whenever we tried to do something because that's what you do when you're in this category or that's what you do in business you know what everybody says you're supposed to do like it rarely worked out for us so I wondered if we were an anomaly and then I had a theory our ideas alive a question so I called dr. bruce lipton he's a cellular biologist and I said our ideas alive and he said why do you ask I said because it seems like some ideas that I have are actually they they work out more and I said I have a theory that those 75 percent or whatever that number is now businesses that fail it's because that was a good plan it wasn't an alive passionate idea inside of them I said also I think viruses are considered living of since found out they're not I go but how can that travel from person to person but an idea or a meme or a thought that travels isn't considered living where does life begin and where does it end and he said these are really great questions and he said there may be something to teach you here in physics first of all he said everything is a living vibration everything is an energetic vibration and every living thing is seeking more lifeforce energy so who knew that then he taught me about resonance and dissonance so we're gonna go into a physics class I know y'all thought I was gonna tell jokes all day we're not we're gonna talk about physics real quick as soon as they change the slide younger so he taught me about dissonance and he's a dissonance is when you take two energy waves that are traveling at different speeds and different wavelengths those two together create less energy than they do apart did you hear that do you have energy you're going along you hook up with someone that's like this you literally have less energy than when you started that's got distance then you tell me about resonance he said resonance is when you take two energy waves and they're traveling at the same speed and the same wavelength you put those two together and they actually have more energy together than they do apart I am like what thank you hear that they literally have more energy together than they do somehow they're amplified so I started thinking back to my life prior you're in the bankruptcy when I was 38 and I started realizing about dissonance of it went away and I started noticing whenever I would make decisions they were literally from my head up there was no alive feeling in my body it's literally like what you say I need to do this I need a mentor I need to go around and what what do I have to do had to do this okay great great great everything was outside myself and it was extremely cerebral what happened is I was victim right I blamed everybody life was against me it ended up in bankruptcy was heavy tense and I was always protecting like I was just worried every single second and I realized that that's what happens when I'm making decisions not from my full body and not worried about what becomes alive if everything is so strategic I end up like this and I'll tell you in our business we practiced this so much that whenever we're in distance we call it struggle or wonky world like we notice it and we'll kind of do like a Zen painting and scratch it and I'll tell you one example we were going into the UAE and my attorney calls me and says we're gonna have to give the formula up to the government of Saudi Arabia and I'm like why and he said it's just legal we have to don't worry I'm gonna find you an attorney and we found a female attorney which I was super excited right I'm like you go girl so we found a female attorney we have the call law set up I'm gonna have to give away my formula which my formulas my trade secret kind of like Kentucky Fried Chicken I'm in my car I'm driving to work my assistant ten minutes after the call was take place the calls not happening and she calls me panicked she was I don't know what happened I mean I literally called the hotel before the call I got through I've tried every number I've tried three phones and I go just calm down settle down choose the call will not go through back if something's not right just stop I say call the attorney time to find us another attorney she's like what and I said yeah something's not right here something is dissonant like I can feel it something's not right so my attorney knows me he goes finds another attorney two months later he comes in he's like Suzy you're not gonna believe this he said you know he said we got the new attorney and we don't have to give up the formula had we given up the formula it would have been public knowledge but what I did is I realize that there was struggle in this phone call and whenever there's struggle I stop and go hold on something's not quite right this is how intuitive I'm talking and then the opposite of that is resonance resonance is constructive interference in what I realize is when we are going about ideas that feel resonant like things just feel alive like remember there's two energy waves we're sitting here and all of a sudden we get an idea and it's like oh my god you can feel the energy in the room rays have y'all felt that before you know it everybody's like buzzing and we're on fire we're like oh everybody's working you're working night and day and night and day and it doesn't matter because you're pulled towards that what I call an alive idea you felt in who you felt it yeah see there's something to that this is the physics so what happens is before the alive idea you're just trucking along that alive idea Compton Wow like I am amplified it's the same thing with people within groups if you're in struggle within a group watch that get the group together that is amplified together because they're creating a field of resonance what I've discovered is whenever I'm in a resonant situation and doing something that turns me on like life is for me like it feels like I've got a skip in my step everything just sort of works out the first example I have of that as girls do poop the company was about eight years old competition was coming in and I felt something inside of me I'm like we got to get the show on the road like what are we doing we've been sitting around in boutiques like we got a truck and I find these guys we go camp out for two weeks and in two weeks we wrote a script built the website cast cast for the video and we filmed a four-day video in four different locations and that became the viral hit girls do poop the reason that's so exciting is because we did all of that work that you think is pretty impossible in a two-week period we did it because of resonance another situation is we had a video a music video interview scene is called imagine where you can go and this was a music video but have you seen it would she just get the joke well that's what happened so I take my team I always take them off site so I took them off team we're in Hawaii we're there for about a week we're riding and riding riding we don't come up with a song I tell my team I want to make a music video nobody's made of consumer goods product with a music video they're like you're crazy I'm like it's fun hell virgin did it with her you know thing like we can do it for a poop spray so we got it why'd we camp out my team comes home a week later and they're like this what's going on they said we don't have a song I can't we have ten pages of rhymes what's a song it's a rhyme right like don't worry dude we got it so I was filming in LA and I'm on side two NBC studios and I'm sitting with the producer because it's an all-day thing and I said you know I need a songwriter one that should be signed that's not because you start dealing with all about it you know it's dissonant and he goes you know what I'm a producer the voice I know the perfect guy his name's Jeff Lewis I said Jeff Lewis's is awesome he was yep two hours later we're in the elevator NBC studios that producers like Susie and what and he goes Jeff Lewis like what what are you talking about right there's Jeff Lewis so I meet Jeff Lewis we and if we make the video it's another viral hit it's amazing but what happened is it was fun you know I'm saying there was another strategy like we have to do this and we have to pull these numbers and we have to do this we're literally working through synchronicity and magic it's an experiment it's vibrant it's a startup energy all the time it's endless upload creativity's just going we get out cameryn duddy they're just an uptown funk you know what is it four billion views he did it for like 1/4 of his price he's probably like kill me right now but anyway he was like this is a dream job everything just sort of worked out so what I've discovered I started going okay residents and dissonance residents and dissonance and I was like how do you know whether you're in residence and I figured out there's four signs for me and I want you to try these on for yourself that tell me if I'm in a resident situation and the first one as I'm turned on and lit up remember how I said that energy increases like that's when you see yourself researching every night you become with poopourri I was obsessed no one I didn't want a business I never ever ever thought about it being a business everybody thought I was crazy but I was obsessed about whether I could do this thing or not once I figured it out then I knew it had to come into the world but I wasn't thinking of that I was literally like oh my god I can make this happen I can make this happen that's where you get on these roles where you're just into the work and nobody and you are lit up you don't need caffeine you don't need coffee you don't need sleep you are just rolling and going the second one is body sensations what I've noticed have you been around people and they go oh my god I've got chill bumps right you tell an idea of something they're like oh my god I've got chills like yeah that body sensation mine comes iing up my arm I don't know where yours go sometimes they're at the front of my legs so sometimes I'll be sitting there we'll be in a meeting and when I'm in meetings I'm gauging the room like a shaman from energy levels but yeah I don't feel it I don't feel it I'm gonna fill it and the idea pop up on the oh okay hold on let's lean into that like I felt something right here I felt something in my arm and legs there's also a pulling towards everybody can jump on to that the third one are signs of synchronicity right so people used to call this Suzie's world of course that happens in Suzie's world of course it is I know it happened in your world too so what happens is when you're in resonance things just kind of work out it's I don't know you guys are probably all too young but do you remember mr. Magoo I didn't even remember mr. Magoo cartoon yeah we have like 10 okay good well mr. Magoo he was so amazing because he would be driving down a highway he did these big glasses where he couldn't see he'd be driving on a highway you couldn't see anything and you're thinking he's gonna go off the bridge and then a boat will come underneath him right and he was land right on it so that was the whole mr. Magoo cartoon so what happens is you need a rider you need a song producer and all of a sudden he's in the elevator or he's sitting on the plane next to you or like oh my god my cousin did that or you know that that happens there's no exhaustive searching like it's just it's like it'll literally come to you if you say open and look and the fourth thing is that idea keeps knocking on your door it does not leave you alone how many times have you heard somebody say oh my god I've had this idea for six years I haven't ever done it or 10 years or somebody I'll finally come out with it and they're like oh my god you know I thought of this idea 12 years ago and it hasn't left me alone that's another sign of resonance that idea and you are a perfect match so it's gonna stick with you now here's what's cool about all this remember when I told you about resonance and that the energy wave has to match it has to have the same wavelength and the same speed but when it matches it creates more energy together than it did apart okay hold on for a second I'll explain to you what that means my interpretation is that means if you were not able to pull that idea off then it would have never in the first place been a resonant match do you I mean like I feel chill bumps with that like I feel it that's the truth because it would not be attracted to you so all those ideas you have and you dream up and people tell you all this stuff you know don't worry about it because literally if that idea came to you you have everything within your power to bring that into the world because that idea is resonant with you here's another thing that I think is freaking cool do you remember how I said the two wave legs you've got one separate then you've got the other one just like two people what we forget about is we're bringing 50% of energy to the party guess what that ID is bringing the other 50% of the energy so it's not all up to you when do you guys get that yeah so we always think I have to do it I have to pull it off I have to make this happen right what you don't understand is that idea if you allow it is also bringing its own energy to the party if you just be open and follow the signs and follow the resonance this is where trust your gut comes in we don't hear a lot about intuition we're starting to hear a little more about intuition business some people call this intuition I explained it as physics or that I saw it in physics because I think that helps our Western mind because we're so in our head but really you are born with an internal GPS system that we abandon when we're young we're taught don't listen to that oh you're silly you're crazy you're crazy my toss to you is that you start doing anything to clear away whatever is keeping that from being alive in you because that right there is your power source that is 100% that is going to guide you better than any mentor in the world now that's the truth so the mentor can give you advice and when they give you advice you you get into your body and either it feels good or it doesn't and if it doesn't feel good you turn around and run you go thank you so much I'm going to go over here because you can trust yourself so I'm going to ask you one more time do you really want to be Rich's do you I didn't believe you do you really really want to be richest yet yeah who's this guy bring him to your party then get your together by dropping this that's dragging you down stop worrying about outside and trust that only you know your and dive into the that turns you on and focus on that lights you up focus on that lights you up and when that is resident for God's sakes go for that and do not hold back because you are worthy of you are powerful is and you you alone can change this because you are the you are the and there is alive inside of you that's the key to all of that that you desire and if you just tuned in and turn on and move towards that a live then you're going to be rich - no [Applause] thank you I think they said we got a couple of questions or something was there a situation in which the residents didn't quite work for you why do we have to spray before okay that's an easy one you don't have to but it actually worked the best before because it's actually trapping the odor on the surface of the water okay so you're actually handling the situation before it begins but it'll still work after it's not as effective your as fun as oh thank you how do you wait how do you find best pick your team to increase residence a certain idea project what I do is when I told you I literally sit around in meetings and III am very vocal I say you know I'm not feeling the energy here I'm not feeling this in the room right now and then we just keep tossing out more ideas and in our in our environment you don't have to have the great idea we are literally playing but once we get something it's like literally hooking onto a jet pack where we start riding when it is I go oh my god I feel it like I feel chills our buddies like I feel chills we feel excited and that's when we start riding that idea and going deeper and before that we're just playing and we're just tossing if there are a lot of shits like you up how do you choose which one is the best I like that I read you can have a lot of shifts you know you can be working on you know my mentor says you can work on five major things at one time and I literally would bounce back and forth to which one's turning you on in the moment right like I oh my god I got this idea for this one you work on that project and oh my god I had this idea for this one you don't have to do it in such a linear fashion that's the way artists do if you look at painters they're painting several paintings you know all over the place they're not necessarily sitting down working on one so I would continue doing it okay I don't know how many we okay we're done okay did you Brut step oh i bootstrapped I've never had alone never had an investor completely self-funded Spray before you spray oh that's a good one okay anyway I think we're done thank you so much I appreciate it [Applause]

[Music] I'm here to talk about a topic that's not very commonly talked about in Silicon Valley because this is the home of venture capital but we bootstrapped our company entirely never raised a single dollar and it's a 22 year journey and I'm going to talk about some of the lessons we learnt and I'm going to share and the biggest one that's there in the title it's the mindset when bootstrapping is more than anything else it's your you have to conquer your own mind first and then only you are you know able to build a business first question how many of you recognize this SNMP what it stands for I would not be surprised if most of you didn't know because it's a very obscure thing it's simple network management protocol and this actually is if you look at that was our very first product actually this was 22 years ago we called it a Java SNMP API it's really very popular product right it's popular brand name but you know it's actually there's a lesson here for bootstrapping in fact ie I remember even at that time I mean you're selling something like this even your mom won't recognize what this is right actually we still sell that product by the way it's still we have a website where we sell the product but this is a very tiny part of our business and we sell a lot more these days when you have probably seen the Zoho you know commercials watched all of this those now we call ourselves the operating system for business and that's over 40 products in that suite including this presentation this is actually made from zoar show our online presentations after that as part of the one so that's what we are known for these days but as I mentioned we still sell that original that Java SNMP API and here is the thing that I liked about that starting there well it paid our bills it is not a huge 6e market but it paid our bills and it trained our engineers we learnt how to do how to build software and we learnt how to build software outside the pressure cooker of large scale right we learn to build you know smaller kind of software and that's valuable training and then it taught us business actually taught me sales and marketing I am an engineer you know I still know how to write code but the thing that I had to learn is how to sell how to market in fact if I had to go back and redo it I'd probably learn a little more of the sales and marketing because that's one thing that probably in the early years I had to struggle with they taught us the business you know how to how to build a business or run a business and it allowed us to invest in more software and more and more in 22 years now we have built a lot of software and we have now you know we would be considered one of the largest private companies now in definitely largest one of the largest private software companies in the world and having never raised money and we are going to stay private we are never now that we have tasted this the freedom we are never going to go public and SNMP also this thing kept us alive to fight another day this is something that I would tell our people early on that this puts food on the table and it keeps us alive to fight and fight and fight and we built from that experience of staying in business and fighting living to fight another day and this is actually something that really I stress for particularly for a bootstrapping company you have to find ask yourself what is my SNMP that's a good way to ask the question and today this is our Joe one the operating system for business and it is the full suite of sales and marketing and accounting from email collaboration all of this in one suite let me give you some simple guys navigating the whole bootstrapping how you do this I won't be the person to approach if you are raising lots of money and I don't say that this is the only way in fact it's something that's important everything I say in this you should the disclaimer any advice in any philosophy or to realize that it's very contextual there isn't some universal truth that applies to all people at all times this is what from our experience what you can learn and apply it to your context see what you what makes sense for you and the first five years for us I was thinking only one thing that is survive survive survive survive survive this is actually true for a lot of startups but particularly bootstrapping right you you literally have to bring in the money to keep the doors open and if you I know the the most common thing in business failure is so you just run out of money simply you an idea may be good your product may be good your vision may be good you keep customers happy you keep employees happy but if you run out of money or it's game over particularly through in bootstrapping so this is the first thing that I would tell myself tell our team that we have to survive if you can survive we can try we can even win but we first have to survive and if a market segment is particularly in a bootstrapped mode actually if you go back 22 years and those of you who were old enough to remember that was the time Yahoo and Google and eBay they were all born Amazon they were all young companies at the time in fact I remember this when we were starting out Yahoo had not at least a million dollars in revenue that was the time and why didn't we go and compete in that space well all those guys made Yahoo at raised maybe 20 30 40 million dollars at the time there's no way we with no money could compete with them then why didn't we go and raise money it's not actually easy even today with all the capital floating around most people still will get rejected right most of most people who approach venture capital are going to get rejected so and most people who even apply for incubators are going to get rejected so the default assumption you should make is you're going to get rejected for funding and and so my advice is how do you build in spite of maybe not being able to raise money or maybe you don't want raise money in our case it was a mix of both I mean we we knew it is going to be not easy to raise money but we also may be a you know early on we didn't really want to be raising money so you find the market opportunity that's not heavily contested heavily funded and bootstrapping works best if you find that niche but make sure something exists right there's a market that's a balancing act I mean if the market is too large too hot too many players are already heavily funded or chasing it your opportunity is going to be limited in that market so you have to find that cross between a market that is there but not so sexy that too many players are chasing it typically venture capitalist will avoid anything that is not on a billion dollar potential at least and this is a true story actually in 97 we were exhibiting our software in a trade show in Las Vegas where I actually drove from here to Vegas I mean I couldn't afford a plane ticket it was cheap and we stayed in this like $15 or $12 a night hotel where they subsidized you for gambling there right except that I didn't gamble so we were Hawking this is this was the show we were showing this and we actually found some really valuable customers of the diamond that particular event probably got us half a million in Romania eventually there was the particularly vent where we got started in a in effect and a VC saw this and asked us what do you guys do and said we are doing this software he asked how big is his market I mean we are at zero right we are at zero revenue I took a wild guess and said maybe ten million dollars there was a wild guess I had no idea and this was the thing why are you so unambitious I begged him this was the question I had no answer except that I thought to myself well if I'm too ambitious then I wouldn't have a business because I wouldn't be able to raise any money for all the ambition ambition is good but you know then you already tell the story and somebody has to trust you putting the money all of that and if I start in this niche maybe there is a way to find it I need it exactly worked out that way in the diamond where we actually pulled in about two critical customers who each paid us about quarter of a million dollars so from that single event we made half a million dollars and yet we see told us why he saw an ambitious and so you ideally want a small niche that could become bigger right and accept that this niche we found actually I you know I don't know wine what reason I had heard the ten million number because we found ourselves actually such rating at about ten million about seven years later that's exactly what happened so in after seven years we reached the ten million number that I had predicted and there was no growth left I mean we just completely flat and this was also the time if you remember the post September 11 the economy was bad things were generally crappy and lot of coms were dying or dead and even our own customers who were labeled customers before now we're going away so it was that seven-year itch we faced with the doldrums and well we had a business it was profitable the bad news was it wasn't there wasn't much growth left I could see the trend clearly I could see the writing on the wall if you had stuck to that business we would just a tiny forever basically it was clear so here's what we did we just simply became our own we see at that point we had a 10 million business it tagged reasonably you know profitable it had good cash flow we invested our own money in our social this time we became our own VC and bigger market and we found market segments again this time bigger but again not potentially too hot that was part of our mission because if you find it too hard if somebody else has raised 100 million and if you are going up with your like say 5 million capital how are you going to win so that's a calculus always in my head I would always be looking for who's raising what in this because simply so that we can condition ourselves in what kind of money we have to compete with them there's a lot of times people log in you in sales and marketing so we actually found a bigger market segments and we invested and that took off and we have to be gain strength in that we invested again in bigger market this time this time we had a hundred million kind of revenue now we could reinvest a lot more right our scale had grown we could invest a lot more we reached a point at some point now really just a VC money cannot outgive us anymore we can go ahead to hit against any venture capital kind of money so that is no longer a niche and that is so our Zork are essentially our third act in this serially but we are still in that first two we are doing quite well in all first two the very first one I mentioned the tiny niche and then the second one we call it engine the third one is all they're all divisions in our company now and of course though is the biggest of them all it's the it's playing in the largest playground essentially every business could be a customer for so that's how was the market segment is but to be able to do that we need capital and we have succeeded in the first two enough to bring in the capital to invest and now Soho has taken off in a big way and this is the you know this stone was of co-founder of Twitter it's familiar that time being perseverance and ten years of trying but one modification I'll say twenty years well that's the bootstrapping story right I'll just give you a couple of quick tips it's useful to think of yourself starting at here minus five not here zero that's why it's very useful when you're bootstrapping because otherwise we are comparing yourself to people who have raised money it'll always will feel like they're right of you but when you don't have any money you will use the mindset of minus five and if you reach here zero you've gone five years but you still have only gone to your zero right and the total number of people who really care about your business I mean how much truth can you handle right you gotta assume that okay you have to assume that actually well after maybe five years seven years we still act convinced ourselves that we were in business actually we were a business and in fact the zero is an optimistic count right because if you include all the active naysayers as a negative count but let's say optimistic keep it at zero right so your business number of people who care about it zero that's a good number you know what that includes the near and dear to they may not tell you but most of them actually don't believe in your business yet keep that in mind because you know it's useful to have that realistic mindset and that way I never got upset for example you know when my own cousin or somebody doesn't even know what we do you ever learn to not get upset right right after like the first million dollar in revenues when we could feel that we are on legitimate business that's what bootstrapping does to you so you are because you're constantly battling that you know existent she'll don't are we in business are we not and they you know they have a name for it the impostor syndrome but a bootstrapper that's like imposter syndrome squared you know like you feel that even more strongly so you have to kind of overcome that self-doubt and that's part of that mindset I talked about in the beginning so that's like the real essence of bootstrapping here that the mindset of that you bring in you start and you have minus five and you assume that nobody will really care you have to overcome your own self-doubt and then the practical advice of your own finding the market niche all of them so it's ultimately now I'll go into a little bit of philosophy you have to realize that it is a self-discovery process you are discovering your own inner strengths over the course of time and for myself that is absolutely true that it's some things I learned to do things I never thought I would be able to do like actually presenting know I'm an engineer I you know I only thought I could quote but under the later I realized I could do these things and you are when your self discovery is funded by someone else what happens is it it kind of becomes Self Indulgence often which we see right when people raise too much money too quickly and the thing becomes self-indulgent or I know we call this the or familiar bootstrapping is Mort sure the trustafarian that's the name right the self-indulgent you don't have any kind of self-discipline in the way you spend money but bootstrapping that's the nice thing about it you have that balance between discipline and that indulgence you are your discovery is tempered by your discipline and finally I'll just leave you with this because you are in Oakland you're in San Francisco Bay Area it's something important we are the most expensive real estate in the world as a bootstrapping person you have to give yourself all the advantages you can give yourself because you don't have many advantages so ask yourself why am I paying the highest IRR into the world and and suffering from the highest cost of living in the world go figure out somewhere that's cheaper that's something very important there's something that I constantly tell people you don't have to be in a particular location to achieve your goals and the the cut your personal burn rate when you do that you give yourself a longer runway even with the limited funds you have so and finally we have actually I'm rerouting here you have seen our our trailer outside the Zoho big yellow one and I have one on once now after this so you can sign up and this is the DC war dot t-- o-- one on one that's the URL so you can go register I'll be here the rest of the evening so feel free to meet me thank you thank you [Applause]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
[Applause] [Music] hey everyone i'm jerry CEO and co-founder of touch up modern and i want to talk to you guys about the decision between profitability and growth this is one of those things that's often a trade off that startups have to make because you know in a perfect world you can do both but in reality if you could do both you would never tell anyone about it and so we wouldn't be talking about it so just some facts about touch of modern on the kind of on the bird's-eye view founder in 2012 16 million revenue 16 million registered users and we launched about 30 brands a day on our site because really we're all about discovery and when we'll be showing something new every single day obviously this is a great challenge to be kind of doing this on a day to day basis and so we've grown to about 130 in annual sales and we got to a point where we had to decide whether or not to keep on this venture funded growth path or make the pivot to profitability i'll talk to you about some of the decision points that we had to weigh in to make that decision so some of the factors that are really important are the amount of money you've raised versus the annual revenue and this is something that's often overlooked by young entrepreneurs because in Silicon Valley you go out there and you want to raise as much money as possible obviously that's good to give you a cushion because you always need more than you think but the bad thing is when you raise too much for the actual revenue that you're generating it limits your options in terms of what you can do next because with raising money comes expectations from investors of how much you need to grow before the next round some of the things to consider also the past valuations again everyone wants to pump their valuations super high because it feels good but again limits your options for your next round as well because obviously the next one needs to be multiples higher than that and then for we were practically near ebay da profitable as a company the way we've run the company we always kind of looked at it as swimming with one hand close enough to edge of the pool where even though we're growing we always knew that if we needed to become profitable we could obviously there's still some unknown of where that I could pull it off but we had a pretty good idea that we could and also not our investors burned by e-commerce failures but in general a lot of folks in the space had become kind of jaded by ecommerce because of some of the other exits that happen in the recent years right gilt you know a lot of investors lost money on that some made money obviously and likewise the other companies that are that are near it so what are some of the risks between deciding so what are some of the risk of the consider when deciding between profitability and growth right when you decide to become profitable obviously the company culture really changes you start managing to a much smaller number which is the money actually bring in versus the the high-level number which is just gmv revenue whatever it is for you guys and then also you start thinking about competitors who are pouring millions of dollars into acquiring possibly the same market that you are if you're gonna decide to become profitable you're not going to be spending as much as they are and you need to figure out what you're gonna do about that so for us we finally decided to shift from growth to profitability this is about some time mid last year and the reason we were able to do that is because we did really deep research and an analysis about our most loyal customers because for us and for a lot of companies in Silicon Valley the greatest cost is marketing and growth right and so if you're gonna pull back on that what are you gonna do to make up that revenue and for us we found that we had a really loyal user base that we can actually nurture and grow to offset the amount that we were pulling back so here are some stats about what we found about our users which is actually really unique for an e-commerce company so for this is and this chart shows anybody who's ever visited touch of modern the site or the app in 2012 and we found that 10% of those people actually come back every single day which is really like gaming level economics for a our gaming level metrics for an e-commerce site right and about 40% of that entire group as you come back at least once a week which means they pretty much see every single thing that we put up at any given time and 80% of anyone who's visiting 2017 not just purchased by anyone who's ever visited actually come back at least once a month and no surprise people who come back more often also more likely to purchase so someone who comes back on a daily basis is about 10 times more likely to buy than somebody that only comes back once every three weeks and this is a little bit also about the category preferences so this is important because if we're gonna talk about how do we serve our best customers we need to know how they're actually different than some of our less profitable customers and we found is that the category preferences are actually completely inverted from someone who so someone who visits every single day and purchases a lot it's actually completely inverted from someone who doesn't visit a fan maybe purchases once a year or less and this is really important for us because we found that okay well we can't actually cut any category because people that are new actually want the things that our most loyal customers are not that interested in right and so if we just cut the categories that are not as popular with our most loyal customers we lose a user acquisition channel for new users right and so we couldn't really cut that but what we could do is really beef up on the things that the most loyal customers want just give you an idea of you know the scale the spectrum about 80% of our revenue come from the top 20% of customers and so when we did this there was a little bit outdated from the first time we put this together but we're now 10 months EBIT are profitable after having made that shift and focusing more on on the repeat customer and a little bit less on user acquisition and so what are some of the key takeaways and how should you decide about becoming profitable versus sticking to growth and there is a few things that you really need to factor in decision-making the first one is understanding the market and what is actually more valuable at the given time so your main responsibility as a CEO as a founder is to produce the most valuable company that you can possibly produce right and depending on investor sentiment depending on what competitors are doing or whatever market forces there are at any given point growth could be valued more profitability could be valued more and in the years prior to this decision that we've made growth was obviously you know in style you know the other companies were growing like crazy but then when they started suddenly failing investors suddenly got smart and said you know what maybe burning a ton of money just to grow the top-line revenue is not the is not the smartest thing for this kind of company right because ecommerce is not like a SAS company it's not super high margin and you can't just kind of make small tweaks and and and right the ship if you needed to become profitable so they started looking at you know how how do you actually become profitable right because all these other companies that spent so much to grow couldn't do it so that was something that the factors in our decision-making right in general what my philosophy and philosophy of our founders has always been is that growth for any given category comes in and out of style but profitability is always cool so it's also the harder thing to do another decision you have to think about is do you actually have the levers or do you understand the levers that you can pull to achieve that desired result right and for some companies it's easier to become profitable because you know you've been close or you really understand the metrics and what you can tweak to get there or it's easier just to raise money because I don't know you have the connections you have an existing investor base I can introduce you to other investors who can get it done right both of these carry their own execution risks because if you were a growth company and you decide to become a profitable company and you can't get there then you're neither possible nor are you growing and that is really the worst position to be in obviously and you know if you bet your chips on growing and raising and raising money to grow and that doesn't happen we also fall flat on your face and thirdly and I think this is probably the one that is least talked about in the valley is that even though you're you're you know aligned with your investors because the equity and all that the way that you think about risk is also different than the way that your investors think about risk and you should have a very honest conversation with your board and with your investors about that right and I think you know oftentimes when you're starting out you think oh this is great I'm putting in my time the investors are putting the money so the risk is really more on them it's actually not because you only have your given amount of time the investors have a large portfolio they have a lot of companies that they're betting on right you're just one of them so they're always gonna ask you to shoot for the moon because if you fail you know there's a bunch of other companies that that might make it for you if you fail that's your entire livelihoods and that's all the years that you spent on this company right and so you're gonna be a little bit more risk-averse when it comes down to making that decision so you know talk to them and figure out what's really the best for both of you thank you [Applause] you

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
you just popped it Kanye West get right for the summer work that chain and ladies exactly you might better pull you a rapper hey everyone I'm Ethan thanks a lot to the hustle con folks for having me before we get to what I'm supposed to talk about it's five ish you guys have been sitting all day we're gonna stretch everyone get up I'm gonna do it with you get up get up get up get up get up everyone get up all right you're gonna put your hands up you're gonna grab your left wrist with your right hand and you're gonna lean over to your right side hold it for five yeah the opposite side of me five four three two one switch hands we're gonna go the other side five four feel it on your right side three two one let go grab your hands behind your back interlock your fingers and lift as high as you can you're gonna open up your chest and ideally hit the person behind you four five four three two one that's it thank you sit down all right so let me grab my clicker so for those of you who don't know Optive is an on-demand audio fitness product our members pay $99 a year for unlimited access to a large on-demand content library we have twenty two categories of classes over 2,500 classes and we released 40 new classes a week we try to remove barriers from fitness so we don't think that it should be about you know how much money you can afford to spend or how close you live to a studio or some fancy new equipment so we focus exclusively on audio content our trainers motivate you they guide you through workouts and we have everything from treadmill to strength training to rowing to boxing and we've grown quite well we launched the business three years ago we have raised a little over fifty million dollars we announced our Series C just two days ago which was a twenty two million dollar round we had thank you we had invest this time this time we raise money from some strategic so we had Amazon Disney and Warner Music invest in the company which is an exciting vote of confidence from some key players in the space so we launched the business three years ago and we grew beautifully we did five thousand dollars of revenue in November of 2015 and 1.7 million in July of 2017 so that's a 24% compounded monthly growth rate over that period which is cool the problem with that level of growth is that growth is very expensive and the problem with expensive growth is that you burn an obscene amount of money so we realized that we were burning a little over two million dollars a month and in July we burned July of 17 we burned 2.4 million dollars and you know burn is an interesting thing that's been talked about a lot because it's very relevant and important there's sort of the tactical challenges with burn right which is you're actually running out of money you have to pay people you have to pay for things etc but if you ignore the tactical problems with burn the real problem is that you're losing control of your company you're losing control of the thing that you want to build because if you're constantly burning money you're constantly raising money and if you're constantly raising money you're at the whim of the investor community you don't get to have this say that you want to have on the product that you're building a product is a perspective those of you who are founders are building a product because you have a perspective on the way that the world should be and if you're a high burn company you will inevitably lose control of that perspective so we asked ourselves how do we stop the burn and there's typically three options associated with reducing burn the first one is layoffs I wasn't going to do that I I love my team there they're fundamental and crucial to everything that we do there's there's simply no way I was going to layoff my team to save the cash burn it's it's not something that would be fair to them fear out of the business or fair to the members the other option that some people suggested was to slow down our acquisition spend you know we're a young company many of you are founders you have young companies I think that the number one piece of leverage the highest point of leverage that any of us have against whoever the large behemoth is in the space that we're trying to disrupt is speed that's the highest point of leverage that I need us have and if we slow down our acquisition spend that means we slow down our growth that means we lose speed and if you lose speed you're giving up everything so I wasn't going to do that either we asked ourselves is there some kind of third magical solution that we're not thinking of or that you know people haven't advised us about or that we don't read about and we realized fortunately that there was and that was to fix the working capital position of the business so let's talk about working capital for those of you who don't know what it is working capital is basically looking at the cash inflows of the business and the cash outflows of the business and what you want to do is set yourself up such that you have a positive cash balance between the money that's coming in and the money that's going out and a lot of people don't talk about it you know especially in the startup community it's not something that's a topic of conversation we sort of see an invoice that's due and we pay it out or we book some revenue and we don't really care if it comes in 5 10 15 30 60 days that's absolutely the wrong way to think about your business the cash position of your business the inflows and outflows will determine the success of the product you're trying to build it literally is the amount of control you have in your product and I know that sounds I don't know dramatic or bullshitty or whatever but I promise you the more control you have over your cash position the more control you'll have on your product and ultimately that's what you're there for that's what you want to build so we're a subscription business we generate lifetime value of a member and so we said how do we improve our working capital and it was either to increasing the lifetime value of the member and receiving them and/or receiving the money earlier so to increase the lifetime value of the member we sell our products online but we also sell it through the iOS and Android App Store and as anyone who does this knows it sucks because you have to pay 30% to Android and Apple to do that so when I say see LTV up there I'm talking about the contribution lifetime value which is net of merchant fees and net of any cost of goods sold it's your gross margin basically so we could improve our merchant fees which would mean that we would sell it on web instead of through Apple or Android so on web we pay 2.7 percent on alpha or Android we pay 30 percent so that's a 27 point 3 percent savings like that number two is we could increase our conversion so if we increase the frequency in the rate of conversion we're increasing risk LTV and last was to actually improve the retention of our members from year one to year two year to year three etc which increases the lifetime value so that was on the CLT side then we said how do we receive the money earlier there was a couple of options there number one was to explore alternative pricing options so we're a subscription business we chart well before this we charge $10 a month for unlimited access to all of our content and that $10 a month price point we didn't really test into it we sort of you know it felt right but we realized that maybe we should be testing into it a little bit more so we explored alternative pricing options including an annual plan and we now have an annual plan that's $100 a year you pay that upfront and we change the price of our monthly to $15 a month so well we realize that it's more valuable for us to receive $100 upfront than $15 over 12 or $180 over 12 months broken down $15 increments because of net present value because of cash flows because of working capital so depending on how your business's work depending on your pricing schemes there may be a meaningful discount which is worth it to get the money upfront that was the case for us the other option for us was financing structures so for those of you who receive money through iOS and Android you typically receive it 45 or 60 days later so we tried to see can we finance those receivables to receive the cash sooner so what we realize is this the summary of all this is that we needed to sell annual subscriptions on the web so how do we do that the first thing that we did is we built out a robust engineering team dedicated to the web product the second thing we did is we said why don't we actually make the web product our primary focus from a traffic perspective so any ads any marketing any partnerships that we did instead of sending people to the app store let's send them to the web where again we pay a significantly lower merchant fee the third thing we did is we said why don't we make the web our website a place that people actually want to come for great experiences for great content as opposed to just making it you know a page where we're just trying to convert people as much as possible why don't we actually make it a really exciting place to be despite that we also said let's continue testing the share out of it to make it a really great sales page so we did a lot of a/b testing a lot of iterations on pricing fortunately the result of all of this work is that we went from burning 2.4 million dollars in a single month to actually be in cashflow positive seven months later and this to be quick okay I just realized that Jeff is totally wrong we're not throwing out money that's not the message I'm trying to show here we're supposed to reverse it's supposed to come in where we were started receiving money it was positive by the end of that he looked cool doing it okay you can do this if you focus on the working capital situation in the business and it took a lot of work from our team to do it but it completely changed the control that we had on the business it can we control it now we control our cash position which means we control the product and the perspective that we have I hope this is helpful for you guys for those of you who are founders or entrepreneurs I know the cash tough cash balance management is really challenging so I hope this is helpful feel free to find me on LinkedIn or my Twitter handle which is right there thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

Justin is the Founder of numerous startups including Twitch and now heading up Atrium- a tech-enabled law firm building technology to revolutionize the legal industry. Listen to his take on how to integrate customer acquisition.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
it's me Justin here to tell you teach you something I'm gonna teach you one thing at least and we'll see what that is all right cool so uh that was you know you've probably I won't belabor you on on background I started a lot of companies the one that worked was twitch also invested in a lot of companies kind of seen all sorts of every side of the market and that really informed this new business that I started called atrium so I came here I want to tell you about atrium and I want to tell you about some of the growth hacks that I used to get us going because it's been about exactly a year now in June we celebrated atriums first birthday June 12th I think so you can wish me a happy birthday alright so why did I start atrium well at first I was very brain damaged from twitch and when you start a consumer startup as many of you probably will find out people don't really want to pay you they don't want to pay you very much but so when I was thinking about what should I do next what startup should I start I really really wanted to do something where you get paid and so there was one constant in our entire Twitter journey which was we always no matter what how we were doing as a business the amount we paid our attorneys always went up and that's sadly true and so I was like that seems like a very interesting business to do at the same time I was a partner at YC I felt like I'd stopped learning I stopped leveling up and I wanted to build something into a big industry where I felt like I could continue to scale you know cuz we grouped which it was about 170 people when Amazon acquired it I want to build a big business something bigger than that and I felt like the legal market was something that would support that and then lastly I'd been an experienced client as I like to say I was in voluntary power-user of corporate legal services and so I was like well I know what people want and I feel like I can deliver it and what did they want well here the problems I faced with legal really quickly pricing seemed like playing Russian roulette when I would open those legal bills sometimes there was highly variable response time when I was working on a very important thing where you know was a like an M&A or fundraising round the quality of service was super high but often times when we wanted to do something else that wasn't as important it was you know we'd be waiting for for a long time for response the quality itself was very variable oftentimes there were mistakes because there's a lot done by hand and then there's very little transparency into the process like I didn't know what the steps were for anything I wanted to do like a fundraising round what what are the steps from getting you know legal is not the end State I wanted to get money in the bank or I want to sell my company I always wanted to do something and League was just a blocker and when there was no transparency into what was happening I was very frustrated so we decided to solve that with a couple different things strategies moving everything to fix pricing so we have a incentive to make things more efficient over time now increasing role specialization so that we can increase response response times and and I kind of right-size all the legal work were you building all this technology to do stuff behind the scenes to actually lower costs and then we starting with startups that's you guys in the room because that's what I know and sorbs you know they might start small but eventually if they become the next Airbnb or uber they end up spending you know a lot on legal and so you get the good stuff you're the kind of growth hacks when I started the company there were a couple things that I did to really kickstart the process and grow it pretty quickly so today you know atrium has done over five hundred million dollars in primary financings for clients we have over 240 clients here in Silicon Valley and around the country and you know I think we've done a pretty good job we scale from a team of four people to 80 people in in this last year so done some things okay but we're there still a lot to do you know all I see is problems and and there's a long road ahead of you one thing I should say is no matter who you are it never gets easier that's a lot of nervous laughter but that that's actually true it's a so so if you feel stressed out if you feel like you're struggling with your startup you know might be early days but you should just you know know that I'm I'm feeling the same pain somewhere in the world probably in San Francisco I'm probably banging my head against the table on something that's not scaling exactly right I thought it would be easier actually this time so that was my mistake all right on to the growth hacks so the first one was when we started off I was like will anyone hire a start-up law firm and in fact lots of people were like nobody will ever trust their sensitive you know legal work to a you know a new startup that's unproven and so what we did was we ended up hiring top talent and and trying to leverage their credibility so first thing I did was I realized you know couldn't start a tremulous who had a ton of experience and I ended up yeah because I'm not I've been the client site but I've never been on the legal service providers side so we ended up spending I spend a lot of time months and months and months talking to different partners seeing who was interested in kind of innovating in this space people who had been successful in the careers at other firms and eventually I decided to co-found atrium with my current co-founder Augie Rico who is a who was a partner at auric on the you know emerging companies BC practice and so all you had a great book of business he was known as someone who was very interested in kind of innovating but also like really founder of friendly and and like great at building you know client development and so we got along super well we end up meeting because he he actually represent my brother's company cruise automation through their sale to GM for a billion dollars the year before and so so we got to it we sat down a lot got to know each other and really put a lot of thought pre work into building this business together then after that all you know you kind of broke the dam and we were able to hire a bunch of talented attorneys from top firms here in Silicon Valley and so when we went to founders we will say hey we can offer the same levels of service that you can expect from other firms and you know I think that that was a huge piece of the puzzle because we were legitimately able to say hey if you are going to go with this this other firm you know we can do the same amount of work but we promise we're gonna fix the pricing and we're going to do it you're gonna be you know we're gonna improve our quality service we can improve up our our response time we're going to lower your cost because we have built this technology that's going to streamline the delivery service and it worked that was not obvious to me that it would work at first but it did which is really good so what was the second thing we did we decided to try to help founders with additional value outside of just the legal services so in the very beginning like literally a year ago we were sitting around we're like how are we going to get any clients and the way that what I would have it started off the whole thing by just posting on a forum for founders actually was on the internal YC forum and I said hey if you are thinking about going through a fundraising process soon for like a series a financing series be financing something like that I would love to get customer feedback from you I just want to learn about how your think about that process and do some customer development for my new company and in exchange what I'll do is I will help you on your pitch I'll give you some pitch feedback because I've you know I've raised about 80 million dollars in fundraising from venture capitalists and angel investors and seed investors so far and I think I have a lot of you know kind of firm beliefs on how you improve the narrative and your pitch narrative and I could probably help you out so let's like let's do a trade and so I did that with one of my friends actually who has this company called message bird which helps helps people send you know it's basically a chat like a SMS and phone API and sat down with him he had a great business business growing superfast or they're on track to do I think 80 million dollars in revenue that year and I sat down with him and and and he was like I can't get any traction with investors what's going wrong and so helped him out with his narrative and two weeks later he had a term sheet and it raising 460 million bucks so it wasn't quite as simple as that but you know I did really help improve his his process and so you you know then at that point when he had the term sheet I was like hey you know we have this law firm if you'd like to maybe you know you could consider using it and he was you know excitedly was like yeah sure I'd love to give you guys give give atrium a try and that's how we kicked it off so we eventually did a bunch of experiments over the summer helping people out and we decided to professionalize it we said hey we can batch process this by running a free bootcamp you know every quarter I think we send it up being every couple months and so that's what we did we called it atrium scale and we helped founders raise money and figure out how what their fundraising strategy is because it's effectively a lead-gen event for our you know our atrium services right so that's worked pretty well in fact we've had over I think 60 founders go through our bootcamp over the last six months and I think about a quarter of them ended up raising you know Series A or series B okay so growth act number three atriums Series A our own series a fund raising so when we went out to start this business we thought maybe I can jump-start it by having all of our investors or our future investors because there weren't an investor's yet maybe I can jump started by having all of them basically become our channel partners and so the way we created our round was we ended up raising money from one lead who set the terms I was General Catalyst and then we ended up basically well I guess we used our credibility and hustle to get in the room and we turned up talking to about a hundred and vesser's total and I just pitched I was like pitching non-stop like day after day and got everyone participate with us like a little amount you know a hundred thousand or to five hundred thousand it's just trying to raise like I was kind of like a small amount from everybody in Silicon Valley and the reason I wanted to do that was twofold number one I didn't want people to block us just like I was worried founders would be nervous that there was a about having a new firm I thought investors would be super nervous right because investors you know what's the point of like why I innovate here if like the founders kind of the one that's bearing the pain he should just like suck it up and maybe use easy use their you know existing firm that I've heard about right I was worried about that so I went out and I tried to pitch everyone in Silicon Valley and then the second reason that I thought that was that would be useful is that we would be able to ask them to refer us to their portfolios and and really make those investors believe that they could help us grow and they they'd have like a direct influence in helping us be more successful and so we ended up doing that and here's some of the results you know I talked about that one atrium scale has grown pretty well we've we've been able to grow that from like this large base of stars here in Silicon Valley we end up raising rent around from almost everybody in in Silicon Valley we had participation from kind of all of these different top-tier investors and they've done a great job of referring us to this you know portfolio over 240 clients who have tried atrium today and in fact you know there's 25 percent of those guys come from from from our investors all right so last up how I can help further you can email us at atrium if you need any sort of legal help an atrium scale I encourage you all to apply if you're thinking about raising venture fund fundraising in the future it's been pretty effective so far and I think there's one last thing we have a special discount for any of the founders in the room today you just look for someone in an atrium in an orange t-shirt and and go find them to claim it so that's all I've got for you today thank you very much and I'll talk to you later bye you

Pat Brown is the Co-founder of the Public Library of Science, Inventor of the DNA microarray and most recently the Founder of Impossible, famous for their Impossible meat. Impossible now supplies burgers for 2,000 restaurants a month. Pat started a company because he wanted to solve a big problem. But he had to sell that dream to investors.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
[Music] [Music] okay well thank you for being here it's actually it's actually 2,000 restaurants and more like 2 million burgers a month but so it's a little strange that I'm I'm here purporting to be a kind of business expert because I'm still a complete freshman in the business world and I think they're half the people in the audience probably could teach me more than I could teach them about how to how to function in that world and I definitely have as much learned as anyone here so ten years ago the last thing that I would imagine myself doing was founding a business and and even laughter than that was founding a food business because I had essentially no interest in business and and my only interest in food was you know just eating it when I wasn't eating it I was just not that interested in it and so I was completely unqualified for this gig and at the time I had what was really my dream job I basically had awesome colleagues I had a research lab that I loved and great students and great funding and a very secure job and I basically my job description was invent and discover things and that was literally what my job description was and it was what I would have created for myself if I had the choice so why would I give all that up to do something that I was unqualified to do and oh okay a cheesy photograph of myself that's that's kind of unnerving okay so so this here is a scenic view of Mars this is the second best planet in our solar system and it's probably the second best planet that we could travel to in our lifetimes within 50 light years of Earth okay and it sucks it it has no breathable air no liquid water it's winter all the time but there's no skiing and and dim light and nothing but rocks and boulders as far as the eye can see it's a sorry excuse for a camper for a planet but it's kind of a good negative control for this we got the good planet this is a little patch of planet or if this is this is just a patch of the Amazon actually and you won't find anything like this anywhere within 50 light-years of here we have liquid water we have air we can breathe we have mind-boggling biodiversity and beauty and we take it for granted that this is just where we live big deal but we shouldn't you know earth is 4.5 billion years old and when it was 4 billion years old we couldn't have lived on it for five minutes there was no breather but there was no oxygen in the air it was only when the first land plants appeared about 400 million years ago that the oxygen levels got at all into the range where animals could survive so this is you know this is not something we can take for granted and the lives of our children and future generations basically depend on how good a job we do of taking care of this because there's no alternative and we're doing a crappy job of it and this is why this is for all practical purposes the reason why this plant is in jeopardy which may sound surprising but it's just true so there the problem is actually it's not the problem but the driver of the problem is we love meat and since prehistoric times well in prehistoric times it was essential for survival we hunted animals to survive because basically it was a very efficient way of getting high high in nutrient density food with relatively little labour and of course but it didn't scale and today we don't need meat to survive in fact people who don't have any meat in their diets by and large are substantially healthier than people who do but we love meat and to satisfy the growing demand for meat we've built an industry that today kills 11 cows 15 sheep 17 goats 47 pigs and more than 2000 chickens every second and using that prehistoric technology animals to produce these humongous quantities of meat requires a huge fraction of Earth's natural resources and it takes a tremendous toll on the global environment and I won't drag you through through all the ways in which that's true just say that it's responsible for more greenhouse gases than every cart car bus truck train airplane rocket ship boat all transportation combined it consumes more water and pollutes more water than any other industry on earth and it currently occupies about half of every square mile of earth of land on earth that's not covered by ice or water so the the land that is devoted to raising animals for food either growing crops to feed them or grazing them is greater than the total area of North America South America Australia and Europe combined that's how much land we're using for this and that's all land that once supported biodiversity diverse plants and animals that's basically now been homogenized to a few crops and the kinds of grasses that can sustain intense grazing so this industry it's overwhelmingly responsible for habitat destruction and global deforestation for example in the Amazon it's responsible for more than 90 percent of ongoing deforestation and and you know that if you look at that image you're thinking holy that that beautiful Amazon was turned into this kind of waste line but it's not just an aesthetic issue you know we kind of take for granted as I was saying about you know how we help basically when mosses appear that's the first time animals could breathe we we depend on this diversity of plants and animals to keep this planet habitable to maintain the ecosystems that refresh our air and water and and just keep our planet and us alive and healthy and 10,000 years ago we shared this planet with with nature and all its diverse plants and animals by 1976 we had reduced the total biomass of wild animals remaining on earth by twofold and the cows alone the cows that were being raised for food outweighed every living wild animal on earth terrestrial animal on Earth by a factor of four that was 40 years ago and it's getting worse so whoops what happened there my my slides were rapidly we has it we edited in the past hour or so and just realized a slight error but anyway today 2018 the total biomass of wild animals living on earth is less than half what it was 40 years ago so in the past 40 years we've wiped out half the wild animals that were living on earth and it's for all practical purposes entirely due to the use of animals of food technology on land it's the expansion of animal farming overwhelmingly responsible for a destruction of habitat and and ecosystems and in water of course it's overfishing so it's our use of animals of food production technology that has basically reduced the number of wild animals living on earth by a factor of 2 and today the cows that are being raised for food at this moment outweigh every living land animal on Earth by more than a factor of 10 and the pigs that are being raised for food outweigh every living wild animal on land by a factor of 2 and chickens outweigh every living wild bird remaining by a factor of 3 so we've basically been pushing nature and all the creatures that we depend upon for stable ecosystems that keep this planet thriving and keep us alive practically to the edge of oblivion you know if we if we reduce wild animals by the by the amount that we did in the past 40 years there'd be zip left and and the reason is you know the demand for meat basically that the biomass that we consume annually is so great that if we decided that we were going to as people have suggested to me pretty frequently well maybe we should just hunt animals for our meat if we went to that model there would be no wild animals at all left on earth in two months so basically we'd wipe them all out not a single mouse or shrew or or squirrel left on earth in two months so that's not a solution anyway this is just to give you I'm not trying to bum you out of it's to give you an idea of of why as soon as I learned about this problem I thought I'm going to give up the best job in the world and do what I can to fix it and and that's kind of the one take-home lesson that if if there is a take-home lesson from any of this is that you know when I looked at this problem and realize what a big deal it was I looked around actually I my first instinct was okay someone's got to do something about this so it didn't seem like anyone was doing something about it so I'm gonna go around and try to convince someone to take this problem on and I went around to food conferences and stuff like that I said someone this is a huge opportunity for someone it's a huge problem and a huge opportunity someone is gonna make a bundle of money if they take on this problem and and the people there you know whatever pepsi-cola and so forth were just like come on and and that's the point that I mean I think this isn't a point to convey if you see a problem there's this sort of a natural instinct that someone else is working on it or someone else is responsible for solving it but don't assume that because they don't know that responsible for solving it and if you don't see that someone is working on it it's a reasonable bet that no one is working on it and if it's not their responsibility who is is it it's your responsibility as much as anyone elses and if you care about a big problem you know it's you can't just say well someone else should fix it it's your responsibility okay and and since it's a business conference I'll just parenthetically note that usually when there's a big problem to solve if you can figure out a solution there's money to be made so okay the problem was that that I wanted to fix was this massive scale of the the system we used to produce food from animals and what made it a real problem is that for most of the people on earth for for billions of people the food that we get from animals is really an essential part of the pleasure of living there they're not going to be willing to sacrifice something that contributes as much as as meat and fish and dairy foods do to their quality of life and even when I've gone to these environmental conferences that you know there is like lifelong environmentalists as far as the eye can see every single one of them is going out for a steak after the conference and I'm not kidding and they're not there they're wonderful people and they understand the problem and they're not being about it it's just that it's really really hard to make major changes in diet the diet that you've had all your life and you just have to accept that we are not going to solve this problem by persuading people to change their diets or making it a moral or political issue total waste of time and unfortunately I can't see anyone here but I was going to do a Q&A so if you're in the audience don't worry I can't see your face so I won't judge you do you love meat yeah all right good future customers so and and and now do you love meat in part because of the way we make it from animal cadavers is that is that part of what you value in the meat it's a serious question actually no okay do you love meat in spite of the way we make it yes okay good you're you're that's that's virtually everywhere I've gone about around the world pretty much that's including middle America that's the way people feel about it they love their meat they're never going to give up eating it but they don't love the the way that it's made just live with it and that really defines the problem in in a useful way oh and this business about 1.5 trillion dollars this is why it was possible I think for me to raise money for this project okay and this is really the way to look at the problem the problem isn't that people love meat of course they love meat it's that we're making it the wrong way and the solution is to develop a better way of making all the foods that we get from animals but not just something that's almost good enough in order to succeed we need to make foods that consumers around the world decisively prefer based on all the characteristics that that give it value to them taste nutrition affordability convenience and so forth if we can do that if we can if we can do a better job in the cow of making the best meat in the world and just put it on the market that's that's the most decisive way to solve the problem sorry and just as a quick analogy although I think this is pretty intuitive to you you know for tens of thousands of years horses were the definitive technology for for powered transportation and if you ask someone to two hundred years ago what the future of Transportation looked like they highly likely would have told you the horses will probably be faster and then the first mechanized transportation came along in 1830 this is a first commercial locomotive and it famously ran a race with a horse in 1830 and lost slightly lost to the horse but the important point here is that it never lost again because the horse never got faster and once you switch to a technology from a completely unimprovable technology like basically animal as as power or as food - one that is improvable in multiple dimensions as soon as you're running close the race is over you know you're gonna win okay so okay I'll talk fast so so this this impossible food started out as a mission and the mission basically wants to replace the world's most destructive technology by 2035 by making the most delicious nutritious affordable meats fish and dairy foods in the world and and letting the market do the rest this this became a company the mission of getting rid of this technology became a company when I realized that the solution was market based and the first step was convincing someone to invest in this as a business which I had never done before but fortunately I happen to live on the Stanford campus which was within short biking distance of half the venture capital in the world and so I could just in a less than 10 minute bike ride pop over to Khosla Ventures and knock on their door didn't really do that but walk in and and gave my pitch and it was it was a completely amateurish pitch deck and it's kind of like I'm going to show it to some people at the company at some point because it's so embarrassing in retrospect but but basically this was my this was my first slide it was about mission and the next nine slides were about the mission and why it was so important and it was not until the tenth slide that I said anything about how this could function as a business but fortunately that tenth slide basically had you know one trillion dollars on it which was that magical moment when they reach for their checkbooks and anyway when I when I launched the company I should also add what I knew for sure was that the was going to succeed I was I I knew I believed it was totally doable and I was completely determined I was not gonna let this fall short of complete success but I didn't know how we were gonna do it I just knew it was doable and it was evident from my deck that I really didn't know how I was gonna do it and I also didn't know how to run a business as it was obvious to the investors once they saw how bad a job I did of pitching to them but anyway this is another slide in my my pitch deck to just get move this on which was you know some ideas about how we might do this and and what the technology would look like and one of the ideas was at this I'm not gonna go into the science behind this you can ask he might be the magic ingredient for flavor and and I had this what I thought was a brilliant idea which is that there's this heme heme is the thing that makes your blood red and carries oxygen in your blood and it's found it but it's found in lots of high crimes and animals low quantities and plants but the one place in plants were there's a decent amount of it is in what's called the root nodules of nitrogen-fixing plants there's a protein called leg hemoglobin that has heme and and I thought I did a calculation I realized that there's enough leg hemoglobin in the root nodules of the US soybean crop to replace all the heme and all the meat in the u.s. diet and I thought holy crap this is such a great idea well we'll just once they harvest the soybeans will come come across the field and harvest the root nodules and it'll cost us almost nothing and and and it's it's genius these are these aren't root nodules you can just see kind of open they look like meat inside a small amount of pea root nodules like one ounce of pea root nodules you can get all this red juice that team okay so then the first year of the company we spent probably more than half of our startup investment pursuing this idea which involved basically making multiple trips to Texas and Minnesota disobeyin farms and amassing these giant piles of soybean roots and developing these root Goldberg contraptions to recover the root nodules and extract the leg hemoglobin from them and after actually more than a year we realized this is a ridiculous idea and what we'd spent like a million dollars discovering that and but it wasn't a waste of time for a couple of reasons first of all the only way that we could learn that this wasn't the best way to do it was to try it and realize it was a terrible way to do it it was also a great way to build a team because there's no better way to to build a team than than to be you know working on this kind of ridiculous project where you find yourself with your you know small group of colleagues at the start of the company at 4 a.m. you know mopping up the floor of some godforsaken pilot facility in South Texas it really helped us you know bond as a team but we realized that wasn't the way to do it we figured out a way to produce heme using yeast and that enabled our R&D team to establish what we'd sort of only suspected which is heme is the magic molecule that makes me taste like meat it's basically the explanation for why meat recognizably tastes like meat and unlike anything else on earth and it does it by catalyzing chemical reactions that turn these simple nutrients into flavor molecules and so forth I won't go into the science you can ask me about but but anyway and so that was just part of the science that went into you know the the job that we assigned ourselves was study meat the way I would in my previous life have studied the disease to figure out in molecular terms how it works and then once you know that to figure out how to how to make the best version of it you know using a new set of tools the R&D team which was the best group of scientists ever assembled in the food food world by far did that task and and then ok and about two years ago we we decided we knew enough to launch our first product which was raw ground beef which we chose because it's the most disruptive product we thought we could make in the US and and and again here's how I know we're going to succeed here okay so this product they were serving it in the food trucks I encourage you to try it and email us if you have any any comments on it but but here's how we how I know we're going to succeed basically the cow has been working on this for a million years and we've been working on it for about six years and at this point I would say by a lot of criteria were running even with the cow okay so this is like where mechanized transportation was in 1830 and we're getting better every day and the cow is not and this just the mission here the original motivation or a big part of it was to reduce the environmental impact of the food system and even at this early stage where we haven't really fully optimizes for sustainability producing our burger based on independent lifecycle analysis use the quarter of the water an eighth of greenhouse gas emissions and less than one twentieth the land to produce the same thing from a cow and that's going to get better so okay 30 seconds more today there are people who are actually talking about you know the need to establish a human colony on Mars so that will be ready in case we totally mess up this planet in case we make earth uninhabitable but the thing is that Mars is already uninhabitable an earth is awesome and all we need to do is to keep from turning earth into Mars and we're good and so anyway so this is the plant that I'm going to bet on and and it's this that gets me excited to go to work every day and the other reason is this I absolutely love all the people that I get to work with every day and that's it thank you [Applause]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
[Applause] you know hi everybody I love that opening song that was great well thank you for having me here I'm Kirsten Tobi co-founder of revolution foods one of the things that we that we really thought about when we first started was and and kind of what drove us to start the company was you know the fact that every kid in this country deserves to have access to high-quality healthy food no matter where they grow up no matter the zip code no matter where they come from no matter where they go to school so so my business partner Kristin seems obvious right that access to healthy food is a fundamental human right so my visit part business partner Kristen and I started 12 years ago now we met 14 years ago here right up the street at UC Berkeley and in Business School and we kind of came together around this idea that you know we could create a new model for how kids have access to to food and and kids and families really we've always kind of focused on where the greatest needs in our communities and and you know when we were looking at this when we were in business school we saw you know all of the statistics about the obesity epidemic is on the rise type 2 diabetes is impacting at this point in inner-city communities it's impacting one and two kids which is a shocking statistic and you know we have kids at this point in history slated to live a shorter life span than their parents which is the first time ever and that shouldn't happen it's all because of preventable preventable nutrition related diseases and food-related diseases so we started revolution foods to make what we call kid inspired chef crafted food accessible to all well it won't spend a ton of time talking about the sort of the origin story but because they asked me today to kind of focus on a lesson that I can teach you guys so so I do have a little a little lesson that I'll that'll kind of dig into which is one of our newest newest initiatives that we're working on and kind of how we're approaching that but we started here in Oakland actually right down the street or was our first school a charter school called lighthouse community charter school wonderful school they just graduated their first class of kids who have eaten revolution foods now for twelve years and they're now going to college which is exciting so they've it's been exciting to kind of grow with partners like that who have you know charter schools who have been growing alongside of us we've started here in Oakland but we very quickly expanded to new geographies we expanded to Southern California to Texas to New Orleans to Denver to DC to New Jersey New York and most recently Boston so we're now serving about two million meals a week and in this next school year it'll be even more than that including breakfast lunch after school meals after school supper after school snacks in the summertime we serve summer meals to kids who come to either city sponsored or or other community sponsored programs we work with Boys and Girls Clubs YMCAs and other places basically anywhere where kids are spending time we offer meals to them and we built the company with a real focus on making sure the meals are accessible so accessibility has been one of the one of the really driving factors of of how we've grown how we've how we've you know really built the whole model and accessibility to us means that kids need to be able to have our food or have access to our food and families need to have access to our food regardless of their income levels so we built the our whole platform is built around the the USDA sponsored national school lunch program school breakfast program other federally subsidized programs and about eighty percent of the kids who eat our meals each day qualify for free lunch at school so that means they're coming from families that are living at a hundred and thirty percent of the poverty line or below and that's been you know really fundamental to to how we how we've started and how we've continued to grow and how we've been very focused in terms of our mission and our vision so family fresh fish family dinners is is what I'm here to talk to you about so you might think oh revolution foods that's a school lunch company well school lunches is how we started and is you know probably three-quarters of our current business we also do breakfast as I mentioned and we are really focused on you know making sure that camel e's have access to to good nutrition and and nutrition education so one of the things that as we've grown and as we've been serving more and more communities we've had teachers and principals and parents in the schools that we work with say you know it's great that you're feeding my kid breakfast and lunch and sometimes a snack or a meal after school but I'm still struggling to get dinner on the table and dinner is a real challenge and you know as busy working parents you know many of us who are who are you know running the company are also struggling to get a healthy dinner on the table it's kind of like getting a getting a healthy dinner on the table sort of knows no boundaries in terms of socioeconomic status and and all that sort of thing so so we really so we saw dinner as a way to to both increase the impact that we are having in our communities and to solve a real problem that is that's kind of within our realm of core competency but the way that we've approached this I think is an interesting and an interesting kind of path and that's what I'm here to to kind of walk you through so one of the things we wanted to make sure to not do was to sort of pivot and say okay well now let's focus on something new and let's get a whole team and let's invest a lot of money we've really tried to to build you know kind of a small kind of innovation focused kind of skunkworks approach to to what we're doing here but to do it in a really thoughtful way and to be very clear and methodical about the about the process so the insight you know that we had was you know we have this opportunity we have these hunt you know several hundred thousand families that are reliant on our program that we have a daily touch with because we're serving their their kids in schools we have you know at this point we have several hundred refrigerated trucks on the road every day we have culinary centers where we're making and preparing and delivering fresh meal fresh meals on a daily basis we have this incredible kind of infrastructure and capacity and we said well how can we leverage that to bring a dinner solution to families so we kind of launched an innovation process and the very first thing that we did was to talk to the end-user so this is you know and when you're starting something new whether you're starting a new business whether you're starting you know a new creating a new product within your existing business talking to your consumer it's probably the most important thing that you can do and don't just do this once you gotta keep doing it you got to keep going back to them figuring out if it if what you're if what you're creating is working for them maintaining an open mind so don't go in you know we didn't go into this thinking okay we know exactly what this solution looks like and we know how we're going to deliver it and we know what it's gonna what the menu is going to be and we we really kind of let the process unfold as we worked with our consumers and we tested a lot of different things before we kind of honed in on here's what the products to look like here's what the solution needs to look like and I'll say well we're still on this journey we're not we're not kind of done and I'll kind of tell you where we are today with it but listen prototype learning and prototype again so you know try to be we when we first started this which was about a year ago we started doing the kind of consumer work and talking to talking to parents and teachers and and kids and families and we went into people's kitchens and cooked with them we looked at you know what are people eating what solutions are currently out there what's the price point that a family like a middle-income family has to spend on a dinner and I can tell you it's not the same price point that you might be targeted with your you know the postcards you're getting from milk it company is about like only twelve dollars per serving it's a lot less than that what families actually have to - who are you know families who are struggling to make ends meet have to spend on a dinner and then we built our we built our kind of innovation team and and this is a really important you know the way that we've built this team is is important because we've you know done innovation before and I think done it incorrectly but the way that we've that we've done it in this in this case is we have kind of taken people who are real experts within our business so we have a we have a team of fifteen hundred people across the country and you know many of those people are you know 99% of those people are focused on delivering on our core business and I should probably emphasize as a part of this that you know continuing to deliver on our or business and grow our core business which continues to which continues to grow we continue to add new schools and new cities that we didn't want to distract that 99% of our team in in building this innovation team but what we did is we found you know a few people within the company who who knew a lot about either our supply chain our menu development process our school partnerships our marketing channels and we brought them together and said let's make this a team of people that will kind of come into this innovation space and work on this project but while still you know doing your day job as a part of the as a part of the core business and as we kind of built the the product of the proposition we started you know realizing where we needed more dedicated people to come in and and take on specific parts of the process but but really being thoughtful about how to craft the team not kind of walling off a bunch of people in a separate room and saying you know go create something completely different but instead you know I was trying to think of what's the right metaphor a lot of entrepreneurs talk about you know you're building the plane while you fight fly it or you're building the ship while you sail it well I think the best metaphor for this is that we're we're building this train and it's and I know it's kind of old-school cuz nobody takes trains anymore but it's a but I think the metaphor works because we're building this train and as we've grown the business you know the Train continues going in the direction that we're going we're continuing to like run the core business to our goal but what we're doing now is we're building a new car that's going to be on the back of the Train and that's eventually going to you know be able to be you know we're gonna build more of those cars but you want the car to be connected to the rest of the train and you want people to be able to come and go and and to bring what works on that current train and bring it into the new car and develop it but also spend time thinking about how can we do something different so that that kind of idea of pulling a cross-functional team across you know from the existing business but having them focus on this new area is an important an important piece so being careful not to build that dedicated team too fast I think you know bringing people who are kind of industry experts from you know other places and saying okay we're going to build this new thing so go off and build it is it's going to take you in the wrong direction building on your core assets is the way to you know really kind of learn from what's going on in the current business and bring it into the new business and then as the process unfolds always being clear on what you know what you don't know and what you're testing for so we've done a lot of testing and learning over the last nine to twelve months in this in this space and we're always very careful to say okay well we just did this test we learned this this and this but there's still a lot of things that we don't know so we've tested you know is it going to work better if families can order this dinner platform ahead of time or do they want to do they want to buy it on impulse so we've tested both you know both kind of environments we've tested with a smart fridge in a school site so that it's you know parents can actually come and pick up a meal when they pick up their kids from school we've tested a smart fridge in a more of a workplace site because maybe parents want to bring a dinner dinner meal home from their workplace but always being careful to know what you're testing and what you're learning and and when you've learned it then you start then you can start to really kind of invest in and double down on that learning product development so we have as we embarked on this process we went into we talked to a lot of consumers as I mentioned we went into people's kitchens we tested a lot of different ideas and we looked at all the different I mean the milk industry right now is exploding there's so many different ideas out there but what we heard from from the consumers that we talked to is that you know as busy working parents people don't have time to be you know learning how to cook and spending 45 minutes of prep time while they're trying to you know juggle family juggle all the other competing priorities of their time and then cooking the dinner for another 45 minutes and then having a you know sink full of dirty dishes we talked to people who you know have looked at that or if you have tried the current kits and they're so tired of all the garbage and the trash that comes every time you get a box delivered to your doorstep and then we talked about like what's the price point that people need to have this to truly be accessible to the communities that we that we are serving and so we've really honed in on a product that is that meets all of those that kind of addresses all of those different needs it's a it's it's in a recyclable pan we deliver it into a refrigerator at a central point of distribution whether that's at a school whether that's in a corporate you know office location whether that's in a community center so you're picking it up out of a refrigerator you're not getting it delivered with a bunch of you know insulation and ice packs and then it's a and because of those things and because we're building on our existing infrastructure and we already have this infrastructure in place of food production and delivery we're able to deliver it at a price point that really works for the families that we are that we are serving and we've stayed very focused on making sure that that price point stays accessible so you know really understanding who your consumer is when you're developing the product is incredibly important spending time with them I mean even though I am a mom I've got you know three kids my husband and I try to figure out how we're gonna make dinner every day that doesn't mean that we understand every consumer that we're trying to work with so actually going out and spending time in people's kitchens testing out different different kind of iterations of our product is was incredibly enlightening to our entire team as we as we went through this really understanding you know we I think we had a very good understanding of how we were going to get the meals to these points of distribution we hold it kind of that last mile we have you know trucks that are already going into communities and into school sites but how do we actually get people to walk that last 10 feet to go and get the meal so we spent a lot of time we're we're still spending a lot of time really testing different ways to get people to actually you know go to those those last 10 feet to pick up the meal and then the feedback and learning loop is ongoing so every we've even though we feel like we've got the product honed we've got you know this incredible kind of menu of items where you get a you get your kind of dinner kit everything's already chopped for you everything is marinated the sauces are made everything goes it goes into these recyclable pans that you just put into your oven everything cooks at 425 for 30 minutes it's very easy we've taken a lot of that thinking and a lot of that work out of it but you're still putting raw food into the oven and coming out with a fresh freshly cooked meal you're not microwaving something or just you know reheating something so some we've kind of developed that product to a certain extent and we're getting great incredible feedback on it but we're all we're still continuously learning so somebody might say oh what the green beans didn't cook all the way at the time that you said so we went back and we tested the green bean cooking time again and we changed the directions and you know if we've made sure to keep the business very this this kind of innovation group incredibly nimble we're not over investing in packaging or not over investing and you know in a lot of things that are gonna be hard to kind of turn around if we need to pivot and do something differently or you need to make a tweak or a change so keeping that feedback and learning loop ongoing even as we're kind of even as we think certain things are honed and complete you know we're really continuing to to be very nimble and an agile kind of as we're developing so the future I think where we're gonna take this is still to be determined where our core business as I said is still growing we're we're gonna be serving you know even more schools and community sites next year but now we're gonna have this this other layer of what we can offer to our schools and community sites so we're not just going to be able to bring healthy breakfast and lunch and after school meals to students but we're gonna have this offering for families that will be you know available through the the schools that we serve we're starting here still you know as I said we're still kind of in the learning loop and worse we're just doing this right now in the Bay Area we haven't expanded this out to the out to the you know other parts of the country that we're working in but as soon as we have some of those some of those key questions kind of answered we'll be rolling it out to other parts of the country and I think there's you know we're still continuing to kind of build and learn the platform and the program as we go but I think just for some key takeaways and and where you can learn from this and maybe as you're if you're starting a business or you're you know trying to trying to pivot your current business into a different direction I'll try to offer a couple of takeaways so one is this there's this tension between you want to isolate the new and isolate the innovation so that it doesn't distract from that 99% of the rest of your business you want to make sure that you've got you know a solid kind of team and resources dedicated to the the core business so you want to isolate it but at the same time you want to you want to kind of not separate it so much that it that you start kind of moving away from where your core competencies are and that's that analogy of the train you know if you're if you're building if you're building a train and that's your business and you're trying to build an airplane on the side that's gonna be totally different from what your what your core business is so you know if we were as we're as we were looking at this we said well we already have fresh food production we already have refrigerated trucks on the road we have this very unique access to this channel of you know schools and community centers and and and everything we do comes back to are we leveraging those core assets are we leveraging those core assets or are we looking at building a whole different a whole different kind of company and when we keep coming back to you know leverage the core assets make sure this is something that we know how to do and we're just kind of tweaking it around the around the edges so it's that tension between isolating your innovation and keeping keeping of you know keeping it from being distracting but truly leveraging what your what your core is and what your what you're truly good at and at the end of the day I think I can't stress this enough especially in a food company but product excellence has to be the number one focus of every single effort every single day and you know if if somebody has a bad experience with a meal or a food item it's really hard to get them back and I think this is probably the case with just about any with just about any product so no matter if you're on day one of your business or day you know ten thousand and sixty four making sure you're starting and finishing your day focused on your product on the quality of your product and how your product is is kind of meeting your end users needs is the most important place you can spend your time thank you [Applause]

Henrik is the Co-Founder of BARK, the company that's creating the world's best stuff for dogs. Henrik has been in the startup scene since 2005 as an investor, founder and advisor. Entrepreneurs often get distracted by interesting ideas that aren‚Äôt core to their business. BARK has figured out how to explore those ideas profitably.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
I normally really don't tell the story about how we started the company because it's kind of awkward but it has a point to to the things I want to talk about today so so here goes I met my co-founder the first time as I walked up in a hot che bed on a cruise ship in my boxers and so the PR folks don't enjoy too much when I tell that story and I kind of had to take their hand over the duvet and said hi my name is Henrik we were at a conference and is vv or a little bit of the cheap hustler then you could pick a ticket where you were basically randomly paired up with somebody else and I had picked that ticket and so had my co-founder Matt and and so he went to bed early before he kind of came to the room I thought they pushed the bets a pot but I thought it'd be hilarious to put the best back together so so he went to bed early I went to bed late and so the first time we ever met was in this very romantic setting the reason why I want to tell the story is because that I think it's really changed the way that we built bark we never really thought it would be a very big business I really wanted to work with Matt and my other co-founder collie and we had these dogs that we really loved and we didn't think there was any cool thing there but we thought you know how big is is the this how big can that market be probably not too big and so we kind of just did it for our own dogs it turned out that we stumbled into an industry that hadn't seen a lot of innovation for a very long time there is a ton of dogs in the u.s. roughly 48 percent of households have a dogs and it's an industry that really haven't seen a lot of innovation so in the last few years you've seen some very big transactions coming out of that space she would being bored Blue Buffalo being bored and what-have-you and so we walked into this industry where there was a few time makes that have changed it was very big it hasn't they hadn't seen a lot of innovation and and then you know like we we felt that we could do something there what also have changed was that people had really changed their relationship to dogs dogs are no longer just a pet that lies out in the in the garden it's really a pet that is part of our family and so maybe I can just like get a raise of hands who have a dog or used to grow up with a dog and and any cat people if you could leave the room please sneaky cat people so the relationship we have with dogs have really changed you know they now live in our bedrooms a third of all dog owners lie in an uncomfortable position to make sure the dog is having a good time my Labrador kind of like lies on the bed it's kind of like spreads all over and 83% of them kind of a-c-c their dog that's their best friends as I certainly do and so that was really like how our business grew up over the last five to six years I have a little video that I think gives a good expression impression of what we are doing beside the box I'd like to play for you dogs wagons flute and beg and tootin tug and doof and fetch and stretch and snack and scratch and lick and dig and sniff and snug and smooch and huggin dogs do they make life better every person thinks they have the best dog in the world and we agree with all of them we're barb the company dedicated to making dogs as happy as they make us and dogs make us really happy Park was started by these guys because of these guys love those guys in 2012 they created Barlow's you're hoping the barkbox for the help me the first subscription service meet just four dogs barking five years and 60 million products later making way more than the box mark helps pop parents make good healthy decisions for their dogs because everything we ship out must first be play tested and approved by upper management bark makes the most original cutting-edge state of the fart dog stuff imaginable and the most thoughtful trustworthy lip-smacking dog snacks on earth look we're just a bunch of crazy dog people and like you we know that dogs are way more than pets their family and they deserve the best the best toys the best treats the best life we can give them at bark we want to be the people our dogs think we are so we're gonna keep our eyes on the ball and follow our dogs lead by always remembering what they've taught us be good make time for play and for dogs sake treat yourself thank you so here's to the serious part of the conversation because that we never thought it was a would be a big thing we kind of build in an assumption every time we do something new that it won't work and I think that's very much different than a lot of the other startups that I've been part of in the past where you kind of sold this big dream to a lot of different people and therefore it kind of has to work but if you take a little bit like an academic approach what really happened there so you have a coal fesus and then you go out in the market and you try to see if that thesis is actually valid or not and so that's very much the approach that we have and so what I brought today was a few examples of the ways of how we try to kind of assume that we will fail but that also allow us to create a lot of new products very quickly and not be too sentimental about them if they work or not and so we have a very good way of I feel taking kind of extreme care activities and a very data based approach and then really merge those two together that gives us the opportunity to become more creative because that we are very kind of ruthless about things that don't work and then we move on for that and so the most depressing stat I could find was basically this one we're gonna fail whatever we do the stats are pretty a pretty bad if you beat like a book like obviously blanking on the books name right now Thinking Fast and Slow they make a very good case I think about how most projects will kind of like have a rabid regression to the mean and so we shouldn't have too much bias to think that we can change that what we can do is that we can reduce the cost of trying so that really the opportunity and the investment is not as high and that's like a principle that we very much taking to heart and so we really try to have this mantra of trying to reduce the pain of feeling and then really trying a lot of different things by we choose the try at the cost of trying I brought a few examples basically how we built the the Box first I'll tell you a little bit about the first few days of that I have two new products that we haven't really announced a lot of the projects that we built we you don't go out and make PR around them we test them with data before we think they're kind of ready but these two is kind of ready so I thought it'd be fun for you guys to see them and so I'll go through a different then this is the first side it was called doggy back I'm from Denmark and my English is not that well and so I thought it'd be funny to call it doggy baggie and my co-founder telling me that you can totally not say that in the US and so it became barkbox instead this was the first version that I had had mate it was basically a wordpress template that I'd hacked together and so the way that we got about making the the starting the business was that I made this template showed it to a few people and most of the time when I was showing it to people they were saying hey that sounds super cool please sign me up when you're ready now I also had Square on my phone so I was like you can just give me your credit card and I'll be good to take your money right now so the first 67 accounts or something like that was was really just signed up on on met cause and my phones we didn't I didn't really have the technical skill to understand how to implement a payment system so this was basically my own little mock-up ball Simek mock-up went to you know vendor designer comm and got it to make it look pretty and and then put it on a wordpress template so we could show it around on our phones this next kind of like I think interesting thing about scaling and and preparing to fail was that everybody then was asking me the question when I had when we had started then actually taking money from people's like how you gonna scale packing the boxes and and I said well I'm gonna pack them myself and most people say well that won't scale at all and I kind of was I understand that might be a problem but right now I have 68 accounts and it's relatively easy and all the way up to the first two thousand accounts we would have these patent Patties this is my dear wife on the Left that I'm bribing with red wine on date night and so we would basically invite our friends on on the last Thursday and every month to come and drink wine and eat cheese and then there'll be that little surprise that they also had to pack a few boxes funny anecdote I don't spill very well either so I wrote happy holidays with two L's in two thousand boxes and my co-founders thought I was an idiot but I think it kind of like mixed a point we didn't assume that this would be a very big thing we didn't try to think about how to get a 3pl which is a big packet logistics center that we now need that we'll be shipping you know hundreds of thousands and millions of boxes and I think this idea of really saying well let's just go out and test some of these things this is a good and valuable exercise we check that into kind of like even and micro level these are our poop acts that are coming out the summer and so we thought it would be fun to make kind of like poo Buganda which is basic like these statements where you can put the hand in the poop bag and then you can make a statement before you're picking up now I don't know which one of those that most funny and and so we will often sit in meetings and have this very kind of like conversation about what is fun and not what it's not fun and what we tend to do is that we say well let's just try to test it a little bit let's assume that we don't have the answer and let's assume that nobody will actually like any of it and so what you can see in the top is a little ad campaign that we've been running just on the mock-ups for all these different products and so these different I think these are some of the kind of like rap kind of inspired stuff or maybe these of the poop again anyway these are some of the the different it's only actually I remember the first one we we were doing we're doing this localized and so for example the top one that's called rent that was a statement about like the rent is too high in in New York and so probably the same in San Francisco I hear and so that is the one that was performing the well and it goes back to this kind of like general principle of like let's not assume that what we are doing it's working let's find a way of making sure that we can test it as quickly as we can the final thing I wanted to show you is this idea of chompers Club Chomper Club is another product that we haven't known yet and I'll give you a little bit of the background around around that a lot of you have dogs know that you should be brushing the teeth of your dog every day but we don't really do that and so we wanted to try to come up with a new way that we can create dental hygiene for dogs but in a fun way and so we came up with this idea of basically creating toys that had this basic toothpaste and science so when the dogs are playing with the toys then they can do that now we're obviously a bigger company now we're 400 people and so even if we feel that we are still a startup you start to get like the dynamics of a bigger company built into the DNA of the organization and so you will have like our marketing team getting very nervous about how when we launch something new we can protect our brand you'll have the tech team that's very nervous about how this will work into their roadmaps and stuff like that and so we take a very deliberate approach of launching everything as they're independent units and so each of these new things that we're launching they are basically startups within our startups and we hire new full-stack teams to basically launch them and we do that because we think there's a very decent chance as these things will fail and so we have a lot of those conversations internally and to be honest often like it creates a little bit of kind of like a bad dynamics because people get a little bit frustrated that we take one part of a business and turn it into new things but we feel really in today's age where the half lifetimes of products and marketing campaigns are getting so short you're really key competitive advantages is to be able to launch something very quickly and take decision very quickly and empower teams to really move as as quickly as they can and so we do that other thing this is as mentioned cold chompers Club it's a new product we have coming out if you search for it online you'll find it and we've had it up and running for two or three months you'll notice that there's no bog branding on it at all inside and that is really because that that team is a completely separate team that we're running independently and first when we think that we have the product completely right that we have the cocktail TV in the in the position that we really want then we integrate it back into the family of brands and and then we we kind of like push the pedal to the metal on that but let me show you a little bit of the product puppy breath ah dog breath offensive dog breath stinks and that's just the beginning here at bark we hear from millions of dogs and their motto every time a painter they have a lot in common a love of snacks a hatred of squirrels and dental problems serious dental problems these dental problems can be prevented by brushing your dog's teeth daily but you're not doing that no one is over 90% of dogs get severe oral disease in their lifetimes gross dog breath is often a sign of deeper problems tooth decay gum disease serious infection safely treating your dog's dental health problems can easily cost $1,000 per year let's clean it up introducing chompers Club we're making it easy to keep your dog's teeth in tip-top shape wrestle with a toothbrush bribe with treats no you don't need to work that hard anymore with chompers Club canine oral hygiene is just another flavor of fun here's how it works we've developed a convenient subscription with an innovative new toothpaste for dogs its enzymatic translation it's loaded with tons of special tummy safe enzymes that break down the bacteria in your dog's mouth that cause tooth decay and oral disease it's also delicious we designed special dog toys engineered to scrub your dog's teeth while they play you apply the enzymatic toothpaste to the toy and give it a toss while your dog is busy chewing our toothpaste is busily eating away at the tartar and plaque on their teeth that's it you're done when you join chompers Club we send you everything you need as often as you need give your favorite Chomper healthy teeth chompers Club [Music] so a lot of these things that now we make them as human great I have actually brushed my teeth in this it is different to have a bacon flavor toothpaste than what you normally used to it is pretty delicious but the the most probably right now is the chicken so so that's the one we're sending out and so I think really for me yeah this is the site and as you can see there's none of the branding in there and it's definitely one of the things that's created some conflicts but we very much believe that the way that we've been able to continuously build your products get them out of the market is to have this a little bit kind of non-conventional methodology and how we do it and assume that we're gonna fail before that we have these fail a few times because before we come see me succeed and so basically the Cole kind of like messes you have the three of what three of them the three kind of stories was I built this company together with two friends and we kind of assumed because you know we didn't know better that it might not work at least I really adore my co-founders and so every day that's a little bit hot it's really enjoyable because I can think back of lying on hardship but no because that I can enjoy how cool they are I think really taking data-driven design and find a way of minimizing the cost of putting new products out there is something that's worked very well for us and then I think you need to increasingly see yourself as being a system of creative systems thinker when it comes to launching new things because that products lifetime are getting shorter and because new channels and how you grow is becoming easier and easier to copy and so we see our business very much as somebody who really loved dogs and then really created like a very cool platform for building a lot of things that make dogs happy I hope you enjoyed the presentation

I'm so excited to be here I gotta tell you I've been getting asked the same question over and over again recently how did you make your first dollar at the penny order well it was in a way that was a little bit unexpected in fact I don't know that I've ever admitted this certainly not in front of 2,000 people but the way I made my first dollar was through mystery shopping here's how it worked companies like gas stations and restaurants would hire me to go to their store pose undercover and then pretend to be a customer and see how clean the store was how nice the associates were and then I go home and I'd write a report about it and then I would get paid anywhere from ten to thirty dollars but when I was done I wrote another report on this site here this is one of the original versions of the penny hoarder and I would write about how much money I made I'm actually really embarrassed to show this to you not because it looks awful but I'm remembering now that that logo I think came from the Microsoft clip art gallery and I think they're the sponsor please don't sue me I know it sounds gonna get mckee but mystery shopping was a big part of the penny hoarder and I wasn't just a mystery shopper but I was a beer Auditor I got paid to pass flyers around neighborhoods for a penny apiece I stood on the side of the road with signs and waved them for $8 an hour I was doing anything I could and that's because I was in a lot of debt like a lot of debt like $50,000 in debt at the ripe age of 23 and much of it was student loan debt but I hadn't been to class in years and I certainly didn't have a degree to show for it I found that debt to be so very shameful I would often hide my phone when I was around friends and family because I didn't want them to see the collectors calling all day long when things got really bad I would sneak into a hotel to steal free banana from a continental breakfast it was a dark time and because I was so embarrassed about I did the only thing I could think of which was to start writing about it first on a free blogspot account I would share how much debt I have what I was doing to pay it off and through three years of mystery shopping and penny hoarding and beer auditing I paid that debt off and along the way something kind of special happened on the blog I started to hear from readers who would say thanks for sharing your story they would cheer me on they would share their own story about paying off debt and I realized I wasn't the only one feeling all that shame when it came to our debt in the last couple of years the pending order is now scaled into a personal finance brand that reaches millions of people I'm proud to say that in the last couple of years Inc 500 is ranked as the growing private media company two years in a row and in the last couple of months we opened a new headquarters in st. Petersburg and I hired my hundred employee it's been a crazy crazy ride and I know that sounds like a lot of easy success but what I want to talk to you today about is all the challenges and difficulties that came along the way I want to be honest with you I was terrified to hire my first employee absolutely terrified I was 28 a complete introvert I still am so introverted that I refuse to go to social gatherings in a car pool because I want to make sure I can sneak out the back and so the idea of working with people every day and having to put clothes on and not work in my pajamas who was absolutely terrifying and for a long time I thought I was the only one but I've met enough entrepreneurs now to know that there are many introverts who here prefers to work at home in their pajamas by themselves okay okay there's a few of us I was absolutely terrified to hire that first person and so I did what any stalling procrastinating entrepreneur would do I put an ad on Craigslist because who wouldn't work for a college dropout who wrote about couponing and mystery shopping that's an app you'd answer right in fact I was so embarrassed that I didn't want to tell people they'd be working out of my house so I had them meet me at coffee shops and in the meantime I found another way to grow the company for years I had been working with freelancers and one of those freelancers owned a Content agency and I convinced her to sell me the company and move her for folks to st. Petersburg I know what you're thinking that sounds even more scary acquiring a company but for me it was less scary because these are folks I knew I trusted them and more importantly I knew I would enjoy working with them every day we eventually did hire and when I think back to some of those early hires there's a few things oops there's a few things that we all had in common one those early employees they all have they all were all willing to teach me and it can be extremely difficult to admit this as an entrepreneur but I knew absolutely nothing still don't and these folks were willing to come in and teach me everything that they knew and be very humble about it the second thing that I that those early employees all had in common was they were all willing to adapt and change very quickly one of my Craigslist's employees as I call her was came on board is our bookkeeper but within a few weeks I asked her to take on benefits and then a few weeks later she became our HR rep and then she became our office manager and our receptionist and on more than one occasion I asked her to play my personal assistant she took on a lot of roles and I think she's probably had about ten titles in the last three years but that's what you need with those early employees because the company you're building today is most certainly not the company you're going to have tomorrow people who can adapt and change with you the last thing that those early employees all had was that they were early believers nobody believed that the penny hoarder could be a thing I remember telling my parents so I'm gonna quit my job and I'm gonna work on a blog called the penny hoarder I think my mom would have preferred it if I said I was gonna deal drugs that's how bad that that came across but these people believe they quit they quit their real jobs and came and answered my Craigslist ad met me at a coffee shop they were crazy enough to do all of those things and that's important because those believers are the people who are gonna convince the next group of people to come join your company and they're definitely the people who are gonna get you through the hard times and believe me there have been some hard times around the end of 2015 we had about 20 employees and this is probably the toughest time I had at the company I was playing a lot of roles one of my Jobs was to write the email newsletter every day I was just focused on getting the product out the door we moved into a new office but nothing went as planned there were termites servers went down one of our big advertisers left us Johnny hated Sally Sally definitely hated Johnny yellow yelled at him in the middle of the workroom everything went wrong and I was working all the time I was hustling and I would go home after working 18 hours and I would pour myself a glass of wine have a quick cry just sleep for a couple of hours and then come back and do it all over again it's hard I think back to that time now though and so many of the decisions we make made back then are why we have a culture of transparency today I certainly wasn't telling my employees every fear I had can you imagine I just finished crying but I'm ready for our meeting now don't worry but I was open with them about how little I knew and I'm terrified I was to run a company I didn't have all the answers and ironically I come to find out that they didn't expect me to have all the answers what they wanted was a vision they wanted to know where we were going but they were willing to help me figure out how we were gonna get there they also wanted to know that I cared and of course I deeply cared one of the ways that I try to show that I care is through our benefits from the very beginning we've given our employees unlimited sick time paid parental leave we've paid a hundred percent of premiums for health insurance for both them and their families all right and that's something I want you to take away is that if you can hire great believers big believers you believe in what you're doing and then treat them really well they will help you figure out all the things in between yeah absolutely and they have helped me figure out quite a bit as you hear me talk about my employees I think you can tell I think about them like family and so one of the hardest moments I've had as a CEO is having to say goodbye to one of them it's something every entrepreneur goes through at some point and we we talk a lot about how important retention rates are at startups and they are important finding good people and holding on to them is absolutely important but it's also important to say goodbye when it's no longer working and this is a lesson that took me a little too long to learn so I want to encourage you to learn it now because what I've come to find out is that when you do finally make that decision it's better for the company it's better for the team and in almost every case it's better for the person as well if you're just shouldn't know more about this I highly recommend radical candor by Kim Scott has helped me on numerous occasions get through those difficult periods I'll fast forward to 2017 we now have 80 employees and we're humming like we're humming along we've built processes we've got a plan for onboarding new employees we've got a plan for off-boarding we've got a plan for how to get you on slack and how to make sure you're ready to go on day one we've got a plan to make sure our Sprint's run on time and we have hired a ton of people and we're making a lot of money but of course it's not that easy and of course right around 80 employees it started to feel heavy like things started to take a long time when we were small the five of us could sit around my kitchen table and all make a decision together remember we had a little bit bigger 30 40 50 employees us three executives could make decisions just by slacking each other but at 80 people there was thousands of decisions to be made content was taking too long to get on the site we were pursuing IT projects that had no plan of bringing us money or engagement in the long run and so we blew it up we said what got us here is not gonna get us to the next place we formed an employee led committee and they went through every tool we were using which was over 50 third-party tools and came to decisions about which ones would make sense for us to scale to tomorrow we've reorganized the company people change managers in a way that allowed decisions to get made at the department level we formed a steering committee so that it wasn't me deciding what IT projects were gonna go forward but the staff and we started over or at least that's how it felt and I gotta tell ya starting over is is not easy in fact it was pretty darn stressful people wondered well I still have a job who will I report to what will I do all day will this company survive but it's in that moment that those early believers those people who were really good at adapting and changing started to rear their head and say we can get through this we can do it we've done it before and that's gonna happen we know the systems that we're building now for a hundred employees will probably have to start over again at 200 and again at 500 and again at a thousand employees so what I want you to take away today is to know that it's okay it's a change course it's okay to start over again that's part of it I've also found in the last couple of years that I've had to change myself as well in fact the job I have is nothing like the job I had three years ago as I mentioned my job was to get the email newsletter out the door and you get three Twitter posts up that day and the second year I had to think about things like infrastructure how would I attract and retain employees how would I where would that where would we all work what would our office look like and the third year I got to figure out how to run a company through a hurricane that's something they don't tell you in the handbook it's a joy of a being of Florida CEO and now in the fourth year my job is a little bit more about thinking about long term strategy and developing leaders so that we have a company that can be around 20 30 40 years from now I have to change myself and that's terrifying most days I'm doing something I've never done before this week I got to meet with TV agents in LA I got to review drone footage from one of our photographers I've got to become an expert in trademark law that one wasn't so fun I dealt with a fire code violation at work I never know what the week might bring it's also the most terrifying part worried about whether I'll be able to keep up my own growth with the growth of the company will I be able to meet the company's needs and so I think about you know when that voice comes in the back your head the one that says you can't do this you're not a real CEO don't let them find out you don't know what you're doing when that voice comes up and it comes up all the time no matter how far or how many accomplishments we have I try to think back on the last three years about what we have gotten through the servers being down the Hurricanes being down finding good people paying them really well and sometimes having to let them go I think about all those things that we've already accomplished being able to create all those processes and then say no none of those work again and that's what I lean but lean on in those tough moments being a CEO is probably one of the toughest jobs that you can take on but it's also probably one of the most fun jobs you can take and if it ever gets to be too much and it will I want you to think about something that has worked for me go home put on a pair of pants you don't one with the drawstring something real comfy pour yourself a glass of wine have a cry if you need it no judgment please some mariokart some RuPaul take a deep breath RuPaul gets me through a lot take a deep breath and then you come in tomorrow you believe in yourself you believe in your team and you hustle your ass off because this is the thing that got you here and it is the thing that is going to get you to where you're going thank you so much hustle con [Applause]

[Applause] [Music] [Music] my name's James I started a Coffee Roasting Company in 2002 I was thinking while I was back in the green room dead in 2002 what percentage of the audience in 2002 was waiting for their mom to pick them up at soccer practice is that 80% maybe anyway I was a grown up in 2002 I didn't have a great inspired idea what to call my company so there was an interesting and maybe apocryphal a side note in the history of European coffee there's a heroic and romantic story of the founding of central Europe's first coffee house in 1683 so I always a sucker for the heroic and the romantic I named my company after der blaue and flashin but in English hello peanut my three year old just blew me a kiss sorry where was I so I called it the Blue Bottle um that that's the logo up there so a little bit about me on paper my qualifications or I think are particularly maybe spectacularly or supremely unsuitable for a career in retail entrepreneurship I have a bachelor's degree in philosophy and a master's degree in clarinet performance thank you very much and in in my script I have after that I have pause for snickering so I'm glad I'm glad I wrote that I didn't just go right into it so which means I don't have the usual things that which usually cause somebody to be up here talking to you I don't have a degree in engineering or MBA I didn't work for a VC or a place like McKinsey where they know everything or basically any prior knowledge of the world of Commerce what I had was a reflexive desire for something that I could understand a model of Commerce that even I could understand and so I had to create a very simple business fortunately I was a farmers market shopper and that was a model of commerce that I could understand it's quite simple if you haven't been to a farmers market what you do is there's like people that have stuff that they've made and you give the money for that stuff they give you the thing that they've made and then you repeat it the next week and even I could understand that so in 2002 I had two credit cards the limits were not very high and I had around twenty thousand dollars in savings which seemed like all the money in the world and I signed a lease in in your materials that says 86 square feet it was actually a 186 square feet so I signed a lease in a very small Coffee Roasting space about that big I bought a used roaster for $5,000 and and then went to work in farmers markets and now after successful rounds of funding led by the likes of true ventures Index Ventures Google Ventures fidelity we have Blue Bottle has 60 or so not quite 60 cafes in the US and Japan and last October there we sold a controlling interest in Blue Bottle to the largest food company in the world which is Nestle so I wasn't sure what kind of reaction I was going to get actually after that I have any anyway I I won't tell you what my notes were in the script after that so I came to coffee as a hobbyist I used to roast coffee very crudely in a perforator baking sheet and my oven my home oven and it would fill the apartment with smoke but you know but but it was very interesting at those times in the late nineties there's literally no place I could go in San Francisco to get a bag of coffee with a roast date stamped on it and this idea that of coffee freshness was something I thought was blindingly obvious and simultaneously widely overlooked so this idea that let's see if I hit the right button Oh Marcel Proust that's when I started that's the idea that was basically the premise of Blue Bottle coffee company coffee is fresh fruit after roasting coffees flavors develop they mature they get to this peak of freshness and then begins the inevitable decline that's depressing and familiar but in the late 90s you know as I said I couldn't find anybody who were talking about this this idea of coffee being a fresh food so and this was also at the time before the internet was taking the joy out of these personal discoveries so I thought this idea belonged to me and to me alone so this idea that coffee is a fresh food is is basically the premise the the foundational idea the business plan you could say of bluebottle and so how did this inform the decision subsequently that I took to make Blue Bottle coffee a bigger thing so having the idea of coffee being fresh food led me to be very protective of this thing this this thing called coffee it seemed very simple I wanted to know that coffee was this evanescent fragile delicious and special thing that didn't need heavy roasting it didn't need flavors so when we opened our first kiosk in Hayes Valley in 2005 on Linden Street I didn't realize that the protective gestures I made around this product were very unusual for that time I was just doing what I thought I had to do so no snow sizes no flavors every drink ground and prepared to order every milk drink steamed to order I was interested in a very pure experience of coffee as pure as I could get and at the time the number oh there's farmers market at the time the number of cafes that were doing that in California was exactly zero so once that became so also with the kiosk architectural II I could only afford this little space in a garage so it's like having that simplification imposed on me it I was able to avoid the tropes of cafe design at that time so comfy couches messy couches bulletin boards like all kind of the the messy tropes of cafe design in the late 90s I didn't have the money to do it so it let me be very simple and people really responded except for one thing there's a notion of being protective of the product led to some unfortunate experiences for our guests who weren't in as invested in coffee as we were so being protective led to some bad experiences unfortunately this isn't from one of our cafes this is widely shared on the internet a list of rules that people were asked to guests we're actually asked to observe at a cafe in Memphis I think so fortunately in 2008 Gramercy Tavern asked us to provide coffee for the restaurant Gramercy Tavern is a kind of at the pinnacle of New York City dining and it was known for its deeply entrenched culture of graciousness I spent about a week there and the realization came to me that our product wasn't coffee exactly our product was the way a guest felt while they were drinking our coffee in our cafes that was a product and once that became clear to me it freed me to really delve into the mechanics of pleasure as it relates to coffee and that's when Blue Bottle fortunately was starting to grow quite a bit at that time we were adding cafes and I was hiring a lot of employees so I needed a way to encapsulate this idea of coffee being an experience this pleasure being an experience not just this absolute notion of what's in the cup so around that time I was asked to come up with a mission statement and that I failed at I wasn't able to provide a mission statement and as I was walking to the meeting to apologize for not producing this mission statement I realized that I didn't need a mission statement I needed three words three words that encapsulated what I wanted to do and that was deliciousness hospitality and sustainability so those three words kind of ran Blue Bottle for the next ten or twelve years and because of the purity of those three words the simplicity any time we told an employee those three words they would remember it right off the bat today we didn't need a lot of materials and it was a way of having a conversation with the people we were working with so we could prioritize this experience based on on those three things and every new cafe was then an opportunity to see how much could be stripped away to showcase those three words I realized that the more unnecessary distractions could be stripped away what remained would be more memorable so for the last ten years or so the purpose of our approach to cafe design was a subtractive one to remove obstacles from a primary to experience that we needed our guests to have and that primary experience was this and that's only that a delicious coffee served by a hospitable coffee professional and we could train for that we could strip away everything so that was the only thing that remained or we could try everything else was a distraction so we built cafes for a few years raised some money built some more cafes and then I was worried about one part of our business which was starting to seem like a distraction one of the dirty little secrets of the specialty coffee industry is that the vast majority of roaster retailers revenue is in wholesale coffee and wholesale coffee means when you sell beans not to a guest in a cafe that you own and operate but you sell beans to a restaurant or cafe operator and have them make the drinks for your guests you can't you can't have the same amount of control so around a few years ago I was walking past a cafe and across the street was a wholesale a wholesale account of that that roaster retailer and they said proudly serving as wholesale accounts do and then they mentioned the roaster retailers name and everything was fine it looked fine except they'd misspelled the roaster retailers name and I realized that was the essential problem of the wholesale coffee business is that you can't force somebody to care and if they weren't willing to care it showed in the cup and we got the blame so a few years ago we made the very difficult decision to walk away from 30% of our revenue and here I have in the my script pause for gasps I don't know didn't hear enough gasps I think ah there I did that um so you know why did we do that because if we really believed in our product that meant we wanted to take responsibility for it if we really wanted to simplify the experience and make it crystal clear whose responsibility it was we had to take responsibility for our own coffees being served in our own cafe so and wholesale became an obstacle for our guests enjoyment and a distraction for our business and that was a moment which kind of crystallized an intuition into a thought and the thought goes I think something like this building value in building revenue are two very different things this is is me realizing this after the fact but there at many points at Blue Bottle coffee I've made decisions just intuitively that have been not about building revenue they've been more about building value of bluebottle and walking away from wholesale was definitely one of those a few other decisions like that that we made Oh building revenue is additive you you're sort of in search of this these new sources but building value is subtractive my opinion your your getting rid of things your jettisoning things that aren't important so what remains becomes much more important becomes the the singular focus in my mind and our guests is mind so a few more things about how we were able to think subtractive lis in that way in order to build value is when we offered that's the right the wrong order but we built some as expensive pastry kitchens and instead of using wholesale baked goods and if we would have used wholesale baked goods that meant we could have built revenue faster because we weren't investing in kitchens but we took responsibility for our products and we built some kitchens we made some really delicious cookies we made a decision to shorten the shelf life on our bottled product it made it much more delicious we could have sold more we could have gotten more revenue if it sat on store shelves longer but we chose to make it more delicious and that actually ended up making a lot more attention for us and then lastly we avoided joint venture partners we avoided licenses when we moved to Japan and opened a few years ago and because we got to make our own decisions we didn't have a licensed partner telling us what we should or should not do and we made some kind of very strange decisions about real estate and ignored a lot of people's advice about how to change our offerings in Tokyo and that ended up I don't know if you can tell on that slide but it was very busy for for opening it was really busy and it's still quite busy and we're opening a lot of cafes wholly owned by Blue Bottle coffee now and it's been more successful than and just more interesting than a more bloodless relationship with a JV partnership could have been so taking things away subtracting being more essentialist has worked really well for me and Blue Bottle coffee over the last 16 years because it has helped me staying focus on the things that remain what remains is by definition what's most important but I've always had anxieties about the future so my central anxiety about the future of Blue Bottle today has basically always been my anxiety about Blue Bottle which is are we going to be able to carve away the things which should not be there and continue to improve am I going to be able to improve in my ability to imagine cafes and coffee and the pleasure that can be had for out of both and I find myself more and more apprehensive in that in the pursuit of scale my will to work on these mysteries and the problems I've been fascinated by for 16 years has been eaten away by my own increasing comfort and the knife-edge of my intellect and desire for improvement has been dulled by success and habit so I take some consolation in a passage by that connoisseur of anxiety Soren Kierkegaard and I apply the idea of vertiginous freedom to my anxious thoughts much in the way that bactine is applied to an open wound so thank you very much everybody enjoy your beer [Applause] you [Applause]

[Music] okay first of all I'm extremely impressed with you if you wanna talk about hustle it is the people that will show up in a dark room when it's totally gorgeous outside on the summer Friday so I am very very grateful that you're here and over the course of the next 20 minutes or so I hope that I can serve you in some small way where you get some nugget of wisdom or something that will help you on your entrepreneurial endeavors I can tell you that I'm going to share what I have done right and what I have done wrong both have been equally valuable and that was a good intro I hope there's anybody here familiar with the selling about family a brand oh good thank you I'm so glad this is we're about a lot more than accessories we're really a family of brands across different women's lifestyle categories we have two accessories brands and a skin care cosmetics brand and we have 50,000 independent business owners in six different countries that have earned over five hundred million dollars in flexible earnings by selling our products on our social selling platform so it's probably not what you were imagining in terms of an old-school direct sales business that was the goal of this business so by way of introduction I want to just talk about what I mean by community which is really business that's there to serve a group of people of movement when I think of community I don't think about a Facebook group though we certainly use many of them but when I think about being community driven and purpose driven it's about having a business with a different center that doesn't think about of course we think about profitability and everything else that a business should but it's not our primary purpose so this is how we began I know what you're thinking that those children are adorable and boy that looks like a dump and those are both true I had been a ecommerce entrepreneur before and and I can tell you the journey for one to the other was kind of crazy I think every overnight success story takes about seven years and that's certainly what it was for me I was here I graduated entrepreneur in many ways and I know that easy and entrepreneur don't typically go together but when you think about the stars aligning and the and history a time I was born you know in this country I graduated from Stanford in 1994 at the advent of the Internet the first time that women were earning degrees equal to men and everything was a start-up so I went into technology startups and I did a lot of entrepreneurs do they and what I then went back to Stanford Business School and dropped out to start the company that would become wedding channel comm and I went at that business with my head and I looked at every framework and said where's a large addressable market space that you could disrupt with technology this was the early days of e-commerce it was about aggregating price and availability to bring wedding gift registry online and and that business worked and it worked so well we were on Oprah for being great entrepreneurs and all these women reached out to me and said you know it was an Oprah eyes do of the story so it was like she loves shopping so she started this business this is actually not what happens but people reached out and said how do I start this business and I honestly thought that all I could offer was I had raised over 120 million in venture capital I worked seven days a week and all I could think was I don't on this business this business runs me I'm honestly I'm like this businesses but it's like I can tell you what you should do is don't do this I really thought to myself how could I be so successful and in what you're supposed to be pursuing as an entrepreneur and actually feel like a fraud and I and every metric that you wanted to check off the business checked off so I said to myself hold on I'm wired to hustle for sure I'm an entrepreneur by trade I look at the world and I just see the way that I want it to be instead of the way that it is and I become endlessly obsessed with making it so but if I'm gonna do that it better be for a purpose and that purpose better not be to just create liquidity for the different people on the cap table so I decided to go at it again very differently and being mission and community driven and really saying what are my passions and for then and at that time I had this serendipitous experience of discovering direct sales I was staying at the Adolphus of Tallinn Dallas has anyone been there it's kind of old and creepy a bit like this theater but like the elevators are this big so if you in the elevator you were like making out with the other person in the elevator like this is intense and I was there with these women that were pink caddy drivers they were with Mary Kay they had sashes and Tiaras and they were clearly very very successful it was clearly a community it was a business where it was about more than makeup it was clearly about people and I could see their joy and their expression and and I was in this business in this world for all it was was about growth and challenge and even if we were growing we weren't growing enough and I thought to myself you know that's the business I want to be in it's a people business and I'm so curious about it now I thought it was a pyramid scheme that was stuffing inventory into closets and had a lot of false promises and honestly a lot of that was actually accurate and it scared the crap out of me meaning I thought there's no way I could go into a business like that because what would people think right here I was the poster child for the e-commerce and then I was gonna go start this crazy industry but I realized that that wasn't the reason why I couldn't shouldn't do it that was the reason why I had to and I wanted to change it and I wanted to use what I learned as an entrepreneur and really go in and reinvent what that meant I went to this conference this industry conference and learn to learn about what is you know how do I do anything in direct sales I think that's what you do as an entrepreneur right you crack a book you go to a conference like this you talk to people you ask questions you soak it in because you start knowing nothing and then you just figure out a little bit as you go and what really got me was when I went to this conference it was all it's supposed to be about the mission everybody's tagline every mission that was print painted on every corporate offices wall was about being the company for women or serving this but then when you talk to their executives it didn't really feel that way it didn't really seem authentic and I just continued to do more research about the industry these are big companies I mean these are a hundred billion dollar global industry with lots of multi-billion dollar companies in it and I looked at and said you know the founding story of this business is really important and it's not going to look like going to raise venture capital which is a good thing because I don't want to do that anyway so there's the first way you really create a community is with totally authenticity you don't start by being a community leader you start by being a community member so for me that meant being someone the business is ultimately to serve it's it's really not what you're thinking in terms of 80% of our business owners have other full or part-time jobs they're doctors they're lawyers they're teachers they're not just the stay-at-home mom that is really how the industry started in the 50s these are very much professional level women that have a sidekick it's their side hustle and but what I realized is I needed to start this business this founding story needed to be me working another job nice and weekends out of my living room while I was pregnant with my first child so it may have seemed crazy and in a way it was but that the actual authentic roots of our business now anybody who's doing this and I can understand their struggle because I've been there and I've done it so that was really important and then also allowed me to bootstrap the business so unlike the first company I decided to bootstrap this one we raised nothing more than two million bucks I funded it myself for a while and then I brought in a couple other investors but with all the the concept of being an LLC and buying and holding the business and we've were over a couple hundred million dollars in revenue we've been profitable ever since and we never took more than two million in capital to build the business because it was community driven and community driven when you think about how do I go acquire a customer and so often you think to that about like well how do i acquire a customer how am I gonna get them online how is it gonna be viral I'll tell you how you acquire customer to really borrow away he walk into their living room and you go door-to-door and I really literally mean that when I started in was a community member I started with the product trying to sell it even though you know and so I think that's really really important is to always be a member and stay a member and have authentic interactions the other thing about being a community is you have to be simple to join and quick to connect when you have a user or a registered email or even a customer with the first-time purchase see them as a member in waiting but Rick nobody connects with a courser re-introduction they really bond when there is a true connection so as a tribe of sellers these these 50,000 people again in six countries and the things that we do right if you're walking into a standout conference or a keep collective conference or an ever conference we would use every tactic and device that's a part of human nature to connect them to the tribe there is a dance that we learned there is a song that we learned it was as close as you can get to having a secret handshake because if you're inside of a community you're a member you feel like you belong it's like what church is about right you sing songs you but ritual if you live in a particular town you know things that people that don't live there don't you know don't know and so that's that's really important about when you're thinking about the community is can the community can't just be about a commercial purpose it has to have rituals and customs and things like that so so that's the other thing that we're really doing is that recognizing that in real life really matters it's even think you've probably seen and read all the statistics that people are more connected than ever but actually lonelier than ever do you know that bowling is up as a hobby but more people are bowling alone this is very sad sad but true and so in real life is really critical the more we're we're a tech company as much as we're people companies so we build these social selling apps that allow them to connect a lot of our businesses are driven online but we do a lot to do things to get people to meet up in person because that community element is really really valuable and I know that's why the hustle does this conference here and it really matters so the other thing to think about that's so counterintuitive to what you think about is in business everybody's heard about the Pareto principle and that it's the top 20 percent that will drive your revenue that you got to focus on the matter but if you're gonna be a real community you got to worry about the 80% a community isn't a group of people it's about the one if you can make that one person feel celebrated and special and included when that one person does something small everybody else watches and knows that you truly truly care if you only celebrate the heroes the top contributors the top sellers the top leaders then everybody else feels unimportant and you know who the top people are there to impress everybody else so you really can't have people that thrive as outliers in a community without loving the one and loving the whole and are really our whole business is built on that because we're there for big income we really focus on funding a need so there are people who will come in earn some money to pay for a fertility treatment and then they're out and we see them as equally successful as the woman who earns hundred thousand dollars a year and we celebrate each of those successes really in that I think that's really really important be transparent fair and easy to forgive you can't really outsource managing community to other people and I'll make this to like if it's personal it's personal you're a member of the community you guys say a member of the community and with things like this I'll give you a very tactical and specific example we've had things keep collective as a term business you'd be amazed at how large that type of business can be one of our charms and I hope you love this is it's a collectible it has a lot of heart and humor and it's anybody know what a Red Solo Cup is does anybody not know what a Red Solo Cup is okay so we have limited edition charms one was a Red Solo Cup just like our working snow globe it sells out like hotcakes and then we'll like turn up on eBay for a great a great premium but this red cup that goes crazy and sells out people love having scarcity demand and they love it about product but they're furious if they've lost a sale because of it our community was going to be outraged that we kept running out of stock of these these items even though collectability was the point so we bring in our leaders and we teach them inventory planning we give them total visibility to the buy process and the ranking process so if you can bring your community truly on the inside and treat them as a business partner and be transparent and when you send out an apology you don't make a memo you go live with video and you let them see that when they're stressed you feel the stress but you give them the why they'll be on your side and it's a really important element of community so then the last thing about community that is is really important is that business is nothing more than people business would be so easy and I thought I if I wrote a book about business it would be dr. Seuss style and would be like I've got problems here problems there problems everywhere because the reality is if you've got products and you've got people you have got problems but without without either you also don't have a business and it people if they come together they can solve all those problems but people are these incredibly beautifully complex in crisis often people and so they come into your community and they'll vent and they'll do crazy things and they'll you know out loud complain about things and so that can lead you to want a sensor so in our community I'll give you an example in our in our skincare brand right we have a phenomenal product it's clinical grade it has lots of efficacy its award-winning it's got all these other things but in any large sample size you're gonna have somebody who has an a rash to this ingredient and you guarantee that person's gonna post the picture in jewelry we have the industry standard industry defect rate is 14% are just 3% we over invest in quality but the entire 3% seem to come online and post a picture robbing you know robbing everybody else or the confidence and the quality you have to continually message the numbers and the Cystic saying yes thank you so much for sharing that photo we want you to know here are the numbers here's the stats because you have to protect the community but without censoring it because censoring will backfire this is a world of a glass house and transparency and a few sensor here a private community crop soap over here and and you and you lose the trust of your community so we are live in a world now where it's truly power the people and you've got to have all your all your dirty laundry is out there for everybody to see and you just got to be out there and you've just got to own it then the last thing I'll say about the community is that when you have a community and it's personal and you love it you'll lose people and they'll come and go and when they do you have to do nothing but show gratitude and when they complain you have to show nothing but gratitude because in the end of the day your best mentor is your customer you're in your best critic is got a gift to offer you but if you listen with a sense of we went on offense instead of defense then your community will be the people that guide you and it's not just not having a vision on your own and giving them what they don't even know they want but if you truly listen to the naysayers you know you there's something to learn you don't want them sit in the front row you don't let them dominate the conversation but you can't ignore them either and most importantly it's to help you really learn to shape so that you can serve your community better so I hope that with all this today you got something out of it that can serve you and your business together and then the last thing I'll tell you if there's lessons that you want to know they're in that book and the entire proceeds of the book go to supporting women's education so thank you so much for being here and I hope you enjoy your hustle [Applause]

[Music] what's going on everyone so so I like to keep things pretty casual so I'm gonna talk to Jake but I want to get everyone else involved so my twitter handle is the sampar so if you guys have any questions or want me to ask anything or bring up anything tweet at me at any point and I'll have my phone right here but basically we've worked with movement in the past before because we are huge fans and I've known Jake for a little while now and typically at hustle con we get a lot of entrepreneurs who are silicon valley-based which means they tend to raise a whole lot of money but what interested us with movement and Jake's story is that this company is only five years old and they're tracking to do 100 million in revenue this year in 2018 and that's what that that's what taking zero funding him and his team own 100% of the business and what they've done is really amazing and so today we're gonna talk talk a little bit about how the company started but also why they've taken decided to take the bootstrap method versus raising funding so Jake thanks for coming here can you uh you know what what what impressive what impressive stats that I miss when introducing you because I know there's so many yeah I mean we're so yeah on track to do a hundred million this year we have 35 employees in-house which is a pretty lean team to your point we haven't raised any capital we launched on IndieGoGo even then I was in college I was about 21 years old so the only money I had was 18 months of interest-free credit on my Chase credit card and basically ran through that pretty quick on samples in just kind of investing in the initial samples and and camera equipment everything that I needed to really start the business and launch you need to go go and how many units have been sold since you guys started over 1.5 million you know it's crazy okay so what I want to hear about is the very first month of business so like you said you had a little bit of you had some very small personal line of credit yeah how much was it it's $5,000 and you used that to do what so samples were a big portion of that we we were very familiar with IndieGoGo and Kickstarter back then it was still less known and you know I dropped out of college and at 19 so I spent my time pretty much studying every single Kickstarter and that went up in understanding the do's and the don'ts and why things worked and I could almost predict when a campaign launched if it was going to be successful or not so first month was really we bought a camera from Costco returned it a week later spent 60 dollars on a microphone on ebay returned it a week later I mean pretty much it was his bootstraps his bootstraps I can get but really it was you know we designed the watches in-house we work with the manufacturers we found them on Hawley Belva it was we were doing a little bit of everything and the first month was officially just on IndieGoGo and we launched in June of 2013 and we didn't have money to spend on Facebook or Instagram or anything like that those aren't even platforms that were well known at the time to recoup your investment for ads so for us it was leveraging web sites like Reddit and kind of just doing little growth hacks I had people in the Philippines upvoting my reddit posts to the number one spot and it would generate 5,000 dollars in revenue I'd make a hundred accounts on reddit post something about my watch and different subreddits and then use a proxy to change my IP address and then upvote with this this wasn't automated though this was oh this is this is me this is fit like this is as bootstrap sees you I mean this is studying how to start an online business without any capital okay so but you you have this five grand you got the samples and the samples you only had samples and then you did the IndieGoGo campaign in that part in 300k yeah 300k so the whole concept is basically show the samples tell the story and if you can you know hit a certain target goal which ours with 15,000 we ended up raising three hundred thousand that the business would start you have enough money to place the initial production run and then continue to buy him in my watches I loved fashion and was just fascinated with the watch industry there that was one category that I couldn't really afford many other products out there so for me it was really about creating a product and a brand that represented something more than just a physical good and watches was something that I really liked from day one so you you use this money to get samples which you use to make your video then you hack reddit which basically you just created a hundred different accounts and posted them all over the place I've been commented about how much you love the product it was me talking about how much I love the product over and yeah got it everyone's been there yeah we did it and then with once you receive that 300k you guys had found you how did you find your suppliers so Alibaba I don't have a good suggestion on how to find the best manufacturer really for me it was communication being one you know we only had really one go to find to get samples made because once you invest in that like if the samples were [ __ ] you're screwed so for me it was reached out to 30 or 40 different manufacturers in Alibaba talk to them understand who they worked with I think communication is key because if they can't if there's something being misinterpreted or missed because the language barrier then there's gonna be issues down the road and I think people who work with the United States a lot are just better at communicating they have someone in their office that can communicate better so well and you're not like a watch designer but you told me that you are literally just like you like sketch is that what you very little they're little Photoshop self-taught experience and it was a lot of kind of so what it's an in-house service where basically you go back and forth of them they'll create a digital rendering so a lot of times they'd miss and we go back and forth back and forth but it was me cutting out inspiration from different brands or sketching different things and a lot of back I mean it took eight months to get samples now we're moving much quicker with a designer in-house but but it was you actually designing the wat like literally drawing it out or using Photoshop yeah we tried we went on like up work and tried to find a freelancer but it just it was easier for we knew what we wanted and I felt like we could illustrate that better and okay so you get the 300 K from IndieGoGo in like 30 days the campaign was 50 days fifty day you get that from hacking reddit what did you so with that 300k how much went to paying the supplier a good portion basically was you know by the inventory sold and then spend the rest of the money to buy more inventory because if this is gonna it was like do we either take the money and call it quits or do we you know reinvest that money in the inventory essentially so we reinvested in inventory saved a little bit for for the website and then me and Cramer paid ourselves my business partner paid ourselves ten thousand dollars and then half of that really went to the credit card debt so how long was that Tang Korean supposed to last you that was really I was just focused on paying off the credit card debt because I was running out of time on that so were you living at home I was living in Santa Barbara where we officially started it and then moved home with my parents and I was on a fast track to get out of there as quickly as possible so I was which for the record your mom and your brother work for you now my mom brother cousin Kramer's brother on and sister so [Laughter] so you know we're the hustle were mostly bootstrapped business and one thing I think about when we first started was it could it costs money to start [ __ ] even if you like even it doesn't matter if it's a restaurant internet website it costs money to get things going and it's actually quite stressful to like watch your bank balance tick down as you hope your revenue and profits are going up yeah how close did you guys get to running out of money because you guys had literally no capital other than your IndieGoGo campaign Nick that was fast yeah I mean early days early couple years I mean it was kind of what do we think because for us a big piece of our business is q4 so come around summer time we even right now we place big orders for the second half a year and so pretty much every year for the first few years we had no idea if we were gonna sell through this inventory were buying very very large POS which would deplete a lot of the cash and then you'd have to sell it otherwise you're stuck with inventory and that's our business and I so fortunately for us we actually had the reverse issue where we would sell out too quickly we didn't buy enough which was a great problem to have but where there was there times where you were like I don't know if we're gonna be able to make like we have to do something in the next four days because payrolls coming up we were very very lean for the first year it was just me and Kramer we did a million that year I mean we had my mom was doing bookkeeping or something but we should give her free watches or something I can't remember and it was very lean I mean really it was like it was inventory and then it was our website which we actually were gonna launch on Magento then we heard this thing called Shopify we got a quote for 30 km Magento and they went to Shopify got a better website for 2-grand so we were just very lean it was like if it's cheaper and we think that it's a sustainable option like let's just go that route and it turned out to be a better route so the first year revenue was a million and that was mostly from to IndieGoGo campaigns right so to indiegogo campaign basically launching an ego game campaign did 200k and then realized she'd we don't have a website we got a relaunch and then we did another hundred K on that and then the rest of the year was just our own e-commerce website and so how did you oh and by the way up that 1 million do you know how much was profit I don't off the time I had to be honest but probably yeah 300k I was 300k and after that first year how are you able to feel growth because you guys jumped from like a million in revenue to seven seven and then like what 27 to 37 30 and then 30 to 60 to 80 now 200 yeah what what helped that early growth you know how were you able to jump from a million to seven million yeah in just one year in revenue yeah so we really focused we really didn't spend any money on marketing year one but kind of depleted a lot of like we were doing word-of-mouth and I had hit kind of a certain capacity of it just wasn't growing as fast as one of the business to grow so we started spending money we're looking for channels to spend money on whether it was Instagram Facebook Twitter at the time Twitter was bigger than then Instagram Facebook wasn't really proving out yet but for me it just made the most sense and it seemed to have like the backend seemed to be you know equally as built out as a like an AdWords Google so for us started testing there and found success early on and we were able to convert customers at a really low cost per acquisition for like 10 15 bucks and there just wasn't a lot of it wasn't saturate at the time so but I think the challenge back then that I always like people are like oh you're so lucky you were able to acquire customers for so cheap that that is true but there wasn't like it clear like everyone knows Facebook's a great way to build a brand now that wasn't known back then so we had to kind of you know trial and error in so many different places first time we spent money on Twitter we spent money on tabula and other areas and Facebook proved to be the most successful when I actually taught myself how to do it I was running the ad so I really understood what was right and what was wrong we actually hired someone off of Reddit to run it initially and then it ended up bringing in a house but I think the big you know way that for us the scale was just acquiring customers for a low cost so basically in 2014 this is your second year Facebook had how many Facebook at this time must have had close to a billion users but how many advertisers were there do you know I don't remember off the top my head but I believe it was it went it's 10 next yeah so there just simply was not a lot of people advertising on Facebook and one of the early ones yeah and you was the game plan just as long as we're acquiring users we're gonna spend all of our budget on pretty I mean for the most part we didn't want to be overly salesy but people love the brand we were I mean yeah we were we were profitable on every single order we still to this day being bootstrapped we have to be profitable in every single order that we get you know I think some brands that are venture backs are willing to lose money because they're hoping to recoup that you know six months or 12 months on the road for us it was the day we acquire a customer we need to make money otherwise we're gonna go out of business so as long as that was happening in any channel that we're spending on and it was you know supporting the what the brand represented I think we were okay with it and went that year that you guys did seven million in revenue how many people were working there at the time there's probably like three or four maybe maybe a couple people part-time Wow yeah so someone was just tweeted at me and it's actually a good question to ask now which was during your IndieGoGo campaign you were able to get the money and then go and buy the product how did that change how did you ship to be more operationally savvy to be able to have inventory at all times you can negotiate with your manufacturer on terms so now we put down twenty to thirty percent and then we get in that terms once shipped so there's negotiations like that you don't have that leverage early on but I mean if the manufacturer wants your business then hopefully they can give you terms we have inventory planners now we're very sophisticated and kind of mapping that out and we have a line of credit to help with some of these things but back then it was we didn't want it over by inventory so it was pre-orders and people would come and buy inventory or buy products on pre-orders and they'd be willing to wait a month or two we ended up pissing a lot of people off if it would take longer than a month or two but we were a startup and if they wanted the product and they had to wait what I'm amazed about is how you just said you guys did so right now you guys are gonna do 100 million dollars in revenue with 34 full-time employees you did seven million in revenue with you said four full-time employees what tools were you using to make this possible I mean it sounds you must have had a lot of automation I mean it just seems like one of the most efficient businesses I've ever heard of in my life sure I think well for us another thing is you know watches or one-size-fits-all generally and Shopify is a big secret to be honest through our success I mean so many brands would launch on magenta or these other shopping carts and it to do some of the tools or the features that we do abandoned cart or a pop-up or reviews I mean they would have to pay thousands of dollars and have developers involved I mean for me it was like plug and play it was click tested I'd do it all I mean I was running the entire website on my own essentially we paid it as developer two grand to get the template up the templates cost 150 bucks so I probably overpaid on that and really it was just me running the website and Facebook instigating the Instagram we really focused on social I mean we would do you know the movement was always about our community of people who backed us from day one so we would always do giveaways that every a thousand lights we get or you know we'd offer discounts or store credit if people were friends so really focusing on the community your first adopters to really spread the word and the movement and we focus on a you know again focused on something more than just a watch we knew early days that we couldn't just be posting pictures and watches on Instagram no one want to follow that so it's more of an experience and a lifestyle and again I think all you know great brands stand for something more than just a physical good amongst my friends who start businesses around here and end up taking a lot of money is that it seems like they try to accomplish a lot at the same time and in order to do that what they what they do is they add in they add and [ __ ] that's probably unnecessary so they'll think we should have this type of social page because everyone else has it or we need to have a blog because everyone else has what we need to do this and that and that and a lot of it's unnecessary and it's kind of like the 80/20 rule where 20% of your effort produces 80% of the percent of the results and it's almost like you just did that to the extreme does that sound accurate I mean did you did your team it was your team telling you like oh hey it's going great let's expand a sunglasses right now or let's expand to this type of accessory or let's add this thing or that thing if we've got this state discipline I think early days it was I was more obsessive of over you know we knew what products we were coming out with that was and it took a long time the development cycle we didn't have a designer in-house so we knew it like you know coming out with more product you took a while for us it was how do we get more people to the site that haven't heard about us whether it's Facebook or Twitter or Instagram or radio or whatever else it was so I was obsessed over finding different acquisition channels to bring traffic you know I mean it's like a retail store you don't have any walk through traffic you're not gonna sell anything so for me it was just getting cost-effective traffic and people who are actually in market for a watch so focused on finding that and then also optimizing the website with Shopify you have a lot of leniency to do that so I was very obsessed with not other watch brands but other e-commerce players that I thought were doing a really job and seeing what tools they were using what review tools or what advertising channels and there's a bunch of like chrome plugins that you can do to see pretty much every script that's on the side and know what they use and I'd kind of go one by one and figure out like what worked and what didn't it and then just use my gut like if something didn't make sense to me I I didn't do it so it's just you gotta use your intuition as an entrepreneur when things make sense or do there was there was some there was some like vendors that would just charge ridiculous rates to use their service and there's an alternative that's you know ten times less and we would often go with them and find the same results so I'm gonna ask you a couple more questions and then I'm gonna go to my Twitter so it's at the sampar I'll try to answer some of the questions so tweet them at me now but in a little bit I'm gonna interview one of the founders of instacart which has raised many hundreds of millions of dollars and I believe you guys were doing close to 30 or 40 million dollars before you even had a lot in credit with the bank but I know that you've had you still do have lots of people wanting to invest in you guys if you had to start today do you think that you still could have done this with with no finance without any financing I think it would be very tough I mean I think especially in our space right like we're in our space so it'd be hard to compete with us and we've were spending on different channels and we're working with we're working with different influencers so it's just hard to compete with what we're already doing but I think if I were to start over now having money to be able to spend on knowing that Facebook works knowing that influencer marketing works knowing you know I need an optimized website like there's different ways to do it and I think IndieGoGo and Kickstarter some of those places are more saturated there's still people who are raising money I think for me if I were to do it again because I haven't win under my belt so to speak I would I would go and either take friends and family money or an angel you know investor I wouldn't go out just to go raise money though because then you're setting yourself for like extremely high expectations potentially but I think it's doable I think that the ways that I built the brand on reddit and so forth those may not work today but now you have snapchat you have twitch you have all these other channels that I believe there's opportunity and that that big brands are overlooking because they don't have time to invest it's not scalable yeah Facebook is scalable TV is scalable but reddit wasn't skilled well we don't even do it anymore maybe it works maybe it doesn't I don't know but it's not scalable for us before starting off and you have no money it's a good way to generate ten fifteen thousand dollars of cash and you so you are able to get to low tens of millions in revenue doing these somewhat hacky things like Reddit I used it I mainly used it year one your one and as it was just wasn't well basically all the communities of Reddit started to catch on and like someone did this which on and found out that I was doing this and called me out and I got banned from reddit so so that didn't work anymore but yeah early days I mean when you're on IndieGoGo in kitchens of people's million millions of people on those websites so I think it's important too you have to leverage and get as many people to that page to convert and the more you convert the more sales you generate their algorithm works in the sense that you go to the popular page and they send you out an email so really for us the reason we want on IndieGoGo is because we were able to generate our own revenue even if it was ten fifteen thousand dollars and then the IndieGoGo system tool put us in an email we generated 30 thousand dollars in a day and then we got on the home page and so I think for us it was just those little things that no one else knew what to do and that's really what helped us okay and now you guys you guys are way beyond just advertising on Facebook or doing direct direct response ads you're on I mean I hear you on every podcast I see you personally on doing commercials on TV how are those things working I mean that's like a huge gap it seems like like creating a Facebook ad it takes literally a hundred dollars in 30 seconds yeah it's like it seems like going to TVs just way different yeah how's that how's that stuff going the Baron entry is definitely more difficult for something like TV you need a produced spot and just buying ads and testing you need capital to do that but so we're in a place where we can go and test that or test radio or podcast but can you reveal how much it costs to going to do it a nationally a national commercial we're buying remnant so it's like available spots I don't know off the top my head though like what a typical spot goes for I think it depends on what and what time and if then be a play officer going on or what so but yeah it's just been a strategy of testing different channels and seeing what's what's worked I moved on Pandora we've done you know regular radio TV Direct Mail I mean we've done literally everything you can think about other than billboards but eventually we're Paul I do that too and so as are you seeing results from the TV and podcast ads if we're doing it and you see it consistently we're seeing results great all right I'm gonna answer some of these questions from Twitter someone a couple people actually asked about the margins they're talking about a 300k a profit on a million sales in new year one have your margins been able to stay the same or increase yeah I mean typically in terms of just product margins typically as you scale you're able to work with your manufacturers to get better margins so there was a question here about since you guys were a first mover or one of the early movers with Facebook and a lot of the new direct response ads where do you see what's the next frontier for marketing it's hard I mean I'm I'm really excited about twitch to be honest that were you gonna put is that a bet you'll may think we're doing some tests there I don't fully understand the ecosystem there yet but I think that there's definitely I mean there was that stat about I think ninja versus I don't know maybe Drake or something and ninja had more explain that to folks who don't so ninja I believe is some it's like a twitch video game streamer and then I think it was going off of Drake's Instagram and just saying that ninja had more impressions more people that were watching him in a given month or whatever it was I don't remember the exact step but those are things that I think large companies are just unaware of right now and I think there's still arbitrage that you can go there and and you know scale when no one else really understands it I mean influencer marketing when we started influencers didn't know they could get paid to post and we just said hey we'll pay you will pay you so we'd spend $100 and then sell 10 watches and we're like okay we'll do that all day as long as it's going and then other brands come up and now you can't spend $100 for anyone to post it's way more iya thousands that's crazy what's them can you reveal the most expensive influence were you paid uh I won't say who but we spent six figures on one post what did you get back from it not six figures so we only have a few minutes left and a lot of people are asking questions about what you what what what what do you think you should have done back when you're starting that you didn't and I phrased it a little bit differently but what's one thing that we cover we haven't talked about about your experience without raising any funding to build a big business what's what's something that something that either a you wish you would have known or something that people often don't assume is the truth about about that yeah I don't know there's a specific thing I can give but I think for me one of the things that I did is I used LinkedIn and just networks to go and like cold reach out to people that I wanted to network with and I figured that and honestly early days it wasn't the CEOs because a lot of the CEOs were busy either hiring people or raising money like the CEOs that of the brands that we're doing well weren't really in the weeds as much so I went after you know the VP of acquisition at Dollar Shave Club or you know different brands that I respected that we're doing well and I would just network with them and then get another referral and talked to people who were really running certain channels or whatever was talk to director Viacom at whatever company was and I think my network I'm in Los Angeles and I'm not originally from LA I'm from Valencia which is you know hour and a half two hours away but living in the heart of LA now has allowed me to go and meet different founders and meet different people within the companies that have for sure movement as benefited for we wouldn't be the brand we are today if it wasn't for that network and it wasn't I didn't have the network to begin with I just offer someone I'd come up with some clever you know subject line on a LinkedIn and then offer to buy him dinner a beer whatever was and go up to people and sometimes I'd have bad interactions but if I had a bad interaction with someone I just kind of brushed off and go to the next one so I think that is really crucial for entrepreneurs and it's hard it's awkward but you have to do it as an entrepreneur and I only have two more questions which was so I'm sure you guys have a ton of copycats now right how are you gonna continue to win those battles and and and stay unique and continue growing yeah I mean I think as long as people are copying us to always be a step behind for us were the innovators in terms of what our brain represents who we work with I think the people that we have the talent in Los Angeles is huge being in LA there's not only in our company a lot of talented people but you have the influencers and tastemakers that all live in Los Angeles so I think another big piece too is like I'm 27 so I'm a millennial and understanding what social networks or what products or trends is a really big piece of the success of the company and someone just tweeted at me and they wanted to know because you didn't have the ability to fall back on a large venture funded bank account can you tell one story where it was the company was at a near-death moment so we didn't have it we now have a VP senior vice president of finance and we wanted in it and just struggled with understanding how like when cash comes in and when it comes out and there was just times where we they're smiling you just really what you're doing this I wasn't doing it but it was no one's fault it's just we should have hired someone earlier we just didn't know but there was times where I think we almost over bought an inventory and we would have gone there's been a but there's been so many times I can't even think of all of them um yeah it's it's a rollercoaster and we're about wrapped up so but what's gonna happen next with movement you guys were launching more stuff where do you say what's your dream and how are you gonna get there yeah I mean for us we want to be we're already a global brand we saw 160 countries we're about 40 percent international most of our business right now is direct-to-consumer that's that was our business model our strategy but the goal is to become a global omni tail brand so omni-channel brands so you know having our own retail doors one day being in different retailers as well I think as a brand you need to be where a customer where your customers want to buy you and I think a lot of people get caught up on just direct to consumer direct to consumer it's a great way to start a brand because you can you keep all the data it's cost-effective if you spend money on an acquisition channel you're able to have all that data and understand how to scale it but at the end of the day if a customer shops on Amazon or shops in Nordstrom you need to be there if that's where they want to buy you and otherwise you're missing out in your competition competition might take market share fantastic well I think Jake you're gonna be hanging out throughout the day yeah absolutely so oh and there were actually was one more question that I wanted to ask you and I don't know you guys maybe not you'll see some movement employees walking around and you'll understand this woman when you finally see them but do you have to be totally yoked in order to work at movement absolutely that's it they had a guy at our dinner last night who I swore he was the security guard we said yeah we sent Ethan to negotiate our lease contracts anything I was like he was like I do marketing at movement I was like oh I thought I was like I legitimately thought your security this guy was one of the biggest guys I've ever seen in all five of their employees were just jacked yeah we all we all we all try and keep up with him but yeah six four he wasn't always that big but over the years he's he's grown so I don't know maybe there's something in the movement water yeah like ping pong tables and stuff a bit protein powder that's your that's your perks yeah well all right Jake I really appreciate you doing the next lot Jake's will be hanging out all day so you could ask him any questions subdued anybody

Brian Scudamore founded 1-800-GOT-JUNK? when he was just 19. Today, the company does $250m in revenue. Here he talks about the importance of being willing to fail, and how that got him to where he is today.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so I would like you to think for a minute about your most recent failure seriously I want you to think about that for a second and then I want you to think about the biggest flop you've ever had in your career or in your life now imagine for a moment that you take that learning those failures as stepping stones towards your success that's the journey I have been on for the last 30 almost 30 years and I want to take you on today so I'm gonna okay I'm Brian Scudamore from 1-800 GOT JUNK the founder and CEO when I think of the business and the journey that I've taken WTF an attitude a willingness to fail has been so incredibly important if I look at my journey it has not been in a straight line and I bet that your journey will not be a straight line either whoever said these overnight successes take a long time was absolutely right so let me start by taking you back for a minute I'm not a PowerPoint guy so I always forget how to use clickers that is me seriously that is me four and a half years old a self-portrait my grandmother I'm a Canadian but I was born in San Francisco my grandparents had an army surplus store south of market he used to go down every Christmas every summer vacation and work in the store and taste that entrepreneurial spirit when my grandmother passed away loved her more than anyone on this planet when she passed away I was about 30 and we went through her stuff and found this picture and it was in a binder that said Brian's drawings and I really remember in that moment connecting with this illustration and going that is me I remember drawing it I look at that a mini uniform same blue colors for 1-800 got junk cleaning up trash like how could that have happened it was like destiny who thinks had become an adjunct man and becomes one but I look at that picture and one part perplexed me when I saw it if you look on the road I drew behind me there's a little broken heart WTF why a broken heart did I have a bad childhood hell no so let me take you to 20 years ago so what I am I 48 years old I start this business and I'm about eight years in I'm at a million in revenue felt pretty good maybe not as grow as fast growth as many of you are going through but I was proud this truck this was truck number two and a little point to note you can see we ran at a red paint there and didn't have a money for that another spray can so finished in blue I'm colored blind but no one else is anyways so I said okay I've got this business I feel like I'm not happy and I wasn't I started to do some reflection at that eight year point million in revenue but I had anxiety every day I don't know if anyone here has ever experienced panic attacks I had them every freaking day for ten years it was depression panic and anxiety why did that happen I don't know but I realized I was a business owner I was no longer this ad D well i'm still a DD but I was no longer this ad D junkman who dropped out of high school and started this business I was a business owner but what I wasn't anymore was an entrepreneur I wasn't a creator I was doing a day-to-day job and I was stuck I was dealing with problems I didn't love the problems and it was a challenge so I decided to do something a little bit differently I needed some help turn to others so I approached the 'enter the young entrepreneur organization it's now shortened we all got old so they shortened it to EO instead of ye o they drop the Y but the entrepreneur organization my business would not be half of what it is today if I didn't get that peer support but a mistake happened when I joined EO and the mistake was this if any of you have ever done the same thing it's painful comparing yourself to others looking at other entrepreneurs seeing what mistakes they've made I wasn't looking at their mistakes I was looking at their successes and I was saying you know what I I want a 10 million dollar business I want a hundred million dollar business I was putting pressure on myself let's face it I'm not in the sexiest business in the world and so I compared myself to others and it hurt so there I was in this Doom loop I was going down this downward spiral and I learned in the EO organization if you need to solve a problem if you want to be creative you take a retreat so I went and took a retreat and I feel like I'm actually standing on the edge of my parents summer cottage docks so I'm gonna have a seat for a second I went to my parents cabin alone on the water and I sat there on the dock and I'm like Brian I didn't really talk to myself but I thought it and I said you know what I'm failing I'm making mistakes I have to shift my thinking or I'm not gonna get through this and ever be an entrepreneur so I took out a sheet of paper one-page double-sided and I said okay what if I stop thinking of the bad and the in the challenges what if I think a pure possibility what could that look like if you've ever seen the movie Jerry Maguire it was a Jerry Maguire moment I'm feverishly writing one page double-sided and I said things like we will be in the top 30 metros in North America by December 31st 2003 that was a five-year vision I said thirty because we've been in 30 cities bigger than where we started in in Vancouver with there were 30 cities bigger we were gonna make this happen we'd be the FedEx a junk removal on-time service up front rates clean shiny trucks friendly uniform drivers we'd even be on The Oprah Winfrey Show a bunch of nonsense to anyone else that might potentially read that but to me I went back to being an entrepreneur my anxiety went away because I now had a vision for the future so I took this painted picture and I started sharing it with others people around me and people ended up in one of two camps are you a supporter and a fan of Bryan's vision do you see what I see or are you someone who's a naysayer and that was okay and the naysayers about half the people said I don't believe in what you believe I don't see what you see and so these people left and I let them go and together the rest of the group we made magic happen we got the Oprah Winfrey Show I remember being a guest on the show we made all the the FedEx a junk removal a bunch of great media and we hit the top 30 cities two weeks before December 31st 2003 it was intact an accident we had a crystal clear vision a future destination where we were going now armed with this vision of where we were going what I did not know is how to get there I didn't need to know I just had to believe in the destination so what I did is I said okay I'm going to embrace this WTF lifestyle culture I'm gonna put myself out there put it all on the line to make the vision happen if I make mistakes if I fall flat on my say my face awesome I'm gonna learn from those so let me share with you some of my favorite WTF moments so this was truck number two a couple years maybe a year after this point I made my first WTF mistake I had 11 employees and I remember sitting with all the love employees one day and I said I'm not happy again this isn't working I don't think I've recruited the right people they weren't happy hard-working hands-on hungry people that wanted to be a part of my vision so I got rid of everybody nine bad apples spoils the other two I said to all 11 this isn't gonna work out I'm sorry some of them were very tall and big and it was intimidating I did it all at once to rip off the band-aid and I said I as the leader as the founder of let you down I might not have hired the right people trained you give them that you the love and the support you needed the only thing I can see to do is start again the learning for me was I had five trucks half a million in revenue I went down to one truck one person one big brick cell phone taking all my calls hiring dispatching booking everything it was a nightmare I mean it was I think it was 3 months to rebuild it could have been longer it was a nightmare but what it taught me each and every one of those 3 months was that you have to make a company all about people all you have in any brand in any business is people make it all about people find the right people and treat them right and that became my new mission for myself so thanks for the whistle so number two my my second big WTF moment what did they say don't hire friends yeah I'm an entrepreneur I don't listen to that kind of garbage I recruited my best friend he had built up a franchise company with College pro painters had done some great stuff so Cameron Harold I bring Cameron into the business we grew it from 2 million to a hundred and six million in six or seven years hyper growth it was awesome but then I realized at some point oh my gosh we're like nitro and glycerin we are fire ready aim we have two entrepreneurial e minded people at the top those of you that are entrepreneurs I talked to one person that you might all know here and I'm not gonna say his name but he said I'm a shitty manager I said you're an entrepreneur give yourself permission to be a crappy manager but find a great manager find someone to partner with so I had partnered it taught at the time with Cameron Harold realized we were like nature and glycerin that it wasn't gonna work and I had to end that friendship and fire my best friend I was the best man in his wedding a year prior who fires their best friend now thankfully Cameron and I are still really good friends we see each other off and we've supported and helped each other in our journeys and while it was hard in the beginning he understood he would say to anyone here it was the right move for both of us it was the right move for the business the WTF philosophy for me was get out there put it on the line do the right thing because when you're building a business when our company was a hundred million the responsibility's way beyond me so I started to go okay now now what how do I continue to grow this by myself I'm not a good manager I'm now the guy in charge I don't know if I can do this so I needed rigor discipline systems i over hired I hired a fancy recruiter they came in big box ridiculously big bucks I then went out and searched and I found the ex ex president of Starbucks who wanted to move from the Seattle location back home to to Vancouver where she was from Lindsay who introduced me wrote an article about this which was titled and there's a little anger there not with Lindsay but how I felt in that moment it sucked it was my biggest WTF moment of my life when I recruited this person not the recruiting but the 14 months later that would follow I thought oh my gosh this is unbelievable someone's beat this person is loved by everyone in the business our franchise partners loved her and as things started to build and grow day by day I realized my vision was here hers was slightly different and I don't think she believed in an ad D crazy high school dropout entrepreneur she needed to for us to be successful together got her out WTF moment of the day and I said okay I got to start again here and what I learned from that moment was I had made a decision that not one person in my company believed at the time they believe today but they did not believe at the time was right they didn't see what I saw and what was happening and where we were at so I I did this I then get hit with a lawsuit for constructive dismissal all sorts of bad things started to happen and it went from crappy to worse but I made it through and when I look back actually as an ingredient that I think is is part of success that is important for all of us to remember well for me to remember whom I to tell you what to do I was angry about this for a few years right it was hard I almost bankrupted we almost bankrupted together my company that I built for 20 years it was hard it was painful it caused family issues the whole bit but I've learned to feel grateful and I mean a truly heartfelt sense of gratitude like I mean that like you wouldn't believe because I learned from it and I realized I couldn't get to my next stepping-stone my next awesome place in life where we are today if it wasn't from that moment I needed to experience I needed to fall flat on my face by hiring the wrong president from my company she's gone on to be incredibly successful leading the financial institution in Canada they're massive she's doing great she was the wrong person for me so what I did is I took out another sheet of paper and I said okay line down the middle what do I love to do as an entrepreneur in my company what am i great at what do I hate to do on the other side and what am i bad at and yes that list was a lot longer than the good side but what I recognized is all these things on my bad at not good outside that I don't like to do hiring finances metrics I had to recruit someone that would come into my business to partner on that side so I sat down and created a mini painted picture I wrote down what does this person look like act like who are they attitude for winning the sales experience that having built something big before and just I mean I listed in full detail this painted picture that I started to send out to my network 75 cos I interviewed all over Canada and the United States was always on planes three people in my network unrelated when I sent out this picture three different people had sent me one person's name back they didn't say hey here's three or five people I know that fit the bill these three people all said this is only one person I know exactly who you're describing a nuts Eric Church so I'm like I got to meet this Eric Church he's got a great job he's gainfully employed he's leading a big company but somehow when I reached out and called and connected he connected with the vision I wrote for him and the vision for us to build something great together so grateful again for the Starbucks experience led me to Eric we have almost a half a billion Canadian in revenue so like four dollars we have we have four brands all under the o2e brands family I have never been happier we've got this great culture and we're building something really really special so when I where's the clicker so when I look at where we are now I one of the things that I figured out is if you're going to have a WTF moment WTF towards what not just towards what vision and painted picture but towards what drives you you are all unique people twenty five hundred of you that I can't see a single one of you because the lights are so bright but all 25 of you are unique and special and have a purpose in life mine I believe is making meaning not money what really motivates you I think that when I talk to different entrepreneurs I hear people say I want these toys and cars and dream trips and freedom is fun and it's nice to have some money but I think when someone's motivated mostly by money it becomes harder and harder to actually get towards that goal so I challenge you to think what really drives you motivates you what makes you tick so for us as a company it's building something bigger and better together those are members at our franchise conference from four brands we love what we do because we're building it together and so that's what drives us in everything we do to recruit so if I kind of leave you with a couple of thoughts here you know I was asked to speak and I'm excited to share any lessons learned along the way and I've had help from entrepreneurs so if there's any way that I can help any of you hey we're human beings let's connect you can reach me I think my Instagram is the best way at Brian Scudamore let me see oh I'm going the wrong way there we go so at Brian's Scudamore if you want a painted picture many people go out you know you talk two minutes about a paint painted picture I don't really get it if you want to see our current painted picture it's not a public document but one I'm happy to share with you as entrepreneurs go to my instagram follow me send me a little note and there'll be a link there for you actually in the in the header of the bio today where you can download our painted picture copy bits and pieces that might resonate in the template whatever it is for you but if you don't know where you're going any road will take you there the second thing is I've recently written written a book as an EDD entrepreneur that was a really really hard thing but now it's gone to the publishers when it's ready if anyone wants to hear more about the story I'll send you a hardcover book for free again go to that link and do whatever you need to do okay so if I can help you contact me I think one of the beauties about entrepreneurship is entrepreneurs help entrepreneurs we connect we network and I think it's it's like magic when it happens so as I close here and it's humbling because I'm up here talking about the fact that we've built this business but many of you are going to build something so much better bigger the learning you will share with entrepreneurs it's unbelievable and as I stand here on again what reminds me of standing at the dock I didn't expect the stage to look like this but it's it reminds me of that day where that what I learned behind me figured out this WTF mentality of how to change my thinking to be grateful to seize opportunities and build on them that's pave the way for the the next 30 years so the previous 30 years have paved my way for the next 30 I hope all of you see the moment and the opportunity to create your own painted picture your own vision for yourself your people and possibility thank you so much for having me and and listening to my story thank you thank you you

Samantha tells her story about taking risks and being fearless. Samantha started her Production Assistant job at SNL when she was 21. She had no idea what she was doing in the high stress, male dominated industry, but she said yes, worked hard, took risks and acted fearlessly.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
[Applause] I'm Samantha I'm the CEO of Givi studios we launched Givi studios two years ago as a creative agency and production studio to make original gift content for brands celebrities TV networks film companies and music labels and more I'm not going to talk about giffy or tech today I've spent some time in a few startups but at my core I'm a producer and that gave me the foundation to really thrive in these startup environments so everything I ever needed to learn to survive in business I learned at Saturday Night Live I spent 11 years in the ultimate boys club where many of the rules were drink lots of alcohol exist on very little sleep showers are optional and most importantly work your ass off don't take no for an answer push boundaries take risks and be fearless so today I'm going to talk about taking risks and being fearless which is funny because I'm quite fearful of public speaking so please bear with me right now I have some clips notes right here so I started at SNL at 21 years old as a production assistant I was bright eyed and eager and kind of jaded as I entered the holy grail of comedy you see comedy really wasn't my thing I just wanted to work at The Oprah Winfrey Show so despite that I did understand the brevity of where I was and it was thrilling I would stand on set and hear the stage manager countdown and we're live in 3 2 1 and I would just get like butterflies of excitement throughout my body and I can't say I didn't get starstruck of course I did I got to meet everyone and party with them I went from drinking wine at 5 in the morning with Eddie Vedder to ending up at after-hours at Tracy Morgan's where strippers were waitresses and it would be like how is this my life right now but the first day that I went started at SNL someone told me whatever you do don't talk to celebrities and don't look them in the eye I think they were trying to help me but I just spent the next year walking around like a hummingbird on steroids being like can I talk to that person did I look at that person the wrong way I got stuck in the elevator with Lauren Michaels like on my third week and just stood there frozen like what's the protocol here am I allowed to look at him I just looked down and it was the longest elevator ride of my life so I jumped into this super competitive environment and high-stress environment with very little skills other than an internship at the h1 and some college classes I really just had to say yes to everything and I made it up as I went along it was either like I go with it or I get eaten alive so I took a lot of risks my second year I was asked to produce an animated segment with a million dollar budget I said yes of course why not despite the fact that I had no idea how to do a budget math was my worst subject I didn't know how to use Excel and I certainly didn't know how to produce animation but I mean I grew up watching cartoons so I figured how hard could this be right wrong there were a lot of variables and it was near impossible and to make it even harder I was really young and doing a really big job so a lot of people didn't take me seriously I had to work extra hard to gain trust and respect and it was constantly like pushing a boulder up a hill I wish that I could say that SNL was the only place that I experienced that but it's probably been almost every job I've ever had for the sheer fact that I have boobs I mean am i right anyway let's see I forgot what I was saying because I just talked about boobs and now I'm gonna move too right okay farts my first day as a producer of TV funhouse I walked into this recording studio and I opened the door and I heard a loud fart out loud fart and I thought are they gonna think it's me I was really embarrassed and I sat down and then there was another fart and I was like what the hell is going on here then I realized that we were doing a cartoon and I spent four hours choosing fart sounds from a fart library for a cartoon from that point I went from fart jokes to penis jokes at my next recording session where I went to the ambiguously gay duo with Steve Carell and Stephen Colbert if then became my job to discuss how phallic the animation was allowed to be on SNL so that's how I became friends with the NBC standards department otherwise known as the censors so not only was i pushing taking risks doing things that I didn't know what I was doing but I we also were taking risks by the content we were making we were being provocative and we were pushing boundaries and there was a whole department there to make sure we didn't go too far and this was the standards department and TV funhouse had a lot of risks so I was number one on their speed dial and I would get messages that would tell me the exact words that I was allowed to use for private parts and the exact words that I wasn't allowed to use let's just say these conversations were NSFW the standards Department and Robert didn't really agree all the time on what was allowed to air on SNL so they would tell me we couldn't air things and we would do it anyway the hope was that we would air it at dress rehearsal see there was two live audiences a live dress rehearsal audience and a live broadcast audience and the hope was that if it was funny enough Lauren would fight for it and it didn't matter that it was controversial I was basically the sacrificial lamb so since it was my job to get these scripts approved it was also my job to tell Robert we couldn't actually make these things and we would run our cartoon at dress and I would walk off the set feeling really high from all these people laughing it doing really well and I would hear Samantha where's Samantha bellowing down the hallway I had no choice but to run and hide fortunately most of the jokes got pushed through and I didn't get into too much trouble there were a few times though where our risks didn't go as planned we had a couple of cartoons that did get pushed through and aired and then got pulled from broadcast because they were so controversial we did get threatened by a lawsuit from Disney I got sued by Michael Jackson for slander my parents were so proud that they framed it on the wall in the living room yeah they finally thought I had made it so I really learned the most about taking risks from Robert Smigel he was the ultimate risk taker and he never took no for an answer and by default either did I but there was one time where risk almost destroyed my career so we would air our cartoons and dress rehearsal and between dress and air we would often edit based on if the jokes played well or notes from Loren Michaels and we did this about 10 blocks away and we usually had about two and a half hours to edit based on where TV funhouse was in the rundown so one time Lauren decided that we should take our cartoon and cut it up and have part of it be the cold open of the show so when you see that that person that's saying live from New York it's Saturday night he wanted our cartoon to do that now we had often spent these two hours editing things and I would be really cutting it close running in New York City in heels with the tape barely able to breathe I had asthma and would always forget my inhaler showing up to NBC at the control room usually with about 15 minutes to there now in this case we only had an hour to chop up a five minute cartoon do a new voiceover try to get the lip-sync correct and we were ten blocks away it was really scary I was looking at the clock every minute it was just counting down counting down counting down and it would have been our fault for the first time in history since 1975 for SNL to open with dead air if we didn't get the tape there on time dead air for those of you who don't know what dead air is it's when you turn the TV on and you see those colored bars with a really annoying high-pitched sound not a good look I would have been fired immediately so I was really panicked and at 11:08 we just had to call it it was going to take us at least fifteen minutes to get back to 30 rock so we lay off the tape get in the car running with the tape Robert Sprint's down the hallway gets to the control room loads it in its 1127 we made it whew except there was a problem there was no audio we were it was really really bad Robert thought on his feet and went and got Darrell Hammond who basically can do every impression Under the Sun and had him do Pat Robertson that's who we were opening the show with gave him a script and there were those words again and we're live in three two one only this time there were no butterflies of excitement I was shaking in fear and Daryl started reading the script live watching the cartoon looking at the lip-sync making sure that his words matched the lip flap perfectly and then it got to live from New York it's Saturday night and went to the music and I collapsed in my chair I mean my heart was in my throat somehow we pulled it off yeah I've taken a lot more risks since my time at SNL I veered away from TV into the YouTube biz when it was really really new and I took a chance at a startup called maker studios most of my TV friends and my agent all thought I was crazy but it ended up being a really good risk because I entered the Wild West of startup culture and digital media and it's led me to where I am now on a completely different path than wanting to work at The Oprah Winfrey Show I find it much easier to get tripped up now that I have like tripped up with fear now that I have more responsibility in my 20s I had nothing to lose I had no fear of repercussions or what people thought of me or god forbid fear of failure but now with a career and a family the risk seems much greater and the fall from failure seems much harder so whenever I find myself struggling to take a risk I step back and I ask what would that badass from SNL do and I dive right in with nothing to lose thank you [Applause]

Maya discusses self doubt- or in it‚Äôs more sophisticated phrase: the imposter syndrome. She explains that feeling you carry with you- worrying that you don‚Äôt deserve the position you‚Äôre in and that in any given moment you‚Äôll be exposed. She wants you to make sure to shake it off, acknowledge your self-worth, and carry your confidence higher.

hi everyone my name is Maya Prosser and I am thank you it's just my name and I'm a founding team member and the head of partnerships for a company called lemonade which is one of the fastest growing yay good there's one of the fastest growing tech companies and insurance companies in the u.s. today and so I thought a lot about what I was going to talk when I came here and actually I think there are a lot of kind of connecting webs or similar lines in between our talks and also I'm the last one so I hope this is good and I guess what I thought about la something that was kind of troubled me in the past few months and it's kind of self-doubt or and it's more sophisticated way the the imposter syndrome and that's kind of the failing that I guess a lot of us get to have some of us more some of us less if you're a woman a little bit more and it's the feeling that you get that you feel like maybe you don't deserve everything that you have you don't deserve you know the position that you're in and you feel like that in any given moment you know you might be exposed and so kind of thinking about you know that that that feeling that you get and thinking about about that fear that you know sometimes women have to get exposed and meeting so many successful talented women who when I talk to them really credit a lot of their success - I just got lucky right and I don't know if you've had or met women who say that but really the the really interesting thing that I found at that research shows that there's almost no connection between how talented you are or how skillful you are - you actually experiencing the syndrome actually the the opposite is true the more successful you get you you tend to feel that a little bit more but the second thing that research showed that it's actually interesting is that we're not born with it so as kids if we all go back and remember kind of our childhood we were you know pretty pretty secure we feel were kind of the greatest and almost everything we do when we have kind of great dreams of you know what we want to become and and and we have that tendency until someone tells us otherwise that we're kind of the best thing that ever happened to the world and my childhood was I grew up in his room in a small town near Jerusalem and and when I was 7 I came back home and I hit my lunch and spilled some ketchup on my shirt it's kind of any like a really regular day for me and then the phone rang and I pick up the phone and it's a casting director for this American movie called desperate rescue which was starring ural Hemingway and she got my phone number from my my you know my my principal at school you know there's almost obviously no data sharing information or laws in Israel at that time and so they were looking for blonde girls to play the role of the daughter of of the main actress and she said listen if you want an addition you'll need to get in like the next hour ten minutes away to studio by the way also we talked to your best friend she's coming I like the screen it was like sure sure no problem got this down I hang up the phone and then I called my best friend I said can you come and pick me up when you're going she says sure and then I remember I'm seven so I I need to I need to get approval for this right so I ID okay who's babysitting me okay my brother so I go to him and I'm like listen everything's said someone's picking me up I'll be you know I'm going addition all good and he says sure and so I go I get to the audition I passed the audition it's great next stop we need to get to Tel Aviv Hilton Tel Aviv final audition my best friend doesn't pass so next logical thing I attach myself to another mom that's there with her kid they're going I'm with you I remember need to do the responsible thing I called my brother again so I listened past I Rock right good for me I need to get to Tel Aviv someone's taking me don't worry about it you don't need to do anything it means like sure and so I get to Tel Aviv at the you know the first thing that I remember i walking ICBC of like blonde girls all dressed up in beautiful dresses all comedy by their moms or dads and this is me with my ketchup stain and and I couldn't be happier like this was like I was like having the best time of my life and as I was having the best time of my life this same time different part of Israel my mom walks at home and she walks so she goes up to my brother's like hey where's your Tom my other brother and Maya and he's just like your time set of friends mais auditioning for a moving in in Tel Aviv not the answer she was expecting so my mom being my mom she's rock star mom she finds out the telephone gets a waiter in the hotel to basically track me down look for a girl that has no one and so he tracks me down he finds me gets me to the phone I talked to her I'm like this is great and she's like okay never mind she lets me play along with it the production actually takes me back home when it's all done and it get the part which is really awesome so I get to like be on a movie set for a few weeks and my brother's punishment for letting me go was the baby Sydney fir on the side for the entire time so that was I was not as fun for him so thinking about this crazy story it is crazy but one of the things I kind of you know try to tap into was I was so sure of myself I had Zira block you know zero blocks I was just going for it I I had complete belief for myself and my in my abilities to really do this and I was seven which is you know ignorant bliss but also I think that you know it's kind of beautiful in many ways I mean then I kind of started thinking about okay I'm a different person today and and and I do have that insecurity right I do have that feeling sometimes that I can't do everything that I want to do or that maybe I can do and I started thinking about these points in life where people start telling you telling us right that you can't use certain things because not only because of who you are but because of what you are right maybe you're not rich enough maybe you're not strong enough maybe you're not men enough something along those lines and so I started thinking okay why did that happen and you carry that insecurity with you to the workspace and so few years later or many years later in my previous job not this one and we had this huge strategic account that that you know came in and we had to pile it with and I was preparing to pitch to my boss I need like I need to manage this like this needs to be my account and I was prepping friend it made a hundred percent sense that I should manage it I managed a lot of similar accounts before there was gonna prepare me for it but that that is security prep you know kind of creeped in and I said maybe I'm young and I'm not you know too mature or maybe I'm younger maybe I'm not you know presentable enough maybe you know I'm not gonna do a good job you know as women we tend to look at like a job description if it doesn't fit a hundred percent of like exactly what we can do we oftentimes like okay so I can't do it but I put all that aside and I forced myself to stand and at least look um is secure and I told him you know I think I can do this and this is why and he looked at me the same series and said this is not happening and I was crushed it was it was tough but a few months later things were not going so well with the account we were three weeks before launch and piloting this huge pilot with Starbucks which is a pretty big company I'm from Israel so I didn't know um and so things we're not going well no one is really owning you know they account and they needed someone to move to Boston in the winter for three months so obviously I became the base choice for the job and so I took it on I didn't ask him any questions and I took it on and I moved myself and I made it work I hired amazing people I made sure everything is Matt the account is super happy we're meeting all of our goals and I just you know really really you know kind of crushed it to the point where we signed the biggest agreement that we ever had in our company's history and really changed you know the the future and what we were doing as a company so later on in that same boss called me up a few years later asked me to be a founding team member at lemonade is it the right one oh not yet and lemonade and and I was kind of his first pick his first hire that he that he asked during the company he's now a mentor to me and and someone I consider one of my good friends and so I guess just gonna go back and circle if you look at that chain of events it all started with me being super insecure not wanting to put myself there but kind of putting that aside and and really replacing insecurity with action and I think that's something we need to kind of think about it that small action we actually started the chain event that led me to where I'm at today and so when we think about as women you know each person can call it a different thing I call the imposter syndrome call it whatever you want just acknowledge it that this is a baggage that you're taking with you and then put it aside and just really force yourself to feel you know feel uncomfortable and feel insecure but go after things that you feel like that you know that you can do that you feel like that you deserve and when we ask for more we get more that's just a simple equation so thank you very much [Applause]

"Back yourself"- a phrase that has described many situations in Chelsea's life. She tells the story of being a relentless fighter from being bullied in elementary school, through her career today. Hear how she advocates for others while backing herself.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
so my name is Chelsea Cooper and I am an SVP and Oscar health the insurance company I'm sure you've seen the ads during Oh II around New York and I oversee our members strategy and operations there so I've married a Scott and one of my favorite expressions that they use in the UK is back yourself and it and it refers to essentially a play that you run when you're when you're playing rugby and you can't quite get the you can't quite pass make a pass and instead what you do is you take it and you run it down the field yourself and try to score and if you think about if you think about that there's a lot of meaning packed into that it's about self confidence it's about advocate advocating for yourself it's about really leaning in and being fearless and everything you do so we've heard some incredible incredible stories tonight from these women and while I don't know many of them well I've got to imagine that they will have had to really live eat and breathe that phrase those two words back yourself in order to get to where they are today so when I was 8 years old growing up in a place called Worcester Massachusetts also known as the whoo for folks who are from there Adam Sandler used to do a little spoof on Worcester but growing up there I changed schools and and within a couple of weeks of my new school I found myself being I found myself as the new target for the school bully every day when I walked into class I could really count on and Rena to call me names pick on me all the things that that that bullies do and when you're that young those interactions that you have mean it's your whole world I have two kids now two babies now and I see how those interactions that they have at school really impact everything they do so so those moments when I was little like really mattered and so every day I'd go home you know crying and and really quite upset and and hope that the next day I would have the courage to stand up and this went on and on for a long time for about four years and one of the things that still haunts me to this day is that at that time I didn't tell my parents I didn't really I wasn't comfortable telling my teachers but more more importantly I didn't I didn't have the courage to really stand up for myself well fast forward a few decades and I started working for a new company a new job and we were doing well I had a new team we were kind of killing it and and I remember my boss coming to me male boss and you kind of sitting me down and saying you're you're doing well you're doing really well and I want you to take on all these other additional responsibilities and I remember having kind of that inner sort of stomach ache and thinking oh man I don't I don't know that I can do this and it was so clear and in that moment that he really believed in me and I think somebody else kind of shared a similar story but he believed in me more than I believed in myself and and so was was really advocating for me even when I didn't I didn't have that yet so one of the things that I found myself doing more and more though over kind of middle of my career was was was finding those opportunities to start advocating for others and I don't know why it is that I found it easier to advocate for others but then advocate for myself and I think it's something that is women we do a lot of and so I there were all you know there were a number of moments I can think about where I would see talented women and you know one comes to mind in particular where I was working in a new role with a new team and I had someone who was maybe a little less confident a little shyer on the team in fact she was powering all of the like analytics and dashboards that one of the the men on my team was actually getting credit for and when I kind of dug in and uncovered it and and realized pretty quickly how talented she was I just kept on putting more and sort of more on her plate she probably didn't thank me for it at the time but but putting more and more on her plate it was because I just totally believed in her and it was it was kind of that same thing that I had seen from my male boss years before believing in me and so I would shove her to speak in front of her whole company I would shove her to go have lunch with our CEO and I would shove her to talk to our leadership and and it it really I think you know helped her and ultimately she just crushed it as I knew she would and and I thought the company was really better off for it so so I found myself advocating for others but really there was a sort of pivotal moment when I just through sort of all caution to the wind and and just decided to just kind of go for it I was mu I moved back to London for business school I had married married a Brit and I was going to London Business School and maybe about six months in an old friend from San Francisco got in touch with me and he is us-based ride-hailing app was taking off uber and so Travis asked if I would help first year at Business School if I would help launch Guber in the UK I said remember going out to dinners with him over the course of I don't know four or five months trying to introduce him to many other friends that could do this for him and said look I just moved here I've got my life I've just got married I'm starting business school sort of no thanks and and finally at one point sort of towards the end of my first year I ended up you know kind of going out and finally was convinced that I should do this and I just said you know what I've got Business School but I've also got this great opportunity I don't know how I'm gonna do it but I'm just gonna do it and I'm gonna do both and so over that summer between my first and second year I launched uber in the UK and then during my second year of Business School was running it while also juggling a sort of full course load and it was that moment where I was incredibly like nervous I didn't know if I could do it all of those things that I just said screw it I'm gonna just go for it and it was one of the best sort of learning experiences I've had and and fundamentally changed the way that I think about things and so I guess from sort of my my if I could leave folks here with one thing it's when you find that that like stomach ache those like inner feelings that are telling you don't do that thing or there's no way I can handle it especially the women out there those are the times that you have to lean in and you have to just jump in both feet and really go for it and also if you notice folks around you who again especially women don't have that on their self-belief that's when you have to I don't even think it's pulled them up I really think it's about shoving them shoving them telling them they gotta they gotta do it I don't have an option I mean the women on my team know that way they know and I'm I'm just kind of forced them to do things but altum Utley they come back and they're better off for it I think I'm better off for it and actually I think our our companies that we work for are much better off for it so thank you all you

Alexandra tells the story about the loss of her father and how after his death, her dad‚Äôs doings while alive inspired her to rethink her life‚Äôs direction and inject a higher purpose to it.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
um Alex or Alexandra and I'm gonna talk tonight about taking risks and an experience that inspired me to do so many years ago so I'm gonna try not to cry but maybe I'll cry and it'll be fine four years ago my father who was 65 years old or something got diagnosed with cancer so we're all together for Thanksgiving we got the news and four months later he was gone so we're not gonna talk about that's not story but something that at the time I didn't think would really like impact my life and like inspiring me to like make a change ended up doing so a few weeks after my dad passed away my mom asked me if I could help her with something so she set that before my dad died he left a business transaction pending so someone would owe him money if the transaction went ahead and that she would receive the money if you know that was came to fruition and so she wanted me to find this John Doe and make sure that he stuck to his word so I'm like okay well I don't know this John Doe I think I met him once like a few months ago when I was visiting my dad while he was sick but I'll figure out a way to get in touch with him so I remembered that many years before my siblings and I had helped my dad to create his first ever email account so we decided on hotmail.com because it was very hot at the time and we created a password that all of us could remember because we were sure my dad would want to access the account from our computers and then he wouldn't remember the password so we settled on something easy and I was sure all these years later maybe like 13 or 15 years later that there was a very slim chance that he had changed the password so I opened my computer I put in hotmail.com I hadn't been there in a very long time put in the credentials acess first try I was inside his email right it's kind of creepy you know it's the email of a deceased person you don't know where you're gonna find but it's not a story about that so I find this like 10 of emails of like Facebook asking him to come back and find what his friends are up to and Linkedin telling him about the friends that got the new job and Dropbox being like you have like a new file or something I'm like this is weird so I have to find John Doe right that's what I'm in there for I search his name I find him and I start typing a message from my dad's account because I figured that's how he's gonna open it cuz he's like oh sure who's writing to me right now I hit Send and then I'm just waiting maybe he'll reply pretty quickly I'll just leave the window open I'm waiting have you ever found someone else's email or Facebook open and your computer's anyone what do you do do you just like close it I mean at this point I'm like maybe you should clean up those Facebook messages you know you never know it'll just like get super full over the next years and they'll just close his email so I started cleaning them up delete all those spammy messages and then his last messages just rise to the top I'm like oh there it is that's the very last message he responded to February 14 2014 this is like eight days before he was admitted to the hospital to never return home so I'm like wow look at my dad he was still going at it it was a business message I didn't realize what he had been through those days because I live almost 3,000 miles away from home I grew up in Tijuana Mexico so that's really far I didn't get to experience the last days with him or my family get an idea of what it was like what was he doing during the day while he was like sick and not feeling well what are you still working which is amazing very inspiring like what was he writing open the email this email was to a business acquaintance but my dad was super friendly he would call him like a very dear friend I knew who the guy was I was like he spent two lines talking about this like business deal or something and then he changed the topic abruptly and he wrote topic my health I'm in this fight the good news is I have great care from my wife my son my sister and a nurse friend could can who can occasionally tend to me when I'm not feeling well I started crying it was like holy like he was expressing something in such few words and I don't think he ever really shared that with us I don't think he really told us how he felt about the care he was receiving or how grateful he was about it or how positive he was about things even just eight days before he was readmitted to the hospital he passed away like 12 days after that message he probably didn't expect his life to end so soon and none of us do really so it really shook me I was like I think I missed a huge chunk of what happened to him and my family by being so far away so I kept going I kept reading the messages I figured this is the best way I have to understand what happened so I keep scrolling and I find more business messages messages from family members like sending him articles about the left latest miraculous cancer cures and emails with to me and my sister who don't live close to home I couldn't stop it was just like this window into his heart what he was feeling the deepest messages were the ones who were his friends of faith people that were really supporting him with faith in these hard moments and they were the toughest because he would share how scared he was and he said he was scared of being alone and I felt so guilty like I'm so far away he feels alone like what's going on right but then I read a message that really inspired me it was a message to my sister and he he wrote something that just completely changed the course of my life he wrote to her in a really short email you build the road by moving along never give up four months after that I moved from New York City to San Francisco left my comfortable job and joined other three Italian co-founders figured out the Mexican and three tally ins to start a sleep technology company no one thought we would be here no one thought that what we were doing was a viable business that we could survive that we could get anywhere that no one would fund this people foreigners with accents like who are you and here we are building the road as we move along and not giving up and that's what I hope that all of you get out of this is something in your life will inspire you one day to do whatever you want to do maybe it's start a company maybe it's write a book maybe is run for a class president or like we're gonna nonprofit or switch from teaching to like being a media producer you never know just stay close to the people that inspired you the most and really watch out for their accuse in their words and care for your words because they can be in cyberspace forever and you never know who they're going to inspire thank you [Applause]

Adena has always lived her life in full throttle. She leaves it all out on the floor, puts her everything in to whatever she's doing, but not at the risk of her heart and soul. Here she tells the story of her Senior Year campaign for class president.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
hello I'm Adina Jones I was actually married in July so we're working on that that name chasing it's like the hardest thing ever so in an an I work at bleacher report and the deputy managing editor their editor there and in an effort to get ready for this event I did what any great journalist would do I procrastinated I learned the lyrics to cardi B's bar da cardi I got in not one but two fights with my husband my even research one of those like really swaggy rehab facilities in upstate New York where like rich women go just to get away from the world because you know they're just they're just tired because let me tell you something I am tied I'm tied I'm not like I didn't get eight hours of sleep last night tired or I did have enough vegetables in my diet tired I'm like fannie lou hamer sick and tired of being sick inside I'm sick and tired of the microaggressions um we you're just not a good fit for the team you know just the cultural fit I feel threatened when you speak to me can I touch your hair what is the URL for black Twitter I'm tired I'm tired of the judgments you look like you could [ __ ] a dude up like you lift right or I bet you had athletic scholarship to school right you definitely did I'm also tired of the judgments the random judgments the 10 things every woman in their 30 should know [ __ ] I only know two and a half of these okay and I'm also women with bigger but should be more intelligent well I should be a Rhodes Scholar with all the the educational background I got going on in here so you know what it is what I'm realizing why I'm tired I'm life is happening to me and I'm letting it like judo chop me in the throat I saw some grandpa's from an influencer selling flat tummy tea and I was like life is 10% of what happens to you in 90% of how you react to it has shock fits bow hashtag love and light hashtag hashtag hashtag and you know I was like actually I'm feeling what this person is saying you know I'm I'm moving too fast you know I'm I'm always trying to be the best never settling for less striving just leaving it all out on the floor every day that's why but how was it me me a strong black woman me the product of a sharecroppers son from North Carolina letting this affect me how is it me the product of a bougie black woman with a biology holding degree that will cut you in her finest fur how is it that I'm letting this affect me like I said I'm moving too fast a quick jog on my memory will hi remember the first time that I just left it all on the floor so my shirt says from Brooklyn but my mom did me the favor and moved me out to Brent were in high school for a better education at some point in time and I ran for senior class president and I was gonna win this year the only problem was I lost every other year every damn year I ran for class president I lost but this year was going to be different I was gonna give them Obama change they could believe in they didn't know what they were in for I was pulling out all the stops fliers was my name on it and endorsements when the popular kids check buttons with my face on it check poster boards in every hallway check and was we doing a cupcake giveaways at the end of every class period hell yeah we were doing that check so that my piece de resistance what it was is I had a group of the sassiest chicks at Brown when high school had to offer they were my campaign team and yeah I know right campaign team you know and I had a girl from every walks of life we had the funny girl the popular girl the I do recreational drugs girl the I'm from Queens and so that means I'm better than all you Long Island girls and every Wednesday it was campaign day we wore t-shirts red and white baseball tees that shout out to my dad for getting them for free 99 and my mom for helping me bring them to school and there on the front they said you know you want to and on the back and said vote for Edina so yeah I wasn't we were going hard every Wednesday we preached the gospel of how great a dina was going to be we were gonna do principal for a day we were gonna do school trips to Six Flags you're gonna air your grievances to the administration it was on we were gonna leave everything on the floor if I lost this year it wasn't because of what I didn't do it's because of what they didn't do we were leaving it all on the floor everybody voted in their eighth period government class I fought like to the to my school bus I was like yeah I got this we want this we left it all on the floor it's what we do get on a school bus kids are like hey you vote today they talking each other yeah I voted today who did you vote for I didn't vote for that Dina girl she's stuck up Wow like since when did representing yourself become stuck up since when did doing any and everything you could do to win become stuck up no actually they they were wrong they were just outliers in the sea of yes votes for Edina next day homeroom is where we announced the winner after all the mundane announcements track practice pools closed all that stuff we got to the announcement for senior class president and your two thousand was three two thousand three senior class president is not Adina nice those are just an eighth of the emotions I felt running through my body twenty kids my whole room staring at the back of my neck I know they wait for me to react you know what not gonna react instead I'm gonna go to my locker and cry on the phone with my mom just talk about how stupid everybody was I I I'm not any actually sure when I got out when I got over the loss of my election honestly I'm probably still salty about it congratulations to mark Parker he won and but the one thing that I did rest easy with was that I did everything I could right I did everything I could if I go back today I wouldn't change it for the world I left it all out on the floor and honestly it's kind of how I live my daily life sometimes to my detriment because when you go out a hundred what do you have left but that's me every day in every moment I'm just there trying to prove trying to grow trying to live you best believe if I'm in a room with you you're going to get the best of me and I'm gonna take every single piece of juice I can squeeze out of that moment but the fact is that as I grow I'm learning not I'm leaving it all on the floor but I'm not leaving my self-worth I'm not leaving my sanity that's the biggest thing I'm learning to self-care self-care means untime runs in the park self-care means deep conditioning and detangling my new natural hair self-care means bottles of rose a self-care sometimes it just means staring at the clouds you know so I'm always gonna be that girl that woman who goes a hundred percent and a hundred miles per hour but I'm always gonna continue to learn to give myself grace in those quiet moments in the locker room and I hope you do the same thank you you

Through the years, she worked insane hours and it took a toll on her family life. Finally, she decided she decided to take on Citymeals and has never been so fulfilled.

thank you that's me that's Shapiro I'm the executive director of City meals-on-wheels quick question how many of you live in New York I can see hands how many of you were raised in New York much fewer I'm with the hands down people I am North Carolina raised by Brooklyn parents Brooklyn and who said North Carolina all right um graduated college sold my car moved to New York with $500 in my pocket to find my fame and fortune I wanted to go into advertising I wanted to do account management it took a very brief amount of time to get my first job at Ogilvy as a receptionist not what I wanted but I needed money I took the job and to get into account management I had to be a secretary so I'm older than 40 and I'm older than 50 that dates me was on an old time typewriter ten fingers really slow I could do it now I couldn't be a secretary because I couldn't type fast enough but if it was all thumbs now I could do it I practiced I practice it was not going anywhere very wise woman our CFO started chatting with me and said we have an opening as an account a coordinator and I thought this is not good the only class I nearly flunked a chapel hill was accounting so I thought I had to tell her I knew I had to tell her because she was making a huge mistake and she said you can do this like all right here we go she's like it is your only path around typing so I did it and I was pretty good at it and it helped me learn the financial underpinnings of a small organization which I now know is quite important worked my way through past accounting and finally got into account management where I was doing what I wanted to do working with clients helping with marketing and communications and it was great we're a 50-person organization at the time 23 of us were let go in one day I was one of those 23 not only did I not have a job I had just charged a trip to the Bahamas on my brand-new American Express card for my boyfriend's birthday so I had to pay for it figure that out found a job quickly bounced around for several years large agencies small startups before there were startups and realized at some point that it was a very crazy life my kids were quite young I was living in Westchester my husband would put them in pajamas drive them into the city to say good night to me and take them back home my daughter's here she can attest to that it was not fun and I knew quickly that I couldn't do it I left went to an agency up near home in Westchester and was incredibly happy eight years working with the smartest people I could ever work with but along the way killer hours still not insane but killer I had clients in London account in California at the same time so bouncing through time zones I think traveling my daughter probably has could tell you every guilt gift from every work trip that she ever received and I knew I didn't like selling other people's stuff I wanted to do something with more meaning there was more dysfunction it was time for me to go I spent two years trying to get a non profit job nobody thought my skillset matched what they needed and it was hard I left without a job thinking all right I can focus on this six months of searching in front of the computer or sweats trying not to eat the pint of Ben and Jerry's while the kids were at school trying to figure out what I was gonna do if this didn't work and another woman took a chance on me the founding executive director of City meals-on-wheels was looking for a director of marketing and communications I got a job I thought it was going to be a piece of cake the skills translate they did I thought it would be easier and it would be a softer environment it was a business it is a business and needed to be treated like a business and I learned that quickly five years later I took over as executive director city meals is feeding homebound elderly New Yorkers people too frail to shop for themselves 60 and older 200 of them are a hundred years old or over in this city yes it is crazy and they will tell you it's crazy if they're over a hundred but I have never been more fulfilled the path was not straight I have met the people who built this city for you and me and that was what was so meaningful for me I did not have affinity towards older people when I was young my parents grew my grandparents died when I was a teenager there was no connectivity and that changed so quickly I have met Mary who rode the elephants in Ringling Brothers yep Frederick designed the first leather bomber jackets for the NYPD and Mamie is my favorite my very first meal delivery going out with a photographer to see what we do we were in Brownsville Brooklyn where my dad grew up not great when my dad grew up and not so great now Mamie had lived there most of her life her husband and daughter only daughter had passed away her shoes were held together with duct tape she lived in a small dark apartment and she was too afraid to go outside even if she could but she had a sparkle in her eye and we're sitting in her kitchen and the photographer brought the camera out and she sat up straight cocked her head to the side and said should I strike a pose that picture is still in my office to this day it has changed Who I am and moves me on a regular basis when I look back and think 30 years ago would I have ever realized or thought that I would feel so fulfilled in my job I don't think I would have but I've learned a few things the path is not straight the finance job was the best thing that could have happened to me to be where I am where I am now and to have that knowledge I had great people who believed in me sometimes even before I believed in myself I mentioned two women there were a lot of other women there are a few men in there too but to find people to mentor you I believe that success does not come simply from hard work it comes from trying to deliver excellent work because excellence is what breeds success and I think but yond anything else it is to be genuine and true to who you are I am a little bit kind I say that's the North Carolina still stuck in here after 30 years but I've also realized I don't have to be an ass to be a leader in New York City even thank you it's true but to rely on your circle to find your people and to be true to who you are thank you [Applause]

Sarah tells the story of her journey from being fresh out of college and a special ed teacher in the Bronx to being in Charlottesville covering the Unite the Right rally with her small film crew. These vastly different experiences taught her to be flexible.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
all right boof okay cool hey everyone my name is Sarah singer I am the executive producer of mic mic is a digital news company that's what we are for digital is coming okay um why I'm here to tell you guys today is this kind of crazy kind of weird story that started on August 12th 2009 that was just a few weeks after I had graduated from college I was getting myself so pumped up I was getting ready to enter what was going to be my first year as a special ed teacher at a high school in the Bronx five years later August 12 2017 I was in Charlottesville Virginia with a small film crew covering the unite the right rally which going down there we thought it was going to be this small little thing turned out to be as I'm sure you all know the alt Rights kind of emergence into the mainstream at least into the mainstream news cycle nina's needless to say I'm really short I'm a petite person and I'm a Jewish woman it was a good fit it was the right story I was welcome there um but those were just about those were five years apart or four-and-a-half years apart um four years apart and oh my gosh what a journey that was from being a special ed teacher by bit my classroom was in the basement to what is now running a video team of mic we are in the 82nd floor of the World Trade Center what a journey so when I'm going to tell you guys tonight are three lessons that I've learned that actually I learned as a teacher that have made me a better professional out of made me a better manager that I think about every single day and this is about that evolution number one and this is gonna sound obvious but this is not this is this is harder to do this is harder to do than it is to say be flexible I studied English in call literature major love writing love student journalism all the things with words nonfiction fiction you name it poetry so when I showed up the day before the first day of school but the day before my first year as a teacher I got my class rosters at my class schedule and I was teaching two classes of earth science this was this was special this was not perfect I actually had never taken geology myself so this was this was the moment this is the moment of reckoning my mother in the room can say there were lots of Tears there was lots of panic there was lots of not chillness but I was stuck with this schedule that kids were coming in in 12 hours what was I gonna do we got it we got a roll we got to teach some earth science so that was it like I was teaching I so this was a high need school and we're not gonna go into educational policy right now but the upshot of it is there was no curriculum I was teaching us all to self-contained classes which just means that 8 to 12 kids varying levels of needs everything from learning disabled to developmentally disabled we were teaching regions level earth science this was not an ideal situation for anybody in the in the room but we we rolled and my god did I become obsessed with her science so that that experience III finished that first year of teaching thinking I could do I could do anything I think you take an English major and plop them into geology with students who are special-needs students are amazing people and just like amazing learners just it's it's very hard sometimes to break down material in that way we're gonna make it work okay so the upshot of it is be flexible how that had Mike which used to be called policy Mike in the four and a half years that I worked at the company I was we were counting this just at dinner right before this event I had seven different seven different jobs in the past four and a half years and I'm sure the folks who worked in startups or entrepreneurs or have worked in very like quickly growing companies can kind of like validate that experience or it can live that and as somebody who was a writer and an editor of words who's transitioned into visual journalism and video and self-taught editor of motion graphics and of you know just film in general oh my god we just roll okay so that's number one be flexible number two and this is where we get a little Zen this is the idea of embracing the whole you right and at face value being a special ed teacher and being an executive producer are two completely different jobs but pull off one layer and what you're doing is telling stories and you're connecting with audiences and the same skills that enable somebody to be an effective teacher breaking down new information figuring out what's gonna make it exciting to somebody relearning it yourself knowing your audience an earth science class for example is gonna look different at the college level than it is at the high school level and it is at the middle school level those are the exact same kind of skills or like practices that we have in journalism right the content is different but the goal is the same break down stuff happening out in the world figure out who your audience is how can you best translate what's happening in the world to that audience and how can you can you know debate them to action so rather than looking at the differences between these two jobs and saying oh my god I'm gonna discount all that education stuff and start and start from scratch as a journalist and rather than kind of putting up barriers around our different careers whether they're at the same company or at different companies using those to your divergent paths or like the unique experiences that make you you and turning those into a collective kind of like whole self and that whole self that can only be you that's what makes like I feel my co-workers that Mike's a teacher Singh my last name is singer you're saying teacher saying teachers how to do video teachers had to do whatever and like that's the realness because I channel so much of that same practice that I did in the classroom as I do at my job now and like that's the that's what makes me me and that's the whole the whole you the homie okay great number three here we are this is the now this is the real Zen one this is the one that I'm most excited about and this is this is the idea of finding your daily Zen and this is the hardest thing especially as in startup world it is the hardest thing to do because startups are roller coasters some days are the best thing some days are the best days ever we're making it we nailed it our company's the best no problems like everything's perfect some days are the worst oh my god it's all ending we're done like this is the last day I'm so sorry I'm so sorry everybody we tried really hard I'm at peace with it okay so the up the upshot of this is I'm going out on a limb a limb here but I think like I know this is something that I worked really hard at as a woman and I think many women in the room can kind of empathize with like we hold on to a lot of stuff like we're it's very it's very kind of like intuitive to say to know roast over something that happened yesterday to just like not get past something that a co-worker said that you're so annoyed about like oh my god he or she must hate me oh my god like I really messed up three hours ago about this thing or become so super like preoccupied with something that could happen three weeks from now if I do this oh what's gonna happen then what what am I gonna do like what's this person going to say about me if I do this or whatever whatever okay like neither of those neither of those are happening now you can't change what happened yesterday and you have no idea what's going to happen three weeks from now so embracing the day and saying I'm in charge of today and all that I could do is create the waves I'm the captain of my ship we used to say this in the teaching in the teaching world as a teacher you're the captain of your ship but you also make the ocean right you create the environment in which you're really going to be kind of like navigating and I think that that's something that I think about all the time every day leading this video team and having gone through lots of different of policymic to Mike and all of that stuff you really I mean it's it's up to you how to best leverage there was ten hours or eight hours or seven hours or whatever your workday is and don't get preoccupied cuz like that's so that's it like the dailies I don't live your life that's it bye [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

Growing up, Susan avoided labels. Labels meant limitations and assumptions. She explains being raised by Korean immigrants and how they taught her to keep her head down, work hard and someone will notice you. But then, after the election, she realized that her lack of labels made her self identity a little fuzzy.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
happy International Women's Day I noticed she got applause for that so I'm totally that was applause bait right there so thank you hi my name is Susan Lee and I am the head of people at Warby Parker I am a woman so I'm a woman I'm over 40 I am a person of color I am korean-american I'm a feminist I'm a Democrat I am a Southern Californian I am an unapologetic year-round rose a drinker I am a snowboarder and I'm waiting for the plus I'm a romance novelist growing up labels were something that we're not a good sign for me it basically meant limitations to the opportunities I have for my life so I always thought about I don't want to be labeled I don't want people to make assumptions about me I don't want them to take away what I'm working hard for when my parents emigrated from Korea my dad came here and he registered and his first thought was he was going to register as Charles Lee le IgH because he did not want the name to make it seem like he was any different than anyone else thankfully they didn't allow him to do that because I loved my last name even though there was like a million Susan leaves if I go to Sephora there is like last name I'm like no no email when I started school I was learning English and talking to my teachers and my friends and when I came home my parents only spoke Korean to me and I knew they knew English they had broken English and heavily accented but it wasn't till a few years later that I realized they never spoke English to me so I once asked my dad I'm like dad I'd love to practice your English why don't you ever want to talk to me and he said I don't want you to learn English with an accent I don't want anyone to pick up the phone and talk to you and assume that you're any different than any other person I grew believing that I was American I very rarely identified as Korean American when I was there in third grade I wanted to play a sport so we went to line and it was I went in the line for Little League baseball and when I got to the front of the line they said actually girls softball is in that field over there and I pitched a fit I said I don't want to play with the big ball I want to play with a little ball with the boys and I started screaming and my dad said to them this doesn't say boys Little League it just says Little League even though you call that girls softball so they allowed me to play it was the only girl in Little League I wish I could say I hit all the home runs and stuff but that doesn't happen that's fine it's totally fine I would take the twins where we can get him so when I was ready to graduate and I was about to go to college they said what do you want to study what do you want to be and I'm like well what are my options and they're like well if you want to be successful you have to be a doctor a lawyer an engineer or a businesswoman and I was like that's all my options okay I'll be a doctor so for five years I studied biochem almost flunking out probably every year knowing there was no way that I was going to go to med school and and it was really because I didn't feel like I had options I didn't know about HR I didn't know about marketing I didn't know about supply chain or PR or any other opportunity out there for me when I graduated I took a job as an administrative assistant when they gave me the phone list it wasn't off abetik oh it was listed by your hierarchy and I was all the way at the bottom and I'm like I don't want to be at the bottom of this list so anytime an opportunity came up I'd say I'll do it I'll change the lightbulbs I'll fix the printer I will fix the network that works the printer and when they notice that I was willing to do anything they sent me to school and I became a network engineer network engineer I know now I'm an HR story for another time the next two acts but eventually in 1999 and I'm thinking most of you weren't even born then but in 1999 there was a time in the world where Microsoft ruled this world and came this phenomenon called y2k where Microsoft thought that because their calendaring and their system wasn't able to flip to the year two and they're worried that all the systems were gonna like break so my company sent a bunch of us to third-world countries to look at their network infrastructure so I was sent to Kazakhstan this was before Borat I may I put Kazakhstan the map not Bora so I went to Kazakhstan and they told me when I was there you have to be very aware of two things you're a woman and you're an American and this was before 9/11 so it wasn't that they had bad feelings towards America it was actually as a woman in American I was at highest risk to be kidnapped to be become a bride a blushing bride and taking bringing my husband back to America so all of my life I shunned labels I just like F that I don't believe in any of this I'm gonna break these labels they don't belong to me I don't identify this way the one label or mantra that I live by is put your head down work hard don't cause any trouble someone will notice and you'll climb your way up that's basically how my parents raised me don't cause any trouble put your head down work hard someone's gonna notice and it's exactly how I got to where I am today then November 2016 happened and I won't make this political but I already told you whether what I vote but Donald Trump was elected president and it was a new administration in the White House and suddenly all of these things that I took for granted what I look like my gender my age my pay rate were in jeopardy I could be a target for any number of discrimination or the way that people saw me and I realized that because I never labeled myself I didn't know what I was gonna stand for what I was willing to fight for what I was gonna March for I just never thought about that stuff i shun labels so only feminists march in the women's March or you know it's like only LGBTQ people go to Pride and like I just didn't think that any of that was for me and what's crazy is I've you know told him over 40 that this realization that I didn't know myself happen only two years ago so I told mentioned that I'm a romance novelist I'm actually started as a romance reader and at Warby Parker were big readers and we talk about books all the time and in my interview with our CEO he said hey what are you reading and it's a classic interview question for us if you're ever interviewing remember that one be prepared and I thought I need to say something really smart so think of a leadership book a nonfiction book what is it what is it and my mind was blank and I and I thought you know what I gotta come clean because if he hires me in two weeks later he says he had that book turned out I'd be like oh good so I came clean I told him I'm reading this book it's uh it's called sweet dreams by Kristen Ashley and basically it's about this guy who's a bartender and he's on a motorcycle club and there's this woman who's down and out and she finds her way to this small town and they fall in love I remember to this day the look of horror on his face he was like and anyone who knows him he gets really uncomfortable very easily and it was just just comfort in horror and he gave this laugh and then he said oh well that was unexpected but thank you for your honesty but what's important that I always put out there the reason why I read romance is I deal with real-life situation all day long that's what I do I deal with people all day I get to see the best in people and I also hear the worst about life and what people are going through so when I come home I want to get lost in that fantasy or fairy tale of the billionaire who falls in love with his personal trainer or the over-40 girl single who lives in Soho find some anniversaries but and they live happily ever after the end but what I came to realize that I've been reading romance and loving all of these stories again when I started to recognize Who I am I noticed I don't see myself in these stories very rarely do I see the Korean girl not as fit as she should be look who is a little bit older I don't see that so I set out to change something and decide to start writing them myself so I write what we call them thank you cannot read it so you don't know if they're any good but I write what we call own voices hashtag own voices romance and almost always it's a Korean American protagonist someone successful and someone who you know finds their happily ever after and now I know that people will get to see that but if I never identified or labeled myself a Korean American it wouldn't have mattered if these books were out there or not so currently I'm writing a young adult romance it's about a Korean American teenager she is bullied mercilessly for having small eyes a flat nose for her clothes smelling like fish her parents having broken English but when she turned 16 all of her bullying turns into superpowers so her small eyes can see miles away and her flat nose can smell evil and at the end of the day she saves the world and she wins the captain of the football team so predictable but and I love that I love that I get to tell these kinds of stories where people like me get to be the hero the heroine I can legitimately in all honesty say that this is the happiest I've ever been in my entire life and the reason I think this is true is because I absolutely Know Who I am now if you asked me two or three years ago who are you I would have given you an answer that at least 50 other people in this room would have could have also identified and said yes I can say oh I'm a generally happy person I'm like you know I try to be positive bla bla bla and I mean I like long walks on the beach it's like things that other people could say but if you take the whole of all the labels that I put out and introduce myself as I know that is distinctly me that is exactly who I am and you know if there is my long-lost twin out there with all those same things talk to me later let's drink some wine but I believe this is just me and that makes me super super excited because number one I know what I'm willing to fight for I know what I stand for I know what I going to draw a line in the sand about I know what my ride-or-die is gonna be and it's also just the guideposts on how I want to live and how I want to keep moving forward the stories that I want to tell so I am super excited at the end of this to meet you guys and I'd love to hear some of your labels I'd love to hear what identifies you your identifiers because ultimately I think that brings a lot of connection and it makes you uniquely thank you [Applause]

Jess has been involved in many ventures, but through all of them, she kept one thing constant: where am I going to be challenged the most? She discusses her journey from high school to her current position and how she worked to get there.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
hi everyone [Applause] hi I'm Jess Lee I'm a partner at Sequoia Capital and before this I was the CEO and co-founder of a company called poly in the fashion tech space thank you thank you and then before that I was a product manager at Google Maps back in the days when we used to print our driving directions and carry them around in the car so it's a while back and I think I'm supposed to tell you a little bit about my life story in ten minutes and sort of share some of the lessons that I've learned so I'm gonna take you back to high school I grew up in Hong Kong I was not a very popular kid in high school I was super into art and drawing and anime and manga and my goal in life was to be a go to art school and be a graphic novelist that didn't work out my parents are Asian and they said no you can't go to art school so I did it but I I was I did get pretty good grades so I wasn't right but I maybe I was like if you think about the totem pole and how popular maybe I was in like the 35th percentile of popularity but I was I got good grades and one day one of my teachers my English teacher came to me and she said hey why don't you take the AP English exam and I was like oh but I'm not in the AP English class I I don't qualify it she's like why does that matter and so she encouraged me to take the test because she thought I was I was good at writing and I aced it and I got a five and who cares what my actual AP English score was but I think that was an important lesson for me because that teacher taught me that sometimes there are rules around what the requirements are and how you're supposed to be qualified for something and you don't really meet them but you'd still go for it anyway and so that's what I did and that was a very early important lesson that has carried through the rest of my career so let's fast-forward to college I ended up not at art school but at Stanford where I was really excited I moved this I was moving to the US for the first time and I had been I gotten pretty good grades in in high school in fact I I think I was probably in the I think I was valedictorian at my school but I got to Stanford and I realized that every other kid there was valedictorian for their high school and so for the first time I felt like oh my god I'm so dumb I remember feeling like I didn't understand I wasn't as well-read I wasn't as articulate I was also fresh off the boat I just moved from another country I didn't understand any of the pop culture references or jokes that were happening in my dorm and I just felt completely out of place and I wondered if it was a mistake that they had let me into the Stanford but it was also Stanford that I learned about this thing called duck syndrome and I think it applies not just to Stanford but to all of Silicon Valley where you look at a lake and you see these ducks floating along and they look really peaceful and they're like swimming along but underneath they're paddling furiously and they're working really really hard just to stay stay up and look calm and that's what I realized Stanford was like everyone there felt a little bit like oh I'm not the smartest person anymore I don't get good grades anymore and all you have to do is you have to just work really really really hard and I end up majoring in computer science and I don't think the main thing I took away from my computer science degree was actually any of the theory or the problem sets it was actually the ability to force yourself to work really really really hard and be a duck that's something I've always carried with me because I think in Silicon Valley in particular there's sort of this feeling of like oh how you do how's it going how's it going with your company and there's this pressure to feel like yeah I'm doing great I'm crushing it but nobody's ever really crushing and that was a lesson that I learned at Stanford so I killed myself trying to get my computer science degree at Stanford and it was my senior year I had accepted a job as an engineer at a company called in to it and I was like you know that was my path my parents were happy again that I was not going to be graphic knowledge I was gonna go be an engineer but then I got a call from Google and this is in 2004 and they said hey we would like you to interview for the associate product manager program and I had never heard of a product manager before but because it was Google I was like you know maybe I should just take take the interview and see what happens but I remember feeling really bad about it and feeling like oh man I accepted this other offer like what should I do with my life and so I actually said that to pretty much all sites I just probably not a good thing to say in interview but I just genuinely didn't I mean I hadn't really interviewed very much before so I asked all my interviewers I'm like well you know I I spent four years studying computer science and I'm supposed to be an engineer like should I do this product manager thing and I remember one of my interviewers looked at me funny and then he got up and went to the whiteboard and he wrote two words he wrote sunk cost and he was like do you know what that means and I was like no and he said sunk cost is you've already given up those four years killing yourself for your computer science major and you're never gonna get that time back so you should really just optimize for your future which is really great advice he's like don't think about that don't let the past decide your future just do what you think is best going forward and I was like wow that was a really smart guy my second interviewer was Brett Taylor who was in the house Brett later went on to become the CTO of Facebook and I just remember as I met him he was a computer science major like me smart and just seemed kind of comfortable in his own skin I was like wow I kind of want to be like that I want to be confident and cool and so I just remember thinking like maybe I should just go be near the awesome people and then I will absorb their awesomeness through osmosis but that was a lesson I thought okay I have to go and find beer around the awesome people one of my later interviewers was Marissa Mayer who was at the time a director of product at Google and then later went on to become the CEO of Yahoo but at the time she ran the APM program at Google and I asked her the same thing should I take this job and she said okay well when I look back on my life and I think about all the times I had to make a difficult decision between two paths I always tried to pick the more challenging path because at least I would learn something and I would grow even if I failed so I would encourage you to pick the more challenging path and so I thought about that I thought well I know how to be an engineer that's what I trained for but there's this exciting product thing the sunk cost being around awesome people and doing something challenging so so that's what I did I ended up at Google became early p.m. for Google Maps and I had an awesome time there I learned so so much then one day someone showed me Polyvore I was Polyvore was actually created by 3x yahoo engineers and they it's an app where you can like mix and match products and express your sense of style and it was so much fun I became a heavily addicted user using it three or four hours a night and I decided to write to the founders and give them some of my suggestions and complaints I said hey you know there's this problems can you fix this I have some suggestions and then they wrote back and said hey these are all great why don't you just come work here and fix all this stuff yourself and I was like oh you know I interesting so I met with them and I really liked them and I felt like that was another set of really awesome people that I wanted to go be near and I thought okay when else are you gonna find opportunity work on something that's like you thought you were in love with where the team is really really small and so I ended up going to Polyvore and I remember still again being very nervous about this decision and then when I resigned from Google and I went to talk to the VP of Product Jonathan Rosenberg he said something to me that was very interesting he said don't worry you can always come back and then I realized Google hires like a hundred people a week I could go back right so that was a really important like lesson like when you have that choice between something you know that feels kind of once-in-a-lifetime like you should grab that because oftentimes the other path will still be available to you in the future right so seni way that was another important lesson so Polyvore it was three people when I joined and we had so much to do and I had never managed a human in my life but I just kept volunteering to do things by virtue of being maybe you know I think as a good p.m. what you do is you just try to volunteer and do whatever needs to get done to move product forward so in the beginning I wrote code I wash dishes I answered the phone when advertisers called I wrote our blog just kind of did whatever because I was the worst engineer on the team and I thought hey you know if there's something that needs to get done I should probably let the real engineers write the code and I'll just do the other stuff and over time what happened was I picked up these responsibilities never felt qualified to do them like running marketing but what what I did was I learned just enough to be dangerous and enough to hire someone who was awesome who I wanted to be around me to help teach me how to how to be excellent at something like marketing or sales and so the team grew and grew and grew and fast forward eventually all the groups in the company were reporting to me except engineering because I had hired so many people and it was at that point that some of the the original founders came to me and they said hey you know what we've always thought of you as a co-founder and you've always acted like one so we're gonna start calling a co-founder and we're gonna give you some of our shares and that is an incredibly incredibly generous thing to do and I will say that you know I have been mentored by many great women and by many great men but I will always be grateful to joining Pasha and Guang way for that very very generous act so I became sort of an official co-founder and then eventually I became CEO and as CEO I learned a lot of lessons about startups the primary one is that startups are really really hard and again I felt that duck paddling that duck syndrome because I looked around and I read TechCrunch and I read like all these different blogs and I felt like man everyone else's company is amazing but I have a lot of problems my VP left like how to fire someone like our traffic is down this week like I just felt like was paddling furiously it turns out that that's true of most startups but we just kept growing and growing and growing and eventually we you know through lots of ups and downs I learned a lot about how to be a CEO probably the first I think I'm most important lesson was that the end of the day team and culture matter so much you cannot always control the outcome like you'll go through ups and downs that are totally outside of your control but you're on a clock you have money that you could run out of your funding and you have the patience of your team and if you treat your team really really well and you build a culture and you surround yourself with awesome people who want to work to get they will give you just that little bit of extra time when it looks like you know probably everyone should just leave it's not really working they'll be like you know what I really love this culture and I really love this teens I'm gonna stick it out for another month or two and then you sort of turn the corner and so we we we kept going and eventually we were acquired by Yahoo in 2015 and it was actually a successful outcome but I'm you know I know again the entire time I just felt totally unqualified to be doing that job but it ended very well and so that brings me to today I have thought about what to do next after Polyvore and I realized that all those lessons I learned along the way brought me to where I am today and I decided to go be an investor enjoying the dark side and as I was thinking about that I thought you know maybe should I go do something should I try being a founder again I spent all this time working on being a founder and maybe I would do it like slightly better than second time around and then I thought about sunk cost and I thought about well I could always go back to that right though you know it's now that I've done it once maybe there will be options going forward so I should do this thing that seems more difficult more challenging where I'm gonna grow and learn the most so I decided to go be an investor I chose Koya because I felt like if I'm gonna go and learn the art of venture capital I'd like to learn it from some of the best people every person I met there was more awesome than the next and seemed like there would be a lot of great osmosis for me and then you know one of the things I'm passionate about is helping women in tech I was a female founder working on a product targeted at women and it was hard to raise money sometimes so one of the projects I work on now is this thing called female founder office hours where the goal is to get all the female founders together let go of duck syndrome for a little bit and just like really share the stories of how hard it is and really help problem solve so that's female founder office hours at female founder dot work so that's my story I I don't know what the next chapter will be but I will say that the interesting thing is when I look back on my entire career I have felt pretty unqualified for almost every role that I've ever been in like I never done it before our first time founder first time p.m. first time CEO first time investor but what I realize now is that feeling of being unqualified is exactly what you're supposed to look for I go back to Marissa Mayer's advice and she said pick the more challenging path go where you're gonna grow and learn and learning feels like being totally unqualified so now I think when I think about my career I always try to think about how do I go find that really nauseous feeling where I'm like oh I don't know how to do this it's really uncomfortable and that's really the advice that I mostly wanted to share with the group tonight go seek out that feeling if you feel really comfortable and like you know exactly what you're doing it's probably time for you to do something different thank you [Applause]

Lee Anne's word is embrace. Her story walks us through how she has embraced various situations throughout her career. She starts with her journey to be a lawyer and how she ended up in a totally different industry.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
[Applause] hi everyone my name is Leanne grant and I'm the head of partnerships and business development at brand list but before I start talking about myself I'm gonna turn the tables around and I'm gonna talk about you I want you guys to take a couple seconds now to think about one word and what that word should be is something that's your intention it might be something based on the four women before me and something that they talked about that resonated with you it might be a word that you think been thinking about in your past so I'll give you a couple seconds okay so keep that in your head and I'll share with you what my word is and that word is embrace and today I'm going to spend a few minutes talking to you about that word in a few different ways throughout my career that I found a way to embrace different situations and moments and I'm even trying to embrace how awkward I feel right now so let's go back to when I was 22 I was fried eyed and bushy tailed senior in college and I knew what I wanted to be in life I wanted to be a lawyer I loved and still love law and order SVU Olivia Benson is was and like will continue to be my personal hero I also took a bunch of social justice classes and I have sneaking suspicion that I it might be me who changes the world and so I did everything that you're supposed to do I majored in legal studies I inserted the American Bar Association I studied for the LSAT check check check everything except for one small problem my personality I would make an awful lawyer I have always had a problem with authority I don't like rules I shy away from conflict and I like a lot of change like it's such a bad idea so last number one embrace your personality and what makes you unique and find a career that's going to complement your personality so I'm a that change and I and I was able to move out to San Francisco and work at Google and at Google I learned so many skills sales customer service spreadsheets how to write an email how i'm not we had email quality and they would record here whatever that was the whole thing but I got really good at writing emails and I traveled I traveled around the US I worked in our India office I made amazing friends Julie you're out in the office in the audience thanks for coming and my favorite part of my job was talking to all these tech founders who were using Google's AdWords product to grow their business and I realized from that experience hey maybe I want to be a founder and so I decided to leave Google and I went to business school at Yale I interned at AOL I was back on the East Coast and then I came out here and I was lucky enough to go work at PopSugar which is an emerging media company and there I headed up sales and business development for shopstyle which is an e-commerce site and I for the first time was managing people and I tried really really hard to be good at that I asked him about their feelings and I said cool Hudson and I spent a lot of time with my team but at the end of the day you know we were turning out partnerships and deals and growing traffic and growing revenue and making decks and presentations and sending so many emails we were so busy and one day I was walking to work and I was walking to the Eric's walking the Muni and I love that time of the day I would think about what I wanted to accomplish I would enjoy being outside and I my walk I got a phone call and it was a number I didn't recognize so I cleared the call and I got on the Muni I was talking to my coworkers and that number called again and so I said okay you know it must be important I answered and it was the brother of a guy on a young man on my team and he was calling to let me know that that that his brother my team member had passed away that weekend he was 26 years old and it was somebody that I managed and you know I'm not going to go into the details but it wasn't it was such a hard situation and mighty real from it and we talked about it we didn't know what to do and so I emailed his his brother and his mom when I just said I'm sorry and his mom responded on me almost immediately and she said I just want to thank you I want to thank you for the opportunity for my son to work at your company he was so happy and that's all I ever wanted for my kids is to be happy what an amazing response when you're in the depths of grief for somebody who's probably having the worst moment of her life to thank me to talk about happiness and how many times do I get frustrated at work or something join wrong at home or like you know something small happens and to just smile and to laugh and so that was my second lesson to embrace smile and Bradys happiness so let's all smile or look like so a couple years later I left PopSugar because I was thinking back to my time at Google and how I loved working with all those founders and I thought maybe maybe I want to be a founder maybe it's my time now and so a friend and I got together and we did everything you're supposed to do to launch a company we did user interviews and Industry research and we marketed it and we built a product and we generated revenue and we talked to investors and when things didn't work we iterated them we tried new things and then it just wasn't working that we weren't getting enough customers and we were gonna fail and I I don't fail in fact at one time I was doing an Ironman triathlon and I got in a bike accident and I blacked out and I cracked my helmet and I got up and I finished that Ironman I do not think i I just like I don't quit and this time I had to quit and so that's my third lesson embrace the failure because if I hadn't tried to start a company something I'd wanted to do for someone for so long I wouldn't have failed and so after I brushed myself off got over myself a little bit it was time to look for a new job so I opted my resume I did networking I went into that black hole of stalking on LinkedIn that everybody's done late at night and I realized you know I'm not quite ready to get back into the 50 hours of working I want to do 50 hours of something different I want it I want to become a yoga teacher and so I did 50 hours a week of yoga teacher training and I was learning anatomy and studying Sanskrit in the middle of a downward dog between warrior one and weary Oh - I'd like run out for a phone interview or I'd put my heels on and I'd put on a dress and I'd go for an interview and at the end of that time I had a job and it was not as a yoga teacher I'll tell you what it was in a second and that was my fourth lesson which is to embrace self-discovery take that time even when you're busy interviewing or talking to people or at work and find something new that you're gonna have for the rest of your life and I ended up at Brandis which is where I am now and for those of you who don't know brand this is a new kind of company we're trying to bring better everything to everyone and so what that is is better for you everyday essentials non-gmo snacks clean Beauty compostable tableware tree free toilet paper and the reason I joined Brandis is not necessarily for what it does but for what kind of company it is and it really ties back to a lot of the things that I looked for in my past so I felt like maybe this is my time to really save the world like I wanted to in college and we're trying to bring better products to people and we have a partnership with feeding America so we're probably not gonna save the world but I'm trying to do a little bit of that I also was harkening back to my Google days and I loved working with innovative founders we actually just won yesterday I think Fast Company is one of the most innovative companies of the year and so I love no and so I'm so lucky to work there and I also like the culture we have and we print on all of our products we put people first and it's really about setting intentions like I asked you to do at the beginning and we'll get back to that and thinking about not people's roles and what they do but who they are and last I love I love my role I love business development and partnerships because I get to learn and I get to work on the most interesting thing so new businesses talking to people I don't know a lot of things but as jess was talking about earlier being uncomfortable so that's my fifth lesson embrace learning embracing discomfort so that's my career and that's how I got here today so just to recap the word embrace I challenge you guys to think about ways that you can do that more in your life so embrace your personality figure out what role is right for you and who you are embrace happiness and those moments where you're frustrated try to smile a laugh and try to get somebody else to do the same I forgot my third one embrace failure it's okay to try things and it's okay to fail it means you actually tried embrace self-discovery take some time out and do something for you and last but not least embrace learning try to find a way to learn every single day so I just shared my intention with you and I want you guys to take a second before the next speaker and share your intention with the person next to you and I hope maybe that you can come back to the stage in a couple years and you can share your intention with more people thank you [Applause]

The election of 2017 knocked Valerie down. She knew she had to do something. Valerie tells the inspiring story of how Fund Her was started and her journey to get more women in office.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
good evening everyone my name is Valerie McGinty and I'm the founder and president of funder how many of you out there know already that the California state legislature is comprised of just 22% women Farra number of hands I really can't see but and how many of you know that thank you so responsive how many of you know that that numbers been going in the wrong direction that we're down from where we were a decade ago we were 30% okay fewer hands well I didn't used to know any of these things certainly growing up I was never political and I wasn't really much of a feminist but one thing I was was I was a doer my parents taught me early on the importance of hard work and instilled in me the sense that I was capable that I could do things well you could do that you could do that and not just that I could do things but that my life was up to me so that if I wanted if I saw things I wanted to have happen it was up to me to make those things happen so when I was 8 year old 8 years old I started my own dog walking business when I was 12 I started working at the grocery store and when I was 16 I was working at the bank and I loved the sense of independence I got from work both emotionally and financially I had the feeling that I could handle any situation that came my way I could work with different kinds of people and I've been stocking away the money since I was 8 years old so by the time I was 16 I could buy my first car with my very own money and that was a fantastic feeling I also came from a family with a very strong tradition of female leadership so in my family women lead alongside men and that's just normal but when I emerged from my family cocoon and entered the real world I saw that in fact that was not normal at all or at least it wasn't how the rest of the world operated and we know that women although we're 50% of the population we are 70% of the world's poor we know that women make 70 cents to a man's dollar and if you're a woman of color it's as low as 54 cents we also know that women are vastly underrepresented in positions of leadership so I mentioned or 22 percent of the California State Legislature when you look at the nation's governor's or 10 percent and we're four point six percent of the CEOs of Fortune 500 companies now these numbers are unfortunate not just for women but for all of us because when women are seated at those decision-making tables we make a real contribution we know that companies where women are at least 40 percent of the board of directors outperform companies where there are fewer women we know that women members of Congress bring home on average nine percent more than their male counterparts and we also know that women change the legislative conversation so they bring up issues that would otherwise be underserved or completely ignored they tend to legislate more than their male counterparts on issues of health care education and poverty issues that are critical to our nation's success and so for a while I had been a budding feminist but I still wasn't necessarily political until 2015 when I saw one of the early campaign speeches of Hillary Clinton and I hadn't really heard from her at least on the political stage since 2008 when she lost in the primaries to Barack Obama and in that speech she told us the story she took us from the day that she lost the 2008 primaries all the way to the day when she accepted the nomination to be Secretary of State and she told that story with such openness and wisdom and such a sense of humor I was captivated and as I sat there I let myself think about how that would feel to have the first woman president of the United States for me as a woman for me as a citizen and as a mother of two young daughters what would that feel like I decided it would feel pretty great and so I was all in for Hillary and the last time we saw her my husband and I took our two daughters to one of her final campaign appearances at the Billy Graham Auditorium in October and when we left that event the sense that we were on the edge of something big was palpable and then Trump won and I knew I had to do something it wasn't just that a misogynist with no political experience had won the nation's highest public office whether that wasn't just that but it was also that he had beaten a woman who was possibly the most qualified person to ever run for that office and he had done it with the help of the votes of 62 percent of white women and I thought to myself have we accepted our status as second-class citizens well I haven't because we're not and so I knew I had to do something but what could I do and so I say slowly emerge from my fetal position in the days and weeks following the election one day I remember very clearly sitting at my kitchen table with my dad who was forever my booster forever my collaborator and we were talking about what could possibly be done and as we brainstormed the options seemed to dwindle to almost nothing and I looked at him and I said I can't turn away from this I can't just hand this world off to my two daughters and say well did my best because I haven't not yet and he looked at me with that perfect dad look and it kind of it how are we gonna do this one and then his eyes lit up and he said well how about all the success you've had with California fund raising what if you could do something with that maybe you could get not just one woman but 20 women elected and just like that it clicked and I knew that's what I wanted to do so now I had an idea but what I really do something I mean after all it has to already exist this is California it's a big State someone must have thought of this so I went around looking for the wonderful organization that already existed that I could just write a check to it's gonna be very easy and as I went up and down the state talking about this idea I talked to women who had run and won I talked to women who had run and lost I talked to women who had been in California politics for decades and I said do we really need this I mean doesn't it already exist uniformly they all said oh no it doesn't exist we and we test Ennead it if you can do it you should definitely do it and I thought to myself troublesome isn't it it's so great to just have a whiz-bang idea and then you have to actually act on it it's really the action part is troublesome homework more homework so I thought to myself and then there's that voice inside of me that said who do you think you are who are you I had the vague feeling I was gonna be arrested you know like oh you're starting your own pack for women and but then there was the answer to that voice that said Who am I not to do it and if I don't do it who's gonna do so I knew it had to be done so I thought I mean I'd rather know what it feels like to try and fail than to wonder years later could have done something I don't know I kind of I decided to go on vacation read a book so so I thought I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a go and there we were on the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump's election and we were celebrating the launch of funder and I'm thrilled to report that in the short time since our launch we've been able to help elect already our first progressive woman Canada to the California State Legislature and there's lots more to come but for us it's the idea that we want to help California be the first state to reach gender parity California is first in so many things why shouldn't we be first to reach tender parity I'll drink to that and so there we were driving home from the launch and my 10 year old said to me mom I'm so proud of you you took an idea and turned it into a reality and so can you and I want to leave you with one of my favorite poems that I've adapted it's called it could not be done and it's by Edgar Albert guest somebody said it couldn't be done but she with a chuckle replied that maybe it couldn't but she would be one who wouldn't say so till she tried so she buckled right in with the trace of a grin on her face if she worried she hid it and she started to sing as she tackled the thing that couldn't be done and she did it thank [Applause]

Tanya always wanted to be a dancer. She has loved dance since childhood. After deciding to go in to the restaurant business, she shares how she still uses the art of dance in her day to day life, especially in the kitchen

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
hi everybody oh my god the pressure share your intentions go ahead and share on Sharon I'm Tanya Holland I'm the chef-owner brown sugar kitchen thank you thank you restaurant in Oakland California and I'm gonna let you in on a secret I am a huge procrastinator and what I love about the restaurant business is that I can't procrastinate because I can't be like oh you know I think I'll put that chick in the fridge in a couple hours you know I'm gonna go to that guy's table and if you know a few minutes so the restaurant business forces me to like just do stuff so you know I I was asked to speak to you guys months ago but when do you think I started working on my speech and I know that some of you know me and my story as a chef and entrepreneur and you know I've been speaking a lot out loudly lately about you know being a black woman this business being a woman in this business entrepreneur I don't want to talk about that anymore I'm actually really tired of talking about I mean it's very important and it's something I want to continue to do but I want to do something different with you guys tonight I want to talk to you about dancing and how much I love to dance and how important it is to me and how I think everybody should learn to dance and it's such an important life skill because I mean I do it every day in my work when I cook I dance the soundtrack at brownshirt kitchen is so important to me I'm always listening for music levels there's a lot of songs that you know are my particular favorites but also reminiscent of the cuisine soul food so music but there's also some of my 80s stuff in the mix if you listen closely and you know cooking its and working in environment it's all about dancing you know pivoting pausing marking your next move and just having a rhythm and a balance and being aware of your surroundings I talked about this to my staff all the time they don't seem to quite get it but I think it's just you know too many of those like rage parties yeah it's like it's different I didn't grow up like I danced differently anyways so I also like you know I yeah I'd feel more comfortable improvising than you know talking off script I have my cards over there like a little security blanket just in case I need them but I want to tell you guys that I really I wanted to be a dancer I asked my dad when I was a young girl if I could be a dancer he's like oh no I'll never put a dancer through school I was like ouch really okay and you know this whole conversation is about kind of holding your vision I mean this is you know I consider myself a visionary and I've had this vision for my life for a long time but you just you never know where life is going to take you so you you need to know how to pivot how to dance and later on you know I start going along and I asked him if I could be President and I didn't mean you know president it√≠d States and he's like well you could be which was amazing you know in the 70s he said yeah I could be to his little black girl here's what I wouldn't recommend it he said it costs a lot of money and there's a lot of people blowing smoke up your butt like verbatim he said that it was like oh okay so I don't know somehow I found out what architect was and I said oh can I be an architect that sounds exciting is like man he goes I wouldn't you won't make any money be an engineer so I applied to engineering schools I you know good daughter and I went to school for engineering and I graduated with a degree in Russian language and literature right and that's a longer story we don't have enough time for that but little did they know you know I was dancing all the time so I graduate with this degree and then this ability to dance what am I going to do I'm going to work in the restaurant business that's the only place you can go I used to you know call it the land of misfit toys because it is it's sort of like that place it more so was when I was coming up of where people ended up where they didn't know what they wanted to do or be in life now people intentionally go into the business because it's all romanticized with the TV and celebrity chefs and like I'm a celebrity chef even though earlier today I was like unplugging the toilet and mopping up pig's blood but it you know celebrity so I start working in restaurants and I just fell in love with them and I became a Francophile when I started studying French in ninth grade and my birthday's best deal day something I'm going to France France for cooking school so I go there and I'm in the Chateau and the burgundy and it's wonderful it's great and then the school split up in two semesters so I went to Paris and my French wasn't good enough just work in a French restaurant on the further house so I worked at the Chicago pizza pie Factory and in a black a-frame dress with a name tag and guess what I had to dance I was part of my job description was to dance to greased lightning twice a night that's right and it was all choreographed by the manager but I'm not gonna do it right now but you know I realized so but I got some of the best tips because I know how to dance and you know it's just not being rigid it's about not being rigid and your steps and you know your vision and your work and what you want out of life and just kind of going with it and you know that sort of give-and-take of just the steps so I you know I finished up my time there and I ended up in New York working and cooking dancing on bars you know Dan always going to dance bar it's just dancing dancing dancing and then I ended up in Oakland and I fell in love with it I was going to open up a French Creole Bistro that was what I wanted I love the intersection of African and French cooking and I just thought like this community would embrace that and I did not get the real estate that I was looking for I didn't get the opportunity so I had to pivot I had to you know be really flexible and you know pause for a minute figure out what am I gonna do and I found this space in West Oakland and I thought okay well I guess I got a you know change up the concept make it really accessible this community and brownshirt kitchen was born a happy accident and yeah thank you thank you ten oh by the way just celebrated ten years in business and yeah I'm convinced that it's because you know I have had this ability to just go you know kind of in and out of situations and you know dancing requires you to also be comfortable in your own skin because you know or you can dance like nobody's watching it's like a statement that people say you really have to feel comfortable and I was gonna do some dance moves for you guys but I don't know we'll see if you get if you're lucky you know I grew up the ark was like you know R&B my first concert was Jackson's then I saw the off of all I'm really oh by the way I'm like I'm 52 I'll be 53 this year so I might make I might make some 80s pop culture references that you don't understand but it's okay and you know one of the reasons I want to be a dancer cuz I was obsessed with Fame growing up was just like you know now it's called Glee but it was Fame and I love this diverse population there was a very diverse student body and Oakland's very diverse and it's just what I've been striving for my whole life and I've been able to create that in my restaurant but you know it was like after the Jackson's I was an awesome wall tour and it was like I wanna rock with you oh you guys missed out on like being the rich I know you guys listen to it now but like when it first came out it was great you know and I still play that the restaurant and then you know I get to the restaurant and I've opened my doors and I'm looking around I created this very diverse environment I did not aspire to open a breakfast and lunch place I mean I don't like getting up at 5:00 in the morning but I'm there and but it was all that was available to me at the time and you know I went in there and I improvised and I you know just kind of created something that I thought you know maybe could be sustainable for a while and it has its lasted and I realized one day you know I'm walking around the space and I'm like I'm president of my company and I'm the architect of my environment and I listen to the music I want to so I dance all day long so I thank you I just want to encourage you guys to dance and you know again it's about being aware of your surroundings pausing don't go rushing trying to barrel through it like I know what I want to get to because you don't know what life is gonna serve you and pivoting when you can and being most of all being graceful and gracious and you know as you go through this world because you know we're living even closer together these days and we've got to just be more you know graceful with each other and gracious and polite and you

Joy has always cherished her female tribe. Aunties, friends, mentors. Her story walks us through the importance of women supporting women and a moment where she was not supported by another woman.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
good evening everyone time being the first is not easy but I'm excited I'm joy Pena global diversity and inclusion leader at Electronic Arts I will admit that I'm partially excited because I have a four and a half month old at home so to be out here dressed and dolled up can you make me feel like superwoman right now but I'm also excited because I live for this I love women connecting women with women other women I love sisterhood I I always wanted a sister tribe to be frank since I was young but I only had a brother who was 21 years older than me so I tucked and clay grew up was an only child my mother on the other hand had nine sisters and four brothers yeah that deserves a stage at a later time for storytelling but because she grew up and there being 10 of them right 10 women she always seemed to seek out sisterhood no matter the environment whether it was work Church the neighborhood and so I grew up with women around all the time and many of them not just those who are my biological aunts just women that she had come to connect with I called my auntie's so it was kind of an unintentional gift to understand the power of sisterhood women always in the house laughing and talking connecting on the couch or and the Kitchener on the phone and I think my mother for that I began to then seek that out in our environment myself she also took on someone who was somewhat of a daughter second daughter to her ten years older than me who really became like a big sister to me by the name of Michelle and she's influenced me tremendously to this day and so listen there are countless names that are of women that I could tell you about who have influenced me in very many different circumstances of my life but you won't know their names there is the name of one woman though that I hope you know who left a lasting impression on me and that's Hoda Kotb so hopefully you know Jota hood is right co-anchor of the Today Show well when I graduated from college I was a part of the NBC page program one year program where you really cut your teeth and get to know the business and so I did that and I had a 12-week assignment at Dateline NBC and I was for the most part answer phones offering help on research and different projects and I had heard that Hoda and a few producers were working on a story about Whitney Houston and see Whitney was like auntie in my head you know there's some of these women that I'm like a you know she's auntie Whitney and so I thought I have to work on this project how am I going to work on this I started to offer just help and support and Hoda welcomed it she even gave me time to spend in her office to hear about her journey and for her to counsel my career and to women producers as well who open the door for me anyway the show aired that was about Whitney I was a Friday night and I told all my friends you have to watch this you'll never know that I worked on it but you know I work I I did I gave time to this project so a Friday night it aired as the credits rolling up at the end there's my name as an assistant producer and this is a year after graduating from college and I was blown away I was on my tiny and you know my tiny apartment in New York on the floor literally floored you would have thought I'd gotten an Oscar nomination it was such a moment for me but it loves such an impression on me and to actually add to that not expecting kind of credit for this work as a recent grad in the next week Hoda sent me flowers just to say thank you I know right just to say thank you for contributing to this piece and I was really blown away by that and I'm sure she sent flowers to everybody and I'm sure she would not remember my name but it left such a maybe she does I hear her at her daughter's middle name is joy I don't know maybe I left an impression on her I did but I am so happy that she we had that experience because it's stuck with me and I'd like to say that every experience that I've had with with women and leaders has been wonderful right and I and obviously I'm not someone who subscribes to this myth that women don't support women because I think secure confident driven focused women do support each other and that's been my experience right we do do but I you know will share that I've also had an experience where I didn't feel so supported and it left us much of a lasting impact on me and so when I moved from New York to California about 12 years ago I also transitioned from television production into HR to really do much of what I'm talking about opening the door for others and their opportunities and there was a woman I'd heard about who is really successful in the field that I'm in and had become really you know well-known for it so we had had the opportunity to meet at an industry event and the person who introduced us said you know the conversation was great until he kind of said joy reminds me of a younger version of you and the conversation went cold at that moment and I and that would have been fine you know for whatever the reasons were but I bumped into this this person had a few industry events later that year and in mutual circles folks would try to introduce us and that would go kind of like this so so and so you know joy Kenya right you've met her and she would say did we know did that happen a few times and I think I'm pretty memorable but apparently you know she did not want to acknowledge me right and that really crushed me someone who had looked up to and and really had hoped to connect with and listen I've matured professionally to understand that and I don't want to demonize her to understand that she maybe was having a bad day or a few bad days ah bad season but I I learned not to idolize people we're all human but I also didn't want to be the woman who doesn't see another woman right I really really it birthed in me a passion to do the opposite and so I share both of those experiences because they were that passion in me to connect women and since then when have even been in between jobs I've hosted a few workshops for women on how to network and even had hosted brunches and happy hours for women in my network out in Los Angeles about 30 to 50 women assistant to c-suite level and have heard of so many opportunities that have come out of those connections and so you know you don't have to host a brunch or a happy hour but I want to encourage you to look around you you know who haven't you seen who haven't you acknowledged who can you connect with there's so much power in that quite honestly and you've probably heard this saying I don't think one candle loses its flame by lighting another so if we all encourage each other support each other and champion one another I think that that's a pretty powerful light that we create together so you know I really want to leave you with this and I'm shocked that I have two minutes left because when they told me ten minutes I thought oh my gosh I could tell you a story for an hour really treating this like you're on my couch or in my kitchen but what I want to leave you with this is as you rise women as you rise then to because I see a few good men in the house which is awesome as you rise I encourage you to reach back someone is watching you someone is reach back lift another sister up you know open the door for an opportunity even if it wasn't open for you open the door for someone else with encouragement with advice with experience with knowledge reach back as you rise reach out reach out to your peers they don't even have to be in your industry or your profession I honestly some of my greatest sources of inspiration actually there's a particular group that I affectionately call my lady loves there a ton of us who graduated from college together we are from all different fields and industries and area cities across the country and I have girlfriends out in California as well and let me tell you those group chats are the best height man a girl can use before a presentation and even today I mean they're there you know in their cities waiting to hear how this goes and so you know there's such power in that and that's that's what I encourage you to do reach out as you rise finally I would hope that you also reach up and if there is not a Hoda Kotb to reach back at you if you're blazing the trail then who are the aunties in your head that you can also think about and that you've been inspired by that have amazed you in the ways that they've blaze their own trails be inspired by them as well and so I wish you great success but I also wish you great sisterhood along the journey thank you [Applause]

Anneka never saw herself as a CEO. She started at LiveRamp as an engineer but after being there for a few years, she was asked to become Co-CEO. After some tough feedback and many hard weeks, she has learned so many lessons from the transition.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
[Applause] hi everybody my name is anneka gupta and i'm really honored to be here tonight to share my story amongst seven other incredibly inspiring women I started at live ramp as a software engineer back in 2010 after I graduated from college little did I know that eight years later I would be at the same company leading an organization of almost 400 people as co-ceo back in 2010 we were just a 25-person startup trying to find product market fit and as a software engineer I spent my days hacking away on different projects pulling all-nighters when our sales team decided to sell something that we didn't actually have and through this product process of experimentation and iteration we finally found a product that was going to take us on our first wave of growth libraries and marketing technology companies I'm not going to get into the details of what it is we do or what our initial product was but when we hit that stage I decided that I wanted to move into product management without a very clear idea about what product management really was so I did everything from handling customer support to troubleshooting engineering issues to developing the roadmap of what we were going to build it was super exciting and this was an early time in the company when we were starting to get a lot of customers starting to get a lot of feedback and really starting to grow and I would have continued down that path had it not been for about a year later the woman that was running our marketing team left the company and I really wanted to learn about marketing because as a product manager I had come from a technical background so I had the technical side of being a product manager down but I didn't feel like I had the external market facing side of product management down so I went to the leadership of our company and I offered to help on a few of the marketing projects that were in flight and I had worked with the marketing team before on setting up our website and setting up some of our marketing tools to run campaigns and our leadership team came back to me and said hey you know you can either run a few of these projects or you can run the marketing team while we look to hire someone so I thought okay this is great it could be a great experience for me I'm gonna learn a lot so I jumped wholeheartedly into running marketing without really knowing again what marketing did or was and we were trying to make a hire and first we thought that we were gonna make a hire for the team in about three months it ended up taking us a year to hire someone for the role so I ran marketing for a year and about three months into the role our CEO came up to me and he said hey you know we really need someone to run recruiting and recruiting is a lot like marketing instead of marketing to specific to potential customers you're marketing to potential candidates and people that are gonna join the company so again I thought that this might be a great learning experience for me so I dove into running the recruiting team I ran marketing and recruiting in this early stage of growth for about a year and at the end of the year we hired a VP of Marketing who could really scale our marketing programs and take them beyond the guerilla marketing programs that I had created and the leadership team came back to me and said hey what do you want to do next you can stay on the marketing team and continue to be working in marketing and growing your skillset there you can run our customer support team you can run our HR and recruiting team or you can run our product team and product was really where my heart was at I really enjoyed my year as a product manager and that was really even when I was in college that was a role that sounded just super exciting to me because you got to be at the intersection of technology and strategy and your market message so I decided to take on this role running the product team and I ran product for three and a half years I ran product through our acquisition in subsequent hyper growth stage where our revenues grew from 30 million to 200 million and our team grew from 30 from 70 people to close to 400 people and during that time it was lots of fun I learned a lot and the product was wildly successful but I started to think to myself what do I want to do next where does this where's this going to take me and I knew I could continue down a career in product management and there's a lot of rules now and a lot of opportunities to lead product teams but deep down inside I was not a specialist one of the things that I'd really enjoyed about everything all the twists and turns that my career had taken me was the fact that I got to do so many different things and I got to explore and I got to be a generalist and even in college I didn't want to be siloed to a single major so I chose an interdisciplinary major where I could work on many different take classes in many many different subjects so I started talking to mentors and they asked me have you considered maybe thinking about being a CEO and at first I was a little hesitant and then I started saying yeah okay that's that's what I want to do so I started telling people I want to be a CEO but deep down inside I had huge misgivings about my ability to do this I looked around me at the CEOs I knew the founder CEO of our company his predecessor CEOs that are wildly revered like Jeff Bezos that are Bart Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs and I looked at them and I felt like they were not like me I felt like I had a different personality and I looked at them and they seemed so bold and self-confident and fearless and willing to bet their whole company on a vision of the future that was potentially controversial so I was you know all this was going on in my head and then in August of 2017 about six months ago I got a call from our CEO and he told me that he was going to take a position as a CEO of a startup company a company that he'd been on the board of the company that had just raised a lot of money from Softbank and he felt like that was the right time to move on in my first feeling at that moment was fear because I knew what was coming next we had talked about succession planning and our CEO told me that he wanted me and our chief operating officer to become co-ceos of live ramp and I remember the day that we announced this to our executive team I was so anxious and so scared I was and still am the youngest person on our executive team and I knew that other members of the executive team would think would ask themselves why were they not chosen as a successor why was I chosen over them I also looked at all of them and I knew that they could all do their job much better than I could do their job so what did I really have to offer in the first month and month and a half after the transition I was paralyzed by fear I felt so insecure about what I could do and making any changes that I basically didn't do anything I mean I did my job but I kept things running but I was afraid to make any major changes and then we started to hit a point where morale was beginning to slip within the company and this was due to a lot of things mainly growing pains we had a bunch of longtime live rampers leave the company we had a bunch of product stability issues we got feedback from people that there was it was hard to make decisions and it was hard to figure out who to go to to get things done we had got more feedback that people felt like the leadership team wasn't being transparent about the challenges in the organization and on top of that I got feedback some pretty harsh feedback from some of our executives that now reported to me one executive told me that I was micromanaging him in that if I continued this no experienced leader would want to work for me another executive told me that I was perpetuating politics within the organization so all of a sudden all of my fears and insecurities are pretty coming very very real and I realized that I had to do something so I started acting and I made a bunch of changes I started ruthlessly prioritizing my time I started changing the way that our internal communications were being managed and how we were leading our executive meetings every week and helping us focus on really the big issues at hand versus just the small things that come up every day and the biggest change I made well I started reaching out and asking people for help and this was a big change for me I restarted reaching out to people to help me even if I felt like it was outside of the scope of their job even if I felt like I was imposing on them for by asking for help and even if I felt like I was being incredibly selfish by asking them to do something that I could do myself the last thing I did was I started being very open about my fears and vulnerabilities and this culminated in an all-hands meeting that I led for the company where I was supposed to share my takeaways and learnings from the first 90 days and I decided to stand up in front of the company and talk about the fact that I was really working on trying to ask for help so I went through the top eight concerns that I'd heard from the team and it was all the things I talked about like are we losing our culture what are we having a hard time retaining people all of these things and for each item I talked about what we were gonna do as a leadership team to solve this and I made an ask to the rest of the company about how they can help solve that problem and that was a real turning point because the organization felt heard and I felt like I was really making a difference since then it's not been all rainbows and unicorns there's been a lot of moments of pure joy and there's been a lot of moments of hardship I've had to make really difficult decisions about where to take the company decisions that were incredibly gut-wrenching I've had to hear through the grapevine that people disagreed with some of the ways I did things and attributed that to me being an inexperienced leader however the sum total of these experiences had has made me a better person it has forced me into a continuous cycle of self improvement and it has forced me to face my deepest fears and insecurities my hope in sharing this story with you is that you will be inspired to step into leadership roles that you may not feel ready for even to this day at least a couple times a week I hear the voices in my head that voices up self-doubts voices that question my self-confidence voices of fear and in those moments I tell myself that while the great leaders are remembered by the bold decisions they make there their courage is defined by acting in the face of fear not in the absence of it thank you [Applause]

Anjelika tells a collection of stories that all follow one guiding principle: say yes, and just start. She tells stories about how she jumped in to the things she loved and that's how she is where she is today.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
hello hi I'm Angelica temple as you can see creative human wife to my college sweetheart Dave is somewhere in the middle but of course I can't see mom - baby girl enoki and chief creative officer and founding partner at Britton Co I'm so stoked to be here surrounded by so many inspiring women I can feel the positive energy please send it my way when I was thinking about a moment in my life that could be formed into a lesson what struck me is that I actually have a collection of moments that I would like to share I didn't have a watershed coming-of-age moment that caused my story to change in an instant it's really this collection that all have one thing in common one guiding principle one philosophy that I was actually not aware of until putting together this talk and to get you there I'm gonna take you on a lightning fast version of my life story specifically as it relates to creativity starting with dance recitals living on an artist commune working for the man and then eventually helping to build Britain Co so first my beginnings I was born in the early 80s in New Jersey - Asha and Arvind who had emigrated from Jersey Asha Arvind anyone all right so lots of lots of fans of my parents they had immigrated from India in the 60s and true to Indian immigrant form they were overachievers who came to the states to go to Ivy League colleges my mom had a PhD in psychology from Cornell my dad an industrial engineer from Berkeley we lived in Connecticut they got divorced they each remarried my dad moved to a farm outside Pittsburgh were their miniature donkeys my brother went to college my mom stepped out and I moved to Salt Lake City and then eventually Philadelphia I told you lightning fast okay so I always knew that I loved creativity I didn't really know what that meant when I was five years old I wrote an autobiography on myself and declare that I was a professional artist and author and I quote would use art to save the world from pollution in the same autobiography I declare Guns N'Roses Paradise City the best song of all time not much has changed I did all the normal creative kiddo stuff I took tap and jazz lessons clarinet guitar piano theater camp in the summer then when I got older I added soccer and basketball into the mix when we were 10 moved from Connecticut to Salt Lake City quite a cultural shift that is where I spent my most formative years when I was 12 I had a pretty crazy back surgery because I had scoliosis and had metal rods put on either side of my spine from my neck to my tailbone so dance and sports out painting drawing creative writing in let's go all in on this so then when I was 15 let's move back across the country to Philadelphia right when I figured out who I am so going into junior of high school is actually the worst time to move a teenager so I thought about getting really angsty spending all my time on AOL Instant Messenger but I didn't I decided to just do all the things I decided okay I'm in this super liberal place in comparison with Salt Lake so I started volunteering for political campaigns I took art classes at night I went to yoga in the morning before school which is insane in school I was on yearbook I joined all the different political and art groups I did a large-scale sculpture series it was overachieving but in an odd place to achieve I was also known on the internet for having the largest collection of bootleg bootleg Ani DiFranco concerts so that was another really important claim to fame anyway high school is done I am now going to Middlebury a small liberal arts college in Vermont we have fans of Vermont so if you've been to Vermont in the summer or late fall you know that it is paradise like Adam and Eve level breathtaking in a very cushy lovely spot to find yourself so I did the very practical thing and double majored in philosophy and studio art you know I was like I'm gonna do all of this but it's not gonna make sense so in addition to that I was the vice president of my co-ed fraternity I ran an art club I revived a feminist art magazine called Artemis I had a radio show all four years I met the love of my life who I know is somewhere in the middle and I found my passion creativity now for me this thing around creativity it was not about making things myself it was actually about helping others and empowering people to share their work with the world I thought I would see friends doodling and be like I need to frame that and put in an art show or I need to publish that in my Artemis magazine people humored me and I figured that if I empower the creative folks around me that maybe everyone would think hey I'm creative too the margins of my sociology notes look pretty good so that was my thing i busy bead and I hustled through and I was very motivated by the present but of course I had not thought about the future at all so it's may of my senior year and I have no idea what's happening next like not a clue like so many people at that age I was totally lost I knew I was passionate about hanging out with my friends organizing art shows I was still into Ani DiFranco at the time I still am and Guns N'Roses anyway I digress but I really didn't know what it meant to be creative like what is that as a profession do i intern at a gallery a museum what do I work at an ad agency like I really had no idea what was next and liberal arts schools don't have design and communications degrees it was just studio art and philosophy so um a photographer friend of mine who had graduated the year before was living in an artist colony in northern Vermont she invited me to an exhibition there and I drove two hours north to the tiny town of Johnson a hamlet of creativity nestled in a part of Vermont legitimately called the Northeast Kingdom I parked my Subaru obviously walked onto campus and honestly it is impossible to articulate what it's like to find your place when you're completely lost everywhere I looked artists were flitting about poets writers sculptors painters from all walks of life all ages from all around the world all United to do one thing make art it was like summer camp for adults all year-round and they were grownups and it made sense but it didn't I couldn't believe it was real so I met the founder and he offered me a role as a staff artist in residence in exchange for 20 hours of office work I would get a studio room and board an exhibition space okay so I can be an artist now isn't that an eventually thing like is that real I told him I have huge plans and I'm moving to New York and I need to think about it even though obviously I had none of those plans he paused me and he said I mean what are these big plans what are you waiting for what do you need to figure out you can be an artist now you can just start and that struck me I had never heard someone say something like that and I realized I didn't need permission to do this crazy thing that was on no path that I knew about I could actually just do it so I graduated and I moved to Johnson middle of nowhere I lived in a cottage with three other artists every month 50 new artists would roll in and another thing struck me these people are using their precious time to just work on art some people were funded by nonprofits some people paid to be there but they were all taking time out of their daily life most people weren't what you call full-time artists it was the first time I'd even seen something called a side hustle I don't think that was a term then and it was really inspiring to me that you could work and do it little by little and it didn't it wasn't an eventually thing so I thought artists colonies are now my thing so my husband was but my then boyfriend now husband was about to graduate and wanted to go to New Zealand and work on organic farms obviously I was not I was down with New Zealand not down to just follow a dude and watch him pick cherries so I got online I mean cherries are cool I got online I applied and got a fellowship to be an artist in residence in a studio in New Zealand it was in the middle of nowhere we lived on a farm next to an animal refuge and it was a strange time it was gorgeous and then we wanted to move on so we wanted to make a year of the wandering so we decided to go to India I'd wanted to spend time there besides just vacations and visiting family so again I got on the internet I applied and got a grant to be an artist-in-residence at an artist community called the global arts village outside of Delhi the village was interesting the people were off it was actually to be honest it's a way longer than 10 minutes story and I am like already gonna be over my time so suffice it to say it was a front for a cult a frog died in my room and I escaped in the middle of the night okay so six months later we moved to New York I applied two jobs on monster.com that had that word creative in them I got a job as a creative assistant at an ad agency I decided to work for the man but being in the corporate world did have its perks I got an education stipend to take classes all the time so for the whole three years I was there I took classes at night I took silkscreen I took letterpress clothing construction anything I could do to hone my craft I ended up with my first raise I bought a laptop to build a website and like the Adobe Creative Suite with mine x-rays I got a studio space in Greenpoint and I was working on my printmaking business then three years in 2009 recession lay it off okay now I guess I'm an artist so I did all the normal things I threw events I design wedding invitations ice cream printed posters and t-shirts and sold them at art fairs I worked at an art startup I was I was honestly completely lost but I was very fulfilled I was I did not have very much money but it was fine and then my husband and I decided all right we're done with New York it's over we need to be outside so we quit our jobs drove across the country to San Francisco and the first week I was here a friend of mine wanted to introduce me to this gal she knew I would love Britt so I had taken a random job at another startup and six months after that meeting the same gal called me up said I'd love to talk to you about a project obviously I gave my two weeks notice and signed on to be Britt's founding partner and creative director and set to work building a company whose entire mission is to empower women through creativity so yeah um the lesson say yes and just start find a way to jump into the things you love even if it's not exactly the way you pictured take a risk with a game plan in mind if you want to be a professional artist take art classes at night submit pieces to a group exhibition enter an art contest don't wait don't wait until eventually don't wait for something magical to happen and finally you can quit your job and be this dream thing do it little by little take your time hone in on your craft then all of a sudden you might look in the mirror and realize oh I'm an artist I'm an entrepreneur and I'm a writer it's freakin happening and it's amazing thank you [Applause]

Ami shares her story of three pivotal turning points in her life that helped her gain a sense of identity. She discusses her experience as an Indian American, a minority in America, and her discovery of a community of like minded people.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
hello everyone my name is Amy metha and [Applause] and I'm the director of product design at Evernote so I'm the last speaker here this evening and feel really honored to be here so today I want to ask you guys to take a journey with me a journey into the past where I had three sort of significant turning points in my life these turning points were points that helped me to get deeper in my own sense of identity and helped me to understand who I was on deeper and deeper levels the first one was when I realized that I was an American girl in an Indian family the second one was when I realized that I was a minority in America and the third one was when I found a purposeful community like-minded individuals so as we take this journey I want you to know that for me the journey was not linear it was actually much more like a maze twists and turns darkness and lightness it was a mixture of all of these things and the maze was circular in nature where there was a beginning a discrete middle where the realization would take place and a retracing of the steps back to the beginning again and what we call this maze is a labyrinth so these three journeys helped me to not only understand my own identity more deeply but they served as a compass to help me navigate life experiences so the very first one I was born to Indian parents in Boulder Colorado and we used to go back every summer to India and as I got older I remember this time where we went to my uncle's house my dad was one of sixteen brothers and sisters and he remembered that we were going there for dinner in Bombay and my brother and father were escorted into the living room to have the intellectual conversation and my sister mother and I were gently escorted into the kitchen to make sure that the food was prepared for the men to eat so as I was helping to roll the rotis and make sure that the food was all hot I was really angry inside I thought why did they get a B in the living room having the intellectual conversation and I have to make the dinner in the kitchen so we served them the food that evening and we made sure they had enough to eat and we cleared the table and we basically went back to the kitchen and sat on the floor and ate on the floor because that's what you did in this particular family so at a very young age I thought if this is what it means to be Indian I don't want any part of it no thank you you know I would I want to be American I want the image I want to live the American dream I want freedom I want equality a few years later when I was in Colorado and yet again my mom was like we got to make dinner and you know your dad and brother have to eat and we were making dinner and doing the dishes and I was just got really angry I kind of threw a fit and I got my sister who's younger who's here in the audience right now and we went downstairs and I said let's make these signs so he wrote out these signs and we wrote on them let Inquilab so we went around the house and we added these little sticks to the bottom of the sign and we went around the house and we picketed and we said me and frightened her my younger sister right behind me lud uncle of blood uncle of blood inqalab which means for those of you that don't know Hindi women's revolution so I was 11 years old and my sister was 9 and I realized it wasn't about being Indian or being American that I was resisting it was being a girl growing into a woman in a patriarchal structure in a patriarchal system and all women and all people actually are part of this patriarchy and so what I was resisting was patriarchy and what I did about this was decide not to buy into it I decided that I was going to be as good as any man or better I was going to succeed at all costs I was going to be self-sufficient and I was going to make my way through life and I decided that patriarchy was not going to get the best of me so the second turning point that I went through was 9/11 in 2001 it's when the twin towers went down in New York remember us working in the corporate world I was in Palo Alto I was in my apartment and I saw on the TV the towers go down and I remember being so scared I'd never been so scared in my entire life and I remember going to the closet looking for the biggest blanket that I could find to try to wrap around me to feel safe but nothing was going to make me feel safe nothing was going to make anyone any of us still safe from something like that so the next day I got a call from a friend who had told me a very good friend of ours from school happened to be working in the towers that day and he passed away he died and so I couldn't leave my apartment for a couple days I was so afraid to just go outside I was so afraid to face the world if this was what the world was like at this time and I remember finally getting the courage and got on my jogging shoes and I jogged from my apartment to Molly stones a small grocery store nearby and when I got to the grocery store and I got to the doors and I was about to walk in an older white man across the parking lot was looking at me with this hateful look and he started to scream out at me and he said why don't you go back to the country you came from we don't need you terrorizing us here in America and at this moment I just didn't even know what to say I was already devastated from everything that had happened I didn't respond I didn't know how to respond I walked into the grocery store and I started walking down the aisles and I just started crying and crying and crying and I kept thinking but I am in my country I am American America is a melting pot this is my country too but what I realized there was these were deep deep forms of racism that I felt not only that day but I think this was the day I truly acknowledged it I think I've experienced racism as many people of color and other people have throughout my life but what I realized was that I wasn't going to let this get the best of me either as I continued to walk through the labyrinth and take twists and turns I was going to be better than this I was going to be resilient I was not going to buy into small minds I was not going to let him or anyone else take my power away so the third turning point that I experienced was when I went back to grad school I went to Stanford and I got my master's in education in learning design and technology and I loved it I loved the program I loved every book I was reading as the biggest nerd in the class I sat in the front row I got strata is that year but I met people in this program but cared about the same things I did making a humanitarian difference thinking about educational technology and ways that we could be instruments to serve to something greater and so this tried this community of people that I met during this program were just like me I found identity in them but it was because we had the same purpose we had the same goals we wanted to make that difference in the same way and so I started to finally find a sense of identity and yet all of these friends who are still lifelong friends are from every culture around the world every race around the world and very different mindsets yet a common goal so today I finally feel like I have been able to understand accept and embrace what it means to be Indian American my identity as an Indian American and as a woman who will not let anyone steal her power as you guys think about your lives I just want you to take a second and close your eyes think about the labyrinths of your lives where are you right now in your journey are you running into mentors and teachers and friends or are you learning in running into tricksters and monsters and people that want to steal your power the only advice I can give around this is if you keep on going and you persevere and you don't let racism or or patriarchy or different forms of oppression get the best of you you can continue to find deeper levels of yourself so what I wish for today and as you can see you heard the journey and the journeys of many other women here tonight is that we as women can come together we can come together as a community we can come together with different perspectives and yet a commonality in terms of experiencing different forms of oppression we can come together as a coalition to support one another especially today especially in these times thank you [Applause]

Cora has always loved jewelry and owning her own company. After her first attempt at owning a company didn't go as planned, she decided to move on and embrace that when one door closes, another door opens.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
the closest I'll ever get to an Oscar speech can you hear me I'm really tall so I feel like it's not good is can you hear me now alright why that guy in the corner I want to help me that's perfect thank you thank you so much okay my name is Cora Thomas and I'm so excited to be here tonight and I'm closing the show Oh a lot of pressure so I won't I did not memorize because I my memory is that of a fruit pie so I have to read off of this paper but I will try to not do it as much as I think I need to okay so my my overarching theme for my story a common theme but an important one in today's world is when one door closes another door opens so I'll take you back to New York City almost 12 years ago I was 22 years old a year out of graduating from Parsons school design one job under my belt which I had quit promptly quit because of a lesson pleasant boss I decided like any 22 year old with a chip on her shoulder no money and very little experience to start my own company because that seemed smart this wasn't totally out of the blue while at Parsons I knew in my senior year that accessories was really where my passion lead the margins were great and I love the size there was no sighs you know there was just want to fit on your ear it didn't and and I loved it and I love that you can take a pair of earrings and like throw it on with a pair of jeans and she sure did totally change her outfit it was it's it's really what was my passion and still it so anyways here I was at 22 starting a jewelry line I was making the wax carvings which I'd never done before I was sourcing my materials in New York producing it in New York and to be very clear I really had no experience doing this I barely even like had sketch jewelry prior to this and well besides her that like odd pair of earrings that you make at your local food store in high school that you think are really cool until you lose them like two days later that's about the extent of my experience but anyways I was just doing it and the one thing I did come to realize very quickly was that I loved having my own company and I loved having full creative control of something I was lucky to get some press behind the company I was written about an owl and Harper's Bazaar Lucky Magazine and clearly in my mind I was bound for incredible overnight success like this this is it at 22 I was gonna make a million dollars you know making jewelry out of my kitchen in the East Village okay yeah the dreams of your you well okay so as you can imagine where this story is going it totally fell apart I didn't know how to run a business and just plain and simple I just needed more experience so I packed it up embarrassed and frustrated and just decided okay I have to move on so that door was shut but I realized how much I love designing jewelry and knew it's where my focus should lay my next opportunity came when I landed a job at j.crew a new door had opened this is my first real experience in jewelry on the large scale and I can't stress enough how important and influential that experience would prove to be I learned how to merchandise a line my sense of color silhouette grew and I built invaluable production connections most of which I still used today so realizing that had I not attempted that first company and I wouldn't have been in that position and which essentially completely expanded my professional career so over the next few years I'd left j.crew I was freelancing for some different brands designing jewelry and doing some concept work and I was feeling really stifled I still have designing but something just didn't feel great 'van uh for me even though I was in like such a creative field in the midst of all of this I started dating someone a photographer adora I probably shouldn't have opened and gone through but I did so you live in you learn anyway is this mr. geographer on a really tight budget for shoot as if I would cater lunch for the following day as my friends know some of who are here tonight I love to cook it is my second love and also very creative so I said yes of course and completely unknowingly walked through a new door for the next two years I ran Cory Thomas catering I know and hater hater shoots for Teen Vogue and Zara Harper's Bazaar Neiman Marcus it was it was such an unbelievably exhausting experience but it was so it was so rewarding seeing people's happy faces when you know they piled up a plate of my food on a shoot and just seemed happy for the first time in their day was so was so great and it was the same feeling that I got when I saw someone trying a piece of my jewelry and had a smile on their face so but I see it's kind of a trend in my in my life that around the two-year mark I realized like what was I doing getting up at 5:00 in the morning to prep breakfast for a 7:00 a.m. shoot this is crazy I'll never forget running down Wall Street in New York and 9:00 a.m. dodging businessmen trying to get back to set holding a tray a fennel sausage I'm thinking to myself I can't do this long term like this is crazy and two things like two years ago I was designing chandelier earrings and now I'm like hoofing it in the financial district with like a hot tray of meat this is not this is not for me but it was great and an experience nonetheless it was a true labor of love but again not sustainable for my future but it's solidified that I how fulfilled I felt being in full creative control of something and owning my own business so I jump back into jewelry design working for a club monaco which eventually led to me going back to j-cruise other brand made well and at the time I knew the creative director from my time at j.crew so I got the job designing their jewelry which again was such an amazing experience and just really solidified with accessories is where was what I wanted to do so two years it made well that two year itch starts again definitely a trend for me and in the fall of 2015 I made the tough decision to quit my job and leave New York after 12 years so I sorry I lost my place oh and move without a job without an apartment without much besides great friends to help cushion any falls to move to California I just have this feeling that if I moved something great would come of it so much of California spoke to me I'd offer great weather a great burgeoning design scene and most importantly spaced and if anyone has lived in New York for longer than a month they know what I'm talking about but also emotional space which we talk a lot about in California so it was it was in this new environment that I was able to finally define what I wanted to do I took all the pieces from my past all the conflicts and success all the things that made me tick and laid out my dream scenario I started to start a company that would design and produce accessories for many different brands constantly challenging myself being able to work with a range of brands and appeal to different audiences stretch my creativity keep me on my toes and keep my career feeling fresh so Cory Thomas design started in my tiny apartment in Venice and now it is in a beautiful office instead of Monaco with three hopefully seem to be for employees and five brands under its belt and it's the most rewarding feeling that I've most rewarding experience I've ever felt in my life in addition to my company with a very good friend of mine we launched an accessories brand called berrineau which this past fall which has been also just such an amazing outlet for both of us who also have full-time jobs on on this well we have full-time jobs and we do this on the side so it's crazy but it's great and lastly be really sweet for me to say to him but anyways on a very personal note on top of all the happiness to success that California has brought me I also met my husband here a year ago so that was really really special a little cherry on top so what I hope you can take away from my story is that don't be worried about not staying on track run down the street with those sausages do anything you can walk through every door that opens and no failure is ever really a failure it is just a tool to help you further define what you love Thanks

Since childhood, everything seemed to be against Nanea. She wasn't supposed to succeed but she pushed through the odds, learned how to play the game, and has done an amazing job so far.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
oh okay I'm first I'm Nanea Reeves and I'm CEO trip and thank you I'm gonna tell you a little bit about my story when I was a little girl my mother was a heroin addict and I had two younger sisters and I felt like the weight of the world was on my shoulders and I was so angry to have so much responsibility at such a young age and that anger fueled a lot of self-destructive behavior and me and my sisters and by the time I was in my early teens I had a complete mental breakdown that put me in the hospital and through that experience I met a woman who was a very kind and compassionate therapist who taught me how to meditate and it was in that safe space that she created that I was able to quiet the noise in my head and see a new vision of myself and of my life going forward that had hope and optimism for the first time but my sister couldn't do that she could only see herself through the lens of being damaged and by many many years of that noise in her head just getting louder and louder she ended up dying from a drug overdose in 2012 and she lived out the life I was supposed to have the same life that my mother lived but I started to make different choices in my life and it got better and I met a man who was handsome and funny and smart and we were crazy about each other and at the time I was an artist and you know very bohemian living a life of self-expression and he took care of me and we got married and we bought a house and then one day he got sick and he couldn't work anymore so I had to go get a real job and I went to go work at a web development company in an office which is pretty much the worst thing you can ever tell artists to go do and I thought I was gonna die and you know it and I had I had taught myself how to code websites back when it was actually kind of hard to do it and I've always been technical I was this weird little girl that took apart the TV and put it back together to see how it worked and when I would play games at the arcade all the boys would go whoa and and I love playing video games because they helped me escape my life and I could be a hero and a builder and a maker when it seemed like everything was falling apart around me and so I took that skill that I had and this love of technology to work with me in that office and I loved it and who knew that building software with the team of people could be so much fun even when it was challenging but just so incredibly amazing when you built something as a team together that actually worked and so that illness that my husband had which I thought was taking away my ability to pursue my dreams actually gave me a career in tech I didn't even know I wanted let alone would love as much as I do and that that small company I want to go work at it got bought by a bigger company and I started to meet everybody in LA tech and people in Silicon Valley and they actually they really liked me because I had a lot of moxie and I had a detector that can only be had by someone who's been through a lot of and I had this weird ability to get very hard things done and it came from being that little girl who had to step up and take care of her two little sisters when her mother couldn't and that same little girl who had to figure out how to do things way beyond her years because of neglect so that childhood experience that had scarred me it actually laid the foundation for what would be some of my strongest attributes and my career started to advance but being a woman in tech as mentioned is not always easy and especially when I went to go work in the video game industry I often felt like I wasn't being heard and that I was dismissed or shut out of the boys club and I was working on a mobile game company that was just starting to really take off back when people said no one will ever want to play a game on their cell phone and some of you are doing that right now and I packed up my office one day in such a state of rage and I took the boxes down to the car with tears streaming down my face and I made a phone call to a friend and I said I can't do this they they don't treat me right and he said Nene you can't leave that company's on the verge of going public in about a year do you know how many people would kill to be in the position you're in right now you have to stay and I knew he was right and I said well I guess anybody can do pushups in their cell for a year I can stay for a year and he said let me make another suggestion that you if you are going to stay you show up with a good attitude even if you have to fake it and so I did that I put my game face on and I went to work and I showed up with a good attitude and what a surprise when I changed they changed they liked me better I got promoted and when my initiatives actually started to make a real difference on the company's success I got a seat at the table and not just the seat they give the girls I got a real seat with real power and I almost walked away from all of that and what I could see was one is really important who you take advice from and two I wasn't playing the game the game was playing me and when I flipped that and showed up like a team player and said how can I help us all win I started to get the same cash and prizes that the boys got provided that I negotiated as hard as they did which was a very painful lesson to learn the hard way but I will say that that company did go public and had I raged quit that day there would be someone else standing here tonight right now but having success in business doesn't make you bulletproof from life and three years ago my husband got diagnosed with terminal liver cancer and yeah he had a very healthy attitude about dying he was a very deep meditator and he insisted that we all be joyful around him during the last few months of his life we were told that we had eight months together and we only had eight weeks and we all came together around him with joy and and love and it was hard but as a result when he did finally die in his meditation room which is where he wanted to leave he was surrounded by all of us who loved him and it was beautiful and had I made that moment about me caving into my sadness at the thought of losing him he would have seen in his last breath the person he loved the most in complete despair and I would have missed the most profound and meaningful moment of our relationship was which was to be there with him with love and gratitude for the journey we had had and I definitely had a lot of time to cave in to my sadness during the past three years it was a moment though in my meditation out as I started to emerge from it that I realized I needed to give my self compassion and to make the choice to look at my future without him with hope and optimism and so I started to make some decisions about how I wanted to rebuild my life I got a dog I never had a dog and I decided that I only wanted to work with people I really loved were and so I love working with my co-founder of trip Zach Norman this is our fourth company working together and I wanted to take the three things I love the most video games meditation and compassion these things that have saved my life and put them together in a company to do something wonderful and unique and I also decided that it was time for me to stop being number two and to step up and be a CEO and thank you so that little girl who's been spending her whole life taking care of everyone else has finally started to take care of herself and I would just like to end with one thing because it was such a strange realization yesterday that woman who helped me in that therapist she was also a screenwriter and her name was Victoria Riskin and she went on to become the very first female president of the Writers Guild and now she is in the later stages of her life as a living as a human rights activist so I'd like to thank her for her kindness and compassion to me and for being a fine example of what it means to be a badass woman and a fine human being so thank you very much you

Farnaz tells her story about constantly pushing herself to the point of discomfort and how that's gotten her to where she is. Although there were multiple points of self-doubt,

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
hello everyone it's wonderful to be here amazing audience even more amazing speakers it's it's so hard to go after three of youth it's yeah it's it's tough so my name is ferno's and I'm an engineering director here in LA at snap when I was talking to the organizers of this event the very first time they said they're looking for storytelling around those sort of pivotal moments that help shape shape our lives and I think as you see there there are several moments like that they all leave their marks but at that moment for me what hit me was this experience I had that has has helped shaped my life from one of those events and I think I'm just gonna go with it and I think Samantha talked about this as well so the story goes back to my high school years when I was skiing I had skied from very early ages and you know you go through those beautiful first few sessions where you know you start with like I don't know what I'm doing - I'm in control like I think I've got it covered and it feels amazing it's fulfilling and fun and obviously future changes when you're learning anything new right the first set of changes come really fast low-hanging fruits and then it gets slower and slower and that's fine well understood but when I got to high school I think I was self-conscious enough to realize that oh I'm not changing that much I'm plateauing so I went to this great instructor and I asked him to start working with me we had their first day together and at the end of the day he said I think I know why you're not good which first you don't say that if you're an educator you're a teacher you're an instructor just don't say that some of us are tough enough to you know hang in there and keep plowing through some of us aren't luckily I was one of those first groups of people so he said let's go and there's a group of quote/unquote cool kids where we go and ski together at the end of the day for an hour the problem is one I'm not a cool kid - I don't hang out with cool kids so immediately that was a red but I figured I'll go with it he knows why I'm not good we went and we hit this point where it was called and within the slopes was called the wall wasn't released back then it was called the wall for very similar reasons it was a vertical drop snowy icy and I would not be hitting that part of the slope in my right mind set it was just not a thing I do not even scary it was crazy so we hit it everybody's lining up sort of perpendicular to the drop and they go one by one a couple of them fall and I'm the last one and I stood up there like imagine high school tough ages and the group of cool kids staring at you and I can't remember how many minutes it was but I think it was that gaze of the cool kid that got me to just go with it and it was horrible I had the worst fall I've ever had my ski was in one place the Hat was in another snow in my ears but I think something amazing happened at that point and that was just getting a little more comfortable with looking silly and clumsy and you know in front of a bunch of people watching you just falling and by the way disclaimer I'm not comfortable with that in life I got comfortable with that at that moment that don't circumstances when I was skiing and I really helped actually push me forward I got better and being a somewhat sentimental kid I took a note of that and thought you know I'm a risk-averse person I get into my comfort zone and I plateau and I have to push myself I have to force myself and I tried to think about that when I get to those tough decisions that I need to make and what I remember is there's a there's a few instances in life where I think that experience kind of came in handy and helped push me outside of my comfort zone after college I was thinking about you know do I want to stay back in my home country or go abroad come to the US and study here and it was somewhat it was scary thought I had to go to a country where I didn't know that many people it was a different language it was in a place where I have to get a visa where my parents couldn't visit me where I couldn't go back due to the risk of not being able to come back and finish my studies but I decided this was you know one of those once-in-a-lifetime sort of opportunities so I decided to go with it and by the way I'm gonna ruin the story I'm still here so like it worked out there was really really hard you know I was staying home that's what people did back home you stay with your parents at college pampered you know parents are taking care of you making sure your day-to-day needs are met and all of a sudden I'm landing in LAX in this new world and I gotta take it but myself it was really really hard but fulfilling and amazing and you learn so much so many new experiences that I would have never had before throughout those those years as I was working on my PhD you know I was a good student and you had to get A's and that was I had of covered but after a couple of years in grad school I started thinking that this is not for me getting my PhD postdoc academia it's just not cutting it and you might think big deal people do something else but within my network of friends and with my family like that that was not something we did like you go you go all the way you go to the end you you know you don't quit and I think that final straw for me came when one I got a cold call or cold email from Google recruiters that was exciting Google was a big deal back then but you know there's a new hot company and I had a paper submitted to this most prestigious conference and my regular me would be checking that website every day do that get accepted I get accepted and I was not doing that at all and I learned that my favorite was accepted through a congratulations email from my advisor that was a really bad time I was not caring and so again going back to hitting that wall the perpendicular wall worried about how I'm gonna be judged as I quit I decided to jump and go and give it a try and I put that PhD on hold again I'm joining the story it's still on hold and yeah I joined I joined the industry and it was amazing it was humbling I knew how to be a good student but I didn't know how to work among a bunch of people who for the most part were smarter than me better than me more hard-working more experienced better just better but at the same time it meant that at those pivotal years the beginning of my career I got to be surrounded by people who were ready to me and I got to learn from them and I think that's huge and within those years I made sure it at every through three years when I was on the project and I was you know going from the first few months of I'm an idiot I don't know what I'm doing - I've got it covered the moment I hit that point the moment people were coming to me asking me questions it was time to move on switch projects do something new get into that zone of not being comfortable get into that zone of questioning whether you belong I'm learning that that's a good area to be at and finally two years ago I left that first company joined snap and it was everything I thought it'd be I didn't know anything about app development snapchat was used by kids that were cool and hip and again I wasn't one it's a repeating pattern here and I decided to join and it was really really hard to start the first three months but as usual that repeating pattern you know you pick it up you learn those new skills you question whether you belong you question whether you're smart enough you're good enough you're creative enough and you figure it out and so I think the lesson for me is we are lucky enough to live in part of the world and at times where we're given so many chances like you can't make a mistake big enough that you can't go back from very easily you can like if you try hard enough but it's really hard so the lesson for me has always been just get out of your comfort zone the moment you think I'm really good at this at this I've got it covered it's time to jump [Applause]

Ashley tells the story of the day she secured her internship at The Today Show. She also discusses the challenges she has faced being the youngest woman in the room, and how she has overcome those obstacles.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
okay hi great that's great hi I'm Ashley McCallum nice to meet you all I'm general manager of tasty which is the food studio at BuzzFeed great great reactions so far so why don't we just get into it so how many of you it's kind of hard to see but how many of you know tasty give me a raise a show of hands awesome great so how many of you have actually made a tasty recipe at home show of hands okay so that's about what I would expect so usually our research says that about 90% of people in the room have heard of tasty and about 50% of those people have actually made a recipe at home so LA market doing okay great so a lot of the women on the stage will talk tonight about challenges they have had as a result of being a woman in the workplace I have had my fair share of those challenges but tonight I am going to talk about something different which is being the youngest person in every room so I'm 30 and I have often felt insecure about my age and so hopefully tonight we can you can end leave with a little bit of a different perspective on having experience or not having experience so I'm gonna kick it off with a story of how I got my first job in media this is kind of a story that'll never leave me fortunately or unfortunately so I grew up in South Carolina with no experience in media no connections but when I decided I wanted to be a medium I knew I had to be creative so I flew myself to New York City to visit a friend who was studying studying there and I thought to myself if I'm gonna be physically near these media companies I should be able to get a job right it just was very intuitive to me this was like before social media I just I couldn't go to New York City and not leave with a job so I'm gonna show you a photo but I'm gonna caveat it to say that I asked the event organizers if I could show a photo and they said nope there are no visuals no slides but I asked for an exception and if you're following along this is the trend for me so will I'll show you this photo may be that you I knew who's who one day we'll show you a photo oh there it is okay so that was ten years ago I showed up to the Today Show yeah so that was ten years ago I showed up to a Sean Kingston concert anyone remembers him very popular ten years ago and that's a sign you can read that says this southern belle wants to be NBC's next summer intern and so I held it up during commercial breaks exciting care about being on TV I wanted to producers to see it and it worked so the executive producer of the show at the time Jim Bell came down and met me and he asked for my resume and cover letter and I got the job which is kind of crazy and please don't do that it's like super stalker to do that now you should just like tweet at someone like don't show up that's super weird now but I was too inexperienced to know that it was creepy and I was too inexperienced to know what was possible what was impossible and so not having experience and just having confidence was the thing that really helped me in that situation so let's flash forward to today it's a present day so I've been a BuzzFeed for six years which is like dog years for BuzzFeed it's like I've been there forever and so I moved to LA a couple years ago and started running tasty which is this massive success for BuzzFeed them had a lot of fun doing it we have some tasty producers in the room I don't know where they're sitting where are they right over here okay you guys know the hands and the tasty video it's like they're right there put your hands up Diana and Julia okay just two of the hands are you moisturized you guys are good okay thanks for coming by the way so tasties had an incredible rise and all the fact that all of you know in this room is it's like pretty amazing but it became very quickly a crowded marketplace so if you know how you scroll through your facebook feed and everything kind of looks like a tasty video like you like don't even know you watching anymore you end up in this like vortex of food videos or like something that's top down and fast that's because a lot of people copied us really fast and so usually copycats take a long time but this time for whatever reason within a year we had tons of copycats entire companies sprung up really just to copy our strategy and copy our format so I knew that we had to provide more value particularly to our advertising partners there's no way we could just have a massive commoditized crowded marketplace and continue to remain remain on top um so trying to figure out where was tasty gonna provide more value so I started looking at our editorial operation and trying to understand the audience more and what I saw was that within hours after posting a video our audience was uploading photos of them actually making it so I asked you earlier how many of you actually made recipe people were watching a tasty video getting in their car driving in the grocery store buying the ingredients and coming home and making it for their friends and family now maybe that seems intuitive but with digital publishers we've always kind of been bucketed as top of funnel I don't how many of you work in advertising okay some of you so right so we've always been bucking as top of funnel mid funnel but the idea of tasty or big mass media company being able to drive sales it was totally counterintuitive by our editorial work was indicating that we could so last summer I held a an off-site for all the people who work on tasty advertising business and we had talked about all the normal stuff for new holes and accounts and all that stuff and then I had a 30-minute session where I said tasty the full funnel advertising partner question mark and so I got up in front of the room and I said hey guys like I have you know I have this hunch that I think that we can actually play in this space but I wanted all of us to be aligned on this thing that we're building are we building a full funnel advertising solution and I got head nods for most of the people the room these two old dudes two senior men in the back of the room who immediately shot me down and then said no way you will never compete in the space we cannot prove bottom of funnel sales their entire company's Google has spent the better part of the last two decades proving a last click attribution what is BuzzFeed gonna do like how are we gonna prove this I took this on as a personal challenge and so I had an unwavering vision for tasty that we could do this even though it didn't make sense that I would not listen to two senior men who spent their entire lives and advertising and I was fairly new to advertising and so the fact that I didn't listen to them doesn't make a ton of sense but I was very focused I had this clear vision for what we could do that was nine months ago in two weeks we're rolling out research that proves that we can drive sales with three of our biggest clients today we launched a 90 SKU cookware bakeware line and every Walmart store in America as a result of us being able to drive sales and in thank you keep it coming just and in two weeks I will be announcing at the biggest CPG advertising conference in the country tasties full funnel advertising solution in two weeks so thank you so the point of that is to say that you should challenge this convention that experience more experience means you're more qualified or you're smarter or you're better because if I listen to the people with all the experience we would have never pushed the boundaries so when you are the most junior person in the room and you have an idea that's not clear or maybe or it's not clear that it'll work you should just remember that the most senior people in the room are probably the ones who made the rules so they're not gonna be the ones who break them and so if they made the conventions they won't ignore them you have to do that and so you often have to push and you have to push back and ignore experience and just focus on your confidence thank you [Applause]

Amber Hameed didn't get to where she is today alone...it took the power of the women before her. Amber gives praise to the ladies who helped raise her up and support her throughout her journey

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
wow this is really bright hi everyone to follow boobs and fart jokes and SNL basically my name is Amber Hameed I'm the VP of information systems at Dollar Shave Club I wanted to thank everyone here who's attending in the audience I think this is a great support mechanism for us women up here telling our stories I want to thank hustle for arranging this this amazing venue and having us up here this is a great opportunity and I'm in great company of some fantastic women and their storytelling when I was thinking about what to talk about I was giving it you know I was bouncing a lot of different story ideas off the wall and and I thought that you know I got here but I didn't get here alone so my story is not just mine it's a story a lot of other people who contributed to where I am today and I wanted to pick a handful of those stories of people who contributed to my life and the success of my career and I wanted to give them a shout out and tell my story through them these are people who sacrifice their lives their future their people who made sure that I got that opportunity that showcase my skill these are people who put aside their preconceived notions about whatever culture and biases to make sure that you know I got that I made the cut and I got that opportunity and there were people who just showed up imagine growing up in a country where women don't get a lot of opportunities and most importantly growing up you know in an environment where you are barely educated a single mom with four daughters and your entire inspiration is to make sure that your your daughters get the best and the highest of education that money can buy this story is about four women who were highly educated in a third world country one of them ended up being a master's in psychology another one ended up being a gynecologist one of them ended up being dinner masters in fine arts and another one was the principal a very coveted school that woman was my grandmother and the woman who got me here to where I am today is my mother and when we got here she brought two suitcases and three kids in tow as a single mom and she made sure that her children had the best of opportunities that she could afford I'm very lucky to be part of that legacy and I'm very lucky to be here because of her and when I came here all she said to me is you know what I can give you is a shot at a good life and a good opportunity and the rest is up to you that wasn't too long ago and when I look back at it all I can say it thanks mom for giving up your entire life your family your comfort zone to make sure I got here the second person I'd like to talk about and there's one more thing she said to me she's like you know you'll do well because I raised you like a son and not like a daughter and if you know where I come from that's a huge compliment cuz it is all about sons and guns where I come from so it's interesting that you know the biggest mentor the first mentor in my life was this woman called Paula when I grew up in Pakistan where I'm from it's almost kind of a coming-of-age story you get your nose pierced you know you turn 16 you go over and you get your nose pierced an exciting thing to do it means something completely different obviously in the u.s. it's rebellion you know it's it's kind of going out there and making a mark you know and my first opportunity out of college for a young student was a coveted internship at a pretty big employment company in Boston called the gillette company it's amazing how you come full circle and i was in college and i was you know doing four jobs to make ends meet and go to college and pay my way through it and you know i was told that my nose ring would be an impediment to me getting this internship and the reason i knew this I didn't know at the time is that I showed up to the interview I did my interview and Paula who was my boss and mentor my first female boss my first ever female boss she looked at me and she said by the way I just wanted to let you know you have the job I have a bunch of students sitting out there who are you know I have to go through the rigmarole and interview them because they here and they showed up but I just wanted to let you have the job and I also wanted to let you know that your student counselor in your cover letter that he sent me told me that you were a nose ring and that might be an impediment to the Gillette culture he said I want you to go back and tell him that I gave you this job despite but notes ringing us so thank you Paula for giving me that shot that shot that made me never look back the third story is about Tony hey Tony is interesting we used to call him the billion dollar boy he wasn't going his entire life this is it a consult to come be there worked at was contributing to the consulting company in the bandwidth his entire personal network is what brought almost a billion dollars worth of business to the consulting company and it was a good idea to be in his good graces now Tony is this big burly Italian guy you know you can cast him in any Tarantino movies you know for coppola movies and this was during the time when nobody was hiring consultants people were letting go and it was to 2018 I'm so sorry 2008 and lived in New York and right across the street from me was the Lehman Brothers office everything was pretty much going downhill at that point and you know he called me into his office and you know he looked at me and said I'm gonna make you an offer you couldn't refuse and I said what is the Tony and he said I have a little bit of budget and I have an opportunity in which you will be working with two of the biggest software giants and I want you to spearhead a practice for this consulting company like okay why me and he said because I know you'll get it done and I'm gonna give you one resource and the rest is up to you to go figure it out and not only did I manage to get that going I was able to showcase that all over the world from the platform of this consulting company all over Europe we won almost 17 million dollars worth of business off of this prototype that we built and it was something that was actually showcased at both of the software giant's major events as a cut-through a breakthrough for them in both events and this all started with two people and this was a shot and a flavor of entrepreneurship that I got and it was extremely exciting for me and that propelled my career in all kinds of different directions and one of the reasons why I'm standing here today and the last story that would have technically tell is something about my own unconscious bias during one of my most thrilling career opportunities but very stressful career opportunities I was in dire straits this project that I was on was gravely behind schedule and I was really looking for for a data Talent and as most of you in the tech industry know that's hard to come about and this was in New York and being behind schedule drastically was a huge challenge for me so I needed somebody to come in and hit the ground running and you know really do a good job and I'd already gone through about three different data architects and I was having no success so finally I had this woman walk through my door and as she was coming in you know I realized she was eight months pregnant and she was looking for a job that would keep her local because she was having a child and she wanted to start a family and she didn't want to travel anymore and I needed somebody who can hit the ground running and if you're at once pregnant I knew she was gonna be going on maternity leave very soon so I started interviewing her and she knocked it out of the park she was exactly what I wanted and I looked her in the eye and I said and I couldn't ask her about a pregnancy obviously but I said you know this is what I'm looking for I need somebody to be here you know this is an opportunity that I just can't afford to lose again and she looked at me and she said I'm having a c-section I have three kids I know what I need to do I know what I'm going in I know when I'm coming out I'm going in December fourth I'll be showing up January fourth and the other person who was sitting next to me is another woman another mother and she looked at me she says no way she's throwing up it's not happening after c-section and delivering a child is no way and lo and behold she showed up January 4th she was there and she was one of the cornerstones of the successful project that I did so thanks Louie for showing up an inclusion I also want to talk about people who didn't show up and you know who those people are you know you are I don't want to take it means they're people who didn't show up the naysayers the dream Snatchers the ones who always told me I would never amount to anything and there's a lot of them there are a lot of people who told me basically that I wouldn't succeed because I wasn't ready I would like to thank them because they made me work twice as hard they made me more determined than ever they made me work harder and better and it made me show up and all I have to say to them is how do you like me now thank you very much

how's everybody doing no no that's unacceptable do you guys have a good lunch guys oh man I had tacos they were so delicious love it well it's great to be here in San Francisco I'm from Greenville South Carolina I'm at wale on Twitter you can ask me about that sometime if you want it is a funny story I run and founded really good emails which is a place basically where I started curating what I thought were best practices for emails email tends to be the bastion of marketing teams and as a designer and a product guy said hell no give that back so I took it and tried to create a space where I was able to add you know my ethics and my interest in emails and over the last two years we've grown to be 25,000 subscriber list and it's a side project so we'll see where it goes from here the people that are at this conference you all included are way more talented than I am so you know you guys should be up here and I should be listening but in the meantime I'm having a lot of fun so I'm really really thankful to be here the other thing that I do is I run fathom and draught fathom and draught is a business first design studio and I'm the director of that and again out of Greenville South Carolina so I want to tell you three things that are true email is the shittiest ship that ever [ __ ] it's awful right but the the reality is that it's good news because it can become really good without too much effort like Unicorn good the other thing that you guys should know is you should not trust people who cannot cuss in [ __ ] public all right it's a brand voice this is what I want to communicate with you all today the reason why most email sucks is because we we are somehow we miss the point that there's an opportunity to talk to our summers like people so I want you to man oh look at that it's so good oh man I'm so happy that my kids get to grow up with gifts so great all right so I'm glad thank you for whoever clicked play that was great um I want you to know this suck that is an awkward phrase but I think yeah if I'm careful I can coin it you know Matthew Smith he's that guy that coined that phrase no the suck but it's it's this thing what happens when you actually know what sucks for your customers for the people who are reading or using your product do you know that now we create personas and all those kinds of things but you have you talked to them have you gone to their house have you heard their complaints not just about your product but rather why your product exists what are they hiring your product to do for them what are they hiring your emails to do for them these are the questions that you know really matter and can give you a bead on what they do and really make your product and your communication with them through email really count so can we oh that's awesome all right speak to what's missing Barbara is missing it's not okay if you guys haven't seen season two highly recommend it here's the thing when we started really good emails the reason why we did was that there was information asymmetry who's heard of that term before okay so there was a time when selling cars from a used-car salesman that dude knew more about vehicles than you could and so he was able to leverage his information to basically create a information asymmetry and make money off of you in that right now through cars comm and a million other you know utilities we know as much or more about vehicles as a salesperson so that's changed but where there is information asymmetry there's an opportunity for growth and connection and and real value and that's what we saw is that with the web you can right-click you can view source you can see the entire thing but with emails it's in individuals inboxes and no one not no one but very few people were exposing that how many of you have a favorites folder in your Gmail account for emails write a good a good bunch of you really good emails wanted to be that we wanted to help people have a space where those things were public so we spoke to that that missing content and then we spoke with a missing voice we like to cuss we like to be rude we like to say funny jokes about ourselves and we like to be vulnerable and say oops we [ __ ] that up I'm really sorry what can we do to make it better we like to talk to our customers and our readers it's a side project so you know like we do the best we can and we let people know hey we're limited human beings please be human with us all those kinds of things and that missing voice that rhetoric ends up making a big difference so these are the things I want you to walk away with also by the way the entire everything I'm saying is all I'll be sending out notes so you don't have to take notes or anything like that if you don't want it's all in a deck for you so I want you to be able to define what sucks for your customers I want you to be able to ask them what are they hiring your product to do for them with their time or with their money what are they hiring the email to do for them and who do they want to hear from and don't forget that they are actually paying you with their time and money don't waste it all right subject and preheader you can drive with curiosity when your dad says would you guys like to go get a treat that's curiosity and that's really valuable if you see a stranger and he says would you like to go get a treat that's different that's how email feels to me most of the time right is like get in my white van no thanks so think about how to speak to your customers in a different manner that feels a little bit more like dad and how do you get there you build trust and that that takes speaking to them like people so value value when you're speaking to your customers has to do with being able to say things that that are really powerful for them that you know that you get to convey to them as a trusted individual so 20 to 25 new companies that make money that's fluff subject to eat subject line three things I genuinely think would improve your day this is the way I talk to a friend very different sort of language and not every company gets to choose that language or that language but it's important that you find a voice that is authentic and how you would speak to your customers not in a way that you're throwing information at them but that it really connects them as people clarity if you have information that you have special resources and access to that's extremely valuable to just simply state something as it is and the value is clear to them because your customers in your email subscriber list they're looking for that information so you don't need to be obtuse about it and you don't need to use gimmicks just tell them what it is connection is my favorite favorite thing I'm single and I want intimacy in my life just letting everybody know so in email yeah this is good this is my personal subscriber list so an email name is amazing no one is using this as they could including really good emails these this is this is my dream um my name is Matthew it's not Matt and Matthew means something to me when people call me Matthew it matters and I have a specific seven letters in my name that's data seven letters it starts with an M that's something that could be used if you have somebody call you by name especially in response or when they see you on the street that's that's my name it matters so why not use it in that way instead of Matthew here's 25 new things bla bla bla you have the opportunity to use that from name or the name that you have in your subscriber database in a way that you would talk to a friend so rethink that entire thing the next is location we can guess at somebody's location it's dangerous but location is interesting like when you're having a conversation with a friend and you're like where are you that's an interesting moment to ask and you can ask that and get to know them a little bit better so what could you do with location you can show things you don't have to just spell out Greenville South Carolina you could grab a map from you know Google throw it as a background all kinds of things you could do that make your customers feel connected actions have they purchased something have they left something in their cart have they looked at something and not bought it have they stopped being active like how about a friend that stopped writing you think about that emotion and bring that into your email strategy there's so much opportunity to connect with your customers as real people and when you do it'll change everything at Relay Foods where I was a chief creative officer our number one most valuable customers were those who we made a mistake with on our first order couldn't figure it out for a little while and then it was obvious they had a connection with our customer service so I'm really sorry man that your avocado wasn't ripe the way it should be can I bring you a new one that never happens anywhere but we did that and that person became so loyal that it was just it was their value and their ability to spread the word and create more customers was incredible and that's the opportunity that you can create an email anniversaries are amazing I've known you guys for like 15 minutes this is incredible this thing we have together right so what could we do with that what can you do when you say it's our one-month anniversary or maybe it's our one-year these are moments these are things in relationship you know this as people but we don't communicate this way in emails and we can birthdays are incredible if you can ask somebody their birthday there's a moment in a relationship if I just ask you what's your birthday that's weird I'm not gonna do that but if there's an opportunity we get to know each other and then I asked your birthday it's like oh you want to know my birthday that's awesome like these are the things I have in my Amazon list go ahead and you know purchase but it's like hey this is an intimate moment what happens then when you when you let somebody know it's your half birthday it's exactly in the middle of the year we just thought you should know we're kind of happy thank you for being a part of this there's a moment of intimacy you drive loyalty you move from transaction to relationship if you don't know enough about them right now just ask people care about vulnerability say we don't know as much about you as we want to know so that we can provide value to you if you have been acting like the stranger in the white van that's gonna be creepy so don't be that way instead be honest hey we haven't been getting to know you in the way we should we'd like to get to know you better for these reasons what I learned in being the on the executive team in design on several products is you never ask for anything from a customer without offering them something better in return and that ethic can really drive you ask for their opinions let your customers know that they are smarter than you and you would like to know something from them this is an opportunity so if I say please fill out our survey it would make us really happy give us twenty minutes of your day and that's it that is absurd would you would you stop and and like somebody on the side of street saying can you stand here and push something annoying for 20 minutes and the UX will be really bad but just keep doing it just because I asked you to that's absurd no one would do that so why do we ask that in our emails and in our products like we shouldn't be doing that we should be saying to a small segment of people listen Lucy we've gathered together 35 people who we think use our product in this very specific way your time is incredibly valuable would you be willing to answer 30 questions it'll probably take 10 minutes we have $100 gift certificate to Amazon for you I hope that's worth it would you be willing to do that you've just earned a lifetime loyal customer that's the kind of things that you can do don't default Wow I am taking forever on these slides so don't default don't use the stuff in your preheader in your subject line that's just like the first line of the email you'll ruin it I'm gonna let you read these things on my deck so I can keep moving through your from name is important you might show up for a date wearing a banana hammock this is inappropriate just so you know take notes this kind of thing for a from name is what we get though a lot we get from names that don't don't they don't connect to the brand you have so much opportunity in your brand to have a from name that really matters like Freddy people love Freddy they have an emotional connection with Freddy people have an emotional connection with smiles Davis our our logo our icon this is Clark Val Berg in four years at envision he has been the from name in their emails you can write him back now my guess is that he has some other secret email address he doesn't give out but it sure feels like he's communicating with me and I have the opportunity to get in touch with a CEO and that feels good lead in you have made a promise in your subject line and in your brand the question is let's go back the question is can you keep your promise okay the lead-in has this opportunity for you to say hey you opened here's what we promised we would give you again like you're offering them some thing don't [ __ ] that relationship up this is a really good opportunity to follow through you're developing literally synaptically this conditioning you're helping them pattern match toward trust help them do that the fold is real I'm a designer for me to say this is like anathema but it's real just make sure that in above the fold you are actually providing information that helps them scroll scrolling is real but your design your email should be responsive so that the appropriate information is above the fold so they will drive down toward more content is it working if you have a 2 megabyte image no it is not working it is failing this is happening do not do that if you have text that is tiny that I cannot read I'm 39 I have awesome glasses but their glasses and I can't read tiny text please improve your readability in your email headings headings are something that your customers will use to be able to move through the email so you must obey the context the context is this at least 70% of the email is being received in a mobile context this is a utility context okay so if I want to go into the grocery store I'm sitting in line is it appropriate for me to have an intimate long conversation with the clerk with three people behind me no I've had to learn this I like to talk so the context for email is utility so make sure that your headings are such that people can scan the content you guys I hope you know this movie it's one of the best movies ever made so make it scannable what this means is that use your headings to be things that get people's attention and communicate clearly as they can quickly scan down the email and then go back to the top and read the whole thing again all right is it doing its job every heading has to do a very specific job every part of the email is being hired by your customer with their time to do a job maybe it needs to be funny maybe it needs to be intriguing maybe it needs to be clear and useful you know that based on your audience because you got to know the suck alright body content thank you thank you content is Jedi you've heard content is king Kings would have their ass whooped by the Jedi okay content is Jedi content as we would talk about here a lot is imperative to being able to really communicate with your customers so couple of questions here one how many of you send out email newsletters and then that content just lives in an inbox and doesn't go anywhere on the web where it can be used again I'm in that camp right so we've got to figure out ways to get that content and get it out there it's valuable so use it keep in mind that your content is what people are hiring your email to do for them and so let's take care of it if you don't have something valuable to say then write an email and say we didn't have anything valuable to say and so we'd like to give you a joke today because maybe we should all laugh a little more like there's opportunity for that if you just hire somebody who doesn't understand your customer and doesn't understand your product to run your emails you are failing stop it why are you screaming so why are you screaming this is just a beautiful little image thank you Internet Seth Godin at a conference called Brooklyn beta said to me why would you scream at the people who are just constantly trying to block out the noise when when you could just whisper to the people that are dying to hear what you have to say it's just always stuck with me and it's a paraphrase but it's just really powerful so figure out what it is that your customers are waiting to hear and say that directly to them and the people who are on the fringes let them on so describe let them fall away and keep going after that strong organic traffic curate your content doesn't have to be original people value your ability to know good information when you see it gather it and give it to them that's a huge opportunity that's what really good emails is based on promote others you know there's just incredible ability to say hey these other guys are doing great you know next week we're gonna promote some really cool things that are happening at appSumo why because it's cool to be cool like that's it like just there's opportunities to do that you don't need to always tie everything to business you know right what's missing so I said this before but this is the thing like maybe in a legal in a legal context like if you're a law lawyer firm law firm you have the opportunity to speak with a voice that's compassionate maybe if you are a non-profit you have the opportunity to speak with comedy that doesn't happen very much when you're talking about orphans you know like there's real opportunity to change things up to be fresh to speak to what's missing links links are gifts there are little opportunities I like to think about them as passports to travel they give you an opportunity to go somewhere either to your site from this email an open door or to find somewhere new so let's look at this little gift I actually don't remember why I put this given other than that this is the most amazing gift on the internet and can we just can we watch that one more time no yes okay watch carefully this is incredible scoot I just I just think that's amazing okay so but links are gifts maybe that's a gift to me here's something that happens a lot click here means nothing it is a door that says open the door don't do this please make your links intentional reasonable and effective and help people understand clearly this is where I'm going CTA I would like to propose that we rethink the whole way that these things work this is something that especially marketing teams drive toward without reservation they just constant we've got to have more CTA we've got to drive this CTA CTAs should serve your audience and if they don't they are [ __ ] it up like get to your customers and start earning loyalty and Trust and you will watch that CTA percentage rise but if we are only worried about the number we're really missing the point we've seen this over and over again at really good emails for us the CTA is exciting when it is it drives curiosity and it makes people laugh and they're like what's behind door number three that's how we do it for our audience for Walmart who one of our clients not so much they've got to be extremely direct about what they do and they've got to tell the customer in the CTA this is what's happening now and that's really helpful that's a service to the customer twenty-five CTAs not a service this is going to incite decision paralysis choose one or two CTAs make it really clear change up the wording on your CTA so that you have variation that you can test and know more about if all else fails be really good just be a good human being this is not hard there is probably only three [ __ ] in this room I don't know who you are but most of us are cool I [ __ ] love you people thank you you

how many of you have heard of first round capital you have cool a lot of you guys so when we were starting our company first round capital is a great place a great place to turn to because they do these really in-depth blog articles about some of the problems that their founders are going through and how they've overcome them and it's an incredible resource and basically by the way if you don't know a first round is there a EC fund with about a hundred seventy million dollars in assets and they fund early-stage startups and they decided a couple years ago to go really big with content because they wanted to be a huge or they want to be a thought leader in the VC and in the startup space and so that's why they launched their blog and since then they've kind of exploded where they have something like six or seven hundred thousand people a month coming to their site mostly entrepreneurs coming to learn about how people have overcome this or overcome that and it's become a really fantastic resource and so we thought it'd be a great idea to bring out Camille who runs their blog it's their only a team of two and I'll ask her a couple questions and I've got my phone here and so I've got a few questions prepared but I know that you guys probably do as well and so you can go just go ahead and tweet a question and use the hashtag con-con I don't use the hashtag con-con so hashtag co and co n and after about five or ten minutes I'll start looking at my phone and we can answer some of our questions so let's give it up for Camille nice to see you all all right Camille I've already kind of explained to people what first round is and what you guys are doing but can you give your your 30 second background of of what the what the site is what the blog is and what you do there sure absolutely um first round is a seed stage venture capital fund we try to write the first check to a lot of promising companies out there were sector agnostic so it really is across all sectors and about four years ago we got big into content with the first round review that's when I joined and our whole theory was that what was it that founders really needed what is it that they really wanted they wanted to be able to go to coffee with the excellent top thought leaders in this particular industry who could tell them exactly what they had done to get where they were today so we were thought well how can we have our founders go to coffee at scale with this type of person we can interview them and make that content available on a large scale on our site so that was what we were trying to do and we've been lucky to have some success so far and it's a team how about you're a team of two we're a team of two it's me and my colleague Sean Young yes and we write all of the content in-house ourselves which has been challenging but a good experience and how many pieces of content a week do you produce we do one to two a week usually - and they're all interview based so this is all us going spending an hour with the people we're featuring on the site I'm asking them really in-depth questions and then publishing what they say and what's the length of each article average 3,000 to 4,000 words and these are not transcripts of interviews it's literally like reported like lots of additional context woven in so I'm gonna ask you a few questions about the length because long-form is is pretty difficult one thing that I've noticed as a theme of today today's event is a process which I want to learn about but actually first can you explain you guys started in a unique way can you explain to me what your launch strategy was when you first got it going yeah so we had dabbled a little bit in content basically what we're doing is first founders running a lot of events like we had an event called design + startup or we'd have an amazing designer come and speak for like 20 minutes and then we would write an article sort of based on what that person had said and the more tactical that talk was and the more tactical the resulting article was the more audience we would get so we thought okay people really have an appetite for like this is exactly how you do said thing and then the longer that we ended up writing about that stuff like literally the amount of detail that we would include the more popular those articles would get so that's how we ended up with sort of this long-form strategy and then when we decided okay we are go full-bore on this strategy we actually ran a launch around first-round review where we reached out to reporters said you know this is a new type of publication for VCS we got some coverage there and then we also emailed about 30,000 people which was like everyone that any of us had ever met haha we did not exactly spam literally the language we used was you will never hear from us again but this is a very cool thing that we think you'd be interested in please sign up if the spirit moves you and we ended up getting 8000 subscribers like in that first week excellent yeah and how many subscribers you have now we have a hundred and thirty-five thousand perfect it worked and the next question that I wanted to talk about and I actually see a couple people are tweeting me about it it's about freelancers and we had a lively discussion about that and someone asked about finding writers and finding specifically copywriters and for early-stage startups how there how can they actually afford to get the content that they think that they need so can you tell me about why first-round decided to invest in it how those what's the ROI been and how you would recommend other early-stage startups to do something similar totally this is a question I get all the time I end up advising between like three and five of our startups at any given time about content and it's definitely a popular question first rounds a little non-traditional because we're not trying to drive conversion necessarily our content is all about brand awareness well do you think this would work for a conversion driven I think so I think that if you have a content platform that is high utility like I'm really strong I strongly believe that if you're doing branded content it has to be like deeply emotional and by that I mean like people are crying they are emailing their best friend saying you have to see this piece of content which is very hard to do or it has to be extremely high utility which is your audience really wants to accomplish something and you are giving them the information they need to accomplish that if you are doing that then I think that your brand is gonna win with content okay and what about launching a team like you have at us company yeah I think in order to find the right writers for you I'm a big I'm a big advocate of bringing writers in-house if you're serious about doing content just because they can really marinate in your culture really understanding who your audience is on a greater greater basis basically then freelancer is necessary going to get exposure to so if you do bring a team in-house you definitely want to find somebody who can write in your style always give them an assignment during the interview process that is actually going to map to what it is you want them to do see how that goes that would be my top recommendation for finding someone and when we started we used freelancers and I've found that it does not work very well I know a lot of people feel that way it's actually really really really hard to get freelancers because it takes a long time to train them so you guys do not use freelancers you have you know you know that another person and I imagine you might be hiring more soon I'm not sure but you can you tell me how you're able to train your new folks yeah I would say that editing the editing process is the easiest way to teach somebody how to write in a particular style it is very hard to describe a voice to somebody like this is the way we write and then you use a bunch of adjectives that people will not and be like yeah yeah fun frolic II okay but what you need to do is sit down with them after they've written something and then take the time invest the energy and going through line by line and talking to them about the opportunities that they might have had to then write more on your voice and giving specific examples so when Sean first joined me on the review for the first three stories he wrote we would sit down and like talk about past examples of stories that I had written why I thought that this particular expression of an idea would be more successful and now people say that our writing styles are pretty indistinguishable perfect so it worked and so how long would you spend going over each piece editing I think those first three pieces we would spend like two hours plus on going through them and you would just literally sit right next to them on your Google Docs or whatever yeah and we would talk about every line of the piece and now and then after that happened we did an exercise where Sean would edit pieces and I would edit Sean's pieces and see what each other had changed so now I write like Sean just as much as Sean writes like me that's crazy cool and so let's go back to the the long form bit because okay so 3,000 words yes for every article yeah that's way different than how a lot of people do things yeah I'd say that the vast majority especially in technology is very snackable sort of short items okay what I mean in and so let's just assume that I have no idea this is true but let's say that you make fifty two thousand dollars so that's $1,000 a week so it's like each article is a thousand dollars yeah it's a fare and then add in although $52,000 isn't even is not reasonable let's just go ahead and double it for cost of employees so two thousand dollars per article that's incredibly expensive can you tell me how how you're justifying this and why you go the long form around gosh that is another example in which I think first round we've been very fortunate at first round because they kind of give us free reign to do a lot of what we want to do and we don't have to produce ROI and sort of the traditional way but we have just found that the long form format provides outsized value to the audience's that we want to serve and since that's really the mission of first run to be in service of founders we found that this is the best way to get them the information that they need and desire perfect and so actually someone asked a question I see okay someone asked a question that I I didn't even think of and it's and it's super interesting and it kind of goes back to the freelancer stuff but how many of you out here have tried user-generated style content so a fair bit so a lot of people think at least that I think they think this that a user-generated it's almost like it's almost like you're cheating the system because you're getting lots of free stuff yeah right it's like well we've got like millions of users there's only a small percentage of people submit stuff then you we've got free search traffic right but typically I found it typically doesn't work like that at least some in our case it doesn't how many people submit have tried to submit work to you guys and why have you chose not to accept it we have but quite a few people submit work and that includes like CEOs of major companies saying like hey I wrote something maybe it would be right for first-round review are you interested we are really committed to the style of the articles that we have set on first-round review which is to be very tactical everything that we run has to be actionable right away and so usually we'll explain to the people who want to submit things that you know we like to write everything in-house in order to conform to those particular standards I think that user-generated content can work but it has to work in particular formats so especially if you are looking for short form content and you can give people enough specific parameters then you can get submissions that will work for you I have found that it is incredibly difficult and this we've really tried UGC also from like the people who participate in our mentorship programs or we have a workshop or product managers in New York and these are extremely smart people but a lot of it requires a lot of editorial support and speaking of getting tactical what I like about first rounds website is that you guys I mean it's beautiful to look at very readable I mean that's a content nerd in me speaking but you have in like your pop-ups are very noticeable and they actually aren't annoying thank you the nicest thing you could have said yeah that's my compliment can you tell me about some of the so if you guys got a first round first round calm you'll you'll see the site and basically you see all these like it's a it's basically a big pop up that pop-ups when you like scroll about halfway down it's pretty engaging can you tell me about some of the tools that you guys use on your site because it seems like it's working really well absolutely thank you for saying that by the way because pop-ups are a huge point of concern for me readability is my number one priority when it comes to anything that has to do with first-round review and so anyone telling me that they were going to put a full-page pop up in the middle of somebody's reading experience I think to myself will that better be a very nice pop-up so we use we rely on a service called bounce exchange to serve our email capture campaigns they do an extremely nice job and the real benefit that they provide is that they'll do all the a/b testing for you and then optimize tests along the way so that you're always getting the best possible what's that mean you basically give them access to your website yes we have given them access to our website and our MailChimp account and so they're constantly testing language and then they'll use the winning campaign and run a different test on top and you don't touch it they literally do everything they literally do everything I have a monthly call with them where we go through the winning campaigns and I can kind of tell them well I like this not that I like this not that okay so you use balance exchange what else the other tools that I real and we use MailChimp for all of our email campaigns it's very user friendly I know it's not deeply sophisticated but it works for us and then also for my editorial calendar I'm a massive massive fan of Trello for editorial calendars so that's it only those three things those three things it's a pretty scrappy act over at first round and the site's built on top of WordPress actually we work with a boutique development firm called mark key if anyone out there is looking for any sort of like custom built beautiful content destination type stuff I highly recommend them go to mark Eby they're incredible team what about posting to social we actually do that all ourselves like straight on the platforms literally TweetDeck is the most sophisticated tool that we use for social and after you've created this 3,000 word article which is pretty awesome what are you guys doing after that yeah it's a whole we have a whole regimen after we push publish on something we will send out an email on MailChimp to our 130,000 subscribers and those emails are very focused like just go read this one article all the links go to that one article really does funnel a lot of people in that direction and then we will publish across our social media channels LinkedIn and Twitter the most impactful for us so we focus on those and we are constantly remarketing our content so on the day that we publish we'll probably promote on Twitter three to five times and we'll do it the day after as well and we will use different pieces of content within each post like the pull quotes or bulleted lists and we will pull those and put those on Twitter to give people a sense of what they'll find we always called that I think I told you this the sawdust a method I love that where you you invest all this money and time into this one big thing and now you just break it up into smaller and smaller and smaller pieces and try to capture value ya give value in that way and honestly like inspirational quotes or sound buy it's like those really they catch fire on Twitter more than anything else so the more you have those in your content and are able to put those on Twitter and then have the link to the full posts or to piggyback on how catchy that quote is the more successful that will be and another theme which we're kind of talking about now that people have talked about is the tools that they use to get stuff done now similar to tools what education services what pieces of Education or resources do you use to learn about how to become better at your craft or to onboard and train your people other than obviously editing yeah I am constantly learning because I think that we all work in an industry that is moving extremely fast right now like content is becoming something that people are increasingly relying on and there's all this new knowledge all the time so for SEO you can't do better than moz.com if you read all of it literally going back you will know everything there is to know about SEO and then for social I rely on the buffer blog I think they do an incredible job over there and lastly for anything to do with marketing I like this website that not very many people seem to have heard of called marketing experiments calm where literally they just showcase like experiments that other people have run and explain why a certain type of strategy ended up winning which is really helpful and speaking of that what have you guys test it on first round that has worked that you thought was totally gonna fail or not make it any a big not make a difference actually we experimented recently with doing compilations of old articles like we had only run totally original content for like three and a half years and then one of my colleagues with my colleague Sean who I told you about went on paternity leave and left me to do this all by myself and I thought gosh how am I going to extend my own capacity I know I'll aggregate my old content into new content by creating lists of it and I thought it was gonna do super poorly and it turns out that some of them have done better than actual articles that I've written that definitely was gonna do better I did not predict that honestly I was like ooh everyone's gonna know that I'm kind of skimping here and it turned out to be a winner yeah what were the headlines Oh things like six must-reads to scale yourself as a manager that obviously don't work that one I ended up getting shared like eight thousand times which is like more than most of the actual original content it kind of made me angry we have this guy who works with us and he like spent like hours and hours and hours working on this one thing and then this one long article and then he wrote this other article where this was before he worked for us was like the amount of money bands charge for a private performance there's and that's literally it was a headline and then just a photo and that got a million views and like that's just how it works so like typically I've found the stuff that gets popular you have no idea that it's gonna get popular oh yeah there are definitely post where I'm like this one is going to be amazing and is gonna go viral and then it totally flops and then some very unassuming stuff has been totally incredible yeah it always that's it seems like that's a trend and so that's why we're always just like just put it out and you never know like we have an article that just talks about like what a billion dollars literally looks like like a billion dollars in cash like what's it look that yeah it's like interesting quite like because it took only like ten minutes to literally like it literally took ten minutes to produce you think that's that's a low value but that's not always the case yeah that's definitely true okay so Kathleen wants to know when when you were building your team out did your manager your boss give you free rein to do whatever you want and do you think that was actually the right move gosh I'm a little bit biased I think on the answer this question I definitely got free rein it helps to have a boss who is not a content specialist or marketer at all I'm lucky enough to report to one of the partners at first round so he his expertise lies elsewhere and whenever I come to him with an issue like this like oh I'm gonna hire a teammate he's like well you're the authority on this subject good luck with that and I've actually really appreciated that like he's a sounding board when I need somebody who has an outside perspective but for the most part he really trusts my judgment which has been nice so you you were trusted because you know your your new guy who worked for you he he wasn't the guy who works through Sean he did not know what he was doing necessarily he was and he was new to the game he was new to the game he's not a professional content marketer yeah did you give him free rein I did very soon after we did that editorial exercise that I told you about where we really got into the same rhythm with our writing he inspired a lot of trust the way that I found him was that we posted on medium not just a traditional job description but it really was a JD as a story like this is the type of person that I'm looking to meet and this is how I hope our relationship will go and Sean ended up responding and writing well-crafted and loving sort of note back to me that really demonstrated how artful he was in his writing and it was clear to me that he was going to be capable of doing what we needed to do and so it really only took about three weeks from onboarding him and editing three times you said and then it was free Raina for that did you help him select topics we definitely are each other's brain trusts so even with headlines we will bandy back and forth some ideas we sit right next to each other so when we are thinking of topics we will gut check them with each other so it is really really collaborative but for the most part I really do trust his judgment to go after things that he thinks are going to be interesting someone asked looks like Matt has asked why or not why but how you do your interviews and I know that you told me a little bit about the process and it was like pretty in-depth yeah the way that we've sort of classified this is a it's a three tier interview process to make sure that we get to the level of granular detail and depth that we want which is really important for our stories so the first tier is whenever you ask anybody a question they're likely to give you just a response you know you ask them like oh hey how do you do your social media and they're like yeah we tweet two times we post on Facebook one time a day etc the second tier is then to be like well what is the language that you use or how do you do that some question that sort of annotates or embroiders the answer that they just gave you to the first question and then once you have that you ask them now give me an actual example of you doing that and that's how you end up getting to a lot of really good proven material and how long does that process take we usually have interviews that are just an hour long like we end up interviewing people who are like the CTO of Instagram or the CEO of Reddit so these people don't have a lot of time so we will tell them like it will be just one hour and and we promise and we try to get extract as much material as we possibly can in that hour and did you say I don't think I heard you say you don't let them review we do you do yes but I would say that the most impactful part of the process in order to get quality content was sharing the questions with them beforehand so usually part of our process is that we will do a pre call with everybody where we actually decide on the topic that we're gonna pursue together in tandem and then based on that I'll write a list of questions send it back to them but before I shared the questions with people the interviews were not nearly as high-quality that like changed the whole game for me okay so we have a few more minutes so make sure to tweet in your questions now oh here's a good question what so like a lot of a lot of the things that people have talked today it's about tactics and strategies and those and the tactics at least change quite a bit right you've been you used to work at VentureBeat I did so you've been doing this for a little while so you've seen a lot of different cycles what has what strategies have remained the same that you do not think are gonna change for another 10 years I think quality content has pretty much meant the same thing this whole time that content is either useful or it is not it is either well-written or it is not I don't think the definition of good writing has necessarily budged that much in a decade how that content is packaged and how its distributed I think is where the bulk of the changes happen and will continue to happen but in terms of like this is something good that I feel value has value for me and is something I want to share that in itself I think we all have like a good sense of because we make those decisions for ourselves all the time every day so DJ asked a question that I didn't even think about but we get it all the time and I would love to hear your answer why text and not video that's a great question um so I've been doing content for a while as Sam said as a journalist and then I also ran content for a nonprofit called Kiva where we were packaging all kinds of stuff texts photos videos from 68 countries around the world and so I got to test a lot of stuff side by side and video is an enormous investment upfront and it actually doesn't perform that well because if you think about it like it's not a passive form of communication like people can't be really doing something else while they're consuming it like audio which I'm actually very interested in so you would spend a lot of time maybe spend a lot of money and get less bang for your buck on video and that has still been the case in my experience I do think audio is very interesting text I think is particularly useful for us because we want people to be able to refer back to it very easily when they are facing the situation in which that advice is relevant and therefore our articles serve as sort of an evergreen manual they're able to call back up we could ask that all the time and an video certainly serves a purpose but we're all in on text at the moment because you just kept you can capture a lot of value for a very long time and when people read out or people when they you many do should at work you're normally reading not watching like an eight-minute video but you can like hide in eight-minute read from your boss that's for sure yeah exactly exactly right all tab yeah it's easier to hide a read that it is a hide an eight minute video yes okay last question and this is a very specific tactical one that I forget who the name is Ethan ass and do you guys so a lot of what a lot of publishers do is they pay money to boost their posts on Facebook is all of your stuff organic or do you actually pay money you've been really lucky to have it be all organic that said for several of the startups that I had eyes especially those who want to drive a lot of conversion with their content and therefore need to run a lot of rapid experiments in order to see what's gonna work I highly advise paid content because that allows you to drive enough traffic to actually get meaningful results to your tests but we've been really lucky to have all organic from the beginning perfect well I appreciate you doing this and taking the time and are you gonna be hanging out for a little bit I think I will yes well well oh and the very first question someone asked that I didn't address yet but they said that your dress looks awesome and they wanted to know where you got it oh my gosh thank you to whoever said that I think it was Chris Kristina who asked that Margaret sorry Margaret Margaret that's so nice ModCloth there you go you got your answer well huge thanks for doing this thank you it's really an honor to be here and thank you so much [Applause]

so I missed it when when Sam asked how many people have heard of the penny holder can you guys do that again awesome that is so cool to see because if I had asked that question and I'm room this size two and a half years ago when he first started scaling the company I would not have seen nearly that many hands so today I'm gonna share with you how we turned what started as a bootstrap to personal finance blog into a digital media company with millions of readers the pending order is a Content site we help readers earn and make money in interesting ways and we use storytelling to do that so we use storytelling to make personal finance fun my background is in journalism and while my data dated now doesn't include that much writing I am a writer at heart like many of you how many of you guys are writers awesome cool so I feel I feel that with you we got that in common about six years ago I left mainstream media to use my content creation skills in a different way in a more entrepreneurial way so I launched a Content agency that helped other companies grow their blogs and a few years into that venture we brought on what we thought was a pretty cool client called the penny order it was founded by a guy named pirate Kyle Taylor and over the next year and a half our relationship grew when we are creating more and more content for the site to the point where Kyle ended up acquiring my company and bringing in-house myself several members of our team and our processes around creating content I also had a baby around that time so it was a really busy year when I first started working with Kyle that was in 2014 and this is what the website looked like then very different from what it looks like now a lot has changed since then as San mentioned I was the third employee and we now have more than 80 employees and actually this week on Tuesday we announced via a press conference that we're going to hire more than 160 positions in st. Petersburg Florida over the next three years we see about 16 million unique readers every month and last year we brought in 20 million dollars in revenue this year we are on track to nearly double that and because of that growth the Inc 5000 has named us as the fastest growing media company in 2016 and again this year 2017 so how did we go from what started as really a one-man personal blog and turn that into a digital media company today I'm going to share with you two answers to that question the first is having mission driven content and the second is developing the right processes so you can scale and create that content my goal here really is to give you guys some actionable ideas and strategies that you can take back with you to grow your own businesses anyone here if you're like--you're your company has a strong mission let's see a show hands it's a few okay cool so having a strong mission is really important especially for a content driven company because it's gonna help you better serve your readers and it's gonna help you keep all of your content feeling really cohesive but it's also good for your bottom line because having a strong mission helps you figure out what decisions you need to make for your company and this is our mission to put more money in our readers pockets and well I just told you how much has changed over the last three years well this is something that hasn't really changed we've really stayed true to this mission and it's I guess it's our guiding star if you will so if you walk around our halt the halls of our new office in st. Pete in Florida you will actually hear people asking this question does this put more money in our readers pockets I'll give you a few examples you will hear this question in at our editorial meeting so every morning we have a number of what we call editorial stand-ups there are quick meetings where the editors are going over what content we're going to cover that day and we might talk about a pizza deal there's a pizza deal we heard about you get free pizza is that gonna put more money in our readers pockets and if the answer is yes it might be something we'd cover likewise we might hear about a woman who figured out a cool way to make some extra money on the weekend and maybe she is collecting dog hair from her around her house and making money about dog hair that is by the way a real thing that we have written about does that help put our more readers and more money in our readers pockets is sharing her story and giving the tips of how she managed to do that is that gonna help our readers and if the answer is yes that's something we consider doing you'll also hear this question in our advertising meetings so we get approached by a lot of advertisers who want to work with us to reach our readers and they want to they want to tell our readers about their products or their services and so our business employees they might say should we work with a certain advertiser and this is the question that they'll ask they'll ask is this gonna help our readers this is gonna put more money in our readers pockets one of our advertisers for example is lift lift is a driving service and so when they we first started thinking about whether we should work with them this is the question we had asked is this actually gonna help our readers to make money so our goal when you work with advertisers is we're not asking our readers to spend or asking them they're helping them to make or save money because our readers really trust us right that's that's why this whole business works they trust us to give them great information that's gonna help them in their life so we have to make sure that when we decide to work with an advertiser it also meets meets this threat this threshold and finally we talked about this on our on our product team so we're always trying to think about what new features do we want to add to the website and we just added a new feature that is very much in line with what I'm talking about today internally we call it money in your pocket if you go to the website and you scroll down on any blog post you will see a bar at the bottom that says does this article or did this article put more money in your pocket and the reader can choose a thumbs up for guess or a thumbs down for no and what we're thinking about this this feature we ask this question is this gonna put more money in our readers pockets and the answer is yes because it lets us collect data that helps us do our jobs better so when readers answer that question it's a way for us to get direct feedback from them and we use that feedback loop to continue to feed them the information that they want they need so having a this this question around your mission it can it's amazing if you lean into that how it can help you make decisions I want to show you what a mission a good mission looks and feels like so this 60-second video it shows you a number of our staffers and they're reading notes from our readers so we often hear from people around the world who have used penny hoarder information to make a change in their life and that's what we're talking about in this video so have a look I love this website you guys are amazing I cannot tell you how much I learned and the different leads you have provided that have helped me have helped me it helped me thanks to you I've been able to save and make extra cash thank you the penny hoarder you saved me two hundred and seventy seven dollars on an EpiPen wow that's a lot of money just wanted to say thank you your post on companies hiring work from home led me to a great company that I started with three days ago I have to say thanks to the penny hoarder just got one hundred and twenty eight dollars from a class-action lawsuit nicely done we just received a settlement check for almost fifty dollars thanks to the penny order because of the penny hoarder I was hired for one of the full time work from home physicians and just started working for leaf force love the penny hoarder thanks so much for sharing and we love you [Music] thank thank you Thanks thank you come on gracias thank you thank you oh that's the first time I've seen that on the big screen and it gives me boost goosebumps you notice at the end calf one of our employees she's actually here with us today she kind of got choked up at the end because our employees feel really passionate about this mission of helping our readers put more money in their pockets and I bet that's I guess a bonus of having a strong mission it will lead it will drive your business but it also helps with employee morale and that means you're gonna be able to retain your top talent so what is your mission driven question that's something I want you guys to think about what question can you ask at your company that's gonna help you make decisions and while it's awesome if you're making decisions the the leader of the company you also want to empower your employees to make decisions so if you have a question that they can use to make decisions on your behalf that's that's even better once you have that question what do you do with it how do you create how do you develop the workflow to create amazing mission driven content that's what we'll talk about next we do that at the penny order through process by having a really defined workflow that helps us create great content and the example you're seeing here today this is a really personal example to me because this is the process that we used when when my company was acquired by the penny hoarder and my company was not purchased because it was the biggest agency it was certainly not the most well known the reason why the penny hoarder was interested in us was because we had this really good process that was scaleable and that we could use to get bigger and bigger so what you see here this this is what we started with and this is what has become the foundation for a growing editorial department and I'll walk you through it we talked about creating an idea and writing the content and editing the content at the beginning most of our content was written so we always thought about it as an a text with a text laser-focus after writing we would optimize for SEO format and WordPress so that the post looks great add photography publish and then promote on social or email marketing having a process like this will work will help you will benefit you no matter how big you are can I see a show of hands how many people in this room are one man or one woman shops who do every piece or almost every piece of this on your own wow that's awesome this is a room of hustlers that's how I started my agency as well so when you are a one-person shop your time literally is money having a process like this that's efficient is going to help you do things more quickly and better but it's also good once you've grown so at the penny order now we have a number of people for each of these roles so we have lots of writers lots of editors an entire SEO department a PR department social media department and having a process like this helps all those people work together so everyone knows what their role is in the process and how they can contribute to it just because you create a great process doesn't mean you can't change it in fact you should really change it as you grow so as you learn as you improve you should make tweaks to your process and these are a couple examples of how our process has changed you see the first step is different in both of these examples right and one we now sometimes start we start the story the idea the story comes not from a writer but from other parts other content creators amongst the company for example we sometimes do photo essays so one of our photographers wanted to feature a work from home mom and what does it really like to work from home when you have kids running around it made for some great photos and it was very mission driven so she started that story it started with photos and then she worked with other members of our team to add the text and other components and like was on the right side you see sometimes now we actually start ideas from our SEO department so previously we used to optimize for SEO after the content was created and now a lot of the ideas that we execute they come into us from our SEO folks and our lead SEO guy he's awesome he has an editorial background so he's able to make sure that that content is really mission driven while also helping us appear up higher in search results and I'll give you a quick example he noticed that we could rank for best cars for college students and so he suggested that to the editorial team they ran with it created a post around it and now that ranks on the first page of Google so right now if you're the leader at your company or a leader in some fashion it's probably up to you to create these processes right you're thinking about what workflow do I need to create but the real end game is to create a culture where all of your employees want to participate there too and they want to be the ones who are creating the processes and that's what I'm so proud about the penny hoarder is we have really a process dominated culture where the employees are the ones without being prompted to say we need a process for this or we need a better way better workflow for for this piece and it's really cool to see that because when that happens it means that you have specialists around your company who are creating the processes for what they do every day instead of the person at the top dictating how it should look they know their job better they know their job best right and so they can create a better workflow and a better process for it it also gets a media buy-in sometimes it's hard to get employees to want to follow processes but if they're the ones who create it they're gonna be really enthusiastic about following that to a tee and training others on how to follow it as well these are some of the tools that we use to communicate within our process some of them are probably familiar to a lot of you guys slacking was a popular one we use slack to get out of email for all internal in communication and a few ways that we that we use slack to communicate throughout our process is we have different channels for each of our editorial teams so our editorial team we basically operate like a newsroom we have teams of writers and editors and they each have their own channel in slack where they can talk discuss topics talk about we're in the process each post might be what elements it needs before I can go go live on the site but we also have company-wide channels so for example we have a channel that's we call ideas or anyone across the entire company can drop in an editorial idea for content and the editorial team will we'll have a look and see if it makes sense to turn that into a story so it can be half-baked it can be a seed of an idea it doesn't have to be well thought out because it might be coming from a develop or developer or someone who doesn't isn't really even a primary content creator but that allows us all to keep our eyes out for great stories wherever we are and share that with our editorial team flow is a task management tool and I think we probably used flow in a way that it wasn't really meant to be used but it has worked for us we create a task in flow for each story and because flow is collaborative once once the writer creates a task for their story they can tag anyone across any other department so that person knows that they can be you they can be utilized in that story for example a writer might tag a videographer and say hey I think there's potential for video here and it would be the video team's job to say yes or no it could work but then they'd know that there's an opportunity there same if we need a graphic or if there's a social component that we can we could loop in so that helps us all talk to each other throughout the content creation process parsley is a Content performance tool it's similar to Google Analytics but it is easier for media companies to use so it's actually created with media companies in mind which means that if someone's a writer an editor who doesn't always isn't used to creating content on a regular basis I'm sorry isn't used to looking at data on a regular basis because they are creating their canta content they can easily go into parsley and find what they need the data that they need to move forward but Google Analytics is maybe maybe some of you here have experienced this it's not always the easiest to use you can't always find exactly what you're looking for if you're not used to digging in there one other cool feature of parsley that we use a lot is it allows you to pull check reports for authors so we have a writer named Dana and if Dana wanted to see what all of her how our posts performed last week she could pull a report that just includes posts that she wrote and that's that's harder to configure in Google Analytics so they make it really easy for you and we use that data to close the feedback loop right so we have this process and every time we we create content were able to look at how it performed we're able to look at the data and then it helps us figure out how to create more content going forward and that's what we use native for as well it's a feedback loop for us native is a testing tool I think actually they have a rep here today but it allows us to test different variations of the content that we've created on Facebook before sharing it with our Facebook page so if we write a post there's lots of different headlines we could try lots of different images we could try we might test different variations of that piece of content with a look-alike audience on Facebook and determine what is the best performer and then we'd share it on Facebook on our on our page so that ideally the idea is then organically it would it will perform better so all these tools have helped us really work together as a team and communicate better throughout the process we're also big users of Google Analytics I'm Sarah I'm sorry of Google Docs Google Analytics - but Google Docs I love Docs because they're so collaborative and they let everyone jump into any piece of content whenever they need to so what you see right now is something a piece of our process that we started way back when and we still use today it's what we call the editing funnel and it's simply a list of folders in Google Docs and we can move posts within those folders depending on what step in the process they're in so you can see we start with step 1 that's when a post is getting edited it goes on to a second editor then it gets warm in a word press and then it's complete and we did start this funnel with step one by the way but over time we tweaked that process and we realized we actually needed to step 0 because we needed a place where he could put Docs that included ideas and posts that we are getting ready to assign this works for us because everyone can see we're in the process different pieces are so it really allows for collaboration amongst the group and finally once you have a solid process look for ways to innovate within that process one way that we've done it at the penny hoarder and this is I love this is really fun it's through Sprint's for we call it a sprint I mean we made that up but it's we call that internally whenever we have whenever we want to get a group of people together and achieve a lot in a short period of time we call it a sprint so it might be an hour or two hours we put on everyone's calendar anyone who's gonna participate bring different players together to achieve a common goal and I remember the first sprint that we ran was at our old office back when we had probably twelve employees and we were we had a lot of content coming through our funnel we had a lot of writers and we were working a lot of freelance writers but we hadn't yet hired enough editors and so we had a bottleneck where we needed a bunch of our posts needed headlines before we could publish them the way we do headlines at the pending order is we have a Google Doc and we all write in lots of different variations of headlines so we give ourselves freedom to fail they can be terrible headlines but the idea is if you write a lot of them you can go back and choose a few that you think might work to test so in this headline sprint we got all the content creators we had in a room it was probably half a dozen of us then and we all worked on the headlines for this group of posts that we're ready to go live besides the headline and if you do that in Google Docs during a sprint the cool thing is everyone else everyone can see what they're what everyone else is doing like you can actually see the headlines being created and so everyone learns like you might learn oh this editor is really good at this piece and how did he make that work or how did he use that word in a headline it gives you ideas you can feed off of each other it's also really good for training employees and when you're at a fast-growing startup where you're always trying to train people if you put a new employee in a sprint they're gonna see how everyone else operates and it's a rate great way to kind of get them up to speed really quickly so in closing I'm hoping that you can think about how these things apply to your business what is your mission and what mission driven question can you ask at your organization that's going to help you create awesome content and finally what processes can you develop that will make that content creation possible if you already have some processes in place this is a great opportunity to come back and and redefine them make sure that they are as strong as they need to be peel back some layers go a little deeper create a place where all of your employees can participate if you do that well you will put yourself in an awesome position to successfully achieve your mission thank you [Applause]

everyone my name is Adam Ryan I'm the vice president media for the hustle I have the the pleasure of introducing our next speaker who most of you probably know if you're here you definitely know the company that he's created sampar has been a lifelong entrepreneur he started with a chain of hotdog stands in Nashville Tennessee and now oversees the entire hustle operation in San Francisco and Sam started the hustle in his kitchen creating content that was for the purpose of community and since then the hustle has now grown to 500,000 subscribers in our email with industry-leading industry-leading engagement millions of people to our site every month events like this one all across the country and has had the opportunity to hire 17 people while keeping a profitable business that whole time what hasn't changed is the process of how we create content and and how we do that on a daily basis so without further ado Sam par to teach you how we have done that for the last couple years when I first started this company I promised I would never speak at my own conference but on Tuesday Kara asked me to help her out and give a talk because a lot of people had asked about this topic and so here I am I'm breaking my first rule so but that's okay so today what I'm going to talk about is the really really boring stuff that everyone should think about and use if they actually want people to read their writing and what's what's interesting about this topic is that it's like I said pretty boring but the results are what are incredibly useful and so before we get into this I'm gonna I'm gonna assume a couple things and this is who this talks for first it's for people who are novice to medium novice to intermediate when it comes to writing how many of you are doing content marketing because you have something else that you want to sell okay how many of you are in the media space where you're just what you you that is what you're selling is your media okay perfect that that's what I was hoping for so most people are in here because they they have a product that they try to sell and they're trying to get traffic to convert those users so that that's perfect and the last thing is that the assumption here is that you actually want to influence action and get people to read what you're gonna what you're creating now I have to I have to do a quick disclaimer which is so when we started the Hustle originally what we were is we we're now an email that's what we do we have half a million people on our email list but when we first started we were a blog and the idea was we want to create this blog in order to get a lot of email subscribers because we don't have a lot of money so we couldn't pay for it so we just had to use our time and I am NOT a writer I did not study journalism we have people who have at our company but that's not me and so I never considered myself a great writer but what I was always pretty good at was captivating people's attention and so I studied a ton of books a ton of principles and I thought what what makes people share what grabs people's attention how are the tactics how does that actually work and so what we ended up creating over the years is a process that helps people go from an idea to putting it on paper I'm not going to talk about how to get traffic because a lot of people go do that but I'm literally just gonna talk about the the idea of going from idea to paper because it's incredibly important because a lot of people have really good ideas they just suck at going through the process and although I hope that what you hear me saying makes me sound incredibly intelligent but the truth is I didn't make any of this stuff I'm just stealing it from a ton of different sources and we put it together into our process now before we get into all this I want to let you know that I always feel that the point of getting someone to read something is to make them feel an emotion because the most emotion is what causes action I also won't love using first-person a lot of who here works at a company that's over a thousand people okay cool so if it looks about a third of you so if you are one of those people a lot of times you're gonna get chastised for using first person for a quote sounding not professional I think that's crap I think that you can write in a conversational way while also being incredibly professional and when I think of content I think of your creating a journey almost like you're writing an episode of loss and that's how I think of this this style of content where there's lots of ups and there's lots of downs and you're leading people through this emotional journey because in the end that's how you're gonna get people to act so here's the process that we've created now the hustle when we first started it was we couldn't afford to hire experienced people and so this is the process that we use to train people who were pretty talented but not refined now that we have some more experienced people working things have shifted a little bit but if you're gonna implement this process if you just do this it'll work fine it will work very good and you'll be good to go after a while then you can make your own process but if you just copy this it'll work wonderfully and today what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go through an example of one of our very first blog posts we ever wrote was about a guy named Josh Shelton who lived on Soylent for 30 days if you googled the hustle soil it you'll see this article you'll see exactly what I'm talking about but I'm gonna use this article as an example of this process and we're gonna write this we're gonna rewrite this article has anyone read this cool so basically the idea is Soylent it's a New Age meal replacement and it wasn't meant to live off of but we wanted to make a splash and so we said we basically gave this guy $2,000 and he said are you would you be willing not to eat anything for 30 days and only drink this and blog about it and he said yes so let's start with the headline like I said I told you the idea of the article which was the one-liner was we're gonna get a guy to live on so that for 30 days that's a fine place to start now a lot of people what they do is they write something and then they add the headline that's not the right way to do it because the fact is is that most people find their content on Facebook or search how do you find that through the headline the headline is gonna be read by ninety five percent of people the actual content by five percent of the people that's just the number so let's put a lot more effort into the so it all starts here with the headline for the Soylent one we originally said we're gonna go 30 days living only on toilet that's not gonna be the end headline that's just where we're gonna start that's the idea so you're gonna describe what you're writing about in the headline in one sentence now it actually goes a little bit further we're gonna actually go to the description if you guys go through Facebook you're gonna see there's gonna be a photo there's gonna be a headline and then there's gonna be a one sentence description I think it's a hundred and ninety characters 150 but basically it's one to two sentences that describes a little bit more in depth what your article about so originally we were thinking about productivity so a lot of people particularly my nerdy friends who are engineers they're always trying to maximize productivity and so we thought let's just take this to the extreme and so an attempt to become the most productive person on the planet we are gonna give up food and live entirely off Soylent this article is about how it went I just in two seconds I got your attention with the headline by the high-level what it's about and I gave you a little bit more in the description so what you can do is you can get a Google Doc and you can literally just get a Google Doc you write the headline you write the description now it's time to write the first draft this is where people really screw up writing something is and putting it on the internet with your name on it it's a lot different than writing code and putting it online or it's a lot different than being a sales person because maybe only one or two people see it writing is incredibly scary because potentially millions of people can see what you've done and because of that when people write their draft or when they start writing their blog post they get really stuck like they'll write a sentence and they'll go back and we'll delete it and then about half an hour goes by and they'll really only have two sentences down and they're like these two sentences are perfect now let's go through the rest and that's just incredibly inefficient and so what we tell people is make your first draft horrible so you literally just write so you could say this is verbatim what you can do verbatim what you can write right now I'm writing about Soylent and how it went I'm not sure what I'm gonna say so I guess I'll just start in the beginning I started doing sterlet for this reason and that reason that reason you literally can write that in your first draft you just have to write anything the reason being is once you have motion evidence anyone heard the phrase motion create seem this is what you tell salespeople in their phone they say like talk like walk like this when they're when they're trying to sell something because when you actually start moving it gets it gets things flowing same thing with writing so you you just want to start with a first rap and you just want to write everything it's gonna be horrible just accept that it's gonna be horrible and accept that no one no one is going to see that first draft now you guys are gonna have access to the slide I actually linked the Soylent Post first draft in the slide deck so you can go ahead and see it but you'll see it's really bad now this is another part that is not intuitive to most people which is the incubation period has anyone ever heard of like the idea of shower thoughts or you're in the shower and you're just like washing your hair or something and it just like hits you you just have this you have this thought that happens quite a lot right there there's actually a reason behind this it's called um I believe it's called them forgetting fixation so basically the idea is when you're like your mind could only think of a handful of things at once and you're incredibly incredibly in-depth thinking about this one topic it's really hard to deviate even a little bit which makes it difficult to solve that problem because your own you're going through the same solution no is this solution gonna work no is this solution go to work and yours think about the same stuff in reality the answer it could be just a little bit over here but it's really hard because you're so deep and so what this incubation period does it allows you to kind of expand a little bit and you can have all these other ideas flow through and so what we do is you write your first draft it's gonna be horrible if you have an hour then take an hour and you literally just get up and you just kind of walk around and you just you literally just walk around and think or you go and eat or if you're at home you go take a shower I mean you could do whatever you want yeah sometimes the incubation period if you're a deadline it could be five minutes other times there's me people who have started writing movies working on a script and they come back to it two years later because they just like they had a light bulb moment but just going through the incubation incubation period is incredibly important so we're gonna get to the editing now this is where the important stuff all happens has anyone heard of Ogilvy Mather it's it's like a I don't know how big is it maybe four or five thousand means huge four or five thousand people I mean it's got to be one of the biggest ad agencies in the whole world well Davida movie has a very famous book or many famous books and one of my favorite lines is he's he said that this guy's one of the most famous copy writers of all time and he goes I'm a famous I'm a horrible copy writer but I'm incredibly good at editing why because editing is where you take something that's crap and you turn it to gold and so you can see here with the with the Soylent Post we actually we start cutting everything I mean like you will have us will have a post that starts with two thousand words and he'll end it a thousand words I was talking to Michael from courts back there and he was telling me that sometimes I'll have someone do five paragraphs and I don't only actually use one of them for a story and so editing is where the where the real magic happens now let's dive in deeper into that how do you edit well the first thing that I like to do is I tell our writers you need to create a slippery slope the goal the first sentence is always to get someone to read the second sentence the goal the second sentence is always getting them to read the third sentence it's incredibly important that you get people to slowly go deeper and deeper deeper into your story that's why I said it's kind of like an episode of loss have you noticed how like on like an MTV like my girlfriend watch this watches the show all the time on MTV where you they like are trying to meet they're like magic or they're trying to like meet theirs meet their boyfriend or girlfriend I forget what it's called but uh I noticed that they always end like right before the big reveal there's like a commercial break why they're getting people go down their slippery slope that's kind of what you have to do with writing you want to get them to go deeper and deeper and deeper so how do you do that well with this Soylent post the fact that Soylent is basically like a slim pass but for male nerds that's not like I love Soylent by the way so it's like I I could make fun of it the fact that like that it's slim-fast for men like male nerds that's not really that interesting but the idea of living on it that's kind of cool and so that's the start and then actually explaining what it is that's the second bit and how do we do that well we say like here's what I'm gonna tell you about today but first let me tell you about this that's the first way in which we've created the slippery slope and then we can't we're constantly doing that so you'll see that I'll say like but here's the gist or but first or let me tell you this before we get into it and then you like get some of the some of the meat in there and then you add a little more spice like okay now let's get back to the original question why would I do that so we're constantly adding these things in because if this article started out with soya is a New Age meal replacement that's pretty much slimfast for young nerds and people are drinking it now in this article I'm gonna tell you about why I lived off of it that's not going to really punch you and if you remember we want to get people to feel emotions during this during this article so not the next thing we do in order to after we've done the slippery slope is we want to cut like crazy usually the the blanket rule that I've give people is more likely than not you're gonna cut the first 25% and you're probably gonna cut the last 25% and you're gonna have somewhere right in the middle one of my favorite like I said I pretty much have stolen all my brilliant thoughts but my one of my favorite writers in his book called the on writing Stephen King you guys should all buy that's called on writing by Stephen King he talks about how you need to cut you kill your darlings and so that's kind of we're telling our writers you have to kill your darlings and it's really hard for people because what they think is when they write their first draft that's automatically what's gonna be in the in their article but in reality their first draft is they're just getting all the junk out in the open and then they're gonna find the gold in there and so you actually want to cut most or don't be afraid to cut a lot of stuff and the reason being is the sharper your text is the sharper your copy is the harder it's gonna punch and the more emotions gonna make someone feel and the more likely they'll do whatever you want them to do so how do you start cutting well the first thing is you want to make your first sentence punch someone in the face that's what I always tell people it's gonna be really sharp if you notice when I started this talk my title of the talk it at least caught definitely caught people's attention or at least I hope it did and that was the goal with the Soylent post it was I spent the last 30 days eating nothing but Soylent a New Age meet a New Age meal replacement why would I do something so stupid well that seems like it's going to grab someone's attention as opposed to Sonia New Age Miller placement it's important for this reason of that reason I lived off of it and one thing that I hate about the reason why I'd never considered myself a writer is when I remember being in eighth grade and my teacher saying you have to write an eight hundred word essay and I want you to you I want you to describe like the smell of this flower and I want you to I want you to describe what the day was like and I found myself just filling up space with all these ridiculous words that I never talked about or that I never used like like when I when I tell someone about a story I usually I'll say something like so I said to the guy this this and this I don't say like well I stood up there and I stated this this and this like that why am I gonna write like that let's just seems silly and so it's incredibly important to write simple the New York Times is about in a ninth grade reading level USA Today is about a fourth grade reading level we always have our writer stick between six to eighth grade reading level and how do you do that well there's a app called Hemingway app comm it's totally free you put your text in there and they'll tell you what reading level you're at again to quote on writing by Stephen King any word you got to look up and I always struggle to say this words I'm embarrassed to say it out loud thesaurus I don't know the thoris any word that you have to look up in that big don't use so with the Soylent Post well this was actually in a fourth grade reading level if you read the article it's been shared probably 15,000 times you don't sound stupid at all or the article doesn't sound stupid at all it sounds it sounds very insightful and it's intelligent in the article he talks about philosophy stoicism all this is great important incredibly insightful stuff but it's written in a way that I can talk to my mother or I could talk to a ten-year-old and they'll both grasp it that's incredibly important this is actually something that I learned from courts and I talked to Michael about this before this talk and he agreed that or he told me this is still what they do but it's in my opinion and you could once you learn how to once you get much better at this you can deviate but most posts I like to keep them below 500 words or above 1500 words quartz has wonderful data that shows why this is the case for shorter were shorter articles they're not always going to ring for search but they're really really good for social longer articles are a little bit better for search a lot of people have different reasonings why they why they make a link they make their length a lot of it I believe comes back from when you're in eighth grade and your teacher told you how to be 500 words so they assume 500 words equals quality or they assume length equals quality that's just not that's just false that's wrong just because something is long does not mean it's good and I also like to use short sentences and short paragraphs I'll get even more specific with this I think that most paragraphs should be between two and four sentences and most sentences 25 words or less one of my favorite books to read it's incredibly nerdy but it's a letters to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders so it's basically when did it start maybe 1965 or 1960-1961 Buffett you can buy this big old fat book and it's Warren Buffett it's all of his letters to shareholders Warren Buffett we can all agree is at least incredibly intelligent at most a genius or at best a genius so he's intelligent and what I've actually spent time doing this is a very nerdy thing as I documented the average word per sentence and over the years it's gotten shorter and shorter and shorter and shorter and so you've got a guy like Warren Buffett who's trying to explain people how the insurance industry works cuz he owns Geico and the average length per sentence is 18 words and so the reason why is not only is it incredibly you want things to be simple to read look at this text tell me what which is gonna be more approachable Mike I keep referencing Michael but his are his talk he talked about readability which one of those is going to be more intimidating to read it's secondly or not secondly but to further the point of being simple and to make people feel and I actually am a victim of this I do this all guilty of this I do this all the time a lot of people use adverbs a lot they do this because this is again another stupid thing that you're told to do at eighth grade but in reality it's it's you don't need to do it you can have some adverbs for sure but you don't want to have too many adverbs the reason being is it softens your point so like one of my favorite books Great Gatsby if you go and read that book it'll say something like she felt great this made him feel wonderful you don't need a lot of these ly words because they make you they make you sound they make your point they soft in it big time I think that uh and I love quoting Stephen King because the book had a big big influence in my life he believed it's he's the one who said this but it's basically the road to hell is paved in add in adverbs so now back to the headline so what we've done in this process is we created our headline we create our description we wrote our draft we went back and we edit it and so we have a pretty good piece of work now what we're gonna do is go back to your headline that headline that you originally wrote probably doesn't accurately describe your article anymore or maybe it does but you could have gone made it a little bit better but we're gonna go back to the headline similar to the draft of just getting just dumping out a ton of stuff and finding gold that's all we're gonna do our headline right 25 of them literally in a dock run out 25 headlines then you could do like there's software that you can do we can like post all 25 of them and someone will like it'll like tell you which ones best based off like a thousand people voting you don't need to do that just write it all out send it to your front of Facebook or a messenger what I always use or to your peers sitting next you turn your screen and say pick one of these which ones do you like do that to the person next to you that's probably good enough and so that's gonna be your new headline so in the case with this I wrote up there any headlines and the one number seven so that what happened when I went 30 days without food that's the one who won that that one I actually in real life I didn't pick this one until like number 25 because when you have to do 25 you get past a whole bunch of crap and then you start getting more creative and then you get to maybe number 15 18 20 and then you start finding some gold after a while at this point I'm pretty good with headlines I can kind of write maybe three four or five but for a long time I really wrote 25 headlines every single time then we're gonna pick our image a lot of people struggle with picking an image because they don't realize how important it is so not every image needs to be a shirtless guy like this because that doesn't fit every every brand but you have to make your image great a lot of people use really boring logos or they use stock images of like like you know like what I'm talking about it's like like a woman wearing like a suit and it looks - a man wearing a suit with mugs and they're like shaking hands yeah you know what I mean like it's stupid don't do that it's so in order to make it better a really simple thing is you can use Google basically search Google click tools click photo size use large the truth is is that you could be breaking a couple copyright rules by using someone else's image but you might get away with it if you're a little bit bigger of a company like we have actually just started to go through this which we we try not to use images because I don't want to get sued but you can get away with it you're small but but if you really want to do this the right way go to unsplash.com they have literally tens of thousands of wonderful images they're all high-quality you'll see it and in terms of traffic I'm not gonna touch too much on traffic because I know other people gonna talk about it but Facebook is the most important we have a chill I have a joke in my office I hope no one works there but I call I call it Twitter [ __ ] because we never get traffic from Twitter no one gets traffic from Twitter sorry does anyone work here at Twitter okay sorry it's wonderful for a lot of other reasons for getting traffic it sucks but hey look my twitter handle is down there the same part you could tweet I mean we talk but don't send me an article because like most people no one's gonna click on it so the way you optimize for Facebook is you have to have a wonderful image and we talked about the headline then we talked about the description you're already in the mindset of optimizing for Facebook ask some of these other people who are talking and they'll probably agree that 80% of their traffic maybe 90% of the traffic that comes from social is coming from Facebook and finally if you need inspiration one of my favorite things is to do to do is called copy work so the idea here being when you does anyone here play piano who plays piano you play piano when you learn how to play piano did you start by writing your own songs or did you start by playing jingle bells jingle bells right there's a reason for that it's really hard just like not know anything and then just start creating your own thing instead you want to copy other people because you start seeing the texture you start feeling how things are done so when you play jingle bells you just kind of do it and then let's say you want to be you want to play rock and roll so then you start copying food fighter songs and then let's say you want to learn funk you start playing James Brown you're like oh my gosh rock and roll I see this chord structure it always goes from like a B D like I see this I see this pattern and then you see this other pattern you start seeing all these amazing patterns and you start getting the feel of it and then you're like I know the way in which a great song is put together and so a same thing with writing what I did one time I locked myself in a room pretty much for six months I found all of my favorite marketing campaigns I spent about two hours a day I wrote them all out by hand this is called copy work this is a very famous technique that is a proven way of learning humans are phenomenal at learning music and this is the exact process in which they do we don't do it for riding anymore but they used to do it in America in the 1800s or so in the up until the mid 1900 so this was actually a way in which a lot of people learn how to write if you read about Judd Apatow he's the director of a lot of like stoner movies pretty funny stuff he did this as well he would write out SNL scripts a lot of authors I know a few authors that would write out Hunter s Thompson books because they liked his voice not everyone wants to dedicate hours a day to do this you don't need to necessarily but if you're stuck find your favorite blogger or find a great artist or a great writer who you like in or or at least who you want to sound like and just write a handful of their paragraphs or handful of their sentences and that's gonna get you in the mood at least when you'll start seeing how it's done if you want to become a world-class writer or at least pretty good do this for a long time you'll see big differences it takes a ton of work it's incredibly boring but it's it works and finally our final product so this article we posted it I don't know now maybe a year and a half ago you'll see the dates on there but doing this technique this article got seen by about half a million people it gets viewed all the time and this is the process that we do sometimes this process will take a day or a big piece sometimes I'll I could do it in 30 minutes but this is the process that we use for writing and it works pretty well so hopefully this has helped you guys and I'll be around we'll talk about later thank you you

Neville Medhora is the founder of NevBlog, Kopywriting Kourse, and App Sumo

When Neville was first starting his career, he spent a lot of time and effort on content projects that didn't produce outstanding results. 

He got press, but once a visitor came to his website, they didn't necessarily come back.

So, he created automated processes to drive traffic and earn revenue. And it worked.
 
At Con Con -- the content conference produced by The Hustle -- Neville explains the exact steps he took to create these automations.

what's up everybody how was lunch I didn't eat lunch and I down some cold brew so we'll see how this goes so first before I get started I want to tell you a little bit about myself so my name is Neville Medora my main thing I focus on right now is copywriting course misspelled with two K's and I'm also a part of a bunch of other companies and I'm going to tell you how this came about and part of a couple things appSumo the hustle real savvy pink java a bunch of other things and the way that i got all these cushy gigs where i barely do any work yet somehow bring in an income is through building a machine that does most of it for me I am a super lazy person and I still do work and stuff but what I noticed in the beginning was that every time I did something I would have this dip and I can explain that so the very first way that I got like any notoriety online was I started a personal blog called Nev blog in 2004 so actually November 17th 2004 is when it actually started and back then like no one made money from blogs it was like for like 16 year olds talking about their feelings it was kind of a joke to have a blog so when my friends found out I had a blog called Nev blog they just told this day call me Nev walk all the time and it was never blog type fine but dot blog spot.com and it was called nevels financial blog and the tagline was super cheesy was tracking the road to financial success from the age of 22 and and I just stupid college kid I was a bit of a hustler I was doing all sorts of stuff on the side and I was like how do I track all the money that I'm making and without using expensive software and stuff I thought well a blog is a nice chronological way to document everything so I put up all the assets I had and at 22 I thought it was hella rich like I had ten thousand plus in cash and then like a stock account I thought I was super rich and compared to my friends I was and so I started listing out everything I did and then also how I made the money so I owned a rave company at the time I started a little a what I called an agency but it was really just me making webpage it's called res you might so I made resume websites resume I thought it was kind of cool and so I started publishing on this blog regularly and lo and behold people just somehow started finding out about it I didn't tell anyone it just just started taking off and so I started I was encouraged by this I got that little taste of like someone's reading so I started posting more of my money and in more detail and just a short year later I had $26,000 and I was like oh this is this kind of cool putting my stuff out there gets me attention and it keeps me accountable it makes me want to make more money so I'd list out everything I made for my rave company and I guess January 2005 I made five hundred and two dollars in profit it's just helpful to see that stuff there my change jar had thirty dollars in it so I did all these different things and started listening in right and and noticed this one it says water experiment down there five dollars so here's what that was I started doing way crazier stuff than any other financial blogger out there most financial bloggers were doing stuff like I'm gonna do a money experiment and they go sell their a computer monitor on eBay and I was like dude that's like it's not really an experiment so I wanted to shut down all the haters on my site that would be like you have to have money to make money so I was like I bet I could get a homeless dude to make money on the side of the road and I got this guy named Barry who has a serious crack addiction by the way to to sell a bunch of bottled water that I bought for five bucks and we did this we did this like 10 times with Barry and other homeless guys and I published this and and this is like 2005-2006 so this was not revolutionary but it was super interesting for back then right so this was kind of like a weird thing my parents were like what why are you why are you even doing this like what is the purpose of this and it got me a little bit of attention which was kind of cool so you get a big boost of traffic and it feels really good it makes you want to do more of that stuff so then I did even more stuff one of the ways I would network with like really rich people is a crash parties I had some mentors and they would tell me about these crazy parties that they're going to with like Michael Dell and Lance Armstrong and I bought a crappy suit for a hundred bucks from kgs Men's Wearhouse and would crash all of them and would have to blend in and so the top left one that's the Prime Minister of Malaysia I we I'm not gonna say I stole something but yadda yadda yadda we surpassed an FBI background check to get in the room with 25 press members for that one and then and that's Lam strong strong the CEO of Gibson guitars there's Herb Kelleher I knew he loved whiskey and smoking so I bought cigarettes and booze and took a picture with him and I'd post all these exploits online is like borderline sometimes illegal stuff and this was another one like my parents didn't talk to me for like a week after I did this I this homeless thing kept coming up with people and I was like what if I just go homeless and see what happens like what's the worst that could happen so for four nights five days I like when homeless I grew up my beard that was me at the end like I truly felt homeless in that picture it was not fun and then I did these mini experiments like I bummed money and bought alcohol and got absolutely house off this bottle of cheap Kentucky Bourbon or whatever and the next day I woke up in a park covered in ants and and I'd published this stuff online and it actually worked this is the this is the Wall Street Journal in Russia business section someone sent that to me and it says never blog up there somewhere and I was getting featured in publications and I was like it's kind of awesome like that's how my parents found out about it I was in the New York Times and one of their friends was like Neville's in the New York Times congratulations and they're like what and they saw that I was publishing money that I made online which for Indian parents is like super taboo but here's the thing all this stuff all these crazy experiments doing way more than other people would do and here's the result after ten years never block traffic like for real was just flat there was roughly 15,000 you know average per month coming to the site but it was kind of disappointing because if you do something for 10 years and you're in the same place like I don't know I think you just suck at it or it's that's not very encouraging right so what would happen was I would do these crazy experiments I would do the bottled water experiment and my traffic would spike up but then you have to top it right so there's like a dip that happens and the first day you get 30% less traffic and then 50% on top of that and you're back to normal then I would do I go homeless and I got a bunch of traffic and then it would go down now I crash a party him to go up and then it would go down and it was it's like a treadmill it's just like in place I could never grow past a certain size despite putting so much time and effort into it and then I was like wait a second here's the problem I put out a piece of content and then it dipped it goes up and then it dips and then I have to wait a while before I do something else crazy and it goes up and then it dips and then people who saw one experiment didn't see all the other things that I did so I implemented an autoresponder for the next big website I actually made and here are the results of that so this is copywriting course traffic over the same course of period as net blog same ten year span or whatever that is and that one went up into the right and it's still going right and it's actually it's not comparable this is actually like four times more traffic or something like that and the difference between net vlog and copywriting course was from the very beginning when it became a company on January 1st 2015 I implemented an autoresponder an email capture or contact capture on every single page that there was that was the biggest mistake I ever made with Neve blog and after ten years it's still in the exact same place because of that because just people see the stuff and then they leave so what's an autoresponder and why should you implement it for really any business you have if you're doing something online it's just a piece of software that delivers an email for you so on this day it delivers this email on it delivers this email on this day and so forth that's all it is it's really really really simple but profoundly game-changing so with Neff blog my personal blog people read the content be like wow this guy's crazy and then I don't know they just leave they just they just leave and unless they type in my name to their browser they would never find me again or if they just happen to stumble upon me otherwise I had no control over that audience so never blog was a personal blog that image that funny oh cool nice so never log was a personal blog so it it wasn't my main source of revenue so I never minded that dip like it was kind of like okay whatever that's just the nature of things but if you have a business and you're putting out content all the time and you go up and then down up and then down up and then down and you're not growing that's literally just throwing money in the toilet for your marketing efforts so with an autoresponder they come read your content and assuming that you get their info that you're successful at that you can send them more content and more content and more content occasionally sell them something more content and you can annoy them forever I prefer to educate and you know give them good stuff so the reason you're all here today is because the hustle got your email address 100% of you I'm assuming that's how you got here for the most part it's just this simple process and people tend to still put up content till this day and not spend any time trying to get the customers contact info and here's everything I used to build my own machine it's really simple I use the sumo comm tool that's just an email pop-up tool it's really that simple you just install that as WP engine for my hosting of WordPress I use leadpages for some landing pages and any email stuff and then Infusionsoft I use that for my autoresponder but you can use Aweber MailChimp convertkit infusions they're all the same thing right it's just an autoresponder now how can you build your own machine either for an existing business or a current one I'll take you inside of mine so this is inside of my Infusionsoft I apologize the things are so small I'll zoom in in a second but if you see what's going on this is about 64 of my posts on copywriting course which is now like the largest copywriting blog and there's about 100 posts total that's it 100 pieces of content if not if maybe like 95 or something this is 64 of them and what you are seeing is each post goes people sign up for the forum and it either throws them into two buckets that they're an existing member in which case it does nothing because I already got them on the email list and then the second bucket is that it keeps them into that autoresponder so this is an example of a download I have at the end of every post if you haven't noticed my style of drawing and stuff is very very cheesy and I like it so this is at the end of a how to get your Facebook post seen okay it talks about how to game Facebook and I make this cheesy looking ebook download thing and people sign up to this they they want the whole post to either copy or read or share with their colleagues in PDF for Google Doc format so they just click that they enter their email address and bam the machine takes over I don't have to do anything it doesn't matter that the machine it has them now they've got them so let's zoom in on just like a cross-section of this to just show you an example of how the machine works so let's look at the top left over there it says writer's block right and then there's old member and then start KK sequence start copywriting course sequence and and that's the only one we're worried about the ones that are highlighted now the start KK sequence on this one has zero so that means in this month a couple people three people or a couple people have signed up to the writer's block post but no new people have signed up so okay the machine is relatively ineffective their second one email open rates download zero people nothing but then the next one the copywriters salary one look at that seven of my old members signed up so who cares about that then twenty three new people signed up so I didn't do anything for that people just found me through links SEO whatever you have it and signed up and then it goes through an autoresponder and then another post got fifty people the recurring revenue calculator looks like fifty people downloaded that this month if you total all of these up this is just one this is sixteen posts that adds up to three hundred and thirty three new subscribers and this is just a small cross-section there's about a hundred posts so every month without having actually done anything like if I get hit by a bus these still get collected which is pretty great so here's an example of what I'm talking about this is a how to become a copywriter post a lot of people ask this question so I made an article on it and it gets people about a little over a year it's got a hundred and five thousand unique pageviews generally historically overall site-wide through the years my conversion rate has been about five percent of people will sign up to my website from just random traffic so that's about five thousand plus new people of those five percent buy something at an average rate of five hundred dollars each that's about a hundred thousand something dollars in revenue that I didn't do anything for I had no involvement from it whatsoever I made the content once and then it just repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats ad nauseam and for a hundred thousand something in revenue in one year here's all that was that I had to do I just made that little once again one of those cheese a little ebook download things I said I know this post is hella long so download this post and read it later that was it and all these people downloaded it and then I got their email and then the autoresponder took over I'll show you that in a second too so here's another one this this one's not even about copywriting it's called how to scam people for money so this is like a humorous piece I wanted to write I thought it was kind of like a joke but it actually kind of took off and look a hundred and sixty thousand unique page views in about a year a little over a year so that equated to about eight thousand new people and four hundred and four customers that is roughly two hundred something thousand dollars worth of revenue I had no involvement in and did nothing for so even if I was dead this would have happened which is super cool and for that one all I did I didn't even make the little book I just said send me emails I said you can use these psychological tricks for good or evil your choice sign up to the email list and start learning every week that's all if you just add something like that at the bottom of every post you too can have this so when I talked about the Machine this is literally what it is this is a screenshot of what the machine is it's it's just an autoresponder it's just laid out so it looks kind of cool so it's not that revolutionary Aweber MailChimp anything you use will do this okay so people sign up and then between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. it sends them that first email this email will teach you how to write better in two days at 7:00 a.m. and we'll send them that next one how copywriting changed my life two days later the email script that changed my life so the first three don't sell anything they just give good copywriting information because that's what they're usually looking for the second to the fourth and fifth emails try to sell a digital product that's the only time I sell in this entire sequence and then from there on it just gives them good information again but this is all automated so once someone goes in that top it goes boop boop boop and just keeps on going and I don't have to do anything and then for four to six months they get more content and it's very helpful stuff it's it's not just trying to sell them anything so the first one is a street advertising experiment where we we redid a sandwich board for a shoe hospital and I got 50% more walkins and we don't even get them to the site it just sends them everything in the email kind of like the hustle does and then the next one it will go to copywriting books my favorite copywriting books copywriting exercises how to write in a proper tone of voice etc etc etc and this is all on the machine which is super cool so here's why it's awesome to build a machine I make that word passive income because it zooms that you do nothing but it really does take out the sharp edges of your work so I don't have to be doing crazy stuff every day I don't have to be writing articles every day in fact I write maybe one or two a month now and that's just enough the autoresponder does all the rest of the work so here's me and my buddy Noah just chilling in San Juan this year and I was just reading most of the time I was reading the Judd Apatow book the whole time that was my goal for the whole trip and I did a little bit of work here and there our to hear their every day but I didn't have to do anything this is us just chilling on the beach and yeah you don't really pick petrova but uh and then also here I love coming to San Francisco actually live in Austin but during the summers and stuff I come over here because it's way better cool people etc and I don't have to do that much while I'm here because the machine is taking care of most of the lifting the machine is currently nurturing twenty thousand clients or something I don't even know it doesn't matter to me system machine I get to hang out at the hustle with Gus and Sid I threw a Conor McGregor fight party and all during that the machine was working and working and working and working and working which allows me to do you know more of what I like to do so there's only one Nevel there's only me but I'm up here talking I can't do anything else right now but when you build a machine out like this you get many levels so that guy sends the first email that guy sends a second email the third one and you can clone yourself and so if you want to build your own machine I'll leave you with this the only thing you have to do is collect info on every page build a machine that removes the dips in the business where you put something out and then it dips just remove that and build a machine that works for you and then you two could be hella lazy like me thank you very much I appreciate

[Applause] it's going on conk on ya they stuck me in right before lunch so I gotta bring a little bit of energy for you guys don't be thinkin about that food alright so what I want to teach you is how beardbrand has built our YouTube channel okay a little bit about us beardbrand these are some very handsome guys especially the guy on the left our mission is to foster confidence through grooming so our goal out there is we think we can make the world better by giving men the tools they need to invest in themselves when they invest in themselves they can invest in their family and their careers and their communities and it all starts with the person you're looking back in the mirror so we wrap that up with a tagline which is keep on growing which is trying to get our audience and our customers to continue to invest in themselves continue to grow and of course like have some really cool gnarlybeard's our YouTube channel is more than just me it actually started off with me and then we added these other very very handsome guys and we have guests collaborators and we'll talk about that a little bit more but you'll see on the right side is our barbershop series and we go into a barber shop and we'll film it it's very kind of relaxing like ASMR does anyone know you somewhere but anyways I kind of hated putting this slide in here like why YouTube I feel like I go to my fair share of conferences and people are always talking about like Facebook and how to make for Facebook and a lot of the previous talk present ators presenters presenters were talking about how to you know write for Facebook and then of course like blogging and writing for content but no one so for me it's talking about YouTube now YouTube is an incredible platform it's an awesome platform in fact it is the second most popular website it is more popular than Facebook it is this second most popular search so only Google has YouTube beat and they kind of work together anyway so between YouTube and Google you gotta be on there well you don't have to be on there and you'd be on there if you want but it is huge an interesting stat about YouTube is there is 1 billion hours of videos being watched per day all right so just just take a moment to think about that 1 billion so if if you had a billion people that means they were on YouTube for an hour and chances are you guys aren't watching YouTube for an hour so it's just the the amount of people on YouTube is obscene Facebook has this little bait-and-switch tactic where they they allow your posts to show to everyone and you're like oh man this Facebook thing is pretty great I can post something organically and it gets shown to all these people and they're like not so fast we're gonna pull that back and now you got to start paying us for it whereas YouTube is a platform that's like hey you're creating content for us sweet here's more audience for you and not only that there's some money we're gonna give you money so YouTube is YouTube actually pays us to make content so it blows my mind why people all right and the other good thing is anyone in here can start typing in fact some of y'all are typing right now and you can put that typing stuff on a blog post in an article on a Facebook post on Twitter that's pretty easy to do like it's a pretty low barrier to entry to have a blog and subsequently there's tons of blogs probably for whatever industry you're in you're gonna have more competition on a blog or social media platform then you're going to have on YouTube it is a little bit more challenging to create video so it is not easy but if it's something that you dedicate to you can build systems and processes to make it easy and you'll find that you're not running into as many competitors all right so let's get into beard R and how did we do it we're as Adam said we're a bootstrap company we started 30 box we've got no loans we're debt-free no outside money no investors anything like that yeah Mansa we're hustling all right but first so the talk of this if you're gonna tell is how we got to 50 million views in YouTube but I do have a confession we're only at 49 million so the thing is we're getting 175,000 views a day I tried to convince Sam to move this back a week so I would officially be at 50 million but they were not having any of that so the beauty of YouTube is it is like compounding interest and like the pity hoarder is probably going to relate they love compound interest I love compound interest who doesn't love compound interest you do the same amount of work and you get more out of it so let's take a look at beard brands growth over the years so in 2012 is when we started 2012 our first video was February 8 it was a really bad video in fact all those videos in 2012 were bad except for one we're able to get a stunning huge growth in one year of what just under 300 279 followers at first year and only 40,000 or 60,000 views but you'll see we doubled the content 2013 got a significant amount of subscribers and that trend continues you'll see that the the common thread of our YouTube channel is each year we're producing more and more content and we're learning how to produce content so that investment into YouTube comes back because how the user works is on YouTube and they'll watch a video and YouTube does a great job of showing your other videos to them so they'll go down this rabbit hole of watch two or three or five or six of your videos all in one sitting whereas in facebook it's about how the user Scrolls through their feed and you're lucky to get one in there or a couple in there but there's no opportunity to really like maximize and build that that audience and that that content you're producing so let's dive deeper into our growth like I like being an open book showing you how it is I don't think a lot of people out there will will show you their dashboards this is our lifetime views for our channel and I've got certain blue marks highlighted here and you'll see there's like little bumps so the little bump little bump little bump and this is over about what six years those little bumps are going to be the seasonality of our channel so we're in one right now we call a growing season where all the dudes seem to grow their beards out in November I love growing season it is my favorite season of the year if you guys aren't growing a beard out right now I highly recommend it it's great so YouTube is going to have like a natural kind of cadence and I guess abdun flows you know the summer is actually pretty pretty slow a lot of the college kids will head home and apparently when they're in school all they do is watch YouTube and when they leave school they don't do anything else but I want to point out a couple other impressive marks so going back to my previous slide where we talked about how we were creating more content on a yearly basis these red marks indicate when we shifted from so like the first red mark we're doing very sporadically like one a month one every two month and then we finally got up to one video a month and we did that for about a year and then you'll see a little bit of boost in that and then we moved up to to a two-week excuse me somewhere in between the first and the second post and then at the the middle red one it's one that was when we moved up to four post a week and then this one right here before the huge spike we've gone up to daily content so every single day there's going to be a new video on our beardbrand channel so how did we do that it's easy to say just create a video every single day but how many videos do you think you can make talking about growing a beard oh we have over 500 videos and to answer your question to grow a beard out you just wait it's been a little bit of a challenge so our strategy is a lot of pretty good videos over less really good videos and there's no right or wrong strategy with anything so like our blueprint works for us it works for our preferences and techniques and our workflows but for some people they may prefer you know really investing a lot of time and energy I know some YouTube channels that have just absolutely blown up and grown to millions of subscribers and viewers and views almost overnight just posting one video a month primitive technology how many of you guys watch primitive technology okay you all should put a note because that's like my favorite channel it's just some dude in the woods and he's like hammering around in bare feet I don't get it but it's like it's very relaxing and it's he has this like little stories talent so so there is opportunity to create content in consistently I would say and still see success but the thing with that guy from primitive technology is he's like literally living in the woods a month of the time and I think it takes him probably like months to find an outlet to charge up his camera so our strategy is like I we don't really have that good of ideas to be able to create like these really incredible stories or videos so what we're going to do is figure out how can we create a lot of content and the way that we've done that is multiple hosts so you'll see you saw earlier we had three guests that are pretty much regulars we're trying to get that up to seven regulars and then that way we'll have like seven different people's take on how to grow a beard and you know some guys have curlier beard some guys have gray beard some guys have long beard short beards just give that diversity of information but it also goes like your hairstyle your grooming so we've branched out beyond the beard it's more than just the beard it's the hair it's grooming and it's also self-improvement going back to the keep on growing all right collaborations with other creators are a big opportunity I think as marketers we kind of get into this this trap of just wanting to push our product and just living in our own little bubble and just thinking of ourselves and and also seeing like competitors as like a fixed pie mentality right so if someone gets a view on their channel that was one less view that I could have gotten on our channel now maybe it's like slightly true for some instances like we have this one youtuber who we will not name who has like copied a lot of our content and come up with a competing company we're like I got really really frustrated with that I guess for lack of better words but there are other guys out there who also talk about beards but but beards aren't their thing right they're not selling the same similar products that we're selling we sell men's grooming products so being able to have them come onto our channels is one way to do a collaboration going on to the other channel is also so what I'll do is like a beard growing tutorial and I'll give that content - let's say another big channel out there is called alpha M and he does like lifestyle stuff and style stuff so I'll do a collaboration with him he'll post it on our channel or his channel and then we'll get a lot of new subscribers who come over from there and not only that like the reality is the people on YouTube it is a community there are the comments out there and these viewers are watching multiple channels and what happens is when you do a collaboration they become like all part of the community so it's like all this like special Club they're like oh no my favorite beard guy just got with my favorite star guy oh snap that is literally what they're doing on their computer when they watch our videos or at least that's how I imagine it an interesting take though is don't let like your similar channels be your only opportunity for collaborations like think about opportunities beyond that for instance we did a collaboration with a youtuber who has a DIY channel like they're making he makes like concrete tables and benches and stuff and that has like nothing to do with our channel and really like his audience has nothing to do with our channel but what he did is he drove into Austin and we made a bench for our beardbrand office so it was good content for him and then I got to make a little guest appearance on his channel and get a little bit exposure there so just kind of spread your tentacles creatively as you can so we've done them with like comedians we've done them with like I said the DI wires and I'm actually working on one now with a car channel and a guy who like fixes up cars and and of course like you've got to like use your creativity to find new opportunities to build those collaborations okay there was a third one which is watch time now watch time is a big thing for YouTube watch time is really the metric that they're hammering home on and and it's really like how they're beating Facebook right cuz because Google and Facebook they're not the best of friends are competing Facebook stabbing they now get more views on videos and then Google is like hey yeah but of you is like three seconds of someone scrolling by it that's like no one's not really watching that so Google has made this strategic decision probably about two years ago to get people to spend more time on YouTube and really focus on watch time now watch time is a kind of vague metric at YouTube and what it is it's not simply the amount of views you have divided by how long you watch a video it takes into consideration when the person comes to YouTube what video brought them to YouTube what they did while on YouTube and then what video did they last watch before they left so what you want to do is encourage people to get onto YouTube watch a whole bunch of videos spend more than an hour right and then leave when they watch someone else's videos not your video so you don't want to be having in all your videos content that's driving people back to your website if at the end of it you're like hey go to my website buy this buy this buy this then what you're gonna do is you're gonna hammer your watch time and by hammering your watch time Google is going to be like yeah I don't want to throw any bones this way because he's kicking everyone off YouTube so you want to be able to think about building that community on YouTube understanding that it's okay for them to get connected on YouTube and

all right kaun kaun what an amazing day this has been I've been hanging out for pretty much the entire day I didn't catch all of the speakers but I caught most of them and I've learned a lot and I'm sure you're all learning a lot too and so this has been just a fantastic day thank you so much to the hustle for putting this together thanks to the Brava theater I love this space this has been just a great day so since I am the last speaker today I wanted to take a step back or perhaps a step up change perspective a little bit think a bit about some of the fundamentals of what we do as content creators I am a content creator I come from a writing background and so the quality of content is extremely important to me personally and I want to make sure that we're talking about some of these fundamental issues that maybe you already know but it's easy to forget about when we get caught up in the rush of trying to meet those deadlines and meet those targets and as important as it is as vital as it is that we are data-driven and that we you know really do have those processes in place and that we you know really use numbers as much as we can we optimize and we measure in the end we are human beings talking to human beings and if we don't connect on that core level and everything we do is meaningless and there's a big problem that content creators face and it's huge and it's scary and it's simply this there's too much content too much content is ubiquitous and ephemeral and those are words you should probably not use in your content but I'm going to use them here ubiquitous it is everywhere ephemeral it is temporary there's so much coming at us all the time from so many channels in this constant stream most of it doesn't get to our retinas it doesn't get to our brains we can't process it there are almost 8,000 tweets going live every second of everyday I don't remember who it was earlier today who was bad-mouthing Twitter but um yeah that many tweets and life span of between something like 15 minutes if you blink you miss it if you miss it it's gone forget it is it any wonder then that in a survey of some marketing leaders that was conducted recently I think was by bright edge more than two-thirds admitted probably very reluctantly that more than half of their content isn't being consumed ok we're creating content I'm using the general we all of us who create content we're creating content that people aren't reading that people aren't watching that people aren't taking any action on what the hell are we doing right where are we going wrong we're probably going wrong in a bunch of different places you might be creating the wrong content we might be serving it up to the wrong audience we might be putting into the wrong place we might be serving up at the wrong time or maybe we're just creating content that people don't actually want and that's what I'm gonna talk about for the rest of this time today now we create content and when we're doing it because we're so close to it it looks big and glorious to us and we're so proud of it and maybe it is big and maybe it is glorious and maybe it's really high-quality and it's really great but that should be animating it's not animating when you put it out in the world it's just this one little drop in this steady stream of stuff that's constantly passing by passing by passing by so how do we make sure that the content we create even if it is really good how do we make sure that people are actually gonna stop and see it and notice it and take some sort of action with it and here's another way to look at this problem and I think it's really important to remember this because this is something else that's really easy to forget just because you're creating a piece of content doesn't mean anybody's seeing it just because somebody's seeing it doesn't mean they're noticing it okay I can see all of you in this room how many of your individual faces are actually imprinting on my consciousness very few and don't take that personally it's it's not you it's me it's the way my brain works its way all our brains work we can only notice so much and when there's a steady stream of content coming at us we can't notice a whole lot just because you notice something doesn't mean you want to engage with it I saw a lot of stuff I noticed a lot of stuff on the sidewalk this morning I did not want to engage with any of it just because you do engage with a piece of content doesn't mean you're necessarily getting the message that the creator of the content was trying to impart it to you and none of that matters if the content doesn't actually drive the person to change their attitudes change their way of thinking or take some sort of an action so it's not enough just to be present it's not enough just to be seen and you'll notice I put a little green line in that slide what's above that line you know if you're smart you have a good strategy and you do you know you cross all the SEO check off all the ex-ceo boxes and you put in a little money you can make sure that your content is getting in front of eyeballs everything below that line the content has to carry on its own right just because something lands in my inbox doesn't mean I'm going to take any action on it I've must get hundreds of emails a day there are only a few that I actually I'm gonna be motivated open and those are you know the ones that I think are gonna have some real value to me so how do we get across the green line how do we go from being seen to being noticed I can think of a couple of good ways to do that one is to be really obnoxious and make everyone hate you you can take a picture of some toe fungus and you can put some sort of a clickbait headlines on it and you can saturate every ad network there is you know what I'm talking about you've seen these you can do that that sort of content will get noticed it will get clicked but those clicks have very low value right it's not necessarily that people want to interact with your content it's just like it's there it's it's everywhere they can't avoid clicking it's this is not what you're actually going after there's another way to get noticed and I think it's a much better approach you can make content that matters you can make content that people actually want they want to see that they want to interact with that they want to read that they want to save that they want to share with their friends that they want to take some sort of an action on and people want this there was a huge study done by I think it's the Havas group I think they talked to something like three hundred thousand people around the world and they surveyed 1,500 brands and what they found was 84 percent of the people they talked to want brands to provide some sort of meaningful content content that tells a story or that entertains or that informs or that creates an experience content solves a problem that's worth saying again meaningful content entertains and informs it's worth your time it makes your day a little bit better makes your life a little bit better it tells a story it gives me some sort of a situation that I can project myself into and make myself the hero of that story and see how it effects me and see how whatever it is you're trying to tell me whatever it is you're trying to sell can make my life better it provides a solution and that solution is not necessarily by Brand X if I'm with Evernote and we're talking about being more productive being more organized the solution that I'm going to put in the piece of content is not necessarily download Evernote it's going to be more like okay think about the things that you really want think about what matters to you think about what's a priority for you write it all down write down why come back to that note in a month see if that's still what matters to you and why and by the way I know a great product where you can do that that's Evernote meaningful content also creates experiences now that can be something like really immersive a video quiz some sort of a game or it can just be a really well-written blog post that draws you in and makes you want to know more and keeps drawing you in like little breadcrumbs right like Hansel and Gretel you just keep going and going and going now because we know that people want this if you are creating that kind of content you have a huge advantage because this is the stuff that people are already actively looking for right they're gonna see it because they're looking for it right now now that doesn't mean you don't have to do any work right you still have to do all of the hard work of you know making sure that you guys you know is right making sure that you're putting the content into the right places and making sure that you're putting it there at the right time but people are more likely to see it like I mentioned I've got all these these emails come into my inbox every day you know they're only two or three that I'm gonna bother opening yeah obviously the hustle because it's great and you know the audible daily deal because I know that the chances of that content being something I care about are much higher than all that other stuff that's in my inbox which I'm probably just going to ignore okay yeah I know little acronyms little mnemonics are kind of corny but I happen to like them and I like you know I like cream a la who doesn't like cream it's rich and it's flavorful and I think it's a good metaphor for content because cream rises to the top and that's what we want our content to do right so creamy content it's content which is consistent it is recognizably yours it is on brand it is on message all the time it is relevant it is content that speaks to your core audiences needs and aspirations and dreams and fears it is engaging like I said those breadcrumbs it's gonna draw you in deeper and deeper and deeper as you go it's actionable it doesn't live in a vacuum it's not this little island this one piece of content it connects to this larger world and it takes people on a journey and it's masterful and this is the writer and me again quality content adheres to high standards of editorial and design but that also refers to how you go about creating the content let's dig in a little deeper c is for can on brand on message recognizably yours so there's an example up here which is a snippet of the Evernote homepage and a great rule of thumb is if you cover up your logo and cover up your brand name is your content still recognizably yours or could it be anybody's or even worse could it be your competitors so of course we have our logo and our name on the home page but not in this particular snippet there's no elephant logo there there's no way Evernote what we do have is this phrase remember everything and this is a phrase which is very closely associated with Evernote we've used it for years it is our biggest tagline we've tried other tag lines over the years but you know what we keep coming back to this one because this one encapsulate s' the Evernote brand in two words and there are words that resonate with people when people talk about Evernote this is what they say it's my second brain it helps me remember everything and it's very aspirational and inspirational and people connect connect with it super easily and right below that there's another phrase which I happen to like very much organize your work and declutter your life again this is very succinct it's very concise it's very aspirational it's easy to connect to and it's also in just those few words that's what eight words altogether remember everything organize your work declutter your life it's setting a tone and establishing a voice that we can use throughout all the content we create it's saying that we are friendly and we are helpful and that we care about you so if you want to create consistent your content to yourself I do highly recommend you have some sort of a style guide you don't have to go nuts with this but it is key to creating consistent content that you can use for all the stuff you do that other people in your organization who are creating content can use that new people when they come into your organization can use so that you never wander off script that you're always on message on brand and we call it a style guide but really it covers four separate things that people tend to conflate people tend to mix up but the really they are different here's your voice what's your brand's personality what the Keith aspects the key features of the way your brand expresses itself and that's something that applies universally across all the content you create there's your message which is what is it exactly you're trying to say what is your value proposition then there's your tone which people always confuse with voice tone is situational if your voice is universal your tone apply is how do you take that voice and apply it to an upsell email how do you apply it to an error message how do you apply it to a how-to article or a video your voice should be the same in all of these things but each has a different tone you might be very upbeat and aggressive you might be very sober and even apologetic in some cases there are it all depends on what the situation is that your content consumer finds themselves in at that time and then there's the style itself which is the house rules you know do you use the Oxford comma do you use ap style how do you capitalize things if you don't have a style guide or if your style guide you use some work there are a bunch of really good ones that happen to be publicly available you can go there you can steal them you can make use of them yourself I've mentioned three here MailChimp is well known as kind of a gold standard they actually have two websites one is voice and tone calm which covers that situational stuff I mentioned earlier how do you and don't you talk in specific situations and that's hugely important it's not just about here are the rules but here are some good examples and good counter examples this is gonna work this isn't going to work for our brand 18f you'll notice that's a.gov and I know that's kind of scary but what they do is really interesting they partner with government agencies that have huge and very complex content repositories and they help them simplify them and make them understandable regular human beings we're at least that's the idea so if you have very technical content in your organization you might want to look at what 18f does because they've really thought this through very well and then I also mentioned BuzzFeed you know ap style is kind of a default for a lot of organizations some of you are actually in the content creation business and very journalistic great if you're not if you're more of a startup then maybe ap style which is created by journalists for journalists isn't exactly what you need BuzzFeed might be a little bit more relevant to you so I recommend you check those out quality content is relevant it's about the customer not about you this is an example that headline says you're not being lazy routines and breaks are good for you and it's part of a series that we're doing about wellness and how it interacts with productivity because you know productivity isn't just about getting more done and drinking 20 Red Bulls and staying up 20 hours a night it's very much like content creation itself do you want to do more work or do you want to do more meaningful work if you want to do more meaningful work you should take care of yourself and that's the message we're you know we're purveying here and this is something that again can connect to people on a very personal level especially the kind of people who are likely to have an interest in Evernote because they're very driven and maybe they're feeling a little bit guilty about the fact that they want to take a break once in a while and we're gonna tell them yes that's okay and so this isn't actually about Evernote at all we'll find ways to put Evernote in there but it's more about reaching out to a broader audience with something that's relevant to them something that is evergreen we can always use that we can repurpose that we can put into a bunch of different kinds of media and gradually making the association between this self-improvement making you feel better they can be better and our brand if you want to create relevant content of course you have to get inside the consumers head you have to do your homework you have to do your research you have to ask them what they care about what is on their minds you have to do your tracking you have to really find out what people want and care about from that you can build some personas now I see a lot of companies kind of going nuts with personas and they've got you know names and photos and you know not just that and their occupation but you know we know were they like bocce ball and we know what they had for breakfast this morning and we know how they like their coffee and some organizations can do that and make great results with it and if you're one of them awesome but I see usually that kind of persona wise up not being used I would rather see a simple practical persona that's just about sort of the type of person and the type of things they care about and that I can easily keep in my mind and not get distracted by all that minutia which makes me think Oh makes me start to second-guess myself when I'm creating a piece of content oh I don't know if Mary would actually like this because this is about soccer and she likes bocce ball missing the point once you've got their personal personas what do you have to offer them what is the unique thing that they can get out of your product that they won't get out of any other product and there's this great quote I don't know who originally said that I've seen it attributed to a bunch of different people which means it was probably none of them but it's sell a good night's sleep about the mattress it's not about you it's not about your features it's about what your core audience needs quality content is engaging it speaks to audience interests in ways that resonate now one of my favorite parts of my job is I get to do the company podcast it's a place where we can get into really in-depth content with really interesting people we just did one with Chris Hardwick who I love I had to put away all of my fanboy impulses there and that's

thanks for the interest Sam so I might go on I'm the creative director at quartz and I think I heard there's a few people from the court Surratt see in the audience yes no no that's fine too so right so I'll give you a quick intro and tell you what quartz is so quartz was started about five years ago we're essentially a global news site we believe in the free movement of people free movement of Commerce free movement of information and and the thing about quartz is basically we believe that we make really big decisions with our heart and really small decisions with data and that's the kind of thing that informs everything that we do in quartz all the content that we make and essentially how we how we've gotten where we've gotten in the last five years so basically we're guide to the new global economy that's our tagline that's what we do we're writers journalists UX people engineers etc so what I want to talk about today is I basically set up little quizzes little questions little things that you can take here back to whatever your business is whatever you create and you can kind of take these and help apply this UX to make what you do better if you're kind of on board with the quartz philosophy and you think it's gonna work for you I can tell you you know it works for us we've been incredibly successful and what I'm gonna run through today are the kind of things that we really think and talk and care about at quartz and this is how we make everything that we make so very quickly what do we make at quartz so we have quartz which is QC calm we've just launched quartz at work which is a site for working better we've launched quartz E which is our lifestyle site we also have several different emails we have the quartz native app and then we have Atlas which is an open-source tool that we use to make charts a lot of people around the world use that to do visualizations and then we also have the bot studio which we run but with a grant from the knight foundation and what we're doing there is we're we're experimenting with new technology to figure out how you can take that technology and use it to make both journalism and content better so we're trying to figure out you know what is the next thing so basically that's my pitch for quartz but QZ calm and you know anything you to know and learn you can you can check it out there so the most important thing I think when when we talk about content in some ways I know this is Khan Khan I'll probably get get eggs thrown at me for this I kind of hate the word content in a way because it sort of divorces what you're creating from what it should be which which is creating something that generates feelings and people because ultimately what we think about it course and when you're creating content the thing that you want to do with that content is actually create goodwill and what I'm what I mean by that specifically is when someone interacts with something that you make and put out from your brand the most important thing you want them to walk away from is feeling good about your brand and you know and I think when when we were in such like a data-driven world with content and everything is driven by metrics you know a lot of times we as marketers as content creators will will do things that may help our bottom line that may help the numbers and the metrics look good or drive some kind of numerical success but they leave the user coming away with with a bad feeling about the brand and if a user has a bad feeling about your brand that's something that's really really hard to to come back from so our philosophy when we make content is just always make sure that the user comes away with goodwill that they feel good about the brand that it's always a good experience even sometimes when we have to sacrifice what might be you know a metric or something numerical or we have to take the harder way around to make sure that they feel good so the three things I want to talk about to start with are the big over pinning philosophies of exactly how we get into the weeds with making content at quartz and so like I said you can kind of think of these in a way it's like little quiz are almost like if you're kind of like a philosophy nerd like a Socratic method that you can take back to run content through like basically if you ask yourself these questions if when you're making something if you kind of run through this and you really apply some rigor to it whether you take one of these things or none of these things or all of these things if you just sort of examine what you're making through these lenses I definitely for us it helps us improve what we do and these are sort of the guiding lights so the first one here is is aim for the intersection and this is really really important and when you aim for the intersection what I mean to say there's things that you want to say as a brand as a content creator and then you know there's actually the things that your audience cares about and those are generally you know they're not the same thing like what you want to tell your audience and what you wouldn't want them to do isn't necessarily the best thing for your audience so basically how do you find the intersection of these two things so what we do at courts is we have something we call obsession mapping which is kind of like a really fun exercise and the more you do it the better you get I mean you can do this at one person but it actually works best with a couple of people or a group basically everybody gets a piece of paper you write it one person writes the top of it the audience one person writes the top of it the brand you go off into your corner and write the things that you care about what you know what is important to your brand and then somebody else is writing you know what's important to your audience like what do they actually care about and it's probably not the things that you consider a KPI and when you've done this you can take these two things you come back together and when you find two obsessions that match then you found something that is worth creating content around so obsession mapping really drives a tone of what we do at courts because we run our newsroom by obsessions we write about the things that were obsessed about and then we go out we talk to our audience we find out what they're obsessed about and the two things where they meet that's how we find the intersection and for us this has been a really powerful tool that's why our journalists don't have beats they have obsessions and same thing with our content we write about things that we're obsessed about that our audience is also obsessed about so this one here is one that I feel really strongly about which is audiences have values but people have value and I think the way that we the way that many people or we look at audiences right you define an audience by a bunch of numbers you know it's how old people are it's where they live it's what they do it's how much money they make it's all these things but actually an audience is really a set of feelings you know a set of like shared common interest and shared common things so one of the things that we challenge ourselves with here and this is another exercise that you can do is can you define your audience in a really clear and thorough way without using any numbers or data you know can you describe them you know can you think if you are if you were a novelist or if you're a writer can you write about your audience and tell about the things that they feel deeply about and care deeply about without using a number and I think one when you start to do an exercise like this and you take the numbers away from your audience you start to understand that they're not just a conglomeration of data you know that they're actually real people and there's things that they care about and when you can bring your content into a place to reach them based on the feelings not on the numbers that's going to get you much further because when people care deeply about things they tend to take action more often which is something that we that we found at courts and I think this is you know it's tough I know that we're most of us likely what the content we put out is probably 90 or 95 percent digital and that metrics are really important but what I would just say here is I think this is a word the exercise to take the time to see what it would look like if you if you measured your audience in a way that was not numerical that was just based on sort of gut feelings almost the way things were done 30 years ago before we had digital metrics so the other big arching thing that we think about is content is a product and in the sense of we never think of just writing or making a video or making an infographic and putting it in a container we design and think about everything from the ground up is a cohesive piece so basically when we have a story that we want to tell we sit down and we think right at the beginning you know what is the best way to tell this story and I mean that can be anything sometimes it might be text sometimes it might be text and video sometimes it might be a website sometimes it might be an app but whatever it is at the beginning of the process we have our product team or engineers our designers in there so I think it's worth thinking about you know if you're someone who all of your content goes directly on a website or it goes directly on a blog or it goes directly on medium it would be worth thinking about are there other ways that you can communicate the same message through a different format or make something new to start with so we feel really strongly that content is as a product is what defines the thing and if you kind of think of the way that people consume right and consume reading online you know it's a lot like walking into a store there's tens of thousands of things out there on the shelf and they're all packaged a certain way so you can do the exercise and think of well how is my thing packaged what when people just take a quick look at it that one second glance or they see it in a search what is the what is the packaging what is the product that is differentiating my my offering my content from other people and if you conceive it as a product and not just a piece of writing you know it's no longer 500 words or three images it's actually a complete thing that you're designing from the ground up this is a place where we've also had a really strong amount of success by having that product thinking and that's also why I think another thing that we do different is our engineering and our UX teams are integrated with the content teams and we all work together to build these things from day one so in the next part what makes a good content user experience so for us there's three things it needs to be consumable it needs to be accessible and it needs to be respectful sorry the letters dropped on that slide I guess designing for the big screen as I talked about design a good content clearly fail fail so this is gonna sound really dumb but the most important thing about anything you're putting out is it needs to be consumable and what I mean is can people actually access and see and read what it is that you're putting out and this sounds really dumb like well of course people can consume it but if you actually I'm sure you've had this experience there's so many places you can go on the web where you're interested in reading something and you actually can't consume that thing and it could be because the page doesn't load it could be because there's so many pop-ups that it's unreadable it could be because you have to enter your email before they let you read the thing it could be because you have to watch 30 seconds of pre-roll before you see the video but for us making it consumable is important because if a user is not able to consume what they want from you immediately they're going to leave and they're never going to come back so you know give yourself like you know draw a hard line in the sand here is if you look at what you're putting out there and say is it actually consumable or are we doing things to generate metrics to generate signups to generate whatever it is we want to do some kind of dark pattern behavior on our content to get people to do this because for us it's all about making it consumable it's the reason why our courts you know we don't take any IAB ads it's all sort of done in-house make it a good experience so I would take the challenge here can you go and make sure that what you're putting out in the world is something you know that people can actually see and another obsession that we have at quartz is its page loading look we are absolutely maniacally obsessed with seeing how fast we can make the pages load and you know generally when they when they do different sort of independent studies we're usually like in the top 10 or top 15 places you know for journalism as far as making the site read so I would say here you know when was the last time you actually checked the site load speed of your site and you know all the different things that can slow it down it's worth going through and see you know can I make this load faster because the faster you can make the page page load the more consumable what you're putting out there is going to be so the next one here is it accessible can people actually get to this and I think you know increasingly as the world has become really really connected I think as as content people especially content people if most of us here are from the US you know we're all generally on pretty fast internet connections we all generally have newer devices like the newer operating systems but that's actually not the case for a vast majority of people globally so you know what you're putting out there isn't accessible is it accessible to people on low bandwidth connections you know are people who have poor connectivity are they able to read what it is that you're putting out there another one is what about people who use adaptive devices do you make anything for people who use screen readers do you make anything for people who have auditory impairment do you make any concession for people who use adaptive devices we're really obsessed with thinking about making we feel really strongly that everything we create is worth putting out into the world so by doing that we make sure that it's accessible that the the largest number of people regardless of whatever digital impediment they have are able to do this and I mean there are w3c standards that are out there that are a really good starting place for you to look in if you go they can you know you can do an audit of your site and I think you if this is something you haven't investigated you might be surprised at how inaccessible your content is to people in certain places depending on bandwidth and the types of devices they use and the other thing I would say here is like even though right now this doesn't seem like a huge thing in the US if you're building a business for the long term and you think a year from now two years from now five years from now you're looking to have a global audience this is something you should really take care of now because people are gonna come back to your legacy content at some point and they're not going to be able to access it because they're somewhere outside the US so when you go there to build that audience you should be prepared for all these different scenarios to look into so is their content respectful so when you read an article that's like 33 ways to tie your shoelaces like is that respectful of the reader no no one needs 33 ways maybe you need one or maybe you need to and you know respect for the user for the reader is really important because like me you know I'm a marketing person as well and we all sort of have our goals that we're driving towards but again those goals might not really be what would that user trying to do so I think if you put yourself in the shoes of your users and say do I do I respect my user is what I'm doing good for the user or is it good for me at first this can be a little bit of a bitter pill to swallow especially if you're in a metrics driven business especially if you're doing a start but I think what we found work for us is that courts we've always been respectful of the user since day one and even when it's tough you know we've hung onto that and stayed the course that we will never do anything that is not respectful to the user and what it's done is over the last five years we've been able to build again build that goodwill and build people who just have so much love for what we do at courts because we're always respectful both in what we write but also how we present it to them so I would think you know wherever you can you might have some idea like you know what this article needs to be 500 words and I would make the counter-argument if you could cut that down to one sentence and the user the reader comes away with something really valuable from that one sentence that's gonna make them love what you're doing and love your brand more than just trying to fill up space or we just have a posting schedule or we have a social media schedule so I think if you really think tough about what being respectful of a user is you can sort of start to make these decisions and I think brands and companies that are in it for the long haul traditionally and now and in the past always have respect for their user and they and they do what's right for the user in the reader so basically now we can get to a little bit of of the tactical piece you know how do we do some of these things you know very much in a tactical sense so basically how do you create a good content user experience for us and from a technical side there's three things that I think anyone in this room can look at you know this afternoon or when they go home tonight that you might be able to immediately improve on and might help you right off the bat if you if you investigate into some of these three things so the first one is readability so essentially readability is you know when we talked about is your thing consumable a big part of that is readability and if you go out onto the web there are a lot of readability offenders and what I mean by that is readability means you should have a white background with black text or a black background with white text as a second option and making that change if you don't have it is huge and when when you go to sites that have you know pattern backgrounds or really busy UX or really funky fonts that aren't ones that you see those are real tough readability challenges and I and I see tons and tons of them out there because again you get into your mind like oh wow it would be really cool if we had like our company logo running on the background here it'd be really cool if we had like dancing cats and all this stuff but really if somebody is coming to hear what you have to say they just want to read the thing so I don't think there's any shame in having you know just white white background black text I mean that even goes back to you know David Ogilvy said that 50 years ago for print that that's how it should always be because if people can't read the thing they can't see it so I think just really thinking about the colors and fonts that you use for text is especially important again this sounds like everyone's probably rolling their eyes like of course I know that but if you know I see it out there every single day and there's things that I want to read and I'm not gonna call any sites or some sites I think the journalism is really good and I literally physically can not read what they're saying on there so it'd be worth doing a little bit of a readability audit on your content when you put it out there so navigation I think there's really two two things that navigation needs to be doing when you're talking about content so the first thing that navigation needs to do is it needs to let the user know what they are seeing and identify it and again I think the challenge here is it's really easy to kind of fall into giving things like cutesy names and cutesy categories that don't really mean anything or you know what I kind of think of is like you know startup like techno jargon but basically if you're not from this world and there's all this jargon readers and users are not going to understand what it is that they're looking at without further explanation so the whole point of navigation really is to let people know what they're looking at and the second part of navigation is wayfinding it's basically to let someone know where they are and where they can go from here so you know again these sound like really simple things but even having even having a menu structure that lets people know what part of the site they're on it's important and I think - especially some of the off-the-shelf sort of content services that you use don't really do a good job of this and I mean our solution for this is we essentially built our own version of WordPress which is open source anyone who's interested you know you can go out there you can download it you can use it for free it's something that we we build and maintain and we feel really strongly about providing open source tools for content people for journalists for anyone who wants to put information out into the world but that's how our menuing works it's all very simple it just literally tells you the name of the thing that you're seeing and then somewhere at the bottom there's wayfinding navigation

hey guys how's it going awesome 25 minutes and you guys get snack time awesome well thank you guys for having me first of all I want to affirm you husband's heart it is it stuff I want to tell you a quick story seven years ago I was unemployed had no idea maybe quarter life crisis something like that and my prince said hey I got this website and I'd literally just checked my email like that's my proficiency like I could check Gmail and he was like hey dude yeah I got this website I want you to help me build it or whatever and I'm like I don't even know the first thing about websites and content or whatever and and it was tough it was tough for three years it was an automotive website where we had people to get get together to talk about cars and sell car parts and all this stuff and it was extremely hard and there's ups and downs and I'm sure you guys know there's some days we put a ton of work in you see like a little bit of movement and you kind of sometimes it's hard to stay motivated and this is true story so like I had this shirt when I was in that mindset I'm like I gotta get some mindset you're good people say dude you gotta do something else with your life this is not going where but I believed in it and all right this one shirt I would put on and it said the world belongs to those who hustle and I put it on because I knew this there were people that were smarter than me there are people they're more talented there are people more resources but no one was gonna out-hustle me that was my thing and I just want you to know there is lively in the tunnel three years later we were able to sell that business for a few million dollars and I just want to encourage you guys to just keep on keepin on so yeah so you guys are here that's a big part of it so thank you guys for having me [Music] so anyways one question for you guys who loves dogs okay alright we're in good company what about horses horses Birds we own all those domains it's crazy yeah ferrets whatever but so anyways we started off years ago as a Facebook page we wrote Facebook we're like hey people like dogs let's start building some stuff for them back in the day was easy to buy fans things like that and it was I love dogs and we had a website we're like we need a website I guess like people are like going places to read stuff like we are posting dog pictures and dog videos and all this stuff and my buddy was like all right let's just grab URL so it was like the Isle of Dogs site calm was the first time we purchased and we started seeing traffic we started writing content we're like oh wow you know this is like people like reading in they're going here and so about a year into we're like yeah that's - the URLs too long let's find another domain name so I heart dogs came up we're like let's do this so we accidentally became a content company it wasn't totally planned but the cool thing is like really early we realized like as pet owners ourselves we need solutions and so one of the ways we did that we started to write content started out with kind of fun like content and then we started writing more and more detailed content about like things owners need to know or health is a big one - for us definitely one of the things that we read a ton about so small team bootstrapped in coffee shops and then we're like man you know what like you mean really cool is if like we could write content for every single dog breed and there's like two of us every day and it was like little ambitious but we said hey there's got to be a way to figure this out so what I want to talk to you guys today about is um how we bootstrap a ton of content by working smarter not harder sound good okay cool here we go all right site itself so we have a contact commerce model being a media company is tough today it's not impossible a lot of people do it well we you know what we really started with the vision of that um in our mantra for our team is all dogs matter every single dog matters and every single cat matters and part of that is our goal if like if we do anything it's to hell the happiness of pets period and we're really aggressive about that we're gonna do anything we possibly can so when we started writing content people like oh that's really cool like I just found this out of my dog you guys helped give me information but like what do I do next do I take do they give them a supplement do it is there a special toy and so we start doing research like you know we want to connect the dots because when they're ready to take action we want to give them a solution that works but we went out there and like this stuff sucks it's like like we can't we don't feel like we're doing them a service sometimes because it's like we get them ready you're like this is what you need and then and then they're like okay cool like where is that weird I go get it and then all the options just weren't really that great for them so we're like now we're not we're not gonna do this we're gonna build it we're gonna build it I have no idea how we're gonna do we're gonna do it so we launched a supplement company we launched a toy company you name it we're like we're just gonna do it if we if people really need this information and then they need to take the next step and purchase something where they give them the best thing that we possibly can so we started that about e-commerce about 36 months old and we have a million customers so we content we're very content heavy team 500 pieces of content a month we have a team of five that does that and Facebook pages we run a hundred Facebook pages we use it in conjunction with content so this is something that we do is kind of a hack because you can buy likes for five or ten cents still for most niches what we'll do is we'll launch a page just to gauge the interest of a community before we write content to it so like here's an example senior dog owner so dogs are older have different conditions and needs and so for us we're like we will really want to test like how much content we should write so he wrote some content but then we actually launched a Facebook page in a group and and targeted people who had seen your dogs to see kind of how responsive they would be to the content first and it turns out they were so then we double down on that started creating more content so we'll actually launch a lot of Facebook groups or pages just to see where they really where people are and so now we have way too many that's 100 is way too many but Facebook groups another one too if you guys have there's passion and you're building so if you're writing something for people we're very passionate groups are really awesome because that's actually they run it you just got to moderate it so it's a really cool thing if Facebook's investing by the way big time and groups because it keeps people on Facebook so they're definitely so that's one of the things we started pretty early there we go 5% so the reality is that like for all the hard work we do for all the stuff we write only 5% of our content contributes to 95% of our traffic in our revenue and when you look at that number it's kind of disappointing because like 95% of the stuff that you slaved over and you invested time in doesn't really make it and so for us we're like man like how do we how do we actually make that work like how do we take this next level because if we're just writing a hundred pieces to have five work that's expensive we don't have any money and we have a limited amount team bandwidth things like that so we're like all right we can we're gonna hack this model and I'm gonna get into how we do that here in a minute but um so there's three things when we looked at all the content the 5% of content that does the best there's three things we found out is true one is its hyper relevant the best kind of type of relevant and what I mean by hyper relevant is it is extremely specific to the people that you want to talk to so there's general content so like in the dog world we could write and some of this does well it could be like three it could be like something your dog needs to know about their allergies or something right if but if we if we put in there you know three things you need to know is a great day and owner about your senior Great Dane it's a lot more hyper relevant hyper relevancy is everything for us so the best content we have that performs it's really really targeted to the audience we want we're looking for it's not general it tends to be hyper relevant the other thing is it's there's a lot about the value driven reciprocity what I mean by this is like it's really got to create value the hospital does is great like when I get that newsletter I feel like it was for me and there's so much value created and there's something that happens when we were given value I don't know if you guys have ever seen like experiment at Starbucks we're like the person in front end line buys the person behind them a drink and then there's this loop that happens where people just keep buying each other drinks it's like oh okay I'll buy this we're created internally we're wired to reciprocate value so for us if we can get them add enough value to them then we can get them to reciprocate it and a lot of times that's in the form of maybe even we do this with email so like if someone if you give enough value and you say hey give me your email I'll give you some more stuff that's one way for products it's a lot harder but that's really the world we live in is like we want to create so much value for them that they're like all right there they have my back they're gonna help me out and I think the other thing that's really for us is I think really important especially when it comes to context I said this is lost sometimes is it's got to happen for us it's gotta have a clear there's got to be a clear intent behind it like we just all have time money capital to write content just to write content or just to fill a slot or just to push out like it's gotta have a purpose so all of our content before it can God we look at okay what's the point of this like really what's the point is education great now what's what are we educating them towards and how we gonna help them connect those dots okay so there's a lot of stuff going to show up here but this is how we traffic hack a lot of content the type irrelevant so you guys all you guys will follow me in this one all right so because 5% of our content creates 95% of our traffic revenue it's a lot of times we're wrong when we're trying to guess like what actually is gonna work or what's the best solution so we kind of follow this model so we write one really good piece of content and we feel like it's good that we feel like is relevant to a lot of people okay and then we're gonna buy traffic now just when I say buy traffic I think that's a loaded word what I mean really is if we use Facebook will promote it to people who we feel like are potential readers right to get a baseline pretty quickly so we'll write it and you generally you'll get some kind of instant response a few hours you're like you'll see that people are really clicking to it at a higher frequency of the other content that's usually our baseline but then here's what we do rather than just having that piece we'll take that piece right will create five versions of that piece and then we're gonna change the headlines and we actually may even change the content usually the first paragraph to see how we can make it even more relevant to people in that segment so an example would be if it's a general dog piece that the next one we're gonna take the same content we're not going to rewrite it we're gonna actually tweak it a little bit and we're gonna five pieces of content that are hyper relevant to different audiences or different groups from the same general piece of content that clicked and we actually do that over and over and over and over to the extent where we'll have well have one Jim one piece of content that does well meaning it hits the right audience it creates enough value it gains enough traffic like that article will may spawn a hundred pieces of content but every single piece is different and it's unique the general content tends to be this similar but we'll make it really specific for the audience that we're actually targeting so we end up with this a lot of really great pieces of hyper relevant content and we didn't have to create every single one from scratch and so for us that works really really well especially with Facebook because you can make it hyper relevant then target the right audience and then the other part of it that we use is for email opt-ins will will create a mop is just for that audience too so so yeah hi Brooke so you have a general piece that you create hype irrelevant pieces with and then so then you create an emo often for that hyper relevant audience if that makes sense so like then you're then you really know who people are and it's kind of like fishing in a way right like it's like a lure it's like you're getting people in you're figuring out really who they are and what their values are what they they're looking for not just at a general level but at a really really local level and for us that information is super valuable especially when you're trying to offer solutions for them let's see and so the two things I think this is brought up before so he is to add when you add it when you're chained when you're creating hyper relevant content content it's variations you want to use keywords that will pull that audience specifically in stuff that they're interested in and so it's not like you want to just copy it verbatim you want to make it personal to that audience like the words that they would use the words that appeal to them and then relevant images so you want to make sure the images you're using a relative for the audience that you're trying to target that all makes sense so far good okay all right so here's an example like we're in the pet so it's I think this actually works for a lot of different but I'm will take this example one thing we'll do so basically five natural allergy remedies for docs right we want to figure out people have problems with this turns out that you have a lot of problems with that and so then we go okay let's let's see how much deeper this go so we'll create three variations it will make it specific so German Shepherds boxers and labs right and out of that we found wow this breed specifically has a lot of allergy problems there's a lot of readership and interest around it so then we're gonna create another version that takes that hyper relevancy and then just actually magnifies it so the next one we would try is algae remedies for senior boxers of skin it's can irritate versions like that so we'll use versioning as a way to take a good piece of content to extrapolate more people out of the infrastructure Facebook organic whatever to readership and the idea is this we're gonna what we do is we're going to offer them hard solutions so like we're gonna offer them supplements we're gonna offer them maybe there's there maybe there's a ebook or something on theirs so whatever we're gonna do where we use this is actually a way to build that product so if we have enough and we did we enough people say like I really have allergy problems with my dogs and allergies I don't know what to do so through all of that through learning a lot of that we actually started building supplements and now we have some of the best supplements on the market and that all came from versioning some versions of content and it just basically informed us into so what really people are looking for so this an example just a visual example of like what this looks like on the site we hide all these pieces by the way technically you don't like thousands of pieces of the same thing kind of on the homepage but like for this one well this is a general we'll start high level with this one so so basically like this seems like a click baby title one thing we we look at like I said earlier is we're really passionate about the health of happiness the dogs and we feel like we need to sometimes we've got to reach out and grab people to inform them better so we'll use Debra headlines for that but then we get into pretty serious content pretty quickly here's another one three things from the vet so we'll put this out and for us the what we've learned about communities online or in content generals that people are more and more looking for more relevant solutions for themselves and I think that community is the future of the Internet is going to be hyper communities of people there that are really looking for specific things like the hustle right so for us it's about getting those those people and that final finding them in the internet and then pinging them and so the idea of this content there's actually creates a ton of data for us and here's an example real quick with just a few versions that we did that have done over a million dollars revenue in the past six months okay it's just to give you guys an idea of like where versions fall so you're just testing tons of content right you're testing tons of content and then you're gonna find some we're just gonna win for you but it allows you to do that in a skin more of a scalable way rather than write in a hundred pieces of content from scratch big data is big business so this is the really neat thing so when we write content that's specific so say we write a German Shepherd we're gonna we're gonna pixel that user from Facebook we're gonna know that their German Shepherd owner because like you don't go read about German Shepherds let's do that one right so we write content that brings in people that we won't identify with then what we do is we're gonna retarget them and we're also going to take which we grab emails that page that'll be about German Shepherd well actually segment that then we're gonna retarget them for the similar stuff so like these all these variations allow us to create a lot of data points in regards to content and then we can use that to make informed decisions so the way we do that gonna be targeting so offers specialized emails and things like that so those variations is hyper targeted variations allow us to grab relevant emails for different things we use the analytics demo data to better understand how to communicate so like if certain so we'll look at like well actually cross-reference a lot of data and look at the age of owners where they live knowing that like hey it's really cold for you you're gonna have different issues and stuff right now then we are in you know Southern California so we use a lot of that data to make informed decisions about what's right and we get that from that inbound here's the interesting part so on Facebook when we're doing well if any if we're using Facebook we're actually targeting based on data they provide and they're making they're using connecting points to try to figure out what that data is and so when you go on their say

Shabnam had the idea for philosophical-focused journalism in college. Then she found out that Rainn Wilson, the actor from The Office, was building a company that implemented her idea in a big way.

At 2X in November of 2017, Shabnam Mogharabi tells the story of how she managed to get herself a job as the CEO of SoulPancake, despite being on a different coast and having no connections to Rainn Wilson... and what she learned during the experience along the way.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
hi my name is Shabnam O'Hara B and I'm the CEO of a company called SoulPancake SoulPancake is a media company we were founded by Rainn Wilson the actor who played Dwight Schrute on the office the u.s. office not the British office I have to say that because there's always Brits in the audience and our mission is to create positive uplifting inspiring content that we distribute digitally to about 10 million fans on social have amassed half a billion video views on that content and we create content for television for branded engagements and ultimately human connection through storytelling sometimes it's really thought-provoking sometimes it's very deep but ultimately it's always about joy so the story I'm gonna tell today is about how joy transformed my own personal life because I believe joy is a very powerful force and I think sometimes when you say the word joy people look at you like you're a Pollyanna like you're a little bit naive maybe a little dumb and and you are oblivious to the realities of the world how can you talk about joy and look at the messiness of life and the messiness of world and any way shape or form and be taken seriously but I believe the joy is very powerful and so my story starts with how my family perceives me and my family and friends kind of perceive me as a little bit more of an e or than a Tigger I definitely am the person who's like when a bad grade when I got a bad grade in high school it weighed me down I really struggled to like you know compete with all the other people in class and I was always like oh there's so much that I need to do and achieve and it's so hard and I think part of that comes from being the first born child of immigrants I think when you grow up with immigrant parents part of your brain carries the struggle that they brought with you with them and part of your brain also has this idealism of changing the world and the opportunity that lies ahead of you so that balance of idealism and cynical reality of the struggle led me in college to major in the only possible field journalism so you know idealism and cynicism it combines really well for that field so I study journalism and I worked a couple of jobs and then I went to grad school and I went to grad school and when I was in grad school I wrote a thesis and I wrote my thesis about the need for media to create a platform or a place where Falah philosophical and spiritual topics could be cool again I felt like media had kind of sidelined philosophy and big questions and thoughtful things to the sidelines and it just wasn't cool to talk about philosophy and spiritual topics anymore so I write this thesis and I put it away in my parent's garage fast forward seven years later and I'm living in Washington DC it's 2008 and I'm working at a magazine company and I happen to be running a team that creates content in the housing industry in real estate home design development and so on and I remember vividly one day it was fall November of 2008 and I'm driving down Connecticut Avenue in Washington DC the trees are all sorts of beautiful colors and I'm driving to work and I hear on the radio an interview on NPR with this actor from the office Rainn Wilson and he's talking about this site that he and some friends are gonna launch called SoulPancake and they are going to tackle life's big questions and they're gonna make philosophical and spiritual topics cool again and I thought oh my god Rainn Wilson stole my idea and I was really upset now to understand just how upset I was you kind of have to understand where I was in my life at this time and low-point doesn't even begin to describe it that period of my time that period of the fall of 2008 entailed a number of factors going on in my life I was engaged to be married and I had actually called off my engagement a few weeks before hearing range on the interview so I was very depressed I was very unhappy I was feeling like you know my personal life was a bit of a show in addition to that and let me tell you guys one of the hardest things I've ever had to do is call that off and like call people and say yeah that's not happening anymore yeah so so that was happening simultaneous to that again this is 2008 and I'm working in the housing industry so simultaneously to that I had been called in by my boss and told you basically had to lay I had to layoff half of my staff and those are some painful conversations to bring in people who work hard and you're telling them that they no longer have their livelihood those are some rough conversations simultaneously to that it was my ten-year high school graduation you know reunion so I was spending most of my nights at this point going home after work lying in bed eating a pint of Ben and Jerry's chunky monkey sitting on Facebook looking at all of my high school classmates and my nemec's and saying oh look at what they're doing and look at how awesome their lives are right now and of course that day I hear rains interview it just was the bottom of the low I was like and of course this celebrity has taken this idea I had and he's running with it now at that time that specific day I went home and I got in bed with my chunky monkey and and I got a call from my mom my mom calls me and she's like hey shabby she's the only person in my life who calls me shabby hey shabby and I'm like hi mom and she says how are you I'm okay I'm good what are you doing as I'm eating my chunky monkey working I'm working and and she goes so I'm calling because I've decided we're going on a family trip in December and we're gonna go on a holy pilgrimage the whole family all together sidenote I'm a Baha'i that's my religion and a lot of our holy places and temples are in Haifa Israel so it's often place that the highs go so my mom calls me and says in December we're all going we're getting on a plane we're all going to Israel and we're going to do this like holy tree together and I'm like huh no I don't want to do this mom this sounds awful it sounds like the worst thing that I've ever heard of and and my mom proceeds to put on her immigrant guilt at and says but Shabnam but Shabnam your dad and I were getting older you and your sisters you're gonna get married and have your own family soon and then you're not gonna want to do anything with us this is the only time that we can all go on this trip together and I'm like when's the dates mom so I proceeded to go on this trip in December so I get on this plane and I go to Israel and my whole family is dutifully praying and meditating in these temples and I'm sitting in the corner arms crossed and decidedly not praying or meditating or doing anything but thinking about my life and all that went through my head is why God why me how many of you have had that that like why me moment right so I'm sitting there stewing and after a couple days of this thinking about what's going on in my life my realized that my frustration had turned into conviction and my anger had turned into resolve and I came out of those couple of days of having reflected and thought about what was going on in my life and I came out and I decided I was going to find a way no matter what to be a part of SoulPancake it felt like it was my professional soulmate and I had to be involved so I got back to Washington DC and I started emailing Facebook messaging texting calling carrier pigeon anyone I could who was in LA who might be able to put me in touch with Rainn Wilson and his team so eventually through so many connections a friend of a friend of a friend put me in touch with the guy who was working with rain on SoulPancake and I get on the phone with him and I say hey I would love to help with what you're doing at SoulPancake and he says oh yeah awesome what do you do again I said I do content I'm a journalist I'm working as a magazine editor I do content I'm a story and so he said awesome well we have all these bells and whistles and all this technology that we've built we've got a group of people who are willing to contribute but we don't really have any content and we launch soon and I said okay well when do you launch and he said we launch in about a month and if you've ever worked in the content space that is no time at all so I basically said well give me some equity in the company and I will get your content up and running and I turned around and spent the next four weeks calling in favors organizing the strategy and getting everyone pulled together writing content being up all hours of the night because I was still working a full-time job and getting SoulPancake launched that was eight years ago now I tell this story because and the reason that it relates to joy is because the shift that I've seen in my life since that moment has been a markedly different approach to life and from going from that very very bottom low that I was in where I felt like the world was against me and nothing was going right that your mentality I wouldn't say I've become a full-on Tigger but I've made a lot of progress towards it and there are three tools that I keep going back to again and again that came came up in that period of transition for me the first one is I had nothing to lose so I was super detached from the outcome I was super detached brain was gonna make SoulPancake whether I was involved in it or not it was gonna happen whether I reached out or not and I had nothing to lose and reaching out so I was super detached from any potential outcome that was going to come the second tool kit the tool that I that I was able to take from that is how powerful gratitude is that I essentially every time I reached out to someone and asked them to connect me to someone to help me get in touch with Rainn I felt so grateful that they had taken the time to do it and when the team at SoulPancake said yeah come on in help us I felt so grateful for that opportunity and to this day every project we work everything that comes across my desk I feel so grateful that I get to do something where I work at a company that I see is my professional soulmate every single day and the third thing that I learned in that process is how important it is to not compare yourself to other people I was spending my nights literally on Facebook stalking ex classmates like it was a bad period and it wasn't until I a later that I came across a quote that's attributed to Theodore Roosevelt that I realized just how important that is the quote is comparison is the thief of joy I love this quote it's one of my favorite quotes comparison is the thief of joy and I realized that in all in all of my life leading up to that moment I was always so attached to the outcome but what if it doesn't turn out exactly the way I wanted it to or expected it to I wasn't grateful for the great and amazing things and people I did have and I was comparing myself every single day to what was going on with other people and so I've since that time taken those three elements and I've implemented them in every part of what happens with SoulPancake last year we were acquired by participant media which is a film company here in Los Angeles and the process leading up to that was super arduous I had more than 65 meetings with potential investors and strategic partners and I was told no over and over and over and over again but that same toolkit that got me to SoulPancake in the first place got us to the successful exit because I wasn't attached to the outcome I was so grateful for every meeting we had even when they said no because I was able to tell our story and I didn't compare ourselves to what every other company was doing when they would get investment when they would sell I said that's their story but I'm not gonna let it deprive me of mine and so if I can leave you with anything especially those of you who are a little bit more ER than you are Tigger you can find small ways to bring a little bit more joy into your life like I did thank you very much you

hi good evening I think that's gonna be a little bit of boring after all that talk of sex I thought I thought I was kind of the fat last one but Kili I'm just the English proved in all of this I'm Sarah Wilkinson thank you so much for coming out this evening to share and listen to these stories and it's been a really special night so far and I've certainly learned a lot in in r√¥ti I've been specializing in trend brand and creative direction for over 20 years focusing mainly on Millennials and Gen Z and Gen Y customers I've been privileged enough to work for forever 21 currently but before that CK jeans Miss Selfridge ASOS calm and Nasty Gal so I've been around a few years I've been around the block I have emigrated three times in my career and this time obviously I'm here in LA but previously in my career I emigrated the first time to New York it was 1996 so quite a while back and I moved to starts a six-month internship in and I was living in Hell's Kitchen and it was a pretty grim and bleak looking Manhattan in those days I was paid 175 dollars a week cash which obviously didn't go very far especially when my favorite things were clubbing clothes cocktails I mainly survived on deli egg rolls with sweet and sour sauce and drank copious amounts of Starbucks coffee we used to work really long hours in those days we didn't have computers believe it or not so we would have to design everything by hand sketched out and fax to China page by page by page and if the if the fax machine blew out along which it did invariably and quite often you would have to start again and feed every single piece of paper three two factories in China where with some handwritten instruction they would have to take the artworks together and use those to recreate the designs let's just say that we worked hard but we partied even harder we were surviving on probably around about four hours sleep a night and I definitely would have considered myself as a technophobe I think I'd only had a mobile phone for a round about a year there was no scanners no computer no internet no Google at that time can you imagine and it was certainly very challenging to build fashion trends at that time mainly just through editorial magazines and pulling bought samples if you were to fast forward 10 years and 2000 to 2006 I was working in London holding design manager at Miss Selfridge and I still probably would have considered myself a technophobe I mainly would put boards together by hand and taking them together on large pieces of foam core and keeping things really quite simple and very manual I had a very interesting chance meeting with a guy called Robert Brady who was products and trading director at Asus comm at a time I was out in a wine bar on a Friday night and it happened to be his birthday and he was very tipsy and he was extremely animated and deter about persuading me to come and join what was then known as as seen on screen back then not no one has an online fashion store Topshop H&M and Zara those guys probably opening that online stores maybe two years after that so there wasn't a blueprint at all for an online fashion store I thought he was crazy I thought it was impossible I didn't understand how we were going to get people to buy clothes from a computer screen I mean was it even cool I mean it kind of just looked like a catalog but on the screen I mean how are we going to make that into a brand how are we going to make it into something that people would really get excited about I kind of laughed him off the barstool but I did enjoy the rounds of drinks that he was by me while he was coaxing me to try to come and work for him anyway four months passed and eventually he managed to persuade me to leave Miss Selfridge and come and join him and to head up a groundbreaking online fashion store that's when the real hard work started and I started recruiting networking pulling on all my contacts and starting the entire design process from scratch traveling maybe like 20 to 30 times a year all over the world researching putting trends together it was it was kind of it was kind of crazy times but we've started to make headway and what broke it was really in 2008 we landed the front cover of Vogue we got giorgio jagger in the sequence every dress and at last we felt like we'd made it during that time we we launched Asus white Asus black Asus alone Asus Africa Asus marketplace and we collaborated with some incredible talents Patricia fields Marcus look for Josh cute Michelle Rafferty Steph seasons hundreds of people who came to our came to our calling we certainly spent a lot of time in the perb NIC Robertson CEO of ASOS said that if the alcohol ever dried er for a sauce then all the ideas would try it with it but anyway we did have some good ideas in the pub and it proved to be so because we grew had office staff within six years from 60 people head office to 2500 people and our sales jumped from 750 K a week to 35 million pounds a week [Applause] it was this media attention and success that roused Sophia Amory soon aka girl boss to contact me directly on LinkedIn she wanted me to come to LA and set up a fashion label for her that was sis alongside her vintage gatherings Nasty Gal collection was born I moved to LA we started to collaborate with Courtney Love iconic original badass and created some incredible collections and I was there for four years until recently I left and joined forever 21 I have just managed to achieve my hat trick I am on my third startup in ten years I have just managed to do the brand and creative direction for a company called Riley rose which you may not have heard of just yet and but we launched our first store in Glendale Galleria last month it is a lifestyle and beauty brand and really is the next generation of brown so highly integrated between the online and offline experience and its really created for millennial girls just like you so please check it out and the the website will be launching on the 4th of November what can I tell you about the last 20 years it's been a whirlwind of events and and definitely been there's been some real personal challenges in there as well as professional challenges but I want to leave you with a couple of things that I think have helped me through the last 20 years I want to say to you all be brave dream the impossible dream the impossible is possible and be a badass and have a good night and Cheers I'll see you at the bar [Applause]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
so I came to tell you guys about this really special gift that I have a gift where people I've just met tell me everything about their sex life they jump right into their sexual fantasies or what age they lost their virginity or if you're from the conservative South you might divulge to me that your first vibrator was purchased illegally in Texas America I'm not a sex therapist I'm an entrepreneur who's been selling sex in Silicon Valley for four years and it has totally changed my life this major shift in my career happened where all of life's major changes happen the psychic Nicole knows what I'm talking about I had gone through a really bad breakup and I hadn't gone on a date in two years and 'va being honest I said no to most other things in life to this psychic had the audacity to tell me that I was a habitual left Swiper she made me promise that for an entire month I would swipe right on everyone and granted they weren't a total creep in the DM I would also agree to a first date there's a lot of weird people on tinder you guys but I did it and by getting into the swing of habitual right swiping in my dating life I started saying yes to other parts of my life too and hence how even though I thought taking a job at a vibrator company would ruin my career in consumer marketing I did it anyway I entered the adult industry and probably the most softcore way you can ecommerce I didn't have to worry about being on camera tech conventions were more applicable than the adult film star Awards and a blazer was encouraged over a g-string my first day at Jimmy Jane my boss the super handsome CEO with a ton of success in Silicon Valley look straight into my eyes and says the word clitoris and later anal beads and eventually conquering i sat there feeling like I was going to cry slash die laughing slash get fired house x-ray companies don't have more HR problems by the way is still the biggest unanswered question in my life later that day I jump into an Hoover to head home and I'm literally praying that this 60-year old man does not ask what type of building missus he did for fear I would have to tell a stranger I work at a sex toy company which I did the conversation went exactly like this this is such an interesting building what type of building is this work office oh yeah what type of work do you do I uh sell stuff online oh yeah my nephew sells stuff on Craigslist it's so interesting what type of stuff do you sell vibrators I sell vibrators okay but I got the hang of it I started telling everyone that I worked at a vibrator company it was like this super awesome party trick where instead of the typical so where are you from I would just tell them about my job and they would start telling me about that one-night stand or how our form to vibrator was so much better than their boyfriend I made deeper connections faster with more people talking about sex than I had in my entire life before I knew it I was running around town sharing stories about that trip to the dildo factory or have that super new super professional photo on LinkedIn was actually shot in a porn studio that said it wasn't all orgasmic there were times it was awkward and super painful I remember being in an airport waiting for my flight sitting on the fetish page of our website frantically fixing a loading issue when suddenly I realized the people around me were whispering and just kind of backing away and then there's the time that a friend called to tell me that my former boss a woman who I loved and looked up to as a mentor was telling my former colleagues that I quit to go do porn I was heartbroken and pre-six sex toy me would have stopped talking about my job publicly but post sext way me was like [ __ ] you lady I am the only woman working at this company and I'm doing it with morals and respect and morals and respect are incredibly important as you can imagine the adult category is heavily dominated by men who sleep with their wives friends the girls they hire for their videos their employees basically any woman ever right right away I had to set boundaries I politely declined dinner invitations I never drink at work events I refuse to go to adult conventions and I straight up walked out of meetings that didn't align with my values for example when Bruce Jenner first came out as Caitlyn i sat on the phone with the creative team as they proposed a blow-up doll with highly offensive copy on the box I hung up on them and took the next day off I'm probably known I'm definitely known as the most boring person in the adult category but I sleep just fine speaking of sleeping Hawking vibes led me to my first threesome the people I met through working in at Jimmy Jane was an unexpected benefit my friend called me one day and said I met this girl she's doing this other vagina thing he doesn't to be perfect for each other Loren Schulte was just starting the Flex company and was looking for a partner with a background in e-commerce and experience selling taboo goods I just happened to have both I joined the company as a co-founder along with our third partner pan-pan for the record we've never had sex but if I'm being totally honest they have because they're engaged our first product flex is a new period product that replaces tampons pads and menstrual cups it's wearable up to 12 hours it's not linked to TSS and it actually helps to relieve cramping if that's not enough for you you can also wear it for mess free period sex because if there's anything sexier than sex its period sex am i right that's what investors thought too when they gave us four million dollars in venture capital to continue growing our business into what it is today a [Applause] multi-million dollar consumer brand leading innovation in feminine care by women for women and so even though I've moved from selling vibrators to period products the sex that I'm selling is not that different because masturbation and menstruation are actually quite similar masturbation is this incredibly awkward thing that everyone does and no one talks about where the entire time you're praying that your roommate doesn't hear or worse walk in on you the same is true with menstruation menstruation is equally awkward everyone does it no one talks about it and the entire time you're praying that your coworker doesn't see you shoving a tampon up your sleeve when you walk to the bathroom to change it or worse walk in on you both come down to a total lack of education so now instead of answering customer inquiries about what size Kegel will fit or to quote Eminem what a woman's clitoris is I spend my time talking to anyone and everyone about the female anatomy how women's health deserves to be in the hands of women why period sex is safe and enjoyable and how if a man offers you a job and a vibrator in public at the Ferry Building in San Francisco it might be worth saying yes to [Applause]

[Applause] hello I wanted to let everyone know that I I live in New York and I flew out this morning because my story actually needs to be told in Los Angeles this city chewed me up and spit me out is there is there anyone here from New Jersey anyone so I'm a typical Jersey girl my my goals in life and my dreams were very one-dimensional it was to get myself to New York and have a successful career and you know I tracked that I was doing it living this city had a job had an apartment and it came time to apply for business schools and it wasn't on my radar to leave New York I you know that was the serious city that's the city of hustle I didn't even think about going anywhere else despite there's you know schools all over that are amazing but I went through a terrible breakup and at that point I just wanted to get as far as I could from New York City the furthest it could take me so I threw in my application to USC and I wasn't really concerned about making this cross-country move I I thought you know I've watched the hills I get it and I'm a freakin New Yorker like I'm gonna run circles around this city it's not gonna be a problem so there was one problem it was 2008 it was the belly of the beast of the recession I worked in private equity I was getting literally a degree that was depreciating in value on a daily basis in the evenings I I could barely get my car from the Brentwood Country Market to Whole Foods without a problem so I was running circles around no one no one and you know it was a rough start to what would be a rough seven years here I had six different jobs I went from finance to online dating to working for a beverage incubator to then the agency side and it was it was I always had to have this kind of side hustle so my side hustle was working with a lot of startups and new companies to try to figure out how they could pitch money what their marketing strategy was what their branding strategy was was and these these jobs this side hustle have had no money I did a lot of things for pro bono or for sweat equity so on top of that I had to have a cash hustle and my cash hustle was I was a nanny I was a driver despite my poor driving I was a bookkeeper and during the holidays I could even be found on Doheny slinging Christmas trees at mister green trees so it was humbling it was clear I was not lower in Conrad this was not the hills and I think where it brought me was I had all these unconventional jobs jobs that did not require me to be at a desk from 9:00 to 6:00 and it really forced me to meet a lot of people and through those moments I met I just built my community in Los Angeles and a lot of the friends here and the people that I met during this time when far and beyond the bounds of normal friendship to help me with my fledgling career one example would be and two of these women are here tonight I had I was the marketing director of a healthy soda flawed flawed from the beginning and two of my girlfriend's started a company where they would come to my beverage events and they would hair chalk and that was a way to lure people over to try this disgusting drink and potentially draw them in and buy it I mean who's who has friends like that I mean that's amazing so despite you know building this community and all the support I felt I really did my breaking point here and you know my agency got purchased by a holding company I got priced out of my apartment in Venice and I had no boyfriend so I thought I'm really lost I'm 33 I don't know what the next move is clearly I've made a lot of bad decisions so I'm gonna do what rational people do and I'm gonna make an appointment with a psychic who you know my mom friends in the Palisades recommended her and they swear that their life turned out the way this woman said it would so I make an appointment and you know she was very professional she asked all of the information you know in advance she had charts and all these things and the first order of business for me was what the am I supposed to be doing with my life nothing is working nothing is working out for me what am I meant to be doing is something's not working and she was quiet and she said your career house is empty I said oh really because I work like a dog since I was 14 so tell me how my career house is empty and she said it just means that you know this life is not about success or working or your career it's about relationships that's lovely I've spent a lot of time and money to the tone of six figures on this career and on this dream so how is it all gonna work out and she said you're gonna meet a man and he's going to be successful and you're gonna help him be successful so I thought about it I was like okay so I have some opportunities rolling in I need to make a decision about where I'm gonna go and what I'm gonna do next and she said well whatever you do it needs to be like you know take it easy it doesn't need to be as ambitious as you've been and you know I can help you make that next move when these offers come in you call me and we will make that decision so I'm driving home I'm digesting all of this and I'm thinking well I'm not gonna die alone and broke there's that but I mean is this really what my path is is this really wondering how I'm gonna be happy and in that moment I had some clarity and I was like I have lost my mind if I think that a psychic in the valley is gonna make my next career choice I need to leave here so the next week when the offers came in I took the most ambitious and aggressive one I could take and I moved to New York I had an offer working for Gary Vaynerchuk and his agency which is not not an easy task and it was the best decision I ever made and my whole LA experience really didn't make any sense to me until I started working it we work and it's not for the obvious reasons it's not because I embrace startups and really worked in that community here but it's because I understand the importance of people feeling supported and for people showing up for other people because of what the LA community did for me so to work for a company that our mission is to create spaces where people can have those human connections and where companies of all sizes and individuals can feel supported and where they can thrive is is amazing and awesome so I'm sure you're wondering about my future husband and if he's he's found me yet he has not but hasn't happened I didn't listen to her but my shirt says boss and that's really all I ever wanted so thank you you [Music]

June Pai heads up the international sales division of Manduka, a yoga apparel and accessories brand with some of the best products on the market.

But while she's well established now, June used to be a little bit lost. 

At 2X in November of 2017, June tells the story of how she found her path.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
hi guys kind of hard to follow that one but we're gonna actually change the pace a little bit I'm June I would work at Manduca which is a yoga company actually and we're gonna do a little bit of yoga right now so I want everyone to sit and close your eyes if it's okay if if you're not comfortable it's okay you can leave them open you can place your hand right hand on your chest and left hand on your stomach again if you don't feel comfortable you can leave them however you'd like and we're just going to take a moment this moment for ourselves we'll take a deep breath in and exhale another deep breath in this time exhale with your mouth and some of you are doing it already we're gonna X inhale and then exhale so that it's audible alright so I think you guys are maybe now ready for my story so I had a really difficult time actually preparing for this because I was trying to avoid the stereotypical oh I live in a patriarchal society or like oh I'm an immigrant and I moved from wherever but you know when you tell yourself not to think about certain things that's all you think about so those are exactly the two things I'm gonna talk about today and I don't really have a cool aha moment where it's struck and where I was like you know what this is where I got my life figured out and the truth is I'm still trying to figure it out and I think many of us still are and so my story's gonna be more about how I got here and how it's okay to be lost and how it's okay to wander so I was born in Seoul and yes it's a well still but at the time was was very male dominant and my mom stayed at home and my dad worked so as you can see it's a very patriarchal society and my parents did a good job though of trying to raise me a very independent strong woman and so instead of joining girl scout I was in a space explorer when other people were doing dance or whatnot I played chess I was I was really into math and science I was a pretty nerdy kid and when I was nine my family decided that we were gonna move to Arcadia which is about 20-ish miles northeast of here so I moved here and thinking this is so great land of equality land of freedom you know I get I get to be I get to be like one of the boys whatever and so I get here and one of the first experiences I have I decided that I wanted to join Little League I'm a huge baseball fan and it was I was gonna be a MLB pitcher when I grew up so I yeah I just moved here there was a little booth in front of a grocery store and I walked up and said I'm gonna join Little League they're like yo are not joining Little League and I said why not and like well girls pay softball here I said what's softball I only watch baseball and and and for two days straight I cried because I didn't let me join Little League so it was a very disappointing moment I moved here thinking that you know everything was gonna be great and then I got turned down can't play baseball so that kind of made me work even harder to compete with the boys and and be one of them at one point I even had a bowl cut glasses and it was a total tomboy I was you know I was a late bloomer [Laughter] and so that path continued on when my friends were joining dance or drill team I tried out to be drum major of a marching band yeah actually that that for many years still teach marching yeah and and I I finally got I told you I was a late bloomer I finally got to college and I was like you know what I don't think people like me you know I like I saw all these pretty girls in sorties and I was like oh wait maybe I want to be one of like you know one of them and that's what I did I I stopped really caring about my academic work I stopped I I stopped I actually quit marching band and and I said I was gonna be in this then I'm gonna be in the sorority um and and I'm it was a great experience I one of my best friends who's here tonight here and and so I'm not saying that joining us already is a bad thing but it's just it took my focus off of many things that were important to me and I really only cared about my appearance and how I looked and if I was liked and when I graduated from college I was really lost because everything that I had focused on before I kind of threw out the door and so I started practicing yoga trying to find clarity trying to find the meaning of life and what am I gonna do next so I'm in a yoga studio and practicing and not finding clarity not peaceful at all but I keep seeing these little red frogs on everyone's mats and like what is going on what are these red frogs so I I google and said what is this brand called Manduca and I found out it's a little yoga company that's based in El Segundo and I was like you know what I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life anyway what the heck I'm gonna apply for a job here so I applied for a job that was seven eight years ago almost and I interviewed with the CEO at the time sky melter and I said hey would would love to join your company I started doing yoga a big fan of your brand and I'm looking for a part-time role I don't really know what I'm gonna do and he said Jun you're not gonna work part-time here you're gonna work full-time I know exactly what you're gonna do and at the time they didn't have an international division so he decided that for whatever reason I would be a good fit for the role and because because of his trust and and confidence in me it really instilled this accountability and responsibility and I said you know what I'm gonna make this happen and and so I did and so for the next seven and a half years and even to this afternoon I've been busting my butt and trying to make this International Business Forum and uka happen and meanwhile I had really great mentors female mentors actually our president now at the at the moment is also a female who have guided me along the way and it's motivated me to get my MBA motivated me to find a couple different companies on my own on the side one of them which is a non-profit and another consulting business and so the moral of my story is it's okay to be lost it's okay to try out different things but don't ever focus on what people perceive of you or what you feel like you have to be because of what society tells you it's okay to be lost try it out but keep finding yourself keep searching and it'll work out [Applause] you

good evening so good to be here so this past weekend my teenage daughter yells at me from across the house mom put down the microphone step away you're scaring us and I would love to tell all of you that I was practicing for this evenings event but no instead I was alone in our living room playing Glee for we anybody else play this fantastic in-home karaoke game any brave souls willing to raise their hands all right a few a few and I'm not sure why I'm obsessed with karaoke because I suck like I'm really really bad like really bad I've had friends family members perfect strangers actually inform me how much I suck but I love it jesse is it okay I'll stop go to song Jessie's girl but yes I'm absolutely obsessed with karaoke and so the crazy part is that my favorite way to do karaoke is with work colleagues now I know a lot of you are thinking what are you nuts making an ass out of myself in front of people that I have to work with day in day out and nfw not going to happen but the reason I love it is for those Joe from accounting moments you we all know Joe Joe is that quiet shy guy that sits in the corner of the office headphones on mesmerized by spreadsheets doesn't interact with anybody else leads lunch at his desk so we're all surprised when Joe accepts the invite for karaoke and not only does Joe show up Joe puts a grabs the mic and from the top of his lung belts out sweet child of mine by Guns and Roses our jaws are on the floor who is this man any perceptions that we had about Joe are completely obliterated but the best part is when you return to work that next day all of a sudden the headphones are off Joe's actually talking to people interactions in Sioux collaboration begins because we saw Joe for Joe and if you think about karaoke it is probably one of our most vulnerable moments right especially for us sucky singers and this word vulnerability has gotten such a bad rap over the last couple years as being weak being taken advantage of but vulnerability is what creates connections karaoke vulnerability connections and especially now with social media where there is so much posturing everything is perfect look at all my family and friends and the beautiful vacations that I take when we know it's not and I share this story because when I look back at my 20 25 year career vulnerability was absolutely a key characteristic in my own success when I started as an entry-level Account Manager back in 1999 I'm sure many of you were still I don't know where I don't want to know I'd be free I knew nothing about internet marketing I knew nothing about affiliate marketing and be free proceeded to give me the largest account at the time now who's crazy you're giving me the largest revenue generator I know nothing about this space and I had my wits about me I don't know how or why to take a step back and figure out what did I know and whether it was my journalistic instinct or I had a successful sales stint prior to I knew I could make connections so that's what I did for those first three to six months is I tried to get to know everybody in anybody that could help me admit in terms of what I did know and what I didn't know because I knew that mistakes would be made I knew that I would absolutely eff up but if I had strong connections with the client and with my colleagues I knew that we could work together through any of those challenges and that we did we survived the dot-com boom the dot-com bust and not only did I never get kicked off the Barnes and noble.com account remember these guys still trying to compete with Amazon but I got more accounts and I eventually got more people in which to help me manage those accounts and that really began my own leadership and stepping-stone on a go-forward basis a couple years later at be free though I definitely hit somewhat of a low point I was working for one of these management by fear bosses anybody else ever worked for one of these yeah lots of fun huh definitely lots of yelling heaven forbid you challenge him or her in a group setting I dreaded weekly staff meetings didn't feel inspired at all and felt instead felt very demoralized but it was also that same time that bfree was actually getting ready to integrate with our closest competitor at the time which was Commission Junction and we actually had a lot of combined leadership meetings talking about people and process and technology and it was in one of these meetings and I was still working for that boss that it was the bfree leadership team on one side of the table and the Commission Junction one on the other side talking about a variety of different concepts and I kind of sat back was fairly quiet because again didn't have much conviction or confidence at point in time and after the meeting one of the female executives pulled me aside her name was Lisa and she said I've talked to you before I know that you know more about some of these concepts than anybody else in this room why didn't you say anything you need to speak up we need your voice in order for this integration to be successful we need a diversity of thought we need different perspectives and I will tell you this one conversation gave me back that confidence gave me back that conviction and I started challenging that fear by management boss because I knew that Lisa was in my corner I knew that she had my back and I know we've all heard the stats we make up women half the workforce but only 25% of us actually possess an executive level position only 6% of the sp500 actually has female CEO so as you get higher we become fewer we must use our voices we must support one another yes we can protest for equality but it's even the smallest of things that nod to another in a meeting the shaking of the head the congratulatory comment after someone gets done with a presentation it's those little things that make the difference do not compete but collaborate so because of this vulnerability and these connections I not only had amazing women throughout the course of my career but I also had a few good men and I wish it was Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise but that's besides the point I did have a few good men actually emerge and I know there hasn't been many as of late when we think about the Weinsteins of the world and the bill o'reilly who have done disgusting and deplorable things but we cannot stereotype them all in 2007 the president position opened up for Commission Junction and the position was based on the West Coast I was currently living in Boston and I was VP of the East Coast and as I said the position opened up and it was myself and one of my peers that was also very much interested in the position he was male he was much closer to the position on the west coast he had more experience than I did he had more revenue responsibilities than I did and we both demonstrated very similar results and our CEO was responsible for making the decision and his name was Jim and many would categorize Jim as an old white guy because he was 60 plus years old at the time he was white and while he was a guy but at the end of the day Jim chose me because he didn't see gender he didn't see male versus female instead what he saw was the role and the requirements for success and yes somebody that could demonstrate results but also had that Drive had that ability to make connections and when I talked to Jim after the fact I said why he said your willingness to learn admitting what you do and do not know that growth potential that vulnerability and I was president from 2007 through 2015 where I grew that company double-digit year-over-year growth 14 offices 400 employees it was a great great run so I'll leave you with this we need more leases we need more gems and we all need more karaoke in their lives thank you very much [Applause]

[Applause] hi everyone thanks for being here so my story starts in 2012 Obama was president yeah pick up for that I was living in New York City I was working at a big ad agency on Park Avenue I was working with big brands big budgets I was on the strategic side of creative which meant I was using both sides of my brain all the time and so things on paper seemed pretty good but I was stuck and feeling unfulfilled and realized that I needed a change I took some time to reflect and realize that over the past few years working at this big agency I I had decided that I was no longer drawn to climbing the corporate ladder there were too much politics too much red tape I couldn't get anything done that I really felt passionate about I also realized that over the past few years I was consciously disengaging from the work that I was doing because by the time or once we started we would have these big ideas everyone get really excited about them and by the time they saw the light of day and ended up somewhere in the world they were so different than what we actually created they had basically all ended up all the good stuff had ended up on the cutting room floor and I was just really frustrating and being able to recognize that you know made me realize that it was time to do something different meanwhile I had all these friends working at startups both in LA and New York and what I saw from them was something entirely different they were passionate about what they were doing they were like deciding to bail on dinner plans with me without even thinking twice because they wanted to work all night and for some reason that seems very appealing to me also so what I what I decided was you know for me to feel this professional satisfaction what I needed was to be making an impact I needed to be building something to be creating something that I could then see out in the world and I took it a step further and realized that I actually wanted to create something physical something that I could hold and touch and use and that people could use around me but I wasn't sure what that was I knew that I was looking for this greater purpose and a job that I could also you know bail on dinner and and work all night and be excited to do so so I decided this is the summer I decided to give myself till the end of the year to figure out what I was gonna do next and so you know I did what most people do is start putting out the feelers I started talking to all of my friends that worked in startups to understand what they were doing and what they thought I could be doing based on my experience and one night out to drinks with a good friend of mine I had been probably complaining for the majority of the time I even spent we were spending together you know just upset about what I was doing and feeling like I didn't know what to do next and you know how would what I was doing it advertising translate to something else and he looked at me and just interrupted me and said you know I don't think you should be looking for what's next in a new company like you should start your own company I see this founder in you and I've never said this before but I really believe in you and that took me by surprise I was not thinking oh it's time to go start my own company next like I've I went to I didn't go to business school you know all these things that you hear about that I didn't identify with that but after that conversation that that idea and that thought really stuck to me and I started to kind of dig deep and think about you know what was it that I was really passionate about where could I find you know this sense of fulfillment and desire to build and learn and keep growing I've always been obsessed with home and interior design I used to help friends and family decorate their homes just for fun which meant that I was doing a lot of shopping with them not my money which also made it more fun I also had an interior design blog long before blogs were cool like in 2006 and while I went through grad school and so you know that was it was something that I was really into and so you know I found myself one day shopping for bedding and had one of those lightning strikes moment when you least expect it and I it was in this big box retailer and I think probably many of you have had this experience before shopping for sheets or for towels or something in these enormous rooms where there's Florida stack ceiling stacked products everything completely undifferentiated no one can help you and I was like this is the worst like this experience is the worst there's no differentiation everything is in packaging that I can't touch you know I think it could be better and I identified this void in the market so I spent a lot of time thinking more about the home category and really understanding where I could fit in and and what I would want to do and and how ultimately I could affect change and that led me to the bedroom because you spend a xxx relief in bed and sleep impacts everything your happiness your productivity and what I realized in one of these like aha moments for me was you know how is it possible that at this day and age there had never been a bedding brand that it asked me how I slept at night like you'd think at some point someone would be like hey you're sleeping like let's make this better and so again this is 2012 we're getting closer to the end of the year at this point but this is when a lot of direct-to-consumer businesses were really starting to gain momentum and I also saw that that was really appealing to me and to my peers and that the you know there was this new way to shop that felt much more authentic and through my experience and advertising and working with consumers and really understanding what motivates them I saw this trend that people really were taking time and spending their money to invest in themselves and so it became clear to me what I was going to do and how I was gonna make impact and so now it's 2013 it's been about a year since this whole process started I left my job I moved to LA to start parachute and I was back in New York and decided to meet my old boss and I showed him my pitch deck and I was all giddy with excitement and also kind of scared with the unknown but had product and we were having coffee and you know at some point he again interrupted me and he was said you know you should have left advertising a long time ago like I said it's clear that this is what you were meant to do and he was right and so you know I realized at this moment that I had had this founder inside of me all along but I was really looking for someone to give me permission and to give me this push to go do something on my own it wasn't something that it ever registered and so I'll leave you with this this is my parting words of wisdom don't wait and give yourself that push you don't need to wait for anyone and dream big [Applause]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
my name is jessica Mackellar I am a CTO I'm sorry I'm a found in the CTO of pilot comm which is a bookkeeping firm that is powered by software is my third company so I should probably consider myself an entrepreneur but that's not actually how I think about myself I think about myself as an activist who happens to be one and my story tonight is about how I came to think about myself in that way so to do this I want to introduce you to two people in my life the first person I want to introduce you to is Sam I've never met Sam Sam is a person I know on the internet and Sam emailed me one day because he had questions about how to think about how to learn to program and he was emailing me because I've produced a bunch of open-source intro to programming material that lives online and so he emailed me and he was asking for some tips and tricks and I read his email and I and I replied to those questions but in reading his email it it seemed to me like there might be a question behind the questions that he was asking and in my reply to Sam I asked him why he wants to learn how to program I'm gonna read you his response because I get emails like this pretty frequently and there they have a pretty powerful impact on how I think about the world Sam says thanks for the response I'm actually in Stephenville Texas I guess not far from Austin but if you compare the two it's a pretty big difference it's a college town but if your first vehicle isn't a tractor you don't really fit in why do you ask I've been learning to program but it comes and goes it's a problem with studying or procrastination but I've been better lately I'm currently doing phone tech support for a less than usual rate per hour and they'll pile on tons more things but the idea of the smallest raise is a huge inconvenience to them if raises occur it's only in dreams and even then unlikely I get yelled at all day don't make enough it's the American dream I think maybe you're starting to see where I'm coming from I'm just very unhappy with my current life and job and it's stagnant and I only make enough to still be behind I can't learn or improve it's only the exact same day in and day out I want something where my skills are actually appreciated maybe compensated about the minimum for once in my life I've been on the other side of this fence for too long and I just feel like giving up it's my second email from Sam Sam we're just getting to know each other it's gonna take a little while to unpack this but Samuel I've kept corresponding and and then helping him think about some programming projects and Sam has Sam has multiple things going on in his life but at the end of the day Sam is a guy from a small town in Texas who just wants to live a life that is meaningful and valued so Sam is the first person I wanted to introduce you to the second person's name is sha and sha is a smart and charismatic leader who cares deeply about the idea of entrepreneurship he sees that as a way to be creative and to build things that can make people's lives better he also sees it as a way to redistribute wealth and he also sees it as a way to create opportunities for yourself if you're in an environment where you might not have very many Shaw is also currently incarcerated at San Quentin State Prison he's serving a seven he's been in for 17 years and he's serving time for assault with a firearm and he's got quite a ways to go Shaak committed a serious crime and he's paid dearly for it but he's also transformed his life over the past 17 years and has frankly probably worked harder than I will ever have to do on anything in my life to demonstrate to society that he is worth a second chance she was also a guy who wants to be able to build something meaningful and valued and so to explain why I'm connected to Sam and to Shaw I actually did take us backwards in time a little bit I need to take us back to when I lived in Boston and I was bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and fresh out of school and I was working as a software engineer at a company founded by some friends of mine out of MIT so I had my work stuff doing my thing and one day a friend of mine named Ashish came up to me said hey Jessica I have a project for us okay she's what's up I've noticed that there are no women in the Boston Python user group and you know Python I know Python what if we made it like a project to get more women into this user group because it's a really good group like the people are good the content is good why is it only dudes okay this sounds like an interesting project yeah let's do it and we we brainstormed on on ways to tackle this problem and we drew inspiration from some outreach initiatives that were happening out west and we devised this intro to programming in Python curriculum that we taught as a series of weekend workshops and initially were really bad at it because we hadn't written like we hadn't taught before we hadn't developed curricula before but we learned a lot through each iteration of this introductory workshop and it started working we started advertising these workshops and they developed a reputation for being pretty good and in particular for being a really welcoming and accessible place for new programmers and so these workshops kept running and they started filling up really quickly and actually this had a transformative effect on the user group the user group actually ended up quadrupling in size to becoming the largest Python user group in the world in large part due to these outreach efforts and the people directly impacted by these efforts but also the signaling that it provided more broadly in the community but this was a place that cared about diversity and inclusion and was welcoming to people of diverse backgrounds and so we were running his workshops and we've been running with him for about a year and then a really important thing happened at a user group event this woman named Reece a who had gone through she actually gone through the intro workshop twice she came up to me and she wanted to tell me something Risa had been out of the workforce for a while she's been focusing on raising her daughter and she had decided that she wanted to get back into things and in particular she wanted to be a software engineer but she had no prior programming experience and and so she had gone to these intro workshops and she had worked very hard in a very focused way to prepare herself to apply for software jobs and she came up to me yet one of these user events to say that she'd finally done it so six months beforehand she had not known how to program and she went through these intro workshops and she wanted to tell me that this was really the kick in the pants that she needed to really focus on this and she had worked very hard and she landed a job as a software engineer and she was starting in a couple of weeks and that was really exciting to me because that wasn't I hadn't intended to build up a system that might potentially change someone's life in quite that way and the fact that it was having this unintended consequence was really powerful to me and I was thinking about this in the car on the way home and I was thinking it's cool we've run his intro to programming workshops it's cool that we say got a job wait what problem are we solving again we aren't there any women in this user group actually like do I actually understand why that's happening also actually why aren't there any people of color in this user group actually remind me again who has like the opportunity to take programming classes and actually who has access to a computer at home so they might even be able to experiment with this stuff oh this isn't actually about Python and and you start realizing that the disparities that you see in like this this tiny little this tiny little idea like this idea of an open-source user group the disparities that you see who is there and who isn't are a reflection of some very fundamental disparities in society that we've collectively created around education and access and representation and stereotypes and this point my 22 year old mine is like open because when you start doing this root cause analysis on why there are no women in a programming user group you realize that while you can implement the tactical fix of running a programming workshop if you want to actually solve this problem you have to reach back to these really fundamental societal inequalities and address those at that point congratulations you're an activist and you can't really turn back so at that point my commitment to this work really grew I became a director for the Python Software Foundation which is a non-profit behind the language I produced a bunch of material programming material that I made freely available online so people can learn from it I joined the staff of PyCon which is a large open-source conference to work on inclusion and representation and concurrent with that I had my work life where I was busy building companies and building teams and then I started paying attention to these bigger picture issues in a in a more intentional way I started caring about voting riots I bought an American flag cat suit and started running polling stations during elections I started paying attention to criminal justice reform and in particular investing money and time and initiatives bringing the stories of people who are incarcerated to the public because I believe that empathy around that will be a prerequisite to reform and I'm definitely out of time that's too bad and at some point in that process I had the single most important realization that I've had as an adult human being which is that the work that I do inside of work and the work that I do outside of work are actually the same thing and the work is always about building a diverse and inclusive community that is doing the right thing and this realization is important this realization is important because it reframed how I think about what my job is because my job today is only peripherally to be the CTO of a tech company this company is one of a constellation of opportunities in my life to connect people and do the hard work of pushing the community design into a more just place so this is why half of the people that I work with in my company are people that I met doing open-source community building and why my engineering team is 50% women that's why the people from work are also the people building job training programs for incarcerated people with the California Department of Corrections that's how I ended up in a room with Shaw and 15 other lifers at San Quentin State Prison talking about technology in the criminal justice system as part of a journalism class at the institution which is how I met Shaw that time working this is a true story I'm working with guys who graduated from that job training program at San Quentin that was built by my co-workers to submit talks to PyCon which is this programming conference that I've been running diversity and inclusion initiatives for the past five years when I say it's all connected it's really all connected and this is why I always answer emails from people like Sam who's just a guy from a small town in Texas who wants to have a chance to live a life that's meaningful and that's why shot knows that if he ever gets out he always has a job with me so this stuff is all connected and I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to experience these open-source things early and and realize this orientation for my life because it's had a profound impact on Who I am as a person as well as as a manager and as a leader and that's how I became an activist who happens to be an entrepreneur [Applause]

[Music] [Applause] hi my name is Jennifer Cheung and I'm one of the founders of Lanier we're an independent design studio making minimalist high quality leather bags and watches my partner Roman and I got our start three years ago in 2014 when we launched our first collection of men's bags on IndieGoGo the crowdfunding platform with the help of more than 500 guys total strangers from around the world we were able to raise $150,000 in funding which was essentially $150,000 of pre-orders and with that we were able to start production after that Roman and I took turns working full-time on linear with the other person working a full-time job so that we could keep a roof over our heads until we knew our business had legs today we're still proudly bootstrapped and we're a tiny team is just the two of us and we have three remote team members and we're on track to do more than ten million dollars in sales this year selling only online now I know that many people think that my life seems really glamorous charmed even I get to work with my partner I get to live in Florence Italy I get to design beautiful products I get to bring a creative vision into reality that's pretty cool but today I want to show you that my life is not so glamorous at all I want to show you the ugly side and I think this is so important to talk about because we live in a world of sensational headlines and Instagram and I think it's so easy to look at somebody else's story from afar and think man she has it so easy I think this kind of attitude is especially dangerous if you're an entrepreneur or if you plan to start your own business one day because it creates really unrealistic expectations of yourself and if what your entrepreneurial journey will look like so tonight I'm going to tell you about a particular low point that I've experienced and when I say low point that's a huge understatement because these were truly terrifying a few weeks of my life this was January 2016 and Roman and I had lon a collection of women's bags on Kickstarter a few months before we were going to China to our factory to do our final quality control before sending out thousands of parcels all around the world now when we arrived at the factory we were astounded to discover that there was something a little off with the leather of one of our bags the soft tote that meant that the factory had received the leather a few months before had seen that it didn't quite match the sample decided not to tell us and then proceeded to make backs with them and we were finding out at the eleventh hour now we had 350 women who had kind of pre-ordered the bag a few months before and they were waiting for this bag and we knew that a lot of them might not have noticed a difference because they've never seen the sample in real life but we were adamant that we were not going to send out a single bag that was anything less than perfect so we went to the factory owner to try to find a solution and he reacted really badly he refused to admit that they'd made a mistake in fact he put a metaphorical gun to her head he said you either take everything and pay for everything including the defective bags or you leave it all here now the factory was already one month late with production and they were just about to close for three weeks for Chinese New Year we decided to take a calculated risk we had thousands of other parcels that needed to go out with good bags and we didn't want to risk the factory keeping them over Chinese New Year and so we knowingly spent tens of thousands of dollars on defective merchandise to ensure that the factory released our goods we were taking a gamble that we would be able to reason with a factory owner later on but deep down inside we knew we were in big trouble there was no way we could continue to work with this guy and so we booked it to Italy now in Italy we had four goals the first was we had to find a new tannery because we no longer trusted the tannery that had made the bad leather in the first place second we had to find a new factory third we had to send out thousands of parts for all the backers and customers who'd been waiting and forth we had to break the news to the 350 people who were waiting for the soft oats now things started to go downhill pretty quickly our fulfillment partner lost control over the warehouse that they subcontracted and while they were supposed to send out thousands of parcels after 5 days by day 5 they had only sent out 26 now we were staying in a tiny crappy Airbnb in Florence with no heat and we would wake up at 2:00 in the morning so that we could be awake when the warehouse staff woke up and we would call them and try to get control of the situation and then we would go to sleep at 4:00 a.m. we'd wake up again at 6:30 and start calling 350 people who were waiting for the totes Roman and I personally called each and every single one of them we had to explain to them that there was a problem we were trying to remake the totes but we weren't quite sure when they would be ready not a fun conversation to have that was all before 8:30 in the morning at 8:30 we would get in our rental car drive out of the city and meet with a bunch of suppliers tanneries and factories over lunchtime we tried to take a nap in our car somewhere and then over the afternoon we would have back-to-back meetings trying to find the tannery in the factory who could help us solve this problem we drive home at 6:00 and then it was time for more phone calls this time to her backers and customers in the Western Hemisphere after a few more hours of phone calls we would open our inboxes and have to deal with the hundreds of emails coming in from anxious people wondering where their parcels were we'd go to sleep at midnight wake up at 2:00 and so on and so on we did this for three weeks we had so little money in the bank we were freezing our tails off in this Airbnb and there was not a night that we slept more than four hours in a row and all this time we had this ominous feeling that everything that we had worked so hard to build over the last year and a half would just come crumbling down around us well it didn't come crumbling down and bit by bit we had small breakthroughs and we were slowly able to write the we found a tannery we found a factory we started making the replacement totes we finally solved our fulfillment problem by calling their investors and most of the 350 people that we called up were really kind and understanding best of all when we finally sent out the totes five months later they were delighted but it was only two months later that we finally felt that we had crawled ourselves out of this deep dark hole and were finally on solid ground again and that was when we launched a Kickstarter campaign for our new watch collection amazingly that Kickstarter campaign raised a million dollars and was only then when we saw that million dollars on her campaign page that we've breathed the sigh of relief and thought that we were able to keep moving on now many people wrote to me around that time marveling at the Kickstarter campaign oh my gosh and 1 million dollar campaign that's incredible that's an overnight success well now that you know what we went through in the months leading up to that you'll know that it was not an overnight success it certainly wasn't very glamorous and it wasn't very fun at all we had gone through months of despair we had gone and cheated out of half a year of my salary and we'd been on the verge of bankruptcy the thing is entrepreneurship is a crazy incredible ride but it's messy it's unpredictable and it will squeeze you of everything that you've got the reality is you're going to fall on your face over and over again I keep falling on my face and I know it's not going to stop but it's in those moments when you feel like you've fallen on your face that you get to show the universe what you're made of you pick yourself up you dust yourself off and you keep putting one foot in front of the other that is what real entrepreneurship looks like not some splashy headline or some carefully curated Instagram account so don't be fooled by mine and be ready for a fight best of luck over there ventures [Applause] [Music]

imagine that you're on a roll that you love and there's a new opportunity on the horizon it's one that you've been working towards and that really gives you a much bigger role in your company at the same time you're also thinking of starting a family and I'm wondering what the best time to do that is what would you do I was in this situation a couple of years ago and I'd like to share my story with you but before I get into that I'd like to tell you about what sort of what got me to Airbnb I had a fairly straightforward path into tech I was influenced by my brother I played computer games got introduced to programming I and computer science I learned programming actually in after-school classes in high school I moved to the US for undergrad and that's actually where I got enthralled by computer science I realized that it was a tool that I could just apply to so many different fields biotech education and and many others I found my niche in a field called natural language processing which is about how computers can better understand how humans interact how do we express ourselves what do we say and in senior year of high school now most of my classmates were all applying for jobs on Wall Street and it felt a little bit crazy the path that I was going down because it was so drastically different from everyone else I just felt that if I had the comfort of a salary and a well-paying job that I just might not want to go to grad school I was fortunate that I immensely respected both my advisor and my brother that had done a PhD and I sort of you know used that as support to kind of you know go on that path I did a lot of research in undergrad and grad school and I thought that initially that I'd might want to do a PhD but then I really liked sort of the directly affecting the end user and building real-world applications and that's what got me to Google I spent six years there as an individual contributor I learned how to build production systems how to really build products for for the end user and do machine learning at scale and sort of you know looking back at this I I would say it's it's important to find that support system that's gonna help you pursue your dreams you know it's okay to do things that aren't like your peers as long as you know you have a lot of strong conviction and you know where you're headed I eventually landed it at Airbnb and I fundamentally believe that you know planning planning a trip planning a travel experience was just difficult and we had the power to create really meaningful experiences I also believe that accommodations finding a place to stay was just one part of that entire travel journey in 2014 I started what we call the discovery team and the goal here was to help guests find an imp occurred esta nation so this was people that were higher up in the intent funnel and you know I think this product ended up being a bit ahead of its time and at the end of the year we sort of decided to focus on more core search efforts but the time for this actually came again in 2016 we as a company we're going to launch a new vertical called experiences and we were gonna put out this vision for how we want to effect sort of all of travel it was a very exciting time for the company and I had something exciting going on in my personal life I was pregnant with our first baby and you know I sort of at that point or if I actually think just more generally I felt that I always wanted to find a job that I was super excited and passionate about and also balance that with with sort of balance work in personal life and I felt that enough people weren't talking about this you know as women and I think maybe everyone sort of you want time things pretty perfectly you know how does it work with this job that you're going after or this promotion that you want and I remember I was having conversations with my husband where I said you know maybe we should just wait two months because then this it'll line up perfectly with this project and you know looking back it's actually so silly because you know there's there's just so many unknowns with having a baby and you also just you know or when you think of the grand scheme of things two months here or there is nothing or you know even just six months it just it really doesn't matter and you know I sort of kind of got past that and and I was gonna be out on leave starting July of last year and the launch was in in November and at that point I I did feel pretty bummed because I said okay what does this mean for my career it was this great opportunity that I wasn't gonna be a part of and you know it's it's a deadline you you're gonna go you can't sort of extend it or anything and so I went out on leave and you know when I came back I sort of it was quite an experience actually getting just getting used to sort of the new normal I remember that first week I had a goal of coming in at 9:00 a.m. and I I think I just it literally was 10 a.m. every single day that I got in and we had this perk at work where we could take off a day for each week for eight weeks and I didn't end up using that I instead just gave myself a lot more flexibility and I also told myself that okay November and December is gonna be just an easier sort of time back into work and I think this actually also helped me with just what ended up being a role change for me so my manager ended up leading this new effort the trips team and that meant that there was a roll open and so I took on sort of leading the umbrella team and so I went from managing 40 engineers 200 with that change and then you know a few months later in June of this year we again we organized ourselves into businesses and we brought together a whole bunch of teams and created a new one called Holmes and I lead engineering for that and when and and you know I I grew my team from sort of hundred to two hundred fifty and you know it was one of those things that if I'd been optimizing so carefully for each step you know I might not have even gotten this opportunity and sort of you know the lesson that I learned in all of this is that you sort of you don't by not by closing some door and your personal or in your professional life it might sort of you might not know what the impact of that is on your personal life and vice versa and so really just think of what you want to optimize for optimize for what's important to you because the worst thing is that you have resentment later on [Applause] and the final part of my talk is going to be on just that relationship with your manager so a lot of people talk about how important it is to have a mentor or a sponsor and I agree with that but I also want to say that cultivating that relationship with your manager is incredibly important if you think of how you're gonna get opportunities at work your manager has to advocate for you right they are the ones that they might not have the opportunity available but they are the ones that are gonna tell your story and think about you when the right opportunity in the organization comes about so I would really think of sort of what you the relationship you have with your manager and try to think of whether they understand what success means for you and can they connect the dots and line up your career goals with other opportunities another thing I want to call out is that disagreement is okay you know it's just it manages your relationship with your manager is just another relationship you have just as one with your friends you have to nurture it if there's tension you have to get through it and really understand what's at the root of it you know with I had something with my manager where we had to figure out how we were going to work together and it was a new team that I took on from him and we tried to get to the root of really what we what was important to us what was important for the team and when we worked backwards from there everything was much easier um so I would say really invest in that relationship with your manager my manager played a big part in the role that I have today because he was the one that advocated for me to his manager who ran all of engineering and you know I'm at this position now at Airbnb which is which is exciting so at the beginning of this talk I asked you what you would do in my situation and it's it's a trick question really because there's no wrong answer and that's what I'd like to leave you with today when it comes to your life you should do what feels right to you and be flexible in times of change because you never know what door is gonna open up for you in your professional life thank you you

Elizabeth Yin has had a hell of a career. She's a founder many times over, sold a company, advises and invests in startups, was a partner at 500 Startups, and recently launched her own VC fund for up and coming businesses.

At 2X in October 2017, Elizabeth told stories around the unglamorous truth of being a female entrepreneur. She got real.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
hi everyone how are you doing my name is Elizabeth yen and I've been a startup founder and now I'm a startup investor and because of this a lot of people often ask me well how did you know that you are passionate about startups or startup investing and the truth is I didn't or I don't you know everybody is trying to find their passion these days but passion you know I think you can you can go your whole life and search for what you're passionate about and just never find it so tonight this happened anybody so tonight I'm gonna tell you about the guiding light that I use for my own career and it's really simple it's this I like to jump into fascinating adventures or work with amazing people that's it or ideally both so I'm gonna share with you three stories the first is how I actually decided to start my company launch bit and that was entirely about working with amazing people and in fact actually it started a long time ago back in high school so in ninth grade my best friend Jennifer one day she came to me and she said hey my cousin Tony is starting a company do you want to help him out during winter break I had no idea what a startup was but I didn't have anything going on during winter break and the opportunity to work with Jennifer and her cousin and all these other people seemed really cool so we came up to San Francisco went to his office and it was a really amazing experience we did not help with anything we were worried were useless but just observing everything was amazing here was her cousin Tony he was working with his friends and they were building things and they could eat all the pizza in the world it was the dream so on that day I decided that that was what I wanted to do when I grew up I wanted to build things with my closest friends and actually you know Jennifer and I made a pact in high school that we would start a company together someday now on that day I was really naive I had no idea how startups make money or any of that in fact actually it wasn't until two years later that I realized what would happen next when her cousin Tony actually sold that company to Microsoft for what was reported a couple hundred million dollars and then later he went to bet on another company another startup which he now runs a day a small little shoe company you may know called Zappos so I did not know though on that day that that you know that is one way to make money all I knew was I just wanted to work with my friends so years later in 2010 Jennifer and I teamed up and we started launch bit and over the next few years we grew it we eventually sold it to a larger company on the East Coast and really what drove me to do that startup it was all about working with amazing people the second story that I want to share is about having an adventure so my senior year of college I got in my head that I wanted to go to business school and the fall that year I was applying to business schools as a senior in college and I really wanted to visit a couple of the schools that I was applying to that were in Boston but I was here on the west coast I didn't want to pay for my plane ticket to go to Boston so I decided that somebody else would pay for this ticket for me fortunately there was actually a competition of some sort where the prize was a free trip to Boston just coincidentally it was just right there around that time and I entered the contest and I won and so I got my free trip to Boston and this competition was sponsored by a job fair it turns out that that job fair was the largest job fair for jobs in Japan I don't know why they hold it in Boston every year but they do and in order to get my reimbursement for the plane ticket I had to go to the job fair as it would turn out I did not get into any business school that year but I ended up getting a job on the spot at the job fair so I you know I was kind of conflicted about what to do but it's not a really amazing to be able to work in Tokyo this is not something I had planned and so I took the job the next fall I moved to Tokyo and a month into the job my boss pulled me aside and he said Elizabeth this really is not working out your Japanese is not good enough for this job and I was just like oh my god am I getting fired from my first job here and fortunately they were really nice about it they said okay you can't stay in this job but we're gonna move you into the marketing department where you will not have to talk with customers so that's how I ended up getting into marketing and but they said that actually they didn't have enough budget for me to stick around for very long so I ended up trying to figure out what I wanted to do next around that time and since it was the fall again I decided to reapply to business school this time I only had enough time to apply to one school and I actually really didn't have time to rewrite any essay so I sent in the same ones unfortunately the questions were the same and I sent in the same letters of recommendation and I didn't have time to take the test again so I sent in everything pretty much the same and this time I got in my takeaway from that is I couldn't get into business school so I got this job and I couldn't keep the job so I got into business school and the the overall lesson that I learned though is that you just never really know how failure and success will be coupled together you just when you do one of these adventures and you jump in you can't really see the end result but somehow everything will just sort of all work itself out and you should just go for it anyway even if you don't think you're qualified enough to speak enough Japanese for a job or what not the last story that I have to share is about how I got into startup investing so I actually had never ever thought about becoming either a venture capitalist or nor had thought about getting into startup investing and the the short story is after jennifer and I sold launch bit eventually I made my way back to 500 startups which is where launch bit had been incubated a few years before and I went there because again I either really like working with amazing people or jumping into adventures and there were a number of amazing people whom I wanted to work with there and what I noticed in the process of getting into investing I had the opportunity to work with hundreds of teams that went through our accelerator program and so I saw a lot of teams and how they executed and I'm sure many of you already know this somewhat intuitively but having actually seen a lot of the data what really floored me was this founders who fit a certain profile like their pedigree or the way they look or the way they talk if they check all the boxes it's really easy for them to raise money but if they don't and the in even if these founders execute really well it is very difficult for them to raise money now this may sound somewhat obvious or intuitive to many of you if you are startup founder you've shared this sort of experience but I've actually seen it firsthand with hundreds of startups and so along the way about a year ago my friend Eric bond and I started batting around this idea of can we change this can we bring about a meritocracy to at least early-stage startup investing or at least work in that direction and so we decided that the best way to try to tackle this problem is to start a new VC fund we had no intention ever of becoming venture capitalists but this was the vehicle for doing so and this is where I am today in my career journey this is yet another adventure that I am jumping into one that is very meaningful to me and also fortunately I also have the opportunity to work with amazing people such as Eric such as many of our collaborators and founders and investors and I don't know where it will lead but it is going to be another amazing journey now if I look at my own resume and I see ok I was at a tech company and then I became a start-up founder and then now an investor it almost seems like oh that was very intentional but in actuality at each of these steps it was very fuzzy the whole way through I never knew what was going to happen at the end of each journey but that's ok because even though that was fuzzy one thing that was very clear to me at each point in time was that I knew that by jumping into either an adventure or working with amazing founders I would learn a lot and I would grow a lot and so I encourage all of you as you look at your own careers to kind of think about it in this lens can you jump into an amazing adventure can you work with amazing people rather than looking from the perspective of am i passionate about this or am I going to be able to climb up this ladder because ultimately by jumping into amazing journeys or working with amazing people you will find a lot of personal growth and ultimately that's what people value in their careers thank you [Applause] you

While she was in college, Rachel Sumekh started a project aimed at putting unused cafeteria credits to good use: feeding hungry people.

Now Rachel runs Swipe Out Hunger: a non-profit designed to end hunger among students. 

At 2X in October 2017, Rachel told the story of the time she was approached by an assemblywoman to put together a piece of legislation addressing student hunger solutions, and how this invitation changed Rachel's entrepreneurial journey.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
I was 19 years old when a few friends and I walked out onto the streets of Los Angeles and handed out our first meal fast-forward to today and we've served 1.3 million meals my name is Rachel sumac you can call for that thank you my name is Rachel sumac and I'm the co-founder and CEO of a start-up nonprofit called swipe out hunger and we allow college students to donate the extra money from their meal plan to hungry people in their community particularly other college students how many of you went to a public elementary middle or high school all right go public schools I imagine that you also remember those huge cafeterias where you would go in there's a long line you're waiting you're picking up the things that you want and as you approach the lunch lady some students handed money and some students handed in la a little yellow lunch ticket and in cities like New York 70% of students are eligible for free lunch so many that they just passed a law making just free lunch and breakfast for everyone great stuff I'm in the city like Los Angeles it's 50% of students and I remember being a kindergartener as one of those students standing the lunch I'm a little yellow ticket clenched in my hand ready to get my lunch my parents were immigrants they're Persian Jews Iranian Jews and they were just started to get their stride in Los Angeles we're still hustling to make it happen and I was very lucky that by the time I started fourth grade they had made it they were accomplishing the American dream and we were living a pretty good life but I think at the moment that they really thought I had accomplished the American dream was when their daughter got accepted to UCLA and you think go Bruins UCLA and most colleges don't have large cafeterias like public schools but we do have amazing dining halls and meal plans and for anyone who might remember buying that 10-15-20 meal week plan and having extra left over on your plan by the end of the week which you didn't use would roll over and roll over by the end of the semester I maybe you guys can relate to this you had hundreds of dollars left over you weren't sure what to do with it my friends and I found ourselves in the same predicament we said that there must be something better that we can do with this we decided to get a little table set up outside the dining hall and ask our friends and ourselves to go inside and buy to go boxes of food bring it out to us which we would then go and hand out to people on the street has this mountain of white styrofoam boxes behind this by the end of the day is pretty incredible and the first thing UCLA administrator had to say to us was get this the hell off campus as you can imagine they weren't the biggest fans of a bunch of college students walking into the dining hall buying this food they didn't expect to have to prep and having this flow dozens of students going in and out but rather than either disobey them or lay down we thought that we had a valid claim here so we decided to do a little bit of community organizing we got campus administrators involved we got a couple student body president of the SU by president student government involved and after a couple months of negotiation got them to agree to a new model now students were able to approach a table outside the dining hall at the end of the semester and say I want to journey my hundred extra points those funds are taken from their account and used to help help end hunger in the community was very exciting slowly we started to get attention from other schools you see at USC down the street UC Santa Barbara or you began to grow by 2013 we had received more attention than we can handle more interest was coming in we decided we needed to hire someone full-time and because this is a female empowerment you know I'm happy but like a female focus event it would be a shame if I didn't share at least one of the many daily microaggressions I have to face and this one was actually something that helped shift us push us forward it was when a break called one of my co-founders and I said he's a couple years older than me he said hey I know we're trying to hire someone and you know what if I stepped into this role as CEO and his response was I'd really thought about that you know I think you're just too nice to be a leader and I took it really personally because I saw myself as capable and in my mind being nice never conflicted with leadership so what I did instead was get a mentor put together a business plan build a budget put together a Job Description move back to Los Angeles in September 2013 walk into a Starbucks open my laptop and stop my first day as a full-time executive director so I've got hunger a couple months couple months after that day about a little less than a year year later I remember sitting now in a cool co-working space looking across from an excel sheet saying that we have collected hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars just by looking at meal plans and thinking to myself that's amazing I know these dollars are probably doing something really good in the world but I'm not sure like what like where are they what's going on and I started to ask myself what if we actually channelled these funds towards something specific something measurable something we knew would make a difference and that's when the opportunity and almost a responsibility to tackle a specific segment of hunger became clear and that was to focus on college student hunger the same kindergarten to 12 you 12th grade student who hustled their way through school is now in college still hungry has a diet and the first thing you do you wants your budget is tight is to cut your food and if you ask me I don't think ramen noodles is enough to keep someone going consistently and able to be successful in class so I felt hunger began to channel these funds from one students meal plan on to another starting in 2012 2002 today and now students are able to walk into the dining hall and have an amazing warm meal just like everyone else but I'm not here to share our founding story with you actually here to share the story of a phone call I received in March of this year it was a phone call from the legislative aid of a local Assemblywoman and she asked me you know we've been thinking about the issue of college student hunger it's pretty prevalent in California and across the country one in four students at UCLA and UC Berkeley regularly skipped meals because of lack of access to funds and her office this Assemblywoman wanted to take this on as her issue she used to be a professor at UC Santa Barbara and saw how the impact of hunger the impact hunger had on her student's academic performance she asked me if we were to pass a law that would scale your program statewide what would you want it to say and I literally started bawling and lifted my jaw off before I like pitch the idea are to and does everyone know what this seat assembly is this is California we just like the federal government there's a Senate and the House of Representatives in California we have a Senate and in assembly so a couple weeks later I get an email back from them with a proposal on official state letterhead the watermark with the words that I said being proposed as a bill for the state of California fortunately there are amazing amazing policy wonky people who helped make it actually effective and it and look nice and then a few weeks later I gave the most important pitch of my life which was a two-minute pitch to the Senate the assembly higher ed committee in Sacramento begging them asking them inspiring them to adopt this piece of legislation and a couple weeks ago we were now months in June we were sitting in our office and we were keeping an eye on the bill and made it past assembly was getting through the Senate before made it through the Senate Governor Brown plucked it up put it into his budget and with the bill said was any university at 144 public community colleges state schools and you sees if they implement this bill which said if you have our program or a food pantry and also someone on campus who helps people sign up for CalFresh for food stamps then you'll be able to get some of this funding and we had originally thought a campus would get a couple thousand dollars Governor Brown created a 7.5 million dollar fund based off of the program a couple of 20-somethings started based off legislation a 25 year old bro and now the state of California is finally taking seriously the impact that lacking basic needs has on its college students and just as a reminder a few years ago I was being told get this the hell off my campus and a few years after that I was being told I'm not capable of doing this that I'm too nice and after that I was told this is such a nice volunteer project but when are you gonna leave and go to law school you know you went to a good school you can do something real with your life and as I think about what lessons or things I want to look back on and share there's two that really come to mind the first is that innovation does not come from an app that saves you two minutes in the morning even those are great and I use them true innovation is whenever you reexamine the resources and systems around you and see them in new ways and you ask how do I make this better how do I change this system a resource to help impact someone else's live life and those are things that we can take steps towards tomorrow and the other thing I want to share is sometimes you have an idea and you're notched or if it's the right thing the way to solve that is by just doing it and being open to feedback and responses and asking yourself how do I make this better every single day but continuing to be committed to it while also being open to what's possible because you never know you might end up swiping out hunger thank you [Applause] [Music] you

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
what a crowd I'm Rachel Williams I'm head of diversity and inclusion at Yelp but that is not what I'm gonna talk about because I do have several stories about that job I am gonna talk a little bit about an experience I had and how it impacted me so I'm a Bay Area girl born and raised anybody else in the bay write to all others welcome to our town I was born into a really big family over 300 family members in the bay area alone right we're Christian not more men don't ask my parents are working-class my dad makes parts for submarines at Northrop Grumman my mom was a hairdresser and like all parents they wanted the best for me what which means better education so they did what they had to do to make sure that I went to the finest schools San Mateo County could offer so that meant being bussed from my neighborhood to a predominantly white neighborhood imma let you guys in on a little secret and black families black parents have to have a race conversation with their children very early I've had two such conversations with my mom the first one five years old five years old getting ready to go to candy garden real school I was dressed in my red Reds my favorite color still is red dress red pigtails I was matching it was ready to go she pulls me aside and she says so I just want you to know that you're not gonna be like all the other kids and I gave her this look like what in the hell are you talking about lady I'm ready to go to school I grabbed my strawberry short cut cake lunch pail and like ran to the car she said she couldn't even finish the rest of the talk because I was like not having any of that the second time I got that talk was as I was entering my freshman year in high school I went to a very pristine Aegeus an elite private school and a little Enclave and outside of San Mateo and a very prestigious neighborhood and all of the students there had very well-known parents and my mom says well you're gonna go to this school because you're gonna help bring diversity and in exchange you're gonna get a good education which sounds like a fair deal to me I can be myself and get a free education no problem done easy-peasy so freshman year easy making friends cuz what's not to like about me [Applause] now the school part was a little bit rough very small classes ten people in a class so there was no way to hide that you didn't do your homework so little rocky but I made it through second year sophomore year was really excited to take this creative writing class so I was like this is my jam I love writing I've been writing since I was about five years old saved all those books guys ever want to read him sent him around to you but this is my thing like this is where I can really shine so I was I'm in the class and the class is being led by a wonderful woman who I felt a kindred spirit with she was lesbian and masculine what a short haircut and very different from the other professors at this very prestigious private school so I was like my girl right there I'm different she's different like it's gonna be great definitely gonna Ace this class so I remember staying after class one day and talking to her and saying hey you know so I think I want to be a creative writer or you know a journalist or something and she very plainly said to me you don't have that talent yeah think about how I felt crushed beyond belief because I had been writing since the little girl with the pigtails with the Strawberry Shortcake lunch pail so from that moment on I stuck to just writing my book reports no more creative writing no more thoughts of writing a play no more writing poetry no more writing anything extra I go on go to UC Berkeley Khan fluttering right yeah go bears fluttering around I end up with a psychology degree again no writing involved in that really not really a little bit maybe and so I'm I'm never thought again about about writing because you don't have that talent is just ringing in my ears so I'm in this job head of diversity and inclusion at Yelp and it affords me the opportunity to speak to crowds like this and I was at South by Southwest last year chatting and talking about well diversity and inclusion and a publisher came up to me afterwards and said I think I think like you can't you should write a book haven't you heard I don't have that talent I can't do that so I was flattered beyond belief right because that's my ultimate dream to write it's what I've always wanted to do but I don't think that's my jam anymore really stick to this public speaking thing this diversity inclusion belonging equity equality thing activism you know that's my jam now I don't want to write about that so um I'm at my local Whole Foods over in Oakland and I'm doing my huge you know in the line chatting with everybody bah bah bah bah bah what did you get have you tried this and I see this gray-haired woman with the very short haircut and masculine build and she's chatting me up she's like hey you look familiar do you work here no I don't but I'm here very often I'm a loyal customer maybe you've seen me around yeah maybe that's it so we're leaving she's walking we're going out and she's still chatting me up you know like she can't place my face and I could see her racking her brain where does she know me from so we get to the parking lot and she's telling me about the car she just bought and her son and she had just moved back here and I don't know if it was the turn in her face or what it was but it dawned on me that that was that professor from my high school who told me I did not have that talent right this is the moment I have been waiting for like I'm gonna tell this woman what's up so I said um did you ever teach a class and uh San Mateo County and brown 1990 I'm not gonna tell the rest cuz you guys she was like yes I said well I was one of your students and not a very good student according to you and she said oh I wouldn't even remember that and it was at that moment I realize that her words had such an impact on me change the trajectory of my career but I had no impact on her so lesson do not let anybody tell you what you can and cannot do nobody nobody secondly mind your own words be careful what you say to other people because you don't know how they're gonna impact a child or someone's dreams so I told her I said well funny that we're meeting because I was just approached by a publisher to write a book and it's gonna be coming out in 2018 what's your address I'll send you a copy [Applause] so be on the lookout for my book coming soon thank you [Applause]

so let's give it up for Tom bill you [Applause] [Music] everybody man come on we got to do better than that I want to know how many born entrepreneurs do we have in the crowd all right nice well I'm very much not a born entrepreneur and that's very important to know about me I know a lot of you out there were selling flowers that you plucked out of somebody's yard selling them right back to them or you were trading baseball cards or selling candy lemonade stands all of that I was not I was raised to be a good employee which meant keep your head down do as little work as possible and avoid punishment at all costs and that literally is what my parents taught me to do and that's what I thought that a good employee did and that was really how I started and so really a bad track for somebody that wants to ultimately become an entrepreneur but to be honest I didn't start out wanting to be an entrepreneur I wanted to be a filmmaker I went to film school that was my background I was obsessed with human psychology that was really the big driver for me and I learned a lesson along the way which was if you really want to control the art you have to control the resources and so that began my entrepreneurial journey of really wanting to be able to make the things that I wanted to make but to do that you have to really be in control so I met these two guys incredible human beings because there were two things about myself that I said so I grew up in a morbidly obese family in Tacoma Washington and a family that teetered between blue-collar and white-collar and I said to myself there are two things about me that I know somehow in the future I'm going to make come true one someday I'm going to have six pack abs and someday I'm going to be rich give it up I had absolutely no idea how I was going to make either of those two things come true but I really did believe to the core of my being that I would someday figure it out so when these two buff bodybuilder guys who were very successful entrepreneurs came across my path and they said Tom you're coming to the world with your handout and if you want to control the resources you've got to learn business you've got to get rich so come with us we're building this technology company we need somebody to be a copywriter and this was back when I was a good employee keeping my head down doing as little work as possible and avoiding punishment at all cost they brought me into their world and they said now don't think of yourself as a copy writer you need to understand that this is a start-up so you can have any job that you want in the company you just have to become the right person for the job and I was the first time I really started to think about skill acquisition and the notion of do you need to be born with a certain set of skills or are skills something that you can acquire and that question has come to really dominate my life because so much of my journey has really been predicated on my ability to actually acquire skills and so I believe as a very foundational belief that the reason that any of us are here is for one simple reason to find out how many skills you can acquire that have utility and then put that utility to the test now if you're getting good at something building something that exists in service of other people you're going to have the energy and the passion and the conviction that you're going to need to actually see it through but it all comes down to whether or not you actually get really good at that thing and if you guys take nothing else away from what I say today that is the core thesis that sits at the absolute center of my universe I believe humans can get good at whatever they set their mind to and if you're willing to break yourself in half you can become extraordinary so my thing is if you really want to be an entrepreneur you need to be prepared to become capable of the extraordinary so quest nutrition was a reaction so I knew that I was going to have six-pack abs and that I was going to get rich I got into the technology company as a copywriter and I worked my way up very rapidly I began to believe and see the truth of the fact that a human can learn anything that they set their mind to as long as you're willing to completely pour yourself into that and that's something I cannot stress enough so many people fact somebody just today in this room came up to me and said I feel like I'm doing too much Tom I want to enjoy my 20s what's your advice to me my advice is sell your 20s I literally lost my twenties they were completely gone I didn't do anything with them other than work all I did because understand growing up I did not view myself as very smart and in fact from a pure IQ standpoint I'm not that smart and I'll say that IQ is really the ability to process data rapidly and I know that we all want to push it off and say well EQ is equally important and all that and it is it's great but having the raw horsepower if you have it leverage it and if you don't address it and so I had to accept that I wasn't one of those people that learn things really fast so I had to go head down and do a lot of work and that was how I moved through the company so very rapidly I took myself from being hired as a copywriter to becoming an owner in the company through pure sweat equity I never put a dime into the company but my performance was so dominant and my desire to succeed so freakish that the level of value that I was delivering to the company was extreme enough that they were willing to give me a piece of the company so that they wouldn't lose me okay we'll call that being a linchpin employee I don't think everybody needs to want to run their own company running your own company takes a certain thing inside Derrick talked about it in his talk I think you've got to be driven by something it's got to be something that's propelling you forward some sickness and if you know Batman and if you know me you know my obsession with Batman Batman is driven by a sickness there's this dark thing inside him that propels him forward if you have that if there's something that you need to build and bring to the world that you just can't shake you can't get rid of whether you're a born entrepreneur or not just to me they are very separate whether you're born entrepreneur not is irrelevant and I put that to the test and I worked my way up to the company I got ownership in the company I became the chief marketing officer I was making more money than I'd ever made in my life and I had six-pack abs and it was horrific and I've hated my life and I thought there's no way it's not possible that I'm living the cliche of money can't buy happiness like this is a joke it's something that you see coming 10,000 miles off so how is it humanly possible when I understand the power of money you guys know people are going to chase money forever right you get that so when people tell you stuff about money not mattering let me tell you right now it matters and it matters a lot money is I promise more powerful than you think not less but it isn't at all what you've been told and once you understand the difference between what you're expecting it to be and what it actually is then it can become a useful driver in your life but when you're just chasing money unaware of the fact that money is inert it does nothing money is a facilitator money allows you to make your dream into a reality but that's it if you don't know what you're trying to build if you don't know what you're willing to die for money has nothing to offer you so it really became figuring out why I felt the way that I did and the reason was I did not know what my why was so yes we end up building quest 57,000 percent growth in the first three years but to understand that you need to understand why we did it so I was miserable making the money that I was making I saw this there's just got to be a better way I actually went to my partners and I quit I gave them their equity back I said thank you very much but I'm not willing to live this life I'm not willing to feel miserable inside that holds absolutely no interest for me so I was going to go do what made me feel most alive and as I was driving home I called my wife I did it I quit that's it we're never going to be in that situation again I'm never going to be depressed because we're going to do something beautiful I'm literally pulling into the driveway at my house and my phone rings and it's my two business partners and they say the now-famous words we could do this without you but we don't want to that allowed me to reconnect to something other than the money and for the first time I felt so at rock-bottom that I wasn't afraid to tell them the truth I said here's the truth money isn't my highest value camaraderie is my highest value in business what I actually care about is that feeling of brotherhood what I actually care about is feeling connected to the customer what I actually care about is tapping into my passion and building something that makes me feel alive that's a real reflection of my actual personality those things I care about I don't actually care about money that much and that was sacrilege at that point in our relationship because we had all taken a pact that we would always do whatever was most profitable so if that meant giving up a family vacation if that meant going out to meet as a business trio at 2:00 a.m. on a Saturday these are all real things that we did then we did it because we had taken that pact so saying that was such a shift and in that moment they said we actually feel exactly the same way and we felt that way for a while and in that moment we all realized that you can get so myopically focused on the money that you lose sight of what you're actually trying to do so you have to answer that question who knows simon Sinek all right incredible human being he has this whole concept to start with why absolutely critical understanding why you're doing what you're doing and I'm going to tell you in the rest of this talk you're going to see it throughout everything that I talk about the world is changing and I cannot say that emphatically enough I'm sure there are goggles of Millennials here Millennials are just the first wave of a shift that is coming the world is moving to a commerce style that is driven entirely by impact what are you trying to do where the consumer is going to make a demand that you tell them what you stand for that you tell them how you're spending your profits they want to know and they're not going to support your brand unless you do that and we're going to get into that more and how it should affect your business and how for those of you that are in this for the right reasons that really want to build something that matters and you're willing to break yourself the half to pull it off this is the best news ever but make sure you know your why what's driving you now we live in a highly social technological age but one thing I want you guys to get very very comfortable with is the idea from Elon Musk that once you break a problem down to its physics you will actually know what is and isn't possible and I'm here to tell you as a marketer your physics is the human mind and if you don't take the time to study neuro Anatomy to learn the brain to understand emotion to read about how people make just crazy weird decisions that are totally irrational you'll never be able to speak the language of your customer so figuring out social media which I'm sure is way overplayed in terms of how we talk about it but way underutilized in terms of its potential effect if you can find the humanity in it the idea behind technology isn't to form fake relationships it's to communicate and add value it's to show people who you really are it's to get to a world where you're able to build authentic connection with your consumer really think about those words for a second because neither of them are an accident authentic connection so you as somebody building a brand you don't get to hide anymore in your lonely office with the whatever 8x8 inch window that we saw earlier you've now got to step forward and as somebody who I literally lied about my birthday on my Facebook page because I was so convinced someone was going to use it to steal my identity okay I had no desire to step out front I had no desire to be the face of the company or anything like that they hounded me literally my chief marketing officer a wonderful millennial hounded me to finally go out front because what he made clear was that there are two new kingmakers which are authenticity and transparency now why does that matter because Millennials and Gen Z want to have impact and they want to know how by engaging with your company they can have that impact and so that's one of the things you're going to need to make clear in your marketing you'll notice I'm not yet even talking about your product I'm talking about the relationship that you need to build with your community so how did we get to fifty seven thousand percent I got so angry at myself for chasing money and pretending like I didn't just I connect with people that I didn't want to add value that I didn't want somebody to write in and say your product has changed my life I was so furious that I'd wasted so many years of my life doing that was eight and a half years by the time we finally sold that company that's almost a decade of my life chasing money and at the end of that decade I said never again and so when we went into quest we said this is going to be predicated around delivering value and that's what we're going to focus on so showing people how not only your product is going to deliver value but how your marketing efforts are going to deliver value now here's the thing if you're going to build a business at the end of the day there is one thing for all the like Airy wonderful beautiful stuff I'm talking about building relationships really connecting putting yourself out there being authentic you have to know how to build a business the rubber has to meet the road at some point understanding this pyramid of influence in today's social world is exactly what you guys need to understand and this pyramid is exactly how we build quests into a billion dollar brand from nothing by the way we bootstrapped it we started with like ten thousand dollars we were making the bars by hand in a kitchen that we rented by the hour it took like eight or nine people seven or eight hours to make 1200 protein bars we now make 1.5 million a day okay scale but how did we get there and how do we get there so fast the pyramid of influence at the top or the thought leaders it's the people most people don't understand okay they're very bright and they literally they're the ones winning the Nobel prizes but they're not easy to understand for the average person influencers are the band of people that pay attention to the thought leaders but make it accessible to the masses now the influencers in a highly social age is the boon to your business and if you can find them it's how becoming an entrepreneur has been so radically democratized your job is to find you one thousand screaming fans find the most influential thousand screaming fans that you can people that really resonate with your product they love it they use it so for us at Quest we literally gave the product away and we would write you want to talk unscalable we would want right well-researched letters to each of these people showing them that we knew who they were that we knew what they were trying to bring to the world and we thought that our product would give them the unique ability to offer something wonderful to their community and that we didn't want to control their message if you hate it tell people you hate it if you love it tell them you love it all we ask is that you talk and because we didn't try to control the message people felt way better about it now when people think about getting influential people they normally think of these guys but in the way that things have changed you should be thinking of people like this now I'm guessing most of you don't know any of the faces there but I'll give you an example of a social influencer anybody know jenna Marbles all right crazy that will say that was about 10% of you she reaches over 20 million people a day 20 million people a day how did we get her to post with our product a huge stack of product by the way so somebody with a reach of 20 million that's like primetime TV how did we get her to post a photo for free with all of our products we knitted sweaters for her dogs because she's huge into her dogs okay so you want to identify your influencers you want to add value to them in their community engage with their content figure out what it is it's meaningful to them and make sure that you do it go above and beyond sending huge stacks of products for her along with the sweaters for her dogs for her which is over above and beyond nobody had done it and then your goal is to build those relationships into real partnerships where it starts with getting to know each other having something in common and it becomes building a business all right don't mark it build a community there are a lot of ways that you can engage with your fans but the goal for you guys is to really get in there give content that delivers value to them engage with them reply to them look at their page give contextual responses it is a lot of work but when you do that people feel really known and understood and you can get them talking to each other which is incredible I could do a whole hour-long talk just about how to do that and then make amazing impactful content that is really I think the thing that's most overlooked your content has to crush and there's just no shortcuts to that when people ask me what the shortcut is to making amazing content I know they're going to fail let that sink in if what you're looking for is the shortcut I know you're going to fail stop asking yourself how little you can get away with and start asking yourself how much you can bear at the end of every talk that I give I will stand out in the lobby today included and I will answer your questions for as long as there are questions to answer I've done it for eight hours in the past until the last question is answered I will stand there that's how you add value to your community all right what if I told you guys your customers hate your content don't sell you need to find a way in today's world the marketing in and of itself needs to be awesome it needs to be something that I want to watch I want to consume to add value to my life so if you look at the show that we do it's called impact Theory impact theory we don't charge for it's not a revenue generator but the number of people every day that write me and say you've changed my life with the people that you've interviewed on that show you've changed my life I'm going to start a business that I wouldn't have started without that I'm getting out of a depression that I was worried was going to consume me now imagine I can build a hundred thousand people that believe I've changed their life a million people that believe I've changed their lives ten million people that believe I've changed their life what can I do with that when you switch your mind from I want to sell something to they're going to want to buy something just to be deeper in this community that's when it gets interesting and when your product is real when your product delivers real value whether it's a suitcase whether it's a protein bar whether it's a t-shirt it doesn't matter if you're delivering real value and they feel like you have materially improve their lives they're going to be with you and then I'll leave you with this do cool there's literally no substitute for it and I hope that you will leave today understanding that you're not yet the person you need to be to succeed and once you can embrace the beauty of the journey of becoming that person the person that is capable of executing at the highest level the person who is no longer worried about getting a championship ring and instead they are focused solely on becoming capable of the championship performance then you'll win and that brings us back the reason you are here is to find out how many skills you can acquire and put them to service for something greater than yourself you do that you'll build a big business thank you [Applause] [Music]

please give it up for Shane Lynn MA the CEO of zola well you know you made me wanna [Music] [Applause] CEO and co-founder of zola so I think I can consume most of you here raise your hand if you have gotten married and used over for your wet wedding registry yeah raise your hand if you've been to a wedding where Zola was the wedding registry more hands and raise your hand if you've just heard of Zola in general oh cool well if you are not yet acquainted with Zola I hope that you very soon will be and for those of you who don't know what we do we are the fastest growing wedding registry and wedding startup in the country and we are also one of the fastest growing e-commerce startups in the country we started four years ago and we've set out with a mission to use design and technology to reimagine the wedding registry experience for couples getting married today those couples just happen to be the Millennial Generation with different to any other registry you might know of in that we work directly with 500 brands brands that you might be familiar with classic registry brands like KitchenAid or Cuisinart or Vitamix that you see in every kitchen we also partner with brands that you might be less familiar with that a more up-and-coming like Lisa mattress parish's home so knows as well as experiences like blue apron SoulCycle wine tasting and in the last four years since we started it's been a four-year hustle so far we've raised over forty million in BC funding last year we did our Series C of twenty five million and I was one of the depressingly tiny 4% of female founder CEOs who raised the Serie C in 2016 thank you thank you well I hope that many of you here will help us drive up that number over the coming years so I want to tell you how we've seen explosive growth in the business and to do that I wanted to start at the beginning so this is a picture of me and my mother and my brother isn't my brother cute he looks a bit different now and and when I was growing up I was not like other little girls I think many of my friends wanted to be pilots or astronauts or firefighters or teachers and I wanted to be this guy who knows who this guy is Jerry Yang he is the founder of Yahoo and Yahoo you know well today I know most of us here are probably Google users Yahoo started as really the company that helped us access the internet for the first time Jerry Yang started the company Yahoo with the idea that you wanted to make the internet a friendly accessible fun place and if it wasn't for Jerry Yang starring Yahoo there wouldn't have been many of the great companies that exist today like Google Facebook he really set the stage for all of us here growing up I lived and wanted to be like Jerry and when I looked at him I saw another immigrant who started with very little but worked really hard and has now had a lasting impact on the world and when I looked at how do I get to Silicon Valley and start a company like Jerry I didn't know anyone who had ever even heard of Silicon Valley so was reading a lot of articles and read that Jerry and other great Silicon Valley started found of winter Stanford so I thought I guess you have to go to Stanford at work so was lucky enough to throw my application in get accepted and got to go there for two years to do my MBA after my MBA I of course went to work at Yahoo and the best day of my two years ago who was when I passed Jerry Yang in the corridor and he didn't see me but I definitely saw him and I silently freaked out I to this day still have never actually met him or spoken to him so if anyone here knows him please come and see me after but most importantly I learned at Yahoo from the best product people who now run product some of the best companies in this country I then took that those skills and moved to the East Coast to join Gilt Groupe as the first product person there I learnt a great deal and most importantly I got to meet great people like Kevin Ryan the founder of gilt who also founded Business Insider in and Nobu Noguchi who was the head of the user experience design team and with Kevin and Nobu and now my co-founders at zola a gilt I learned a lot about how to build a great ecommerce engine and what the requirements are for any explosives ecommerce company really it came down to a simple but the hard equation and that equation is you need to build in demand intent and virality into your product to see product markets is but that's not enough you also need to build an emotional connection to your users so I'll share a bit about how we saw this work both at guilt and then how we iterated and improved upon that during our time at solar so far so this is Nobu and I so Nobu guilt I mentioned was the head of the user experience design team and you can see some of his design genius in action here in this middle photo and this is Australia Day the best day of the year as Ola and Nobu somehow created a hat which is the Opera House out of a few random paper plates in the office but really what he and I learned together at gilt was so crucial to the formation of zola we learnt about first foremost how to create demand intent how do you define an e-commerce product that customers then led very clearly and quickly down that ecommerce conversion funnel to one to check out the way that we saw this work at gilt was that Kevin had created a company that offered great beautiful design brands at 80 percent of retail price for a limited time only in limited quantities it was the first time anyone had seen this before and it draws a great number of people to check out really quickly when we were thinking about a new idea to start and the year was 2013 and that was the year that all my friends were getting married at the same time I'm sure many of you have had that same year if not you will and that was the year that I had to buy a lot of wedding presents from a lot of registries that at that time with a traditional department store wedding registries we saw there was a clear opportunity here and we saw that there was a ready demand built into the wedding registry market two million people get married every year that means two million people have to create a wedding registry for the most part if you don't want gifts that people just randomly buy for you we realize it's a huge market who knew there was 19 billion dollars of wedding registry gifts per chillingly purchased in the US alone every year and for the entire the global industry it was a 300 billion dollar market I think that surprised all of us and and still continues to surprise many investors so when we were thinking about the market is big enough but how do we really differentiate and build something that we know our friends and couples today deserve we started by thinking about what our users using today and we did a lot of research we spoke to hundreds of couples and we heard that what couples were doing was they were going into department stores they were faced with a sea of products they had no idea what they were doing or what they should be doing and it was it was painful to be led through things that all look the same where there was the same kind of coffeemaker same kind of plate pots and pans that was the physical experience and it led to a lot of fighting on the right you can see these were the DePalma store registries as they looked in 2013 and some of them still look like this today from an e-commerce perspective it looks cold it's impersonal it looks like a checkout card we know couples today deserve better we've started to talk to couples about what would they do if they could do anything with their wedding registry and the same themes kept coming up again and again couple said we want to register for products and experiences and cash and we don't want to set up three different registries to do that which is what they were doing before Zola so we built a registry that you let you register for anything you wanted or in the one place a common complaint we heard was that when you register with department stores they were as people bought from your registry there and things would just start turning up at your house and you had no idea what was coming who sent it what's in the box you weren't even ready to receive it yet often you might have been off on your honeymoon or getting married and yet things just kept coming this was a very easily solved using technology all we did was we said we will not send any to the couple until they're ready to actually receive it which is a huge innovation in the e-commerce space and still something that only we do today third we heard couples want to make their registry as beautiful as the rest of their wedding day so in this country on average couples spend $35,000 on one day they want it to be beautiful they spend a lot to make it reflect who they really are and that extends to wedding registries we let couples personalize what it means to have a registry we made it mobile because that's where couples live today we let them designate anything as a group gift because it turns out people with kind of hacking this by registering for a lot of things they didn't want then taking it all back to the store after they received it to return it for the thing they really wanted you should just be able to register for the thing you actually want in the first place and let people contribute to that and then lastly customer service every single customer we interviewed said to us I have no what I no idea what I'm doing because I'm getting married for the first time please help me understand what to do and that's where our customer service really lends a hand and does what we say in our tagline which is we do anything for love so number two virality the way we saw this at gilt and we learn a great deal with we saw and gilt we were one of the first to really privatize the idea of refer a friend or invite a friend we were one of the very first to launch the invite a friend get $25 that was at a time when gilt with a members-only site people wanted a lot of credit to spend on gilt and there weren't that many referral programs out there so it was unique and a lot of people did share gilt we also were the first to come up with what is something I'm really proud of gilt the personal invitation link where we gave every member their own clink that they could share with friends anywhere and we could track back to to that person how many people they refer and give them credits accordingly and that drove huge growth of guilt in the early days it was virality that we had built into the product that really drove the growth and we knew we had to figure out a way to do it at zola we also as all I have the benefit of having natural virality because when someone gets married on average you invite 150 guests to your wedding so the way we think about building virality into zola's product is that if we can build a registry that is beautiful that is easier to buy from than any other registry then every gas coming to that registry will want to tell their friends who are married getting married or will want to use it themselves when they get married and we just have to remind them that we exist number three last but not least most important part of this ecommerce equation is how do you build an emotional connection so when I joined gilt the first thing I did was interview all the users in multiple focus groups surveys one-on-one interviews about gilt and I kept hearing the same things again and again the same words where I am love gilt I'm obsessed I'm addicted I cannot stop shopping and those words really became the benchmark of what it meant to have a real emotional connection with users the way that we thought about how to bring this to life within the gilt product was in the mobile app I don't know if any of you remember or still have it but there's a notification that goes off when the sales start and that was something that we would hear users say oh the sales start at 9:00 a.m. on the west coast and I'm driving to work but when I hear that notification I pull over to the side of the road and because I have to start shopping right there and then otherwise I might miss out on something and that kind of emotional connection and commitment with something that we thought about bringing to zola in some way the way that we have done that is we have looked at how can we bring this out through what we're hearing from couples they love and they want from Zola and that is really the next phase of our business it's going beyond just the wedding registry to help couples plan more of their wedding we for the first four years of our business have been these are focused on solving the painful parts about wedding registry but we've been hearing users ask from us or pull from us things they also want us to help where things like could you help me with my baby registry could you help me furnish more of my home or could you help me plan more of my wedding and with only in the last few months decided we would expand beyond registry to attack a bigger market and between those three options we landed with weddings we wanted to help people really plan the wedding from the day they get engaged through their first year of newlywed life we launched solar wedding is two months ago with the idea being we could help couples plan through a checklist a guest list and a free wedding website and we could do all of this for free because our business is registry during the two years sorry the two months since we launched solar weddings we've had overwhelming reception from couples who are using the tools to make their wedding planning easier and as we look forward to our next step we're looking at how can we build more to help couples with more of their wedding to make it from them currently the most stressful time of your life into how could it be an easier simple fun time of your life and really the reason we're doing it is because we know it's not just about building product markets here we have that we've shown that in the numbers it's about how can we continue to build an emotional connection and if we can do that then like Jerry Yang at Yahoo like we did it guilt like we're starting to see at zola we can have a real impact on people's lives thank you [Applause]

let's give it up for pay all pay all cut Kanaka and how so tell us how to make everybody get up it's time to slam now we got a real Jam going down welcome to the Space Jam a pseudo chance through your dance at the Space Jam [Applause] [Music] hello everyone hi everyone I'm Kyle Kodaka the founder and executive chairman of classpath I hear we have some fans in the audience whoo love Sam's story as well and so for those of you not familiar with lap pads it's a monthly Fitness membership program that lets you take classes at different studios and gyms you can go to a Sam's flat spin class yoga class whenever you want to and the journey of class laughs which I'm very excited to share with you guys today have been long and winding like most artists are and instead of just telling you guys all about the successes and failures I'm going to focus on one important thing that really led to the success of our company and that was making hard decisions we all faced them in our lives and in our companies and they're challenging but I will tell you and I hope from the stories I tell you today that you can make through them make it through them and get to the other side so let's start my parents came here in the 70s from India and the most important things for them was making sure my sister and I got a good education and had a good career so I went to MIT and I worked at Bain but my true passion alight as you can see here with Indian dance so I started dancing when I was 3 years old and it became the place where I belonged it was my heart my passion and it always made me feel centered so three years into consulting at Bain most of my friends were going off to business school it just didn't feel like the right decision for me at the time I wanted to pursue dance and so that was the first hard decision I had to make in my life I didn't follow the path of many others and I took a job in the music industry and while that was challenging at the time it actually opened up an amazing opportunity for me I built my first startup and it was a dance company I got together the best dancers I knew in New York City and we started practicing and performing every weekend and every night we performed all around the nation amazing venues like Alvin Ailey and Lincoln Center we even ended up on the cover of the art section of the New York Times I was having the time of my life I was in my 20s I spent all my time either at work or dancing but three years in I was at another crossroads this wasn't going to be sustainable and I also didn't know what I was going to do with my career luckily enough at that time I went to go visit one of my friends in San Francisco and I met all these entrepreneurs and in New York City about six years ago there weren't many and so I saw all these people building these amazing apps and products and it was amazing that they were doing it on their own terms I knew how driven I was I also knew how creative I was and I thought I should give that a chance but I needed to think of an idea so I actually gave myself two weeks to think of something 36 hours later I was sitting at my desk and I was looking for a ballet class online after being on Yelp for hours google searching and having multiple tabs open I was really frustrated and I didn't even go to class I kept thinking to myself what if there was an open table for classes it seemed to make sense and I knew I had to build it not just because I wanted to be a tech entrepreneur but I wanted to connect people back to their passions I had fought to keep dancing my life my entire being through college through my career and I wanted to help bring that back to other people there was one big thing in my way though my job I don't know how many of you guys have quit your job before or thought about it it's not an easy decision my favorite quote is on the other side of your greatest lines or greatest fears lives your greatest life and that's how this day went down I got to work that day I told my boss hey I think I'm going to go pursue some entrepreneurial endeavor I wrote an email it's my executive team and one of them who I've spoken with maybe a few times in my three years there decided to call me to his office he wanted to hear about what I was building so I went up there and I was a little nervous I hadn't really gone up there before and he spent two hours with me I told him about what I was building and I walked out of that office that day with a $10,000 check and my first advisor this was the day I quit my job and so we were off to the races we started building class tivity which was the first incarnation of class path it was an open table for classes and we were aggregating all this data and all the schedules from around New York City we even got into tech stars in York we were one of 13 companies out of 1,500 to get in and finally at demo day we launched our product and this was a year and a half after we started building it and that's a really important point which I'll get to in a second we had a lot of press we ended up on the cover of ink magazine and a ton of buzz but I felt like a fraud inside and here's why we had no one booking classes so I built a beautiful website aggregated all this information but no one was going to class it was terrible obviously for the business model but even more so for the mission I started out the company for I knew we had to start another product and try something new so this was our first pivot instead of sitting behind our desk this time we started going to the studios and talking to them about what they needed we noticed a lot of them were offering a first class for free and we decided to package these together and offer our first product called a passport what's called the collectivities passport at the time it was a $49 offering that let you try ten classes in your local area one of my favorite things about this time is after building a product for a year and a half and not having it work we were so scrappy we made our first 20,000 reservations manually for every reservation that came in we would go and book it our selves and then send an email to the customer we weren't going to build things that people didn't want class last Passport did well and in three to four days we had more reservations in the search engine but there was a problem no one was going back to the studios and we got these classes for free from our studio owners so we needed to find a way to fix the business the one thing we learn at this time was how much people loved the variety so much so that they were actually frauding us and signing up for a product over and over again when they couldn't we even did a survey and 95 percent of our members said they would do this product again if they could do it and go back to their favorite studios so all of this was weaning to a subscription model we finally launched the subscription model but to get my team there was not as easy as and one would think so at this point I had to before people and in the past three years I had now asked them to build two products and we were making progress with the passport but it wasn't enough see we had about a metric of 75% of our customers needing to go back to our studios to make that relationship work and only 15% were it was too wide of a gap and luckily enough my team believed me and we decided to iterate one more time so we built class pass class laughs is a subscription where you could go back to these classes up to two times a month when we first started and it was one of those products that was immediately viral people just loved it and they wanted to tell their friends about it and more than just the purchases I think what I really felt was letters from our customers telling me that they had never looked so forward to working out and they felt like this product changed their life I kind of knew we had hit lightning and that doesn't happen very often in a company's history so at that time we had three products in the market we still had the search engine we had the passport and we had slot test for any entrepreneur you know focus is a really important thing we weren't focused one of my entrepreneurs would call me all the time as they you know pile you need to get rid of the passport it's like crack to you guys it will be a chapter in your one day and at that time I was like no way such a good product and in hindsight no one at conferences today knows what the passport is and so he was right so we rebranded and became mad fast calm at that time we actually threw a party and invited all of our members to it it was a really fun time in the history of our company and we knew we had magic but our investors weren't convinced yet they didn't know if this was just a New York City phenomenon so we decided that we would launch in multiple markets so we brought classpass to Boston San Francisco Chicago and we saw the same adoption in our product I found myself back on Sand Hill Road to raise more capital for those of you familiar with Sand Hill Road is where all of our favorite VCS are I had been there three times before many times I came back empty-handed but this time it was very different I had a product that work and people gave me term sheets I had more money than I needed and as exciting as it sounds and someone you know who'd been building this for three years I was actually really overwhelmed I didn't know how to make a decision on who I was going to build a future of class path with in three days so I decided I would make the decision and go with one of my trusted advisors for slamet Fritz and I had met earlier that year via David Tish and when Fritz and I met he was one of those angel investors who told me to put away my slides and just tell me tell him what I wanted to build it's actually a very different type of investor most investors want to doubt you and he actually told me from my hustle and from the charts I was showing him on our growth and he thought I had built the next generational defining company it was a conversation I had never had with an investor and because of that he became one of my trusted partners and when he told me he could give me my twelve million dollars I said let's do it so it's 12 million dollars of fresh half roll in the bank and a product our customers loved and our partners loved we had to protect it we started seeing copycats in every city and it was ours to lose so we had to move fast we weren't about launching about eight markets by the end of that year and instead of launching eight we wanted to launch 20 and we then launched ten right after that my team doubled in size in a matter of 10 days it was a pretty hard decision to make but we knew this was art so we started moving forward we became national and we also hit our one millionth reservation yes we were now at 35 million but this is crazy so we hit our one millionth reservation we knew that a lot of this growth was coming from our limited product it was our product on let people work out as much as they wanted to as a founder you put things out there if you never know how things will end up playing out in the market and one of the hardest things for us to ever predict with usage one of the great things about our unlimited plan was people started working out double the amount they used to but we were paying our studio owners for every class how is attended so the business was suffering and we had to do something about it so this is when we decided to make our first change to improve our business and I never wish this upon any founder is a hard thing to do but we raise prices by 25 dollars the hardest thing about that was it didn't work so we have to go back to the drawing board and figure out what to do I knew we have to increase the price of the plan even more but I still wanted to make sure we were accessible and affordable because that is a promise we made to our members into the world so we launched a 5 plan in a 10 pack we didn't know how the market would take them but luckily enough people love them we actually in tracked an entire new user base but we were still having trouble with our unlimited plan I knew we had to make a change when I would walk into the office every day and my employees would come up to me with new ideas on how we could restrict usage that's exactly the opposite of why we started this company so we finally made the decision to eliminate our limited product at the end of last year this is one of the hardest decisions I've had to make as a founder I wrote a letter to all of our members number one thing I wanted them to know is how hard we tried and the second thing I wanted them to know was how much better we were going to make this experience and luckily enough they listened and they heard and they felt it and many of them stayed with us we actually have a ton of new plans now that are actually growing even faster than we were before so it was great to know that even after all these nine hard decisions we ended up having a great business happy customers and happy studios but there was one last decision that I had to make and it was for me personally I started this company because I'm an artist and I love creating and building the role of a founding CEO changes as your company grows and I wanted to get back to building so I recently decided to switch roles with Fritz Fritz is now the CEO of LastPass and I am the executive chairman and I am working every day on our new product brainstorming wireframing back to the beginning of building the future of classpath and I couldn't be more excited we just closed 70 million dollars of funding which is crazy thank you we're in 39 cities globally and expanding 35 million reservations and we have a team of over 200 people and my favorite thing about them is they're ready for anything we throw at them and they're ready for the next decision that we're going to make and so before I close I leave you all with one question what's the next hard decision you're going to make because the best companies and best people who've made an impact in the world have all had to make them so I hope the next time you're faced with one you decide to say yes thank you [Applause] you [Applause]

love operates as a core tenet of communicating and tying a lot of emotions and one of the central founding principles of the company and the platform is that when you focus on love money comes and when you focus on money nothing comes and that sort of how we've grown this thing how do I is it a clicker here there is okay so the the key thing that really what the opportunity we saw was that there were a lot of marketplaces that were geared towards selling products but there was nothing that enabled any individual to really participate in the world of fashion and style and my incise from creating caboodle was that a lot of fashion discovery had to be done through people and if you look at sort of the last five years and see the migration of how fashion has moved more and more online a lot of it is driven by individuals and people influencing how fashion is consumed and discovered online and by fashion I we really take it in a broad way we certainly talk about the clothes and items we wear but then we also talked a lot about anything that is style and discovery based products and that is sort of some of the future of there we can really expand the platform and bring a whole bunch of products that people can buy and sell in Poshmark the the key thing we wanted to do from day one was to build a community and to do that we really started with literally one person at a time so for the first year of existence of the company at the end of that year we had 800 total users and those 800 users were recruited literally one person at a time a lot of them actually not far from here in in in a bar in so mine in city called district where we would really bring the community into the in into that where my team would go out and recruit and we teach them how to take pictures how to sort of photograph and how to sell items and in fact in the early days we didn't have any payment or shipping system so we really focused on using that place as also as a venue for transacting so people would bring little packages of clothing and transcend them like little secret drug deals that were going on in the bar and that's how sort of we started the the platform and one of the the big realization that we had was that people were craving to be connected in real time and people were craving to be connected with each other in sort of this virtual world that was emerging around mobile computing in 2010 2011 timeframe so what we created and have sort of started to enable is what we call the next generation of retailers so these are people who are starting fashion businesses and and scaling fashion businesses where they may start with just stuff in their closet but then slowly build out a fashion boutique which has may be generating hundreds of thousands of dollars a year and in the last year we've also enabled them to turn them into fashion brands that they're creating hundreds of boutiques that are selling on their behalf so what you see is a person like suzanne cannon who's a mother who has two kids who lives in texas who started out by selling from her closet built out a business over the last two or three years that is a boutique launched her own fashion brand called infinity rain on Poshmark and now has over 250 other women on the platform selling on behalf of suzanne cannon and building out a boutique network for infinity rain so it's really changing that sort of whole process we've raised little over seven million dollars we have close to a little over two and a half million seller stylists and what's remarkable today is that in Poshmark pricing which is actually many times discounted from retail pricing these women are uploading and now men are uploading little over 4 million dollars of inventory a day which is roughly a way to think about it is that every 3 or 4 days people are opening up what is the equivalent of a Nordstrom store and Poshmark the the cool market opportunity is massive we are talking about 30 trillion that may be a little overstated but but they are really spending a massive amount of money I think the the stat is a little about a trillion dollars worth of our fashion is consumed every day every year and so every three years it's like close to three trillion dollars I think that may be the number that they've wanted to put here and a lot of it just sits in the closet and goes to waste so we've really found a place and a way for that to sort of get consumed but more importantly by connecting people to people what we are doing is bringing back small retail in an online setting so if you go back 30 to 40 years in America the way V bought products was we would walk into a neighborhood store whether it was for fashion or Hardware and was Tom or Jenny they would know you by name they would in fact merchandise to that store cater to his towards specific customers and they would when you walk in and they say hey this is not just the screw that you want today but the here's a hammer there's not just a dress you want but there's a piece of necklace to go with it well over time as we move towards big-box retail that personal touch disappeared and everything became sort of SKUs and items and products when we moved to ecommerce we sort of just took that same model and fly to e-commerce and things became even bigger and more massive and then we tried to bring personalization as a substitute for personal well personalization could be Minority Report but it isn't personal what we are really doing is enabling Jenni to know you by name and that's exactly what happens that's why our seller stylists have a 75 to 80 percent repeat selling process and we did that by really creating a social framework when you build your follower network you start to get that repeat selling paradigm happening but the second thing that happens is what used to happen again in the olden days where it wasn't just the brand it was also the communication that you were putting around the brand that led to the consumption by the person by building that affinity with the seller stylist it allows many different independent and smaller brands to actually thrive on the platform in fact when you look at our wholesale engine the top five brands advance you've never heard of and these guys have scaled from zero to millions of dollars of revenue in just less than a year on Bosch mark as a platform this is our first first team and one of the key to creating a great company from day one is to really recruit the right team and I've been privileged to not only be surrounded by an amazing team but the fact is that almost all of these people are still here today six years later and through a lot of ups and downs we are a company that really prides on really bringing people together and then keeping them whether it is our team or it's our community if you look at cohorts which is a group of people who join at a certain point in time and scale up our cohorts deliver revenues as if it is sort of you know if they generate a million dollars in the first year they keep generating a million dollars forever and in fact grow on top of that and that is something you don't see that kind of loyalty across the whole whole platform so when we sort of really started one of the key things we wanted to do was to keep not just shopping which is you know has to be simple and fun but also selling simple and fun and to do that we had to fight many different battles so one of the things sort of vision I had was if you're an eighteen year old girl and you're sitting in a college dorm and you want to sell or shop on Poshmark it shouldn't be a chore it shouldn't require you to sort of or on ramp as a merchant figure out how much things weigh figure it out you know to build a reputation online etc etc it should feel like fun selling and buying should feel like taking Instagram photos or taking a selfie on a snapchat and being able to participate in it to do that we had to fight a lot of sort of built in logistics payment systems that existed out there we challenged the norm of how payments and distribution of payment should work and that led to in 2013 two years after we started the company and things were scaling well every single payment processor in the country had rejected us and we were almost two months from shutting down because of the mindset we took to the problem saying that we will only want to support a payment processing system that eliminates the need for every one of our seller stylists to onboard as a merchant and it took many more months to fight many different battles before we won that thing so today when you come in you can literally take a few pictures and go out and start to sell and you don't have to on board as a merchant no matter what your scale is you could be still doing millions of dollars of business or selling one item and that allows a very seamless experience to happen where today in just the hour that you'll be sitting here over three to four hundred people would have opened up and signed on as new seller stylist on the platform second thing we had to do was to make shipping simple fashion as this unique characteristic where most items are very very light however items can have very random shapes and sizes and at the same time some things can be arbitrarily heavy what that leads to is is that you really don't know how much it's gonna cost to ship something you don't know what it'll take to do that the second characteristic is particularly for women's fashion that exists is even though it can take weeks to make a decision once a person makes the decision they want it tomorrow so it is quite possible that I now need that dress to wear on a date tomorrow or for a wedding this weekend how do you make that happen so you need speed efficiency flexibility and all of that on a highly distributed logistics network so we created the single box which is now called Bosh post that took almost two and a half years to correct and in the process USPS almost wanted to put me in jail because we had hacked their entire shipping system not hacked it in a way in a bad way but really created a service that they didn't support and it took a lot of negotiation meetings all the way to the top to really create in 2014 what is now called Bosh post which is a unique shipping system that allows you to drop any number of fashion items in a box put our label ship everything one two today priority and as a seller stylist you never have to pay a penny everything is priced in and in fact the pricing of that box which we launched in June of 2012 and at that time he launched the box for seven bucks is today 649 and in between the pricing of Priority Mail and other systems has gone up by between forty to sixty percent so it was a belief he took to the market in 2012 where we were losing a lot of money and today that's actually a profitable box that we can scale and really deliver to millions of our sell is stylish shipping millions of packages out there so you have to take a core belief and really not give up if you want to keep things simple keeping things simple is as we know super hard we are really bringing social and commerce together and this is really the power so for example one of the norms we challenged is every marketplace is built on ratings Poshmark for the first three years actually had no ratings even even today the ratings we have are actually kept private to a seller stylist the only thing that is published is a five-star note that is left that we call a love note and that's built on the fact that at the point a woman is actually putting her closet online not only is she wall durable because every feedback hits her personally she is also not confident that what she's putting in makes any sense to put in and then slowly she starts to actually sell stuff and that is amazing but then you get one bad comment and you sort of feel like oh my god you know is it something wrong with me or my style or my products and so that's why we really focused it from day one on a very deep emotion that everyone wants to feel which is to be feeling this feeling of love and if you can do that then there's a lot of longevity you create in the system and that's the social part of the platform the second thing is in order to drive the platform you have to constantly curate massive amounts of inventory to create freshness so a seller stylists are empowered to not just curate their inventory but other people's inventory we're the only marketplace we're really to succeed you have to actually pay forward you have to give love to other people in order to build your own brand in that least to almost today 7 million items being curated by our sellers tie lives on our day by daily basis six months back was three and a half million back items being shared on a daily basis six months back it was just a million items being shared on our daily basis so that's a metric we scale and that ultimately drives the entire nything platform and ultimately drives liquidity as well as sales for every seller stylist on the platform so the key in all of this is to really always think about who you are building this product for at a very deep empathy level and and ultimately fight for that person and how do you do that you have to do that by being in touch well I'm not a woman so I can't really look at myself and in fact there could be a flaw if I just look at myself as a customer of one so on a daily basis in fact for the first six months I personally tried to answer every single customer inquiry that come in and today I'm sort of solving dozens if not many many dozens of custom in Queens that come in on a daily basis on different channels so in fact at this point what we have seven or eight things I have to respond to some on Facebook some on Instagram someone email someone private messaging some through Poshmark that you sort of are constantly engaged with the system we've done I think hundreds of events over the last five years and I have probably missed only two so far traveling across the country so you always have to be constantly in touch with the customer that you're building the product for we really empower our community to spread the love and that is one of the ever binding feature and love doesn't have to be completely ethereal it is something that actually drives the development of their brand development of their followers and ultimately allows them to succeed and in the process they're empowering other people to succeed and other people's to succeed and that creates a community but the community powered by love which ultimately ends up delivering success to each of these sellers through their incomes through their independence through money so to do that you really have to build something where everyone is accepting of another person and in order to keep a culture scalable you have to from day one build a tenant where each person really accepts another person and in a community that is very very critical and so one of the tenants we have in the company is that in order to accept other people you have to first start to accept yourself and if I were to look at all of you which is hard to do in this darkness I'm sure all of you feel a little bit weird inside in fact part of the reason you're sitting here is because you feel a little strange by embracing that strangeness and that weirdness you could actually accept other people and that's one of the core tenets of community and that was founded in the very very early days of how we started and that sort of how we start and and and live everything and that allows us to constantly scale the business and bring in different points of views and differing different point of views within the company itself so that scalability which starts from logistics goes into payments goes into how we think about community goes into how we think about love goes into scalability but the one thing I did not talk about is money I'm gonna go and talk about money from day one we created a partnership with our sellers stylists which was a 20/80 partnership they kept 80 percent the revenue we kept 20 percent of the revenue throughout the five and a half's or six years that we've been around people have attacked that somebody wanted to offer ten eleven three two three four five six all kinds of numbers ultimately most of the business is melted down because they had to change those models either start to tax the customer more or come up with hidden taxes etc in the five years that partnership has remained intact we have never raised our fees in that same time frame Amazon eBay many of the marketplace have changed their fee structures more than a dozen time and came up with 12 to 15 other taxes for the customers so that is a trust that you create because you're thinking of scalability in the future and take the arrows today so that you don't have to change your system out later and that creates a foundation where you've really empowered people created a trusted partnership with them and you can deliver innovation to them deliver ways for them to expand their business that ultimately creates a unification of everyone and and what we believe is something that's going to scale forever regardless of how the landscape evolves thank you very much and thank you for your time [Applause] you [Applause]

ladies and gentlemen Tim Chang and Rishi guard how are you doing we are last thing stand between you and lunch so we're going to try to talk fast and give you something useful maybe it off the beaten track yeah send you off to lunch feeling nice and epic have your appetites be full shoot it down yeah sure um so I'm Tim Chang a partner with Mayfield fund we're actually one of the earliest venture capital firms here in the valley were based down in Menlo Park some of our companies as was mentioned include lyft you're taking a lyft Poshmark class Pass Elon Musk Solar City company I recently sold called moat to Oracle so we do a lot of enterprise and consumer and it's my pleasure to welcome our newest partner Rishi Garg who was a early senior exec at square and Twitter he also himself did his hustle as a entrepreneur before including big skins prior to that at Google and MTV in other places oh thanks him and thanks also to Sam and John for putting together such an awesome group of people and a great conference that helped you guys are having a great time right yeah give him a hand my first hump of Tom and amazing to see how far this has come into the short period of time you know just to build on what Tim said you know Mayfield's backed about 600 companies in this history and over time kind of learned a lot about founders and myself at the founder and and with Tim being an entrepreneur his background as well and all the founders we've seen you kind of see a lot of the same characteristics and a lot of them were covered by Miguel just now some of the elements of the founder journey that are so special to what it's like to be a founder and that's kinda what we wanted to talk about today because the more we reflected on some of those ideas with Sam and John it sort of led to let this talk here so what do we mean by this what what do we mean by founder psychology or the founder journey the founders get a lot of advice on how to like manage your company and how to run the company and how to think about strategy but one thing that's not as talked about is how intimate the experiences of being the founder of a company it is not just a job it's not just a place you go to work it becomes the most deeply embedded part of your identity how many founders might identify with that out there anybody like sort of feel that if you started a company before it's rare that a hundred percent of the founder hands don't go up on that one because it's something that's sort of you really believe in if you're going to do that you put your all into it and the thing is all the good things and bad things by your psychology end up getting manifested in the culture of your company and the culture of your company into becoming the factor towards your success that matters the most as we've seen over time and so that makes it a really important topic for us as we think about not just advising founders but also as investors we're item like with all the companies that you see it's not really this is one of the most important elements that we care about yeah founder attributes your personalities who you are as peoples actually what we talk about most buying closed doors after the pitch usually people think it's business plan quality technology stack that kind of stuff that is actually traits around founder grit for lack of a better word you know that sort of fortitude that sort of willingness to go all the way walk through walls but also things that are softer self-awareness mindfulness if you will and even authenticity and vulnerability those are things we are looking for all the time we're looking for clues of those in how you tell your story how you treat your co-founders how you think about your customers and most of all with that an example is when people are trying to answer questions a lot of times folks feel like they have to have every answer button-down but that's a big tell right there one of the best ways to build trust with investors is knowing when to say I don't know as opposed to try to craft an answer showing you know everything because the truth is we don't every startups an experiment there's so much that's unknown and it's almost more important to know what you don't know and then bonus points if you have a way to test it and how to build sort of some hypotheses and how many of the founders you've backed are hatched fully formed from an AI gets perfect CEOs none and I think to a tee every single company we've ever backed whatever their exit was I was successful resembled nothing in the original pitch that's right and and and when I was I was very lucky to be part of two really interesting companies the last ten years and Twitter and for me that exact point that Tim's talking about where you see the evolution of a founder over time was really brought home because I got to work for two companies back were founded by Jack Dorsey it was really interesting because when I got to square sort of at the end of 2011 one thing that struck me was how singular the culture was its square it was focused on a few things that made a really different it was extremely collaborative everything was an open office framework the most openness of offices it was every part about our business was about pixel perfection it was about generating trust because we were carrying billions of dollars of transactions so everything from the way that we designed our Hardware reader to every single part of the user experience for onboarding in the app all of that was it had to be excellent all the time we pushed ourselves in that way we were extremely structured every meeting the way that we reviewed the activities of the company and it was also very top-down a lot of the power was sort of concentrated with a top tier through folks so even as an executive you sort of felt that a few years after I was early as Square I ended up being recruited over to Twitter to run corporate development and there I got kind of a shock I kind of realized how much Square was a reaction to Twitter in some way from a cultural standpoint and showed the growth that the founder had gone through because Twitter was much more like an ad hoc receipt Twitter was as a company in terms of the inner workings of it as protein and democratized and occasionally Messi as Twitter as a product loss you know we we sort of made decisions in the hallways there wasn't a ton of sort of high-level structure in terms of the frequency of our meetings and the reviews and stuff like that but it all kind of it all kind of worked create this amazing platform and so much of what I realized then was that Jack's journey as a founder and his potential for growth was a reason that both Twitter and Square was successful because obviously the way that power was consolidated and the focus on getting everything just right at square was reaction some the experiences that were had a twitter and both of those were amazing companies but one thing I've admired the most about Jack over time is a under a lot of the founders have worked with over the years and visited over the years is that they have this capacity for personal growth which is really really hard right I mean you've had some experiences I think as well the founders you've worked with yeah you know the point we're hammering here is that startups companies are basically extension of the founders personality values persona all those sorts of things Zappos and Tony Hsieh their CEO is a good example Tony's a friend we've been to Burning Man many times and I was struck by how much inspiration he took from Burning Man and brought back into his own company culture to make an otherwise miserable business of low margin shoe selling online at minimum wage feel like an amazing place to work it was imbued in their values when you walk in the lobby on their values board are things not just about creativity but about being weird and wacky and how every pod of every table is like a Burning Man camp for your there to craft your own identity as a team self-expression is imbued throughout open-mindedness and it was kind of amazing to see just how much fun you could take an otherwise shitty minimum hour minimum wage our job feel with that right culture at play and it started from I think Tony totally so then the question is okay if you're if who you are the founder is completely imbued into the culture and the everyday experience of your company then follow that you'd want to grow and have in many weapons at your disposal as possible to become the best founder you can be and manage some of those goods and Bad's that we all have within us so what are some of the things that you've seen Tim that work really well to help do that especially some of the stuff maybe that a lot of founders might not naturally think about we always talk about the founder grid right and this x-factor and I want to share a few notes with you kind of I've observed and some of these might seem a little off the beaten path but I'm hoping they'll be helpful for you you know we always look for founders who are great managers and leaders but the truth is being a really good leader starts with managing yourself and so I kind of think of this sort of fitness stack if you will you know how to take care your body you exercise you do yoga but there's also the notion of wellness at all levels your body your mind your emotions even your soul your spirit if you will and so we think a lot about how founders can manage your energy levels your mindfulness even your sleep when it comes to energy and food I'm a big fan of looking how to optimize you know the things you eat what you don't eat the supplements use those sorts of things there is a rising awareness for things like nootropics and smart drugs I'm a big fan of personal user of things like neutral box and bulletproof from Dave Asprey fasting is a big wave these days on how you sort of manage you know your caloric intake and expenditures so intermittent fasting is one I've seen a lot of founders use to keep their calories sort of in a certain cycle and have their mental awareness acutely tuned throughout the day mindfulness and meditation although it sounds a bit whoo it can make a huge difference and what for me that is whatever vehicle you use whether it's apps like headspace at home going to meditation retreats doing yoga micro dosing whatever it is that you find it's a way to train yourself on how to respond intentionally to all the stress hitting you throughout the day as opposed to honestly most of us are reacting to fear and crisis 90% of the time it's an emotional reaction and face it startups are nothing but fire drill existential threat every day in and out it's just stressing you out throughout so anything you do to kind of establish a baseline so you're responding intentionally as opposed that emotional reaction is a big deal and lastly we kind of idolize this notion of like you know you sleep when you're dead and it's all about the hustle and work hard but God you know all those years I wish I didn't believe that because you never get those hours of sleep back you can't just sleep when you're dead sleep turns out to be a secret weapon in digesting all the things throughout the day that's happened and also coming up with non-obvious ideas that wouldn't have struck you so as nuts as it sounds don't skip out on your seven eight hours of sleep a day it makes a big difference even for your creative process and your productivity yeah there's yeah right I think a lot of people feel the feel that stress out of the audience and are really excited that they sort of can have support in pursuing a healthful lifestyle there's this great blog post by a coach named edy Batista who writes about this evolution that occurs between being a worker being and not being employee versus being a founder or CEO which is that when you're when you're kind of working for somebody else your job is just to get the work done most of the time but when you become a CEO or a founder the job is to present you and that's why it's such a heavy burden on you that's why it's so deeply involved in your identity but if you're going to present you and your beliefs about the world and the mission that you're on then you have to protect the health of that asset to protect that health of you which is why the physicality is so important why sleep is so important another thing that's starting to get talked about a lot but isn't still right now in the valley is mental illness and not just melt there's two things sort of mental illness which is that these pressure sometimes can uncover some real pain for us and that those need to be dealt with on a professional level but also the idea of D stigmatizing the idea of help and that can be through a lot of different angles part of it's do coaching which I'm happy to say is increasingly common amongst honors in fact of Mayfield we're instituting policies where we're going to overtime sort of ask that all or highly encourage all of our portfolio companies to get coaches so that they can get additional perspectives on how they can grow and develop over time and I strongly encourage founders to do that almost everyone that I meet regardless what they're at may feel because I know it helps everyone has a coach Michael Jordan had a coach and they could be incredibly valuable to you having an advisory board of informal people that you actually trust to get advice from as opposed to one or two people only but to really build some relationships and invest in building those relationships because of those key moments that you decide to those key Mobile's where you need that kind of help and then finally actually getting therapy the sounder stressors are really really strong and I can't tell you how many founders have told me that when they've actually disclosed that they've sought help from a great therapist as part of the process that they've actually found it to help enormous Lee with the burdens of being a founder because those burdens are very very real so then the question is asking now you're doing all this to actually make yourself better on your journey to becoming a better founder by manifesting that in your culture and that's really important what do you do when you get to work what are some ways to actually start to showcase that growth of that capability within work and I think one of the most important things that we've seen is how founders approach mission vision and values right them yeah after you get to take care of yourself and you're really self-aware you can bring that to work and kind of shape the team in the culture around you and this is important because we always talk about the what and the how of our hustle but not always the why and the why matters a lot I think the why keeps you going and I know it sounds fluffy to write down your mission and vision statement but it's actually those things to keep you going when is falling apart around you which it always does um this exercise is also kind of a force multiplier in helping you really just know what your true north is and I think if you really know your purpose of what you're doing I think it'll help you let go of your fear of failure and maybe over time even learn to surrender that attachment to the outcome what's going to happen this is big to me because statistically most startups will fail but if you know why you're building what you're building there's a lot of value in that and it's going to create benefit in the world anyway so you know for me I want to take a moment to thank all of you for doing the hustle you're doing regardless of the outcome of it it's an experiment that needs to be run and there's some contribution to the world that you're building that we're all going to learn from and so that's why I think the vision part is really important because it's the why behind the hustle yeah and if you haven't if you haven't already spent time really articulating that your what your mission is and really spending time on it when I was a founder the thing I thought was the most frou frou thing to focus on and it turned out to be the only thing that mattered in fact at what I was asked where we there was something that we implemented that turned out to be so different when it came to this topic but I just wanted to share with you because I could have always been so impressed by it it's the idea that you use your values to make decisions so the way that we do value the square was that Jack sort of helped us articulate help the firt help the company articulate four core values we called them the four corners and then the way that we would kind of judge whether or not those were are adequately reflecting the words were adequately affecting who we are and why we came to work every day is whether or not we would use those words in meetings to make decisions because that's what value should be right the famous of the I think the values for Enron were like you know accountability leadership excellence integrity or something like that I mean it's like when you actually use values that are part of who you are and then you start to make decisions about them they really argue about and that's always been a great North Star for me as I work with founders on on how to get those down on paper it's it's kind of it's it's work that always feels like it's less important to something else but it turns out a lot of times I think to be the most important thing there's one other thing that gets overlooked a lot and it's again starting to get written about but it's co-founder relationships because this is very lonely as a job to be a founder and most companies are half the company's roughly have co-founding relationships and those are as important as any important relationship you'll ever have I mean they're there you spend more time with your co-founder than you do in a marriage and yet it's amazing how few times founders actually spend time working on that relationship explicitly and found it about standing relationships together often end up being certainly if not more successful though they probably are they certainly enjoy that journey more and can disconnect from the outcome as Tim just says a great example in our portfolio I've actually left where the first investors in left one of the really compelling things when you when you saw a list sort of back in the day but it still Zimride was the relationship between John and Logan and that tightness that bond the the effort they made towards our relationship which persists to this day and we think is part of the reason they've been able to weather the storm and continue to grow in a really changing environment again back to the importance of coaching and even therapy same techniques for marital therapy probably applied for co-founders right but I think we're out of time so I just wanted to leave you with those parting thoughts and I hope those are helpful and again like I said some of these come off as woowoo or touchy-feely but they actually are the things that kind of matter in the end even behind the KPIs and metrics that's right the the you know I joined may fold about here and the reason I did it was the this is a unique time in the Silicon Valley where a few people are creating a lot of impact and so the more that founders can sort of spend their time on building themselves to make that impact the ripple effects for positivity are pretty dramatic thanks a lot take care of yourself guys [Applause]

they grew up struggling with my weight like many of the people that are you know speaking today I started a company based on my personal frustrations as the biggest kid in the class feeling like time and time again the products I purchased the magazines I opened up the programs I tried the TV shows I turned on or not on my side or made me feel worse about myself instead of better and itself so at odds with the way the world especially Millennials is hurting to talk about health and wellness so at odds of the way I wanted to here health and wellness being talked about which was not about health and fitness being the point but about it just being a part of living a better happier longer life so this notion that this is a major profound shift where 73 percent of Millennials would rather be healthy even wealthy so profoundly different from the generations the past like the the notion was like why aren't there brands and businesses that speak to this so in the last six years what we've done is try to build that brand and we've done that primarily through content so today we write content we're a health and wellness media website greatest com check it out we have built a leading far clearer and far away market leader in terms a healthy mind of Millennials to reach 10 to 50 million people every single month using science fact expert approved content that's fun and friendly just like your friends a little further along along the way we've raised eight million dollars led by floodgate dream investor we have were profitable now which is pretty exciting you know not making but loads of money yes that we're on our way and what we're really doing which is you know we're especially excited about its taking this notion of like a friend who's a little further along which i think is a voice that we were a 'king for that's been missing in the space taking that voice and actually productizing it so imagine if we could pair you with a friend who's a little further along you know just six months ahead of you who can show you sort of the path guide you towards where you want to go maybe even pair you with a group of people just like you who want to accomplish the same goals on the same timeline so now we're playing with a lot of different stuff but if you want to ask me about what it's like to run a business for six years how to start something that some people every now and then will walk up to me and be like you run that blog right and being like no it's not a blog it's a media company if you want to talk about really anything the NBA draft my job is to answer anything that you guys have pressing and I was going to perform my Nicki Minaj song but I'll do that later any questions yes sir I'm sure there's like mics or some things don't actually told me how this worked but I will listen to you Rodale totally yeah so in case you didn't hear at the way I understood the question at least was like advertising is a pretty mediocre business and elicitor Facebook and how our media publisher is going to monetize and you mentioned Rodale Rodale actually just last I think this week actually said that they are considering a sale Rodale for those of you that might not know men's health women's health runners world this was the largest private health and wellness publisher actually one of the largest private publishers period so the way we think about this is that advertising is actually a pretty great market obviously some of the largest companies in the world actually are built on advertising but as a publisher especially as a niche publisher that doesn't want to sell your soul and doesn't want to yeah like sell sell out and just write about Kim Kardashian all day you do have to kind of pursue other options but it's because you don't write about Kim Kardashian of all day that you can sort of double down on the trust that you built I have strong feelings about the market of health and wellness as well I think if you're building a publisher in news and politics or media entertainment I think it's really really really hard to figure out how to charge your customers but my guess is every single person in this audience spend every month some amount of money on health and wellness and if I could tell you you could spend it on from the will actually help you get healthier you'd probably move you're spending eighty percent of Millennials today say they're spending on health and wellness they say on average they're spending 20% of their annual income so gut check that for a second does that seem right if that's right that's four hundred and twenty billion dollars being spent in the United States right now on health and wellness what are they spending it on Andy cross paths which you'll hear from payout later so yeah I think I think it's really tight the market that you're in and I think that there is a massive opportunity to build this is my opinion and my pitch ultimately when we continue to grow is like my opinion is there's enormous open opportunity in health and wellness in terms of a subscription you pay for every month that actually drives you value peloton is a perfect example but what's something that like normal people can afford and so I don't know if any of you guys are working on any ideas we're excited to hear about that I think my name is Chuck Adi and I was curious as an upstart media brand with a very targeted demographic in 2017 what are your thoughts about cannabis and its contribution to health and wellness amongst our generation were more comfortable with it at the same time that you guys are building a brand and have you know a myriad of advertisers and stakeholders that you have that aside everyone is into wheat right now right man like I have like so many pitches on like weed infuses green juice like I don't even understand that's just weed juice yeah so I think it's an enormous market I mean it's definitely an enormous like economic like opportunity especially as it continues to expand and grow and be legalized which you know is the only something is it like it's starting to go state by state I think in the media space I would argue that we've has actually been like covered a lot you know high times has existed for longer than like anyone can imagine it's noop dog just bought it I could be going crazy something like that actually think that we'd probably is one of the most oversaturated niche topics that gets covered a lot in media but I think if you're building a product and we that's a a major opportunity thank you other questions yes sir yeah so we work with big steel brands almost entirely and those were very proactively going out to or they're coming in to us but you know the only real way to monetize online today is through sort of these direct branded content sponsorships which are you know sometimes people will call them advertising sometimes they won't it's obviously advertising our pitch to them is look we can activate and engage Millennials to care about their health better than anyone on the planet and we speak their language better than your brand will ever speak and so if you're trying to introduce something new you're trying to launch something new you're trying to change something that people didn't know before but like our finding out that you know change the formula or trying to introduce something new you know that we can do that and help kind of move the needle for you build business build that brand awareness in a different way but yeah the big brand partnerships you know I've been doing this for six years and greatest was not always 10 to 15 million unique visitors a month and when we were much smaller it was much harder to get people to take notice and in fact unfortunately I would say that the goalpost or when you can really start truly selling to these big brands continues to move I remember when we hit 5 million unique visitors I was like this is it this is the moment and then everyone was like now you need said I was like and and then we got 10 at everyone's like yeah but you don't have 30 so you know it's a it takes time to get there yes hi this is Stephanie I'm just curious to know if there's anything coming up for you that you're excited about in in my personal life of course you mean your business yeah the thing I'm most excited about is actually the space in general I think health and wellness I've alluded to it but I think like this is the year like there are businesses that are being built every January for us is our Super Bowl you know I don't know if you guys think of January and are like this is the day that I'm going this is months and I'm going to get everything on track well if it's not everyone else is thinking that and so January becomes the Superbowl and every January for the last five years has just gotten bigger and bigger in terms of how seriously people are starting to take their health and how much smarter they're getting about building it into their lives so I'm actually just really excited about the continued increasing importance of health and wellness and yeah I mean it was not a thing if I was here four years ago you know I'm pretty sure half the speakers on this stage are like health and wellness related or lifestyle related in some way and that was not true four years ago so I'm excited about where it's all moving and where it's all heading yes sir hey Derek my name is dog well that's really terrific my name is on it I'm really curious to pick your brain on habit formation could you talk about like you know this notion that you just said January's your Super Bowl that means that there are a lot of new year's resolution people coming coming to your site to let her help right but how do you sustain that motivation in that energy so I have some strong opinions on this greatest was really built the whole actually name itself is not because I don't know like I don't know how to spell it's actually the idea is that it's somebody who's trying to get better like an artist works an art a greatest just works on being greater they don't have to be the greatest so this notion of like it's all about actually in you know kind of working at it and trying and learning is what I think is the only thing that really sticks is finding what's good for you that you actually enjoy and then you keep doing it over time it's what I found time and time again almost anyone who's doing like a crash diet you know to accomplish a certain goal if you're not going to end up sticking to some of that stuff like you're in trouble in my in my mind and actually science says not only is yo-yo dieting bad for you but look the country has never been more abuse the world has never been more obese and a big part of that is because of but yet the but yet we on average diet three to four times a year in America which is crazy number so so I think actually that the job is not to change the behavior though I think people do we just go through ups and downs in terms of our motivation and I like in the in the health world people take January because they're always like you know oh all these you know New Year's resolution people are going to like go into the gym and then they're going to you know give it up for their don't really mean it they'll give up after 12 days but I actually think like what an amazing opportunity of this moment we're like I want to start fresh I want to start new there are different times that's to be asked throughout the year and so the way I think of it is don't change the behavior but actually like embrace that and just make it easier and more effective if people want to commit to something I'm really excited about I don't know if some of you have heard of this dye called whole 30 I'm excited about this notion that diets as we think of them are shifting and that the new diet is actually a short thing that you do for a small period of time and what you take away two to three life-changing things so with whole 30 which is really hard I lasted 20 days on it it's really tough it's like a very like iffy extreme Paleo with some weird stuff thrown in but I'm a big fan of it and you do whole 30 and you'll learn one to cook more than you ever have before you'll learn that there's added sugar and just about everything and that sriracha is delicious because it's full of sugar and Cholula is less sugar so you're allowed to eat that some deserve reason and and you'll learn about sort of the way your body feels when you're just eating kind of good food and so these are like things that you can take away and stick to and the whole thirty folks actually talked a lot about how almost a hard wig the co-founder talks a lot about how it's not supposed to be for 365 days so the diet tells you you're going to do this for the rest of your life and you're never going to have walk and chips and you're never going to have ice cream again like that's not for me and I imagine it's not for most people in this audience though if it is like props to you and I'd love to eat your guac and chips but I think that that's a major shift that's happening so anyway I think the idea is not to actually like try to change behavior necessarily but to lean into trying to improve like the effect of when that you know kind of rise in motivation exists and totally how are you um where this has a really huge audience can you elaborate more on the marketing and what you've found to be successful to grow and also attract your unique visitors yeah so we do things really differently I actually spoke at con-con which is the event that the hustle put on before this I remember I left [ __ ] memory and and what we talked about was I have this like extremely strong belief that what you need to be doing is producing a lot less content that's a lot more awesome and that in a world where the distribution networks have changed dramatically but are now not going anywhere you only stick out by being really really relevant to a small niche group and by super serving them and so that's what we do in health and wellness which is a space that sort of typifies by people not doing that you know people make money and help them all this the easy way because it's easy for like most of time and so what we do is we produce signs back to expert approved content that's terrifically legitimate we produced a very small amount of it compared to anybody that we ever we get compared to and we tend to perform really well on places that you might think are less sexy places like Google search places like Pinterest people come back and when they come they spend over seven minutes on every article page on average which is like that really read the content which is like a crazy thing in media apparently so you know my opinion is that it's it's not what you think it's not about sort of spray-and-pray it's actually about finding your niche audience engaging them terrifically and you know in growing that audience over time it doesn't happen overnight so we're that there's no mic over there right hope none of you have questions go ahead bit of a similar question I was wondering what was the number one strategy used to first build your audience and how did that change when you got to the stage of scaling that audience yeah number one like what's the thing that worked or number one is in what's the first thing I tried that flop disastrously I would say what's the one you would prioritize now that you know looking back so look greatest started six years ago and the world was very different the way that we drew like first dick thing that we did was we reached out to 100 top influencers in the space I was like oh you know I read voraciously so voraciously that I used to work very slowly just now out it's embarrassing so I read like crazy and I knew all the people that I admired in the space and so I reached out to them was like hey I'm launching this site I want your help how do way we reach normal people just trying to get better and a voice election empower them to improve and those a hundred people when I actually later was like okay we launched the site ended up sharing it today that's an influencer strategy and if that's your strategy like you better have a billion dollars because it's it's shifted in such a different way so that was a strategy that sort of worked then the next thing that sort of changed the game for us was we hitched a ride on Pinterest what bandwagon it was an early we were all using it in the office it was just starting to grow in like late 2011 we decided to double down on this platform that has become one of the largest platforms on the internet and we just honestly got it right we committed to improving all of our content in a way that was more visual and more driven we sort of looked at that and we're like we're going to own this for health and wellness and food and drink which at the time were the third and fourth most popular categories or something like that and so we just keep like really hitched a ride to this and and the challenge now is like what is that platform and so you know it would still give the same advice which is how do you find a platform that's growing that you believe in that is really really truly like some of your audiences on and start like growing from there it's harder to do than ever before because the gatekeepers are there are less of them now and it's and it takes more resources to get ahead so it's like you're thinking oh well the answer is video like video is more expensive doing video right is really and uniquely is really tough and so I'd encourage everyone who wants to build a media brain with to build an audience to focus on a very very specific demographic and then try to make it like 10 times more specific than that and super like super super serve them in a way that actually they basically like you become there must read or there must follow or there must share otherwise you're screwed there's a you know like general content for people it just doesn't work anymore and I don't know why it would and I'm upset that it ever did good either could you talk a little bit about any sort of frameworks heuristics or giving your editorial strategy of content strategy the things that you guys use as your North Star to make decisions whether it's what you're going to publish or not publish or what you're investing in or where you're spending your time um talk talk as much as you're able to about how you make decisions within the company yeah choosing what to cover is really hard actually especially if you have limited resources it's a great question and it's not easy we've gone we've we've changed a lot over time in terms of how we approach it I would say roughly the way it breaks down is about 30% like a third of the dirty 3.3 33 a third of the decisions that we make come from numbers right it's like what's working for us what's working for other people about a third comes from our internal editors and like their judgment and this is really kind of crucial because it's it's like you have to trust the people that know what they're doing and then about a third comes from like the outside world which is you know like what's trending in Google for example so it's sort of this mixture of the three and it's absolutely an art more than a science because we write two or three articles a day which again might seem like a lot to you guys that you know the people were sort of competing with so the people who usually people compare and are like oh you're just like that other media company they're writing 50 to 500 articles a day so you know we think of it as like we have very few shots on goal we got to make take a hell a good shot I obviously I'm not a sports guy or else maybe that would make that metaphor better so I don't know if that answers your question but that's how we think about it and it changes over time and it's and it's it's like you know you're constantly trying to provide something that's different and providing something that's different can just be your voice just your tone and it can just be sort of that how comprehensively how you frame and package it you know how you're speaking online how you're bringing content we probably produce meaningfully more content everyday that's built for each of the social channels that we're trying to build an audience on that we do for our site proper which is crazy so you know this it all continues to evolve and shift go ahead every time I have them like bunch of questions as you keep talking but I'll stick with my initial which was how did you know when to quit your day job and go to this full force and how did you know who to hire when to hire you know how did you realize we have the funds to do it you know just as a surprise yeah how did I figure out everything and yeah well what I'll start with is that I think like I'm broken I've been building stuff my whole very short life I don't think that's the only way to build businesses I think people build businesses for lots of different reasons and lots of different stages in their lives but I from like an in middle school and high school and college I served organizations that are all still around are all still growing honestly they're all bigger and better than when I was there which is kind of cool and actually flattering but also like what does that say about me that's like I've always started new stuff and I'm surprised time and time again by people who are drawn to sort of entrepreneurship for reasons that I think are wrong like I don't know how else I don't know what else to do and I'm a shitty employee I always have been and like I have always believed that I can do better something in this world like truly that I can do it better than anybody else that's totally not normal and I hope very few people think that because it's kind of messed up but it's I think the only feeling you need to have when you're trying to start a business it's like this bubble this I think of it as like you've got a lot of like idea bubbles and one like bubbles to the top and you're like I need to do that and nobody can do this better than me and it's a crazy thought to say that when you have no remote experience and so my opinion on this is if you're considering quitting your day job to do something entrepreneurial it does research a no-brainer to you you have to be sitting there saying you know I think if you're truly asking yourself that question it's probably not right for you would be my strong opinion and that you should have it should be such a feeling like of course I have to do this and so that's my very strong opinion on that I don't know if that's helpful I feel like I just scared everyone I have two questions and I'll ask both of them first should be straightforward I think what's the most popular piece of content you've ever published oh man that's a great question it is 17 or 24 portable high protein snacks it's true right now the number one thing that's trending actually is 24 tricks at 24 24 tricks to stay cool during the summer when you don't have an AC and everything is science fact and expert approved what but yeah those have been it's mostly food food it does terrifically well for us and the second question is as you grow to compete with these traditional media companies how do you think about a comScore number which is going to be used by the pngs and huge companies that might be coming to you with ad dollars yeah we think about it too much probably you know there's a like funny constant struggle between like hey we're different we're not doing things like the other people we're the upstart as someone said and we're going to transform and disrupt and be different but also we want your money and how do you decide to give us your money oh it's with all the metrics that everyone else is using and so it's a constant battle actually and there's no really simple solution you'd like to think that you can actually push the market forward and actually define the market in a different way which is what we do you know things like experiences branded content you know it those are hard to quantify and so that's what people want from you that's what you could sell in a very different way but yes of course we have a comScore number every month we're like wish it was larger and it's a you kind of have to play the game a little bit and as much as I always want to be like you don't understand like we do think so differently you can't even put us on a chart but people need charts to decide how to spend money especially if they're at P&G and are worried about getting fired by their boss if they make a silly decision so it's a balance just like everything in health everything is a talents good thanks Derek um so say you wanted to start a media company you think you've identified a good niche made it specific have an idea on how to super serve them what's a quick way to validate like if those people are going to care by your content without like slaving at it for five months and spending money getting your content out there I think you should slave at it for five months I mean you could write a blog post on your own you know in the early days of greatest I say a lots of people that if you can't start the business on your own you shouldn't start it or you should find a co-founder who can help you build it every now and then someone's like I'm going to build an app and you're like oh cool I love apps so I get apps um and they're like but you know all I know how to do is strategy consulting and you're like all right well that strategy consulting is cool but do you know how to build an app and if they don't I worry about how they're going to put the resources together make the right decisions you can find the right people to work with and so I always encourage people if you're going to build a media company like write and edit like you should be or find someone who's like going to start with you who can do it too so first I would say like create some stuff put it out there it's definitely never been easier to test people's reactions because of Facebook because of you know social media you can both put stuff out there you can pay to get it promoted and see what the reactions are but yeah I actually believe a lot of times that people over eight sort of the I'm going to just put a sealer out there and see how people respond to react I think a lot of times the things that are truly again most of people that are speaking on the stage built something that didn't exist before and that no one was like man what I really need is a protein bar that has slightly less calories and less sugar but high protein and is made of good ingredients like nobody was sitting there actively maybe thinking that and so I think you know like that's the way to be is like the world needs this I keep always thinking about the Henry Ford quote which is like if your desk - what they wanted they would have wanted a faster horse a realtor's really sure that's a myth and not a real quote but it's a good one yeah go ahead a large publisher what do you think of programmatic guides and you know assuming that you think it's broken how would you fix it and programmatic if you're producing really high quality content as shooting programmatic is like a great way to move upstream and make more money programmatic for those of you that don't know is basically like if you display advertising that you're monetizing through a waterfall and the waterfall is like you get to choose which vendors are bidding on your on your inventory and so it's a big thing a lot of people are moving to their in particular a lot of big brands are moving a lot of their spending there which is very frustrating if you're trying to convince them and money on branded content they're like nah I'm good I just want to spend money using robots to decide what to buy I think it's really smart for the industry honestly I think for a publisher you can't possibly get by on just programmatic I think it's really hard unless you've got like I don't know 300 million unique visitors something and I welcome anybody who's innovating to try and improve the quality of the ads and the relevance of the ads because our content and our audience is real and so that helps us but doesn't help everyone it's a mess of the thing though programmatic yeah so I know there's a lot of controversy and diets especially things like fat intake and I'm curious when your experts disagree with each other out and resolve that and you know prevent being safe news all right this is unfortunately the last question and so sorry but it says times up in very scary red letters so I have to trust that I will answer this question though because I think it's really crucial some of you might have heard recently the coconut oil is the devil for you and it has saturated fat it always did and saturated fat is not bad for you and the American Heart Association which makes recommendations like when you read that site I guarantee you any of the recommendations will be like oh this is a hard thing to trust that is not bad for you so long story but but you'd be surprised at how much we don't agree with the science health and wellness is sounds controversial a lot of the time a lot of things in health sound like everyone disagrees but honestly it's mostly traditional media just trying to confuse the [ __ ] out of you and there's a general scientific consensus about almost about many many things if not almost all major things in health and wellness today now that doesn't mean it's not going to evolve and change but there's a general scientific consensus and so you'd be surprised how rarely people actually disagree internally remember we have every article that needs it approve by least two experts sometimes we'll bring in five because there are so many different varying takes I'm waiting for Sam to like run out and drag me off I really appreciated being your lunch entertainment and I think nicki minaj is next thanks [Applause]

Max Lytvyn is the founder of Grammarly, a fremium grammar writing app with nearly 7 million daily users. Having profitably bootstrapped the company to hundreds of employees, Grammarly recently raised a $110m round of funding.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
so let's give it up for max and grammerly hi everyone I'm max animal co-founder of grammarly and today I'm going to talk about bootstrapping and I'm going to use grammarly a lot as an example today so let me just say a few words about the company to those who are not familiar with it grammerly is providing a high-powered products that help people improve their communication help them make their email social media messages documents more effective clear and mistake-free so gramley has a very big mission improving lives by improving communication it's so big it almost sounds undoable not not just not books travel and today I'm going to tell you how it is actually possible to do how this can be done and we're doing it now millions of users are using grammarly and it materially improves their lives and I promise you if you install grammerly after this conference your life is going to get better even if just tiny a little bit it's going to get better so this mission is real we live by it but it's so big it may seem it's not something that can be bootstrap but we did it and today I'm going to share with you framework that helped us do it and just to illustrate what I mean by good scale by kind of we did it this is not to brag there's just some numbers to show you what I mean by by the scale of our company so it all started in 2004 when my co-founder and I decided that it's time to get real it's time to build a real company so we read a lot of manuals mostly from Ikea and we assembled our first office in Tirana as you can see on this picture micro powder Alex was the brain of the operation and I was the muscle so that's why he got the windows eat yes that's how are you who's trekking looks like it's not very glamorous I admit it but it's just a start so in 2009 until 2009 we were focused on plagiarism detection which is kind of a very niche area but it's related to communication and in 2009 our understanding of communication evolved our vision evolved and we we had new missions how people communicate better and we realize it was very ambitious it was very difficult from a technology standpoint and it had massive market it was diverse because communication problems and needs are different for everybody so what do we do is it too much to bootstrap but we decided to give it a try we had some experience we had some learnings from previous projects so we decided to give it a try and what helps us get through it will help us do this was a kind of a three element framework that I'm going to show will share with you today and I very much hope it's going to help at least some of you to do something big and do something impactful so step number one is may look familiar to some of you I guess many here know the concept of MVP if you don't google it it's very useful concept it's great concept but challenge with it is that most people applied incorrectly they just go straight to the product they minimize their product they go with minim and it's easy to make this mistake because it says Minimum Viable Product right so they go straight to the product you have to start your MVP with your market you have to pick a small homogeneous segment with one pane that sold by small fraction of functionality that you're envisioning building eventually and this functionality is something that going to be useful to the rest of your market at some point so let me illustrate it with a diagram what it actually means how how that works so let's say on the to access you have product functionality frog death like how much value you're creating for users and on a horizontal one you have market breadth like the size of your market so and in the area of the chart is the amount of work you have to do together the blue shaded area is your ultimate vision it's like 10 15 20 years of work so you don't want to start there you want to do something smaller trim it and what most people end up with is what I call typical MVP is that gray area at the bottom here it's broad because you're building for everyone and it's very thin because all you have limited resources so what you end up with you're spending a ton of work to build something that barely qualifies as a toy and people forget about it in like few weeks but if you MVP your market first if you find this very small group very homogeneous group and build your MVP specifically for them just for them you're going to end up doing much much less work and the product is going to be better so that it not only gets kind of elevated to the level of 2 rather than toy but you can also charge money for it which is extremely important for a bootstrap product you get early revenue very quickly and just using Bramley as an example again our MVP market was academics students researchers instructors and that strong pain is we identify for them was making documents making papers compliant with rigorous academic standards and that team could be sold by a subset of checks of corrections suggestions that would be needed for other people as well so we were not deviating from our long term vision of just like building building a two-level how people communicate and just let me give you an example of what this optimization of buildings that MVP for that tiny small market gave us for example pretty much everyone 99 percent of our potential market wanted feedback in real time you type any see feedback you see suggestions but academics didn't they were fine waiting five minutes 10 minutes and 15 minutes to get feedback on their document why because they spent weeks writing with it so extra five minutes doesn't matter they just go get a cup of coffee and that realization optimizing for that allows us to not worry about speed and worry about accuracy more but it also allowed us to cut engineering costs by 50 percent and cut server server costs by more than five times and that's just one optimization so don't underestimate the step try to go with a narrow market first MVP or market first before and gain your product now moving on to step number two sell before you build and it's easy to be easier to explain with an example how we did it so as soon as we had specifications for our MVP we went to a bunch of conferences trade shows for our target market academics and try to sell the product just using paired demos and it was invaluable it got us feedback on the product it got us validation of some of their our ideas and the bonus point it also lined up first buyers so that we had first revenue literally days after release the product literally days that's extremely important for start-up again because basically our first buyers funded the rest of the company and this approach applies not only to b2b not only to sales if you are working on a consumer product it still applies there's a way to do it for example for our consumer focused features we used AdWords to advertise upcoming big features and see how people respond to them if people click on ads in what numbers to help us prioritize those features so essentially we kind of pre sold tested the features before they were developed with with real users here is an example of open you of kind of a mailing we did to potential educational customers and this example reminds me of one very important point I want to make when you do pre selling or kind of selling something is you don't have like smoke testing very easy to kind of a not be completely ethical please don't do that it's possible to do that in a completely ethical way without any bait-and-switch or anything like that be ethical and just if you put your mind to it you can completely do it in a very positive and ethical way an example one of the kind of tricks we use to make sure that it's completely fine when we sold somebody on the feature that we didn't have we actually gave them a free trial that ended after we released that feature so before they actually paid us money they saw the complete product that was promised to them and as a result of our approach to this as of this approach to this reselling every customer we sold product that we didn't have eventually was completely happy and we use them as references to build more and more customers so be ethical if it's worth it it pays off expand project the market innovations that's the final step and that's where most people fail that's where big dreams die so pay attention they kind of the trick here the main principle here is build for your next segment not for the segment's not as much for the segments you have now and just use an example to illustrate it not quite an example with analogy what is more valuable building for 10,000 users that you have or for 1 million users that you're about to have of course the latter so think about it this way it's very helpful but of course it's never black and white whatever you build helps both your existing users and your new users so how do you balance that I use this formula where you basically take size of your current segment and benefit to it and size of the new segment and benefit to it and factor in the risk and it kind of spits out the the relative value of anything new you build and it's very helpful for evaluating new opportunities and things you can build so this is how this looks when you put it back on the on the grass which we saw earlier you expand your market you and your product functionality for that market and gradually you delight more and more users so some do's and don'ts kind of a to sum it up and to make this model even more practical and useful first don't bite off too much small quick steps are less risky they are [Music] generating revenue quicker you're going to be going to releasing new features expanding your market in smaller but quicker steps and each each new improvement is going to help you get more revenue which is a very important for bootstrap company then don't get stuck chasing your tail this is a big mistake that many people make and let me explain what I mean by this let's say you had success on a specific segment of the market and as a result of that all the feedback that you got all the data that you're collecting is going to be about that segment but it's not going to teach you about users you don't have users that you have are very poor at teaching you about users that you don't have so you have to realize that you have to break out of it you have to go out of your existing user base go out of the data that's easily available to you and look broader look to your next segment look to you to - expansion and keep focused on your vision and then finally expect each next steps to be harder initially if you've done good job creating your MVP kind of stacking out your MVP you collected although hanging fruit you skimmed all the cream you killed flocks of birds with one stone you've done all that but once you've done all that it's over it's no longer that easy so each next step is going to be progressively get more difficult and again it seems obvious but most people don't think that I like that they fall into the trap of thinking well I'm getting better at what I do I'm getting more resources my company is growing bigger so each day except should be easier no it's the other way around if you've done your job right you've done all the easy things in the beginning and each next thing is going to be more more and more difficult and yes that says it's a very simple framework I really hope it's going to help how some of you guys build something new doesn't even have to be a start-up it may be a product within your existing company it can be applied pretty broadly and it worked really well for Emily we started as I mentioned we started as a very narrow to four very narrow market on purpose and then right now we have a breadth we have broad suite of a high-powered products that how people improve different aspects of their communication from effectiveness tone correctness clarity pretty much all across the board and that's just the beginning Thanks [Applause] [Music]

thanks for coming out this morning so I want to talk for the next 17 minutes about how to win no matter what category you're in so and I want to start to really by saying something that I've noticed about great entrepreneurs and great entrepreneurs don't start out by actually saying I want to go start a company they actually start out by saying I want to solve this problem no matter what industry they're in so I'm the founder and CEO of this company hints how many have had hints before I can hardly see you out there but I believe you so I started hints about twelve years ago out of my own interest to get off of a little-known soda called Diet Coke so I was drinking diet coke every day religiously I think you could fairly call me an addict to Diet Coke and I realized that Diet Coke after eliminating Diet Coke was doing lots of not such great stuff to me so I was 50 pounds overweight I had for the first time in my life developed terrible adult acne and no energy and trying to figure out after going to see a number of doctors what was wrong with me and then when I actually went and eliminated the diet coke and started drinking plain water I thought wow in six months fifty pounds were gone the acne was gone the energy was back up and it was that simple so I'm going to talk a little bit about you know four things that I really see sort of in my own journey of looking at you know what it really was and what would allowed me to win I'm still winning along the way but definitely as I started to look really at what is it that helps me to sort of do what I'm doing today so first of all I looked at solving problems and as I mentioned this was the biggest problem for me and when I started to look at the soda industry as a whole I really looked at diet diet coke as well as diet pepsi and thought that you know these are large public companies who really out to actually get me to drink soda they were not interested in actually helping me get healthier as a consumer they really wanted to continue to sell me stuff by getting lots of celebrities and athletes to sort of show me that they drink those products and therefore they're going to be that's going to help me to get healthier and so if I really wanted to actually have change I couldn't rely on those guys to actually go and develop this product for me so I thought I'm going to actually go and figure out how to do this product and get it out on the market so I think when I started to think about developing hands I go back to what I originally said which was I never thought I want to go run a beverage company I want to go start a beverage company I make college students feel really great by telling them I was never that person who said I want to go found the next big energy drink company or soda company I really want to do something that makes a difference and what I started to see was that if I actually went out and started this company that I could make a difference not just in myself and in my family's life but also in a lot of other people's lives and helping them to get healthier and so that's what I decided to do so I think a lot about other entrepreneurs and lots of different industries this is probably one of my favorite photos of Steve Jobs - the big Idol of mine or somebody that I've really admired over the years but I think that something that great entrepreneurs do is that they not only search for why and sort of they're developed in how they're developing their own product and ultimately their own company but why are their biggest competitors potential biggest competitors actually doing what they're doing so somebody like Steve Jobs wasn't actually going out to start a company he was actually trying to create a better computer and other entrepreneurs like Mark Zuckerberg for example was not out to develop a company he was actually trying to create trying to solve a problem around community and there's other Sara Blakely another one of my favorites who decided to launch a launch a product really around pantyhose and solving a problem so it might not be your problem that these great entrepreneurs are trying to solve but they're actually trying to solve them for themselves first and then move on to try and solve them for other people so talking about talking about my own situation when I went when I was really trying to look at solving a problem and going back to to Steve and sort of other people that I look at and admire I ended up launching Hantz at Whole Foods in San Francisco and after a few months realized that I really didn't have a clue about what I was actually setting out to do so things like shelf life things like distribution I had grown up in the tech industry I had launched aol's ecommerce business way back when and developed it into a billion-dollar business and left in 2001 and was really looking at like I thought okay I can go and do this other industry it's really interesting and solving a problem for myself but after a few months I realized oh I have no idea what I'm doing and so a friend of mine said hey I have this friend that is uh that is an executive at Coke and and he was telling a major executive at Coke about what you guys were doing and he said he'd be happy to chat with you so my original intent was to really get this guy on the phone and just understand how do I actually create a shelf-life in a product that is more than you know six weeks basically that was the initial thing that was the initial product and so as I got him on the phone the the conversation quickly turned into a few different sound bites in my head number one he went on to tell me as I started to describe my company and really the product that I was that I was looking to launch it was really around no sweeteners and so you think about it now it was sort of a silly conversation for me to have with a coke exec especially 12 years ago because he was hearing me saying I live in San Francisco there's lots of people like me that don't want sweet and really want to drink water but aspire to drink water but they just can't get off of the sweeteners and so he continued to talk to me about how how I was wrong and how you know consumers really really like sweet and that the key thing was to get consumers to believe that it's not really about sweet but it's it's really about zero calories and I you know for a minute thought well I think you know he's wrong but instead I just let him talk and I left the competition continue to talk for a while and then I realized that he was really believing all of his and and basically I was so fortunate to be able to have this conversation with them and so I also realized that he was headed down one river and I was headed down the other river and that he had a lot more money than me and so I should just keep going down my river and paddle as fast as I can well he's got his big ship with lots of dollars going down that river and this leads me to point number three that these large companies and companies like you know the big soda companies that I go up against once they actually start to realize that you're a real threat and that you actually may have been right they'll be your biggest naysayers out there bill they'll do everything to basically try and undo everything that you're trying to do so everything from walking into you know large stores like Target or Walmart and throwing your product out in the garbage things like that that are you know really annoying but I think at the end of the day what they can't do is actually undo the problem that you're trying to solve and what I also realize is that the ship metaphor really goes along with these large companies because if they see that you're focused and actually trying to solve a problem for the consumer that it's very hard to turn that ship and especially if they're focused on something that is not actually solving a why and solving a problem but instead just believing their own stuff and again you see this over and over again in every single industry where you have great ideas great problems great problem solvers and the large companies when it's too late aren't having to try and figure out how do I turn the ship around so large companies you know such as Xerox and Kodak and lots of them that have been in my lifetime that have really tried to turn the ship around and have you know really had a tough time doing it and it's just been too late so I think that the key thing sorry to have to grab a grab some hands as I'm going along so other key lessons probably the fourth big lesson that I've learned the hard way is passion Trump's experience so I heard over and over again you came from the tech industry you're you know this little chicky out in San Francisco was during your thing out there and you know tech tech ignorant tech you know obnoxiousness whatever you know the saying was that that they came up with in the beverage industry so I started to believe it and I thought if I can just actually hire those people from the large soda companies then I'll actually be able to you know start my big company and really get the right distribution and really solve all of my problems and so my worst problem was actually hiring people that had gone so far down a path with one of these large companies because I spent more time undoing the way that they had been taught to think my best employees today are the ones who have been who have been passionate about a problem and have really identified that it is a problem so sugar and sweetener earth are the problem and if they in and people that really want to go up against these large companies are the ones that I found to be the best people in your company and often the people that really save you a lot of time because you bring these people in who thinks differently about things you can teach them in our industry how to sell beverages not that hard not that complicated it's really about just thinking differently and again going back to many of the other great entrepreneurs I think that they would say exactly the same thing that you want to hire people that are really thinking differently about things and are most passionate about about the problem and how you do it so I think it's just in closing I just I look at you know in building this company and sort of the position that I was in as an entrepreneur and and again going back to to kind of the why so often I talked to entrepreneurs and I asked them why did you actually go and start this company and if the reason is that they wanted to get out of working for the man or you know or not really being that excited about being inside of a large company then entrepreneur ISM might not be for you because it's a really hard thing right many of you are entrepreneurs out there and have started your companies it takes a lot of time it takes a lot of energy it takes a lot of chutzpah you have to conquer you know lots of things you have to raise lots of money in many cases so I think it's really it's just really a it's a tough road to go down but also if you can turn around in a few years from now and say that not that me and my team actually solve that problem and that there wouldn't be this company this there wouldn't be this category there wouldn't be this industry then I think that that's such a valuable thing to be able to say that you were a part of so thanks so much [Applause]

Jen Rubio is the co-founder of Away, a direct-to-consumer luggage startup with $11m in funding and over $10m in revenue that‚Äôs making luggage easy and fun to buy. Before starting Away, Jen acted as the Head of Social Media at Warby Parker, spearheading content and partnership efforts.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
let's give it up to Jen Rubio the founder and she's going to tell us their story the world is yours so what we're going to do is Jen and I are going to have a little conversation here where I'm going to ask some questions and I've actually asked some of you in the audience what you guys think and I've got a bunch of questions from everyone but uh we're just have a little bit of a conversation here let's start it off Jen what's interesting is that luggage isn't particularly a sexy industry to start in it is now it is now but it was it why why start a luggage company and why start there yeah so we started working on this in January of 2015 and we like to say we have a thoughtful luggage brand not a smart luggage brand and at the core of what we're doing is pretty simple we're a direct-to-consumer company that sells one product which are the rolling suitcases that you see here and when we started working on this it was a time when there was you know a lot of like everyone was making all of their home goods and objects smart you know there's like a big push in the internet of things and we just decide to take a step back and take a little bit of a different approach it basically started with my luggage broke and I was like asking my friends for recommendations and they're just like wasn't anything out there that anyone was really passionate about like you said it's just not really like a sexy thing to think about you know people love thinking about travel but they don't actually want to think about what they're packing there's stuff in and everything out there was either really like cheap and flimsy or super expensive and cost a thousand dollars for a suitcase if you've ever been in a luggage store probably looks something like this the luggage buying experience just completely sucked and we knew they're just like had to be a better way so what we did is we Dobin did a ton of consumer research like focus groups we just like sit in people's houses and watch them pack just really creepy now that I think about it but we really just got to the core of how people travel what their pain points are what they really need in a suitcase and that's how we came out with you know the one perfect suitcase for everyone everything you need nothing you don't and is last year we launched with really just one suitcase it just came in a carry-on size and four colors and it only had one like tech enabled feature which is a USB charger built into the bag to charge your devices while you're on the go and what's interesting what is interesting is that so you came from Warby Parker which they did something almost kind of similar where they took glasses which is incredibly sexy and they made the brand extremely sexy and really cool and everyone wants a pair of Warby Parker's luggage is the same thing it's pretty boring not a lot of people really like you don't exactly Instagram your new luggage but you guys have somehow managed to get people to give a about something that was typically so boring and people love this and so how did you don't get a lot of shits now so Shep how did you define your brand early on yeah so I mean I think you know context is everything we started out you know they start out with an idea for a luggage company but really early on we realized there's just a huge gap in the travel space you know everyone loves going on vacation taking trips but the actual companies involved in the travel space pretty much suck from a brand perspective whether it's like you know they just don't care about the experience and there's just a big gap for a brand that thinks and talks about travel and experiences the way we travel the way a lot of you people in the audience probably like to travel and who care more about experiences and things and readings and reviews and that's kind of how we thought about starting the company and we just we wanted to build a travel brand and we started with luggage and you know since we've launched we've kind of been called you know what is the holy grail of marketing buzzwords a lifestyle brand and it's because from day one we've really thought about context and storytelling if you think about other luggage companies out there they'll have imagery that's all about zippers and wheels and materials and doesn't give you any context on what this luggage is supposed to help you do better or what it enables you to do so from day one we wanted to take a different approach even if it was just starting with our first photo shoot and our imagery which you can see here there's also you know in terms of starting a lifestyle brand the first product we ever sold wasn't actually luggage it was this book so we knew back in November 2015 having work for direct to consumer brands and fashion brands that holiday was you know a big moment that we didn't want to miss the holidays were coming up we knew there are a lot of like big press moments we wanted to hit and they're just the luggage just wasn't ready you know we're working with our factory and they're making it as fast as they could but we didn't want to rush that process so we thought to ourselves how do we get in front of all these people how do we get into these gift guides that we know like would make a huge impact on our business and how do we do it without you know crowdfunding or we're doing pre-orders you know because we wanted to be a brand and not just like a one-hit product it very much wasn't part of our strategy it works for some people it's not something B wanted to do so we did what probably all of you would do in here we decided to write and publish our own book and we we hired a writer we interviewed 40 influencers and these were celebrities or household names that people at the top of their field in fashion and art in music in food interviewer interviewed them about you know about travel the book is called the places we've returned to we packaged it up and this beautiful gift set and we sold it for two hundred and twenty-five dollars and inside there was a gift card for our luggage that was set to launch in a few months so we're like okay this is either brilliant or just a really weird convoluted idea and definitely not going to work but that Christmas we were in over a hundred gift guides and all the top publications you know it was the perfect gift for every traveler in your life and we sold out of thousands of the books and gift cards in a few weeks before our luggage had even launched and speaking of starting out so to give everyone the full perspective here so you guys what we're around for about a year when you were tinkering with the idea and testing and then you raised the seed round like about 15 months ago and starting around that time I started noticing that you guys were in a ton of different outlets and you were a lot of journalists are writing about you can you talk more about how you're able to get all this press so early into the company yeah definitely it's just about you know I think having a great product isn't enough to keep the good press going I think we were really lucky we had really solid PR and press around our lodge but someone can only write about the suitcase ones before it gets really boring so once we kind of got in all the big publications we realized very quickly but you have to consider every single moment a storytelling moment so you know one example of that is a couple of months after we launched we started thinking about launching monogramming which is pretty standard offering when it comes to luggage you know just putting your initials on your bag and we're thinking about okay how do we make this a press moment so we hired three brooklyn-based artists who did all of their own like monogramming styles and for one month only we said that we were going to offer monograms hand-painted by these artists in our studio the New York Times wanted an exclusive on this story all the fashion magazines picked up on it and here we were I mean if you really think about the concept we did not we did not optimize for scalability or or operational ease you can just ask their office team who still hates me but we we optimized for the story and for something that people would talk about we actually tried to end this after a month but it was in such high demand from editors from influencers from customers that to this day we now have a hand-painted monogramming studio in New York with like a than artists just painting initials on bags all day long and that's just thinking about you know what are the features that you guys are putting out there and can you make it a bigger story around that can you make it more exciting it doesn't have to be something that that that you build out with your company as we did with monogramming but but it's definitely a big part of something that it gives people something to talk about another huge part of our growth has been collaboration so you know we're lucky travel the field where that spans across different industries and what we do is we look into each of these verticals that we want to hit who have who have people that we want to engage with and we find you know kind of the best people and the best companies to work with that have loyal engaged audiences this year these are a few collapse from the beginning of this year we launched a pink suitcase with Suki Waterhouse and papi Jaime's accessories line we did a suitcase for charity:water we launched one with made well just this week we did a yellow suitcase for Despicable Me 3 which was which is actually an inbound request from the studio because they'd seen all the other collaborations we've done and I think at the core of it you know it's great these collabs all of these collabs have sold out within a few days but what we really see is just to spread an awareness so even if someone's not going to buy a yellow suitcase or a pink suitcase they see the press people are talking about it and we actually see sales of our number-one products which is a navy carry-on go up when we launch these collaborations some other press-worthy moments we use a lot of data to find kind of these key business moments for our company so luggage is a big there's a big gifting moment in luggage for holidays for birthdays and we decided to capitalize on that in a really brand lead way so we actually now with an in-house editorial team for this Father's Day wrote another book got a lot of influential dads talking about their trips as fathers for the first time or with their fathers published it in the book we partnered with Harry's to provide a shave set for every piece of luggage purchase for Father's Day again tons of gift guides tons of press like big events like lots of mentions from influencers perfect Father's Day gift and its really capitalizing on those moments that that we know as a business work for us but but without we need to make a little more exciting for our consumers and then lastly on that and I think there's a lot of kind of big cultural events whether it's know South by Southwest Coachella this is from Art Basel in Miami and I think you know a lot of a lot of companies think that you need huge marketing budgets to go to those events and be relevant when we decided to go to Art Basel in Miami last year admittedly we didn't really have you know the experience or the connections or the budgets to come in and make a huge splash the way a traditional company would but we did know two things we knew that there would be cool people there and we knew that their phones would die so we built this bicycle charging station we parked it around you know kind of the best parties and people were talking about it and I was like a pretty low cost super effective way to get people talking about something it was more effective than just putting like a charger and a gift bag and way more effective than just throwing a big party with our logo on it but if you kind of take utility and then create a moment that's cool enough for people to talk about they will and basically if storytelling is what's driving you and your business and your activations it means that people were right about it people are right about your company your product your tactics yourself we've been lucky enough to be in hundreds and hundreds of top-tier publications in less than two years are a lot of our growth can be attributed to word-of-mouth and earn media and and you know and we don't take that for granted we know that if we just kind of stop what we're doing there really won't be anything to write about so it's just thinking about how can you make your company into something that people will want to talk about when they're when they're out to dinner with their friends and you didn't have a PR team for that did you we did so actually that was one of the biggest investments that we made early on we knew that even before we spent a dollar on like paid marketing we we knew that we wanted to find you know kind of great PR agency to partner with we drove our strategy in-house and kind of decided on what stories we would tell and then use a PR agency to seed those two they're kind of editor relationships and earlier you've actually mentioned it a few times but one example is earlier when you're talking about the book you're talking about influencers and I mean selling that many books and itself is a pretty cool feat and that came from getting people to share and getting influencers to help you guys out and I know that you'd still do that with the luggage so can you talk more about how you've been able to get people to share so much yeah I mean when you've done all of these things to kind of create a brand that people want to be associated with it organically creates brand ambassadors for you so kind of at a higher level we have tons of celebrities who have come to us inbound or have been seen with our luggage we also have celebrities who pay for their luggage and you know it's been seen on everyone from from Karlie Kloss to Adrien Brody Jessica Alba and I think something that we do is we look at who's actually using our luggage or who's asking for it and now we're thinking about you know now we're in talks with them to to think about ways we can partner and work together instead of what a lot of other brands do which is you know maybe throw some money at a celebrity to to walk around with your product when they don't really give a about it but I think the most important thing for us has really been kind of our customers and the other influencers be engagement he talked about this earlier but we've really created this culture in this community that loves to travel takes incredible photos and will photograph their luggage in in some pretty like unnatural situation like I think if you look at some of these things I just imagine whoever had take that picture probably had to take it a million times and then you know before they got the right one but you know 99% of our Instagram is user-generated which breeds more amazing content and we've actually seen the power of all of that influencer and customer content and have two full-time people on our team now dedicated to just building those relationships finding out when people are going on these cool trips making sure they have the latest luggage and getting content back from them so it's like a cycle that kind of continues to fulfill itself great well you guys have come a whole hell of a long way in 15 months now what's going to happen next 15 months or so um so we just wrote raised a 20 million dollars in our Series B funding so that's a total of little over 30 million that we breathe and one of the things we're going to do with that surprisingly to a lot of people is retail so last year we launched pop-ups as data points in New York London LA and Berlin and that gave us a real sense of how and where and why people want to interact with a way offline I think a lot of people mistake direct-to-consumer for online only but the the physical experience and the offline experience is a huge part of what we're doing even though our luggage is relatively affordable and has like a high high quality to price ratio it's something that people still want to see and feel and and more importantly they come to our store to interact with the brand we have events and workshops and classes and talks in all of our locations and this year we're opening an East Coast five Shakur West Coast flagship is in New York and LA as all stores in San Francisco Austin London we're also expanding into a lot of contents so right now we are just a one product company but because we've built this product in a really thoughtful way people are asking for more from away and want to want to hear more from us so last month we launched a podcast called airplane mode this this month we're launching here magazine which will be digital in print in every way suitcase in specialty stores there's a TV series in the works so I think people have come to trust us as a real travel brand and and are looking for more things for us in that sense pull any any final words you want to say to the audience uh yeah I mean these numbers I have been really humbling and really exciting and you know it's what you said the beginning over a hundred thousand suitcases sold 20 million sales this time last year we were like five or six people now we're almost 70 so we've actually hired more people since we made this slide last week but I think you know you need to be more than your product you need to focus on what your product can enable people to do we're not selling suits well we are selling suitcases a lot of them but we're selling travel and I think that's the most important part and people you know as we launch more products as we go into media and content I think that's you know at the core of it it's a company for travelers made by other travelers and our approach to building our brand is we we approach brand building the way you know luxury fashion houses do but we run our company like a lean tech startup and that coupled with like our obsession with the customer and the experience is what's really driven our growth so far well thank you for telling us the story yeah thank you thanks guys [Applause]

ladies and gentlemen Miguel McKelvey [Applause] morning that's a really huge picture I said I told people to never use that picture ever again because I've seen it so many times and I'm tired of looking at it but I guess no one got the memo um I'm super happy to be here this morning I don't know if I've ever spoken to a group this large but and in this beautiful of a place so it's an it's an awesome opportunity I the other part of this is that I don't normally prepare for these things I like to just come out and kind of like seems like Casey did just talk about the things that are on my mind but in this case these guys challenged me to say something that's actually meaningful and relevant to you guys so I've tried to put together something that that will have impact we'll see if it works out but um but there is a little bit organization which I'm not used to so a little bit about me I'm an entrepreneur from the early dot-com days I started my first company in 98 it was a social network for people learning English as a second language it still exists it's called English baby and and so really I came out at a time when when you know much like today where entrepreneurs are celebrated and while it's studied architecture in school there was kind of was a feeling that anyone could start a company no matter how smart or not smart or experienced or inexperienced you were and and I got a very early experience with starting something and going through the process of trying to create something from the ground up and I think that was an incredible opportunity to explore myself and figure out who I could be but it was also an amazing challenge because there was no mentorship there was no one to help there was no one with any instructions there was a time when you had to figure everything out for yourself and I've always remembered that and a lot of the spirit that that that that you had at that time is self it's you trying against the world in a way you trying to make something happen trying to bring something new to life and when we first started we work we felt like we could create an environment where we could remove some of that isolation where we could create an open place and a supportive place for people who wanted to do these things in the world and we believed that we would all be stronger together that if we were open to each other for interested in each other's journeys if we wanted to lend a hand and there was a forum in a community that would allow that to happen in a in an ongoing way whether it's you know through events like this or or just you know in an afternoon over a cup of coffee that creating that rich environment would be better for all of us so hopefully some of you guys have heard of we work hopefully some of you guys will actually hopefully all of you guys are members that would be awesome if you're not joined tomorrow best advice for any business of any size but we started about seven years ago and we've achieved some success so far we're in cities all over the world we have over 120,000 members I think you know one of the coolest things that we've achieved is we have United a community that is in China Korea Australia all over the US across Europe tel-aviv and now in South America coming soon in India and what we're finding is that people like you on people like us people who are connected to this idea of being creators of trying to bring new things to life that they're everywhere and it's a bomb that we share when we're at this place in our life where we want to take hold of our future and that bond is something that crosses all boundaries I think from political to cultural when you have that in yourself it's something that allows you to connect with others so we work is hopefully a platform for anyone who's in that position we've been lucky to bring people together in business context many different kinds of business we started with small entrepreneurs and startups but now we're working with some of the biggest companies in the world from you know big tech companies to banks etcetera and we're all trying to unite this same spirit of innovation and creativity and really just positivity for for this for these challenges that we're all facing so to get a little more specific about Who I am in the journey that I've been through to get where where I am now and really where we are now as a company I have a few sort of specific lessons and the first one is that my co-founder and I Adam are extraordinarily extremely different people I came to New York City from Oregon with an idea that I wanted to achieve something in the world I didn't know what it was but I felt like New York was the place to do it and one random after Saturday afternoon I met this guy who was brash Israeli who well I'm from Oregon and for those of you from the west coast especially from here you know we're like chill and like for the most part relaxed we have our own vibe and when I go to New York City I run into this guy who's like the exact opposite literally all energy all the time always hype always excited and and with tons of exuberance and really no fear whatsoever in any context willingness to do anything at any time and when I was exposed to him I had certainly a lot of discomfort but I also knew that well a lot of discomfort um but what I also knew is that there were things that he could do that I could never do I was clear from the start that there were there were things about him that especially in the business context there was no way I could do and one of those things certainly is sitting in front of a group of investors and asking for money at a 100 million valuation or five billion valuation ten billion you know now we're above that I knew I would never be that guy but I knew in him that he was he had a certain capability and so this profound difference was attractive to me but I also knew that it was going to be hard for us in a business partnership because we approach things from totally opposite ends of the spectrum and so one of the things when we decided to come together and form the company we knew this about each other we knew that we were going to approach things differently and so we agreed early on that we would always agree that we would we would always come to a decision where we would consider each other's perspective and we would not necessarily meet in the middle but we would make sure that we were both in a place where we're comfortable with the solution and what that did which was profound was that because we knew the other one would have to agree and we knew that we couldn't move forward until we agreed it meant that we were always thinking of the other's perspective before the other one even said it and so we would almost walk into the room offering each other the opposite person's perspective it's like we'd already thought through it so much that we'd already come to a resolution and so over the last really 10 years that we've been working together it's been almost always smooth sailing because we never we already had worked through it and come to a the right middle ground before and so I think that's an important thing especially when you're looking for a business partner a co-founder clothes executive team members one to look for people that are different than you that have different perspectives that are going to fulfill some of your deficiencies but then also create a structure that respects the fact that you're different and in our case you know create a structure that ensures that you're going to be able to move forward and so the lesson here is you know never leave a room without an agreement and and to add to that never let a conflict go beyond the conversation go beyond the moment because no one wants to carry negativity and and in conflict once you come to a decision you're willing to to live with it and move on so that therefore the business can - second thing which of course then you guys are engaged in the struggle you know it's hard and certainly when you're in the early stages of a company that there's people doing a lot of things on their own so you might have you know one founder one key team member totally responsible for an entire component of the business mad someone working on product and I have someone working on sales someone else on say finance or marketing or even two founders just three founders whatever it is split in half one one person doing this one person doing that and it's really hard sometimes to see the other person's perspective if you're not working on it if it's not your world and and for us one of the things that was challenging early on is that we've had you know the product side we had we're building out these buildings and we there we wanted to make them really cool we want a beautiful design we wanted the the best you know sofas you could get in our spaces but we also needed to build extremely fast a big part of our business model and the success of our model was to build quickly and to execute really quickly and so there was always this tension between how do we get the best product but how do we do it extremely quickly and how do we deliver the best experience to members how do we ensure that no matter what we open on the first of the month when they're going to move in and so we would have arguments about you know very specific things that affected that that that back and forth and what we found was the most important thing for us to solve that and to get through those challenges was to involve asthma involve each other in them more specifically and so for us the cool thing is that we have these openings you know well in the beginning every six or eight months and now we open anywhere from 10 to 15 buildings a month but but the opportunity there was to involve each other and involve the whole team in these openings and so you had people in every part of the company taking part whether that was painting walls whether that was you know making coffee the morning that members moved in whether it was taking the mugs out of the box and putting them on the shelves whether in some cases it was doing art projects painting murals but it allowed someone in who was working on Finance someone who was in legal to take part in this collective and it broke the silos between us it allowed us to understand each other better and to and to see each other in a different context than the normal day-to-day work environment so I think the lesson that's important is you can you can do better as a group when you know each other better when you experience each other emotionally in different in different ways and the best way to do that is to get everyone involved at some time so look for the challenges in your business where you can actually assemble a group and take it on together the third thing which this one was a funny one to remember was when we when we first started we were lucky enough to start we work with our own money for lack of a better term and we were brash we were pretty pretty confident ourselves and what we could accomplish and we did pretty well in the in the beginning our buildings were really successful members came in and joined us and the buildings were profitable you know in the way that they operated so we were confident in our model and and we were lucky to to get support from some early sort of angel investors and so one day we got a call or an email but anyway um so we get this this inquiry from this guy who says hey I'm with benchmark capital I was visiting one of your buildings today some of my portfolio companies were in your building and I was I really loved the environment you know are you guys looking for investment and we're like benchmark capital I don't know like we look at their website oh yeah a benchmark capital and like legendary VCS who have obviously now are supporting some of the best companies in the world but certainly their history you know they were one of the early supporters of eBay and made billions etc and so you know they invited us to come out and pitch to them and Adam and I we thought it was pretty cool to go to Silicon whatever it's called the the valley um and pitch but it wasn't like we didn't feel like we needed them we just thought it was a cool opportunity to pitch and go to Sand Hill Road and do that whole thing and and so we we made the pitch and apparently they liked us because shortly after they they they said they wanted to invest and we were thinking what's the valuation you know what are we what should we say and I think Brown number one hundred million sounded good but then you know just because we always want to push it we've said I think 110 is better you know 110 percent right that's what we should be aspiring for benchmark I think was more thinking like 70 million I don't know seventy five so we had some distance between us and there was a moment through the negotiation where we were you know we had been back in New York we kind of forgot how cool it was to sit in front of them and and we actually were considering you know if they're not going to agree with our 110 where maybe we just won't do it and because we felt so strong and so confident in our business we were confident in who we were and we also felt like we we impressed them so much of the fact that they wanted to invest at all meant we should stick to our guns and try to get the 110 and I remember the moment where Adam and I sat down and something came over me and I realized with all this ego and all this feeling that we should win this that we were probably missing what's really important and we're probably missing the fact that the value that benchmarks will provide as a partner is so much more important than this valuation and in that moment it was a total flip it was like we should indulge in this opportunity and think of it as something that's part of a much bigger picture and that this valuation when we get to where we want to go and where big as we want to be when we feel like we're taking on this global opportunity that this negotiation isn't going to matter and I think this was you know an 11 p.m. discussion that it really just switched everything I think we said yes we did actually not agree with their evaluation but I think we're a hundred million post-money which still pretty good for anybody who gets to 100 million valuation I think you would feel pretty successful but for us I think again thinking really big we always believed it was just a small step towards something much larger so my time is running out so I'm going to speak much faster actually I'm going to blame the microphone failure and take an extra minute but um one of the other things it's important you know especially at hustle common with this idea of hustle is that when you're an entrepreneur when you have this burning fire inside of you to accomplish something to solve a problem you know you you you have fuel you have something that probably is pushing you probably wake up in the morning feeling like you're going to change the world but you're going to make an impact that you're going to do something that means something to the world and that can be overwhelming both for you and for the people who are around you and for us Adam and I were both the people who had no off switch I mean Casey mentioned sleep I've been lucky enough to not sleep much for the past 20 years I think Adam is able to sleep intermittently depending on you know what what um what few minutes is is for kids and huge business allow him to find that that time to relax but but what we realized early on was that this unlimited energy that we had it was inspirational to the people who were around us and people followed us and loved to be a part of it but then a month two months three months into it they would come many of them would come and say my whole life is falling apart oftentimes in tears and because I'm the like West Coast chill dude they're mostly coming to me with that conversation so I would be you know in this position is saying you know I'm sorry I'm sorry this is so hard for you people would be saying I've sacrificed my entire life for this company you know I broke up with my boyfriend or girlfriend you know my relationship with my family I haven't seen anybody I haven't taken vacation that you know I'm I'm overwhelmed by this and what we realized is that no matter who we are as founders and for those of us who are true hustlers and may have that unlimited energy the culture of the company has to be healthy you have to start with a way to balance that you need it as part of who you are from the beginning you need to give people of diverse backgrounds of diverse you know family situations the opportunity to be their authentic selves in your context and so you need to figure out how to create that environment that's going to help them be successful and and it's something you should think about from day one what is the culture you're trying to establish and and how do you make the people on your team feel valued and valued as whole people as as their full selves not just for what they can contribute for business objectives and the last one and this one is I think simple but also important is that when Adam and I started we had done other things Adam had started other companies like I said I started one and I was working as a designer and architect and we started we work we felt like we had an opportunity to pursue our full potential you know when you're starting your company you can think of it as solving a problem and that's great if you can find a problem to solve and maybe you can create a company and then sell it okay there's something to that but a better aspiration for you would be create the company that best reflects who you are and what your capabilities are and what your potential is make it a forum for yourself to grow and change and evolve and learn because who gets to create their own job it's very few people in the world gets a form that their own work environment almost everybody works for somebody else but you start something you can make it the best place for you and if you think of it long-term you could imagine your journey being for life and so when we started we said this is a hundred year adventure we're also pursuing Life Extension so that way we can get to the hundred years but but for real from the start we felt like it was our last job and what that did was it said this is a journey this is not a destination we're not trying to raise a certain amount of money it's not about series ABC it's not about going public it's not about IPO it's not about exit that's never been part of our dialogue never and instead it's been who are we as people what's the path that we're on how are we growing and changing how are we evolving and how are we creating the context for us to be our best selves and then similarly for our team members as they join us and they become a part of this how do we make it the best place for them for them to find their path toward self-actualization for them to become their best selves in our context and that's truly one of the best aspirations you could have as an entrepreneur is to create a place where people are pursuing a great future for their for their selves for their families for their their being and for the world so thank you guys for having me and hopefully these five things are helpful oh I forgot we're opening in Auckland my team will tell me if I don't say that - coming I think in December so thanks guys

hi everybody how's it going um I flew in from France yesterday so I just want you guys to know that the time Zone's in my favor so I'm totally [ __ ] charged up right now uh I was super excited to come here because I I do as much public speaking as I can possibly do and it's always focused on different aspects of my career or Media or social media or technology or film or what have you but the reason why I was so excited about hustle con is cuz it's just about the hustle and the hustle is my favorite thing to talk about and I never really get to indulge in it so I want to sort of take you guys through a story of like my life my career how it landed to where I am right now with a really narrow focus on the hustle part um which is something I haven't haven't really really pulled apart yet so with that indulge me all right hustle where does it begin well I think if I go all the way back I I never really understood the hustle until I found something that was worth worth hustling for and what I mean by that is um I in High School literally this was like this was my goal when I was in high school and I would say this like out loud i' like tell this to my guidance counselors when I was in high school my goal was to maintain a straight D+ C minus average which was the bare minimum to graduate and when my guidance counselor would ask me that freshman year I explain that as frankly as I just explained it to you and she'd be like that's terrible and I'd be like not really into it but I'm here so just give me the diploma so I can get past this cuz I didn't care and I never did I never I never got that c minus D+ diploma I just um I ended up dropping out when I was for 15 years old I dropped out of high school and I I say that not to glorify dropping out of school um my kid Owen is a sophomore in college this year and he's a sophomore because he wants to be and he's a sophomore cuz he has to be but for me it was a very different situation like I had run away from home my girlfriend was pregnant we were like living in a trailer park had I had the option to finish school I would have finished school but I didn't but then I I started working and work then was very different from work now um and work then was was was tough and I I I spent between 45 and 60 hours a week which is how much time I spent working I spent 45 to 60 hours a week doing something I hated and I think like that window of time which was about three and a half four years of my life was the most instrumental part of my life it's a time in my life that I call like a phase of Arrested Development and what that means is no matter how much I grow no matter what success I find or happiness I find or struggles I have for the rest of my life I will never get past being that kid and that kid was like a six 16 to 19 to 20y Old like a that informative like 18 years and I worked in a restaurant scrubbing dishes for a living I had a whole bunch of bosses and a bunch of cooks in the restaurant that gave me a hard time and then at home I had a baby and I lived in a trailer park and barely had enough money to make it by and no matter what happens to me I like just got back from the south of France but even so when I think like who am I like what whenever I have the these moments of existential crisis that is what I identify with and that's what I identify with more than anything that's what affected me the most and it was like when I was a dishwasher when I scrubbed pots for a living I was the best [ __ ] dishwasher that restaurant ever had because that unlike high school that was the first time I understood the more hustle I poured into that job the more I got back and I remember like had a system I was the best dishwasher I had a system nobody could beat my system dishes were always clean I'd sit there on a SAT life like this the whole sink clear being like what that's all the dishes you got for me because I knew the harder I work like the more I'd get back and sure enough like before I left that kitchen to move to New York City to become a filmmaker before I left that kitchen I was a line cook I had like two promotions pretty big deal pretty big I was making salads but that that was where I understood really the value of of hustle and what hustle meant and it it was like the most Fair transaction ever you put a lot in and you get more out and that very rudimentary very fundamental understanding was something that I first tasted in the kitchen and it's something I've never ever ever let go of and to get a little personal a little bit weird right now cuz I feel like I know you guys been pretty generous with your laughing at my weak jokes so far one of my biggest frustrations in life when Candace and I are with the marriage counselor is I try to equate my work ethic to my my marriage or relationship ethic and I'm like I just don't understand I work so hard for this marriage why isn't it yielding dividends and both my wife and our marriage therapist looks at us and like the [ __ ] is wrong with this guy um so I moved to New York City and I I I moved to New York City at had 800 bucks to my name no high school diploma the only work experience I had was in the back of a kitchen and not even a great kitchen and the hustle in New York City really sucks it's super easy and fun to romanticize um especially now but the reality of those days was absolutely miserable it was like you know my apartment then I had a futon in my bedroom and it was the bedroom was so small I couldn't lay the futon flat I had to sleep on a futon that was upright which wasn't a big deal but I also had a 2-year-old at the time I shared bathroom in the hallway of my building which is like particularly it always kept you it always kept you humble in the most literal way possible when you have to like take a leak in the middle of the night so you like put on your shoes and you walk down the hall like it's a college dorm room or summer camp but instead of being sharing it with your campmates or your dorm mates you're sharing it with like people who just got out of prison and sort of like undocumented immigrant it was a gnarly gnarly situ uation and in the meantime I had a job that barely barely barely paid me as a bike messenger um you know like this is 2001 so you paid for your cell phone by minutes I don't know if anybody remembers those horrible days like couldn't take a call till 8:00 when your minutes were unlimited but like I'd get all my bike messenger assignments on my phone and I remember at the end of the first month as a bike messenger my bill was like exactly $40 more than my income for the entire so I was like cost me like $10 a week to be a bike messenger it's a pretty shitty job um and and then like how I got my first real job working for an artist in in New York City was an artist who made sculptures his name was Tom Sachs he made sculptures out of all kinds of things one of his favorite materials were those police line do not cross barriers the wooden ones and a friend of a friend told me he's like this cool famous artist and he has a bounty of $10 per barricade I was like [ __ ] those things are all over the city free money so the next day I wheeled into his office like 25 of them and he offered he was like you want a job and I was like yeah I want it's exactly what I want is a job and I started working for him and that was a pretty that was tough as well it was it was a super super challenging job um where I was kind of a nobody I paid 10 bucks an hour to work in a warehouse and cut cardboard squares out of slightly larger cardboard squares um not a super challenging job but a lot of work but the hustle really began there because I was able to look around in New York City this foreign place and all I saw were people who were really doing everything they could to chase down what it was they wanted the magic of New York City is that no one at least no one I'm exposed to lives in lower Manhattan because they have to it's only people who live there because they want to and they pour that want into their hustle because otherwise you just get chased out of that it's so hard there there's no relaxation there's no comfortable life you can have in New York City doing something you don't really love you either chasing after it or you're leaving it and it was after I started working for him that I was able to feel that for the first time um and the hustle went in a million different directions and I remember uh I would work from for him from 10: to 6:00 p.m. and then after 600 p.m. I would like sneak around his office filming stuff with my camera with my big brother and then we'd go edit little videos about our job and then one day he he of accidentally saw those videos and he was like you made these and like yeah and he was like I thought I was about to be fired he was like this is all I want you doing from now on is making these videos I was like okay cool sounds great really good at making videos and that ultimately led to one of his art collectors a very fancy very very like distinguished looking guy who like kind of person you make eye contact at and look away cuz you don't want him to see you cuz you're scared um and this guy saw the videos was like hey will you make a birthday video for my husband and I was like birthday videos are my specialty and funny you should ask because I'm looking at this guy and I'm like sh I don't know what birthday video is mean to him but whatever he wants I'm sure I can do it well and this was like really the first time that van and I my brother and I got paid to do something with a camera um I mean working for the artists we were getting 10 bucks an hour to make little city silly videos we didn't really understand what they could have been or what they were but this was like a real transaction he was like how much money and I was like let me get back to you on that and then we were like what the [ __ ] do we charge this guy and in any event when we were like yeah let's make the birthday video he was like here's a list of people that we want to have in the video wishing Freddy my husband a happy birthday and the first was like former President Bill Clinton and I was like okay it's going to be a birthday video um just a quick digression there were like 20 people of very serious stature in that I mean like heads of companies his husband Fred hawber was a huge politician was in the Clinton Administration was in the Obama Administration huge big deal of a guy I didn't know that then I know that now Freddy's a friend of mine but when we went to interview the President Bill Clinton um I had a really funny joke that I was excited about having the president deliver and we went in there and it's like I mean I look like a bum now you should have seen what I look like back then when I was an actual bum and I just remember Secret Service being like talking to the Handler being like yeah we can't let these [ __ ] guys in here what who are these people and we finally get l in and we like sit down in the conference room and the woman comes in and she's like okay the president will be right out this is going to be 30 seconds and this is what he's going to say and that's it and I was like I had this joke and she's like so we like we waited and waited and like 5 minutes 10 minutes went by then left us alone in that room and I'm looking at the teleprompter setup and I'm like God this is such a lame shot I start messing with the teleprompter and I realize it's just kind of like like like a Microsoft Word like text document kind of thing so I just like control Al and whole thing shut down and literally as that happened in walk Secret Service like full on like doors slam open stand back like this and then in walks the president and I'm like whoa and and he sits down and he's like you know he's Bill Clinton he's like the king of cool and he sits down and he looks into the telepromter and he's like all right I'm ready and then the woman's like okay Mr President right into the camera in the teleprompter just a second Mr President and I was like and I go over to the president and I was like Mr President and as I'm approaching him like like literally like this the um Secret Service is like and I was like Mr President I had this funny joke and he was like all right boys I love that and I hit record he delivers the joke and then we stop recording pack up the cameras and the woman's like I almost got it Mr President we got it we were out so the video was like when we played the birthday video it was very well received um and then that was kind of the beginning of of bigger things like because we showed that to a room full of people that were like you know important we other people started asking like who are these guys that make that video how the hell did they get Bill Clinton to say that um and we were given kind of other opportunities and that very art collector was like I'd love to do something with you guys and we're like great we have this art series we'd love to do and he gave us he gave us hundreds of dollars to bankroll that art project which was which was a series of short videos that van and I wanted to make and literally we used Mr Wizard's world's book of experiments to do at home as our um script and we shot them in the bedroom of my uh of my apartment just up against the wall and we called it science experiments and we did that couldn't afford sets we couldn't afford a lot of footage we couldn't afford anything but we had these little interesting stories that we we shaped around science experiments and then when that same art collector saw that video he's like this is going to stop traffic this is incredible and we started pushing it around we had an art collector in Miami who showed it at Miami art bosel while there the the chief curator whose name I literally remember jacopo vasanti he saw that he was a chief curator of the souo by anual the biggest art show in Brazil the national art show of Brazil he invited us to show those movies science experiments at the national art show of Brazil I was like 23 at the time and I was like it was it was a huge honor all of a sudden my brother van I are sort of catapulted out as like fine artists all of the sudden um funny story on our way to the South Pao banial we were stuck in traffic because there was this gigantic traffic jam to get to that art show I know it's a bit of a Reit but when the guy told us that our movies would stop traffic in some some version of that well we were stuck in traffic trying to go see our movie so it kind kind of counts and and all of a sudden like we got back to New York and it's it's like this is where the hustle comes in it was like wo I'm this huge deal I'm the youngest invited artist ever to go to this national art show in Brazil on this gigantic like I wore a suit I was special and I get back to New York City and it's like oh my rent is 1,00 bucks a month I still can't quite figure out how to make that I still have a day job so I can't do and the reality is of the hustle that unromantic part that that is so easy to gloss over when telling fun stories of being this young artist and getting to do these wonderful things that was omnipresent it never faded it never went away I still struggled every week to come up with 110 bucks which is how much a roundtrip train ticket cost to Connecticut where my kid Owen was was going to school and I would like stay in the Attic of my dad's coffee shop there an attic that was so unfinished I stapled tablecloths to like the the the beams in there to sort of make it feel like a room for the kid and me and we slept in the same bed that those are the two sides of the very same coin literally one week I'm in sou Paulo and like being celebrated on this big deal in giving interviews and doing all this and then the very next week I'm asleep in the Attic of a coffee shop with my with a baby and that's like to me there was that that is the struggle that is the hustle that is the looking at that and saying well what are the priorities here what do I want here and and to talk more generally about the idea of hustling it's like you know I'm super old now I'm 36 some people laugh and everybody else's like damn damn um but there's a few isms or a few truths that I've learned and it's like the beauty of Hustle the beauty of work is it will truly like never let you down and I always say the guaranteed recipe for success is to dedicate your entire life to something and you will one of two things will happen it's it's it's absolute this is objective this is not an opinion you'll either achieve that something or you will have died trying and either one of those they're kind of the same thing I mean obviously one's slightly better than the other but it's a guaranteed path to ensuring a kind of focus on on what you want and you know one of my favorite movies um is a documentary about a rock band called Anvil and I've talked about this in the Vlog before and actually the band got in touch with me after making that which is pretty awesome but this story um and I'm digressing now but this story is a much better example of what the hustle and the commitment means than my own story but in the movie they're like this rock band that almost made it big hair band almost made it in the 80s but they never actually made it and then they show them now and these guys are living in Canada the lead singer delivers trays of food to uh grammar schools like a really 400 a.m. to 7 a.m. kind of job barely makes enough money to eat he's this 55-year-old kind of haggard looking guy who who still every weekend puts on like his leather like chaps like rockers in the 80s and goes and plays in a in a bar to like six people five people the kind of thing where it's like you cringe watching this because you feel so bad for this guy and they interview him and he's like he's like I won't give up my dream he's like I'm a rock star and I'm going to figure this out and you watch it and you're like there's no way on planet Earth that this guy's ever going to make it no one will ever want to watch a Haggard old dead broke guy in his 50s who's all wrinkled who's singing music that hasn't been hit for 30 years no one will ever there's no path to success for this guy his family shuns him everybody shuts him down but he will he refuses to give up on this dream that's his dream refuses to give and then what happens this movie comes comes out [ __ ] great movie like wins all the awards and everything and because this movie is so huge the demand to see his band play goes through the roof and all of a sudden he's now selling out shows all around the world because of a movie about how he wouldn't let go of his dream like how you could never how something like that could happen but it is a testament to what never giving up means so back to 2006 which is about where I'm at you know I was given an opportunity by an entrepreneur named Tom Scott he's an entrepreneur who started a juice company and sold that he started a TV network and and now he's running this whole other thing he's a Serial entrepreneur he's one of the very few people in this world that I would refer to in genuine sincerity as a mentor of mine and I met him and I was young and and he loved what my brother van and I did and we did some fun things for his little TV network and he gave us a big opportunity and he said let's do something big and that something big ended up manifesting as uh the HBO show my brother van and I did and that was the experience of making that was amazing but the experience of selling that to HBO was an even more amazing experience I was 28 at the time we sold it to HBO for over $2 million it was this huge achievement there was like a thing in variety about HBO buying our show I I made it I had made it I was a big [ __ ] deal like my home newspaper wrote about it and my teachers in high school had to read about it I had made it um don't Applause that cuz this is this is this is the story of what happens when you let go of that hustle and they bought the show in 2008 and for the first time ever I kind of took a big step back I was like okay well I've got money now I've got success I've got everything I need now and it was the first time ever that I sort of lean back um and I lean back cuz I didn't have to I didn't have to pay rent on my trailer anymore like I was good and I just chilled out and I have to say like those couple of years were the most depressing time in my entire life 2008 2010 I didn't make anything I didn't do anything the HBO show was caught up in all kinds of bureaucracy it took two years for that to be put on the air and when that show was on the air there was this moment this very this Vivid visceral moment for me in 2010 and it was the same week that I was in Los Angeles and uh the movie that I had produced a feature film that I had produced One independent Spirit award and I was like on stage on TV receiving this award my parents saw it and at the same time I had an HBO show that was premiering every Friday night in HBO it was the Pinnacle of what I had thought was success and I was miserable I was miserable because instead of hustling instead of fighting instead of chasing down what it was that I was into I was sort of Basking in the sunlight I was like taking a warm shower and the water running over me was like look what I did I'm so I did it I'm good good and I was miserable um I was miserable I lost touch of what it was that I was so passionate about I lost touch of what the hustle was about for me and that was when I kind of stopped everything that was when I went back to the drawing board and that was when I decided to start really focusing on YouTube YouTube to me at the time was the most pure form of hustle um I was a guy who like to share ideas and perspectives using moving images using video and YouTube ensured it wasn't about the politics of HBO and that article in variety it was it was it was certainly not about standing on a stage and winning an award among BigTime celebrities it wasn't about telling my parents and my teachers in high school look what I did it was just about me busting my ass for the craft where nobody was watching nobody was paying attention nobody was making me do that only I chose to click upload um and that to me was was sort of the phase two the 2.0 of my career was when I really invested myself in YouTube and that led me to all kinds of places 3 years later and you know 150 million views on YouTube later I had carved out a career for myself that wasn't the career I built in my brother it wasn't the career from YouTube it wasn't a career from HBO rather it wasn't a career in feature films it was something that was mine and it was based purely on that hustle which meant the world to me and around that time 2013 is when I was invited to go to MIT um it was a fellowship that was a joint program between the Rockefeller Foundation that paid for it the Massachusetts Institute of Technology media lab which put it on which sponsored it um and and then the Sundance Institute which sort of chose candidates for it and they chose me and I remember at the time one thinking what going to MIT would mean for me as a high school dropout um and I needed that just so my dad would have something else to talk about um but it also meant shutting down my company it also meant dropping everything and moving to Cambridge leaving a wife who was new and Pregnant and it was a gigantic risk but this was sort of in success I think the first major crossroads for me um and it it forced me to reset it forced me to go back to that like what is it that I want what am I willing to do to chase down what it is that excites me in life and I did it and I I dropped everything I shut down my company and took big risk and went back to to school and I spent a semester at MIT working out of the media lab when I left there I left there with this big fat new understanding which is what happens in the world of technology um I'd only ever understood media and it was because of that that I was like [ __ ] it I'm starting a tech company I can do this I've never written a line a code in my life but I think I've got some good ideas and I can find people who can write code and that was beam and you know Beam for me was the greatest departure because it was the only thing that had not even a a semblance of a relationship to what i' been doing and building my entire career around it was purely about technology it wasn't about media and leaning into personalities and other facets that I would say describe my career in media um and I think the more interesting part about beam the part that I've talked about a lot less is what happened a year and a half into beam you know we raised several million dollars we had a big team we had a bunch of success at the beginning because of of the way that I I was able to leverage my footprint in the social space and bring a lot of people to this exciting idea the idea that the um the product itself didn't quite deliver on but a year and a half in we were just about out of money um we weren't growing at a rate where made it easy for us to raise money and it was sort of like what now what do you do now um and I made a decision then which my lead investor did support although most people on YouTube didn't really understand which was like we had just enough money to pay our bills and pay payroll at beam and Matt and I were having to make a decision what do we do out and I came up with this great idea and I was like why don't we take the entire team on vacation and Matt was like that kind of makes sense and I was like it totally makes sense so we did we went on this big vacation we all literally went to the Dominican Republic and like sat in the Sun for a week and that sounds crazy and stupid but what came from that was this understanding like the most valuable thing we have is this team because we we work together so well we love each other we make incredible products I like okay we got this team what else do we have got this great show that I called a vlog about what we're doing here like there's a lot here there's a lot here that's beyond this one product that didn't make it there's so much here and it was that enthusiasm that was yielded from that trip that sort of made me go back out there and rethink what it was that we had what the value Prospect was on this company um and that ultimately manifested into the the sale to CNN and that's sort of where I I leave this talk and where I leave us now which is that for the first time in a really long time I'm standing at the bottom of a mountain that's probably bigger than any other Mountain I've ever looked up at trying to figure out what the [ __ ] to do um I I mean it CNN just bought my company all of a sudden we have tremendous resources we have an unbelievable team we have all the resources from Turner and above and we have all these eyeballs looking at us saying what are you going to do now and when I look at it and try to figure out how to build yet how to build a really successful company and how to build it under such scrutiny um I don't entirely know I don't entirely know how to do it but I know what the number one most important ingredient is in making it happen and that ingredient is the hustle so that feels like it's like a really full cirer kind of way to end this talk right here so I'm just going to stop there um but that's where I am now and I think we're doing questions but I wanted to thank you guys for coming and hanging out hey Casey yeah I had like I was going to show you guys videos but they're on YouTube and I was so excited to talk to an audience about the hustle I kind of that's cool though right they can always use their phones you know you can always use your phones you know okay so we had a handful of great questions from the Facebook group I'm going to go ahead and pick uh one or two because we only have a few minutes uh but Casey one question that came up a bunch is how do you manage to do everything you're doing with a family cuz you've had a child from very early on uh now you uh have a wife and a and a two two young kids sure um you know people used to ask especially when I was really struggling and had a baby at home like how do you do it with a kid and my response has always been I can do this because I have a kid um you know I as much of a crazy egomaniac narcissist as I am it's like you need a reason in life to do things and for me I don't I don't know what else could drive me if it wasn't for having somebody else to do all of this for um and that's kind of the role that my family plays pragmatically how do I do it yeah so another question that got uploaded a bunch was how do you organize all your projects which is quite similar though to how you manage your time with your family I mean the time management thing is real it's hard um I mean what it literally manifests as it's like I leave for work every day at 10: which is after Francine is off on her day to school and I'm home every day before 6 o' and she goes to bed at 8:00 and then I'm working from 88: until midnight and I work from 4:00 a.m. until 7:00 a.m. when she wakes up so it's really just uh it's a it's a prioritization and then also you know I don't party I don't really drink I don't I don't socialize um I say this in Jess but I mean it like I don't hang out with friends I don't really know if I have any friends so you're saying you you do all this with three hours of sleep well I my recipe for sleep is like I need 3 to five to function but I can only do that for like four or 5 days in a row and then I need like last night like a solid just 8 hours of sleep and I'm good but yeah sleep is a sleep's a [ __ ] huge sleep and the wind are my two biggest arch nemesis in this world all right we have just a a minute or two left uh one question was that I think is is super interesting is what piece of content that that have you created that you're most proud of I mean that the stuff that I'm most proud of is anything involving the family um because it becomes a little portrait of my life that I'll always be able to look back at when I think of the first year of making the blog before it got so big it got really scary and I had to stop putting my baby in it cuz I was scared of all kinds of realities but when I look back at those early days of the Vlog and I see like what was my burining family then like that's incredibly valuable to me um any particular videos that they can search I mean yeah I would say look at the one called a love story it's about how Candace and I got married like I watch that and no matter how much we're fighting I'm like oh I do like her and last question uh what's been the biggest failure so far for you sure the biggest failure was um was celebrating success was the biggest failure I think the biggest takeaway from that is like with each new success with each new with every success should come a bigger more ambitious goal and I think it it took a real couple years of what I would Define as describe as failure to be able to appreciate that anything uh left you want to say I mean sure can you reset the clock I'll go another 30 minutes no we've got about uh 10 seconds no I I I I just want to thank you and you know we were talking backstage before I came out and I was just saying how infrequent it is to get to speak to an audience that is as as sort of well informed as engaged and as as is as focused as I've understood this audience to be um and I just say that like the thing about the hustle is that so few people are are actually willing to do it so few people are willing to put in what it takes that every time you see somebody drop off or take the safe fruit or do something that is a huge compromise because it's less risky that's just one less person that you'll have to climb over on your way to the top and never forget that thank you

hello everyone that was awesome come get around applause forestry complete because I'm gonna forget at the end thank you to hustle Co and to all of you guys for being here surround applause for yourselves it's really important to tell the stories of women in technology to help women stay in technology and also to encourage girls to be in technology as well and they're just armed enough stories about women in this sector or if you see stories about women in this sector it's mostly about how they're not there how they're absent so I admire all of you for coming to this event and hustle close or putting this event on I think it's super important so now I'm going to attempt to share my story and the hopes that it inspires you guys in may and may not if you want to applaud at any moment to give me a little confidence boost that would be great I am typically when I'm speaking publicly it's to a lot of dudes and hoodies on computers with headphones on looking at their laptops this is obviously a different crowd than that I've heard there are a lot of ladies in the house right so I'm gonna try and we'll see how it goes but this is definitely like a cooler crowd than I'm used to so I'll share my story with you guys and as a kid um yeah I'm going all the way back to childhood this one as a kid I was one of those kids who tried everything and quit everything so piano guitar soccer swimming xylophone which I hated selling shoes I sold shoes I was actually really good at that but I put that to social media marketing I think all of us have probably done that at some point in our careers I tried everything but nothing really inspired me and I quit like I was a quitter I was a super lame person and honestly it took me twenty six years to discover what my passion was I know what's shocking because I look like I'm 19 years old but I'm not and honestly when I did it kind of came out of nowhere and was totally random once she'd done I need a trophy for everything so yeah so it happened when I was working as a philanthropy consultant I was working with high profile and high net-worth individuals and nonprofits and foundations doing glamorous things such as filing IRS paperwork which were all about to do that sucks yeah I did that auctioning off gently used clothes to benefit kids with disabilities you know all kinds of really cool stuff like that and I really loved it I loved working with nonprofits and getting back and being in the philanthropy scene but despite the fact that I was doing that I still you know just I didn't feel that like I'm like nothing was pushing me to continue and I could see it in others around me I was working with activists and people who founded nonprofits and founded social enterprises and done all these campaigns and and I was inspired by them and I wanted that like I really wanted that and I was happy to you know work with them and kind of you know fold clothes or do whatever I was doing for them but you know I didn't feel it and that's what I wanted so that's what I'm going to talk to you guys about today is how I found that thing I know a sort of reanimate unexpected okay when I had the opportunity to work on a global campaign called shine for change which was founded by Gucci this outfit is not sponsored by Gucci that's I actually ran out bought this today because the girl who runs our PR for a company said you need to wear long sleeves and I was like okay I gotta go buy something with long sleeves so yeah so trifle change is really awesome campaign founded by Gucci in the fashion house focused on empowering girls and women through education health and justice and they tasked us with finding a way to leverage technology to address tough issues including domestic violence child marriage universal access to primary education for girls female genital mutilation women's health care and more obviously there's not an app for that and there never will be but what we eventually put together was a hackathon yes we convinced Gucci and worked with them to put together a hackathon and that brought together hundreds of women and men developers from both sides to build technology solutions for nonprofits like UN Women by the voices UNICEF and more I honestly have no idea how to run a hackathon I was just like this is gonna be really cool and we're gonna do it I spent a lot of time googling what is a hackathon and I made a bunch of giant complicated spreadsheets which is you know as women do and what resulted honestly blew my mind it was a room full of people men and women who were creating really awesome technology for really hard problems I mean like you know female genital mutilation is not not something that's easy to talk about or even build technology to solve and they were building this technology that could have a real impact in just one weekend and when I was working in philanthropy I was working on these projects that would take months if not years to see any impact that we're talking millions of dollars being funneled into things and not you know kind of hoping it was gonna work and so to see something built in one weekend was really inspiring to me one example was you know a fully working solution that was a mobile health services delivery kind of dumb phone thing for women in rural Africa and lots of other cool things and I actually found myself sobbing at the end of the hackathon which actually is you know if anyone on my team is here which I think they are somewhere I can't see you guys I typically cried every hackathon now just because I'm so moved by yeah I do I really do like we actually just did have gone with Procter and Gamble for Febreze and I I cried at the end even though it's just about really awesome smells because I just but like I really inspired by the fact that people spend their time to build something cool that they're passionate about that could become you know the next big business or the next big nonprofit that could have an impact and you know I'm always moved by when people have that passion and that dedication and they want to do more so yeah so here I am I'm sobbing at the end of the hackathon and needless to say I was totally hooked and I just I didn't you know I knew the hacker was gonna be cool it was Gucci good she's really awesome you know it was with Twitter women who code bunch of cool organizations but I felt that immediately even though the hackathon I was like all right I have to do more to do more of this I need more of this giving more of this so fast forward two years and I basically hunted down a company that ran hackathons and that's when I started working at Angel hack I just realize I forgot I forgot my names up there that's good so I work for a company called angel hack and my job basically was my dream job figuring out how to integrate social impact into every aspect of Angel hacks work they run about 100 hackathons a year in 44 countries across the globe so it's like sweet this is great you know one of the cool things they did was we created a global code for impact challenge that garnered 53 projects in 50 different cities all over the world and we did pro bono sponsorships for nonprofits and it was awesome but same thing at the end of the charm pack hackathon I was like I kind of feel like I can do more like I feel like I can do more what else can I do and that's you know that's how I knew I was on to something on to my passion like that feeling of like as soon as you accomplish something great you're like but wait there's probably more probably more I can do so I started looking at everything else I was like what more can I do you know like so one thing I noticed and I talked about this a little bit earlier was the average attendance at hackathon for women is under 20% so you know I knew we could improve that I mean for any of you they do have fun it's basically a bro fest and the irony is that angel talks the majority female owned and operated company so I was like yeah um so so yeah so we were like how can we improve this so we did a bunch of stuff one of them was you know having gifts in our newsletters that weren't all white dudes that was a pretty easy one you know what other one was partnering organizations like girls in tech their CEO is here she's a badass she's gonna talk shortly after me and we improved our female tenants by four percent in just four months something there's a lot of big tech companies take years to achieve but for me that's just same thing you know it's like yeah good job you got more women it's like not enough so we decided to design an entire hackathon series around this called lady problems yeah yeah so that was super awesome to try to sell that to sponsors and big nonprofits and honestly I was doubting myself I had a lot of people tell me no I found myself with a on a phone call with a leading executives and a fortune 500 company trying to avoid saying the word period to me but explaining you couldn't call something lady problems cuz no one all ten an event that's around that time of the month yeah don't slack and I'm like you knees periods after hearing no and that was a bad idea so many times I was honestly frustrated and confused and I doubted myself and that little kid that like kind of quit everything was like crawling up inside being like it's time to quit but I was lucky when my internal voice was muted I had champions around me pushing me to do more so our CEO who's female would she said you know I said hey I think we're gonna do like three to five events and I said let's do 15 to 20 and she said lefty fifteen twenty at least we can do more I was like okay fine of course my boss is making me do more than I want to do our VP of Sales said hey like you know screw these people who are saying you can't do it I can sell it and she went out and sold it we had people like Procter & Gamble Amazon HPE women who code a bunch of organizations jumped on board I'm the result so I thought this is gonna be like one or two women in tech hackathons we did 17 2000 people sign up for an event some lady problems 60% of them were female our goal was 50% so that was pretty cool we increased by 40% overall in terms of female attendants in Delhi India where we typically see just three percent women code or hackathons that's right three percent we had 20 percent women turnout and the team life and then in Gaza actually is where we had our highest female turnout of eighty three percent women and got yeah so I'm kind of out of time and I have ten more pages so I'm just kidding but yeah so you know that's all great and good and got a lot of women to come this event but I still think that we can do more and so we are gonna accelerate all the wedding teams coming out of those hackathons from Gaza and Nairobi London Berlin San Francisco you know everywhere and because I can't pass up this opportunity for shameless self-promotion if you want to support any of those teams come talk to me please don't talk to me tomorrow because I'm going on strike you take away it's you know you discover your passion when you're constantly pushing yourself to do more I know that's a tiger mom thing to say but as a former quitter you know you've found it when you think you can do more so that's it thank you [Applause]

[Applause] hi my name is Meredith Davis and I'm so unbelievably excited and honored to be speaking amongst all these amazing empowering females I'm going to take you on my journey tonight and my journey has been a little unconventional it starts from lugging around a suitcase full of vibrators [Applause] to becoming the League's first employee and the one thing that you'll hear me talk about a lot tonight is my passions and my mission and my mission has really been the driving force in my career and has really led me to where I am today which is that I want to bring a voice to sex dating and relationship relationships and that mission initially drove me to Indiana University where I created my own major in human sexuality I studied at the world-renowned Kinsey Institute and I did Sex research for four years I researched topics such as women's arousal to what increases and decreases pleasure and orgasms it was amazing why wouldn't it be but while I was there I realized that while I loved studying sex I actually hated research and so I yeah it wasn't that fun I'm too much of an extrovert to be sitting in a research lab so I thought to myself okay it's second semester of senior year and I need to figure out what I'm going to do with my life so I thought about my mission and I started to think about all the different career paths that I could go into that would align with that mission so I'm having this conversation to myself and I'm thinking all right here we go OBGYN uh-uhm not taking that MCAT all right stripper you know I'm just I'm a really bad dancer but what about about sex toys huh yeah sex toys I could do that so fast forward to after graduation and I landed a job at a high-end luxury sex toy manufacturer based here in San Francisco the company's mission was to enhance relationships and bring pleasure to the people awesome it was amazing and it totally aligned with my own missions and my own passions I was Unstoppable not even TSA could stop me when they let me tell you do not travel with vibrators every time I was at the airport I was frisked because I was carrying a huge oversized carryon full of lithium ion batteries and vibrators woo unfortunately soon after I started this new job the company went through a major acquisition and was purchased by a company that when you walk into that dirty grimy sex toy store and you see those phallic looking products on the wall That's the company that acquired mine and so all of a sudden all the managers and execs those who I was reporting according to we're now misogynistic uneducated and sitting on billions of dollars from the porn industry all of a sudden my mission of bringing pleasure to the people was now totally different and all of a sudden I felt really unsafe in my work environment I was now being asked to unbutton my shirt when I was at client meetings and I was asked to sit on vendor laps all of a sudden I was walking down a career path that felt really scary and uh what I'm about to say I actually have never said uh in public I have a lot of co-workers and a lot of friends in the crowd who don't even know this part of my story because the truth is I've been really ashamed and embarrassed about it but I do think it's unbelievably important in as shaped who I am today so I went to the CEO oo and I really wanted to talk to him about how uncomfortable I Was Not only was he dismissive but he fired me so here I am in San Francisco one of the most expensive cities in the world I had no money I had just been fired and the only thing that I had was a huge oversized bag full of dildos so I started to think to myself well I've hit my rock bottom but sometimes hitting rock bottom is not a bad place to start so I started thinking again about my mission my mission of bringing a voice to sex dating and relationships and then I realized I am in the headquarters of every possible tech company you could ever dream of all right so how do I Bridge the gap between sex and Tech dating apps all right so now I just needed to research so I started researching all the different dating apps out there Tinder you know what mayor I know you have higher standards than that we all should have higher standards than that but what about the league hm founded by Amanda Bradford former Salesforce googler Stamford MBA AKA an alpha female badass creating a platform where High achieving individuals could seek out the other part of their power couple Perfect all right so I needed an intro I go on LinkedIn zero connections so what is an unemployed gal too try to guess what her email is a bradfordthe league.com Amanda the league.com amanda. Bradford at the.com how could I possibly figure out which one was the right email I didn't I simply emailed every single possible combination I could think of hoping that at one point one would go through finally I got a response that wasn't a bounceback hi Meredith thank you so much for your email unfortunately we're not hiring right now sincerely Amanda Bradford hi Amanda thank you so so so much for your email I'm attaching my resume below I would really love the chance to talk to you I believe that the League's Mission very much aligns with my own best Meredith hi Meredith thanks again really love your enthusiasm unfortunately we're not hiring get back to us in 6 months to a year hi Amanda I am now attaching every single reference that I could possibly think of Cu I would love to talk to you all right Meredith why don't you come in for 15 minutes well what can I say my persistence paid off and I sure landed that one month contract to higher position two years later and I'm still here and I've seen a lot in my two years and I've been a part of growing the company and a part of that has been a lot of hiring decisions I've seen the company grow from one to eight employees eight back down to three 3 to 20 and the one thing that I will ask any perspective higher is what is your passion or what is your mission because I've seen a lot of people come and go from the league but the ones who are able to handle the rockiness of a startup are those whose personal missions and values align with ours you know I was talking to Amanda the other day and we were talking and she asked me what how would you get off of a deserted island and we're laughing and talking about it and she looks at me and says you know what Meredith you would build a boat but it would not be a pretty boat in fact it would have holes in it we may even sink and you probably would forget to to build the ores but to work at a startup you don't need to necessarily know how to build a boat but you got to believe that you got to get yourself off that island and so that's something that we look at when we're hiring is people who are Scrappy people who will execute and people who will do anything that needs to be done in order to promote the League's missions and passions and you know sometimes it's not always pretty and the water is not always Rocky or not always clear uh some days I'm having to run QA tests and some days are not fun and I'm having to pull data other days I am trying to hire a tarot card reader or a sword swallower for a party that we're hosting but I am constantly reminding myself that I am on the greater path of promoting the League's missions in creating power couples and enhancing relationships and you know doing this for other people and helping others in growing their relationships has definitely affected my personal relationships I can't deny that my dating life has taken a hit I mean thank God I have all those dildos still but but I'm constantly reminding myself that my personal missions in bringing a voice to sex dating and relationships align with the leagues and so if you're to take away anything tonight take away the fact that you should not that you should follow your passions and that sometimes hitting rock bottom is not always a bad place to be and don't play it safe and don't play it conventional and if you play play with a clear purpose and Mission so write down what you're passionate about and follow that mission of yours and don't ever lose sight of it because that mission is going to be the most important thing in order for you to follow your careers thank you

hi is this great volume through field gun I can't see any of you really directly so affair with me firstly I am so excited to get to be here I was told this event is 75 percent women my glance at your very dark spaces suggests that maybe it's even more so I'm Erin I founded a company called Clara labs Clara is an intelligent assistant that helps do menial work that you would otherwise have to manage on your own and we are very very big on empowering women tomorrow's International Women's Day encourage your company be content they'll be awesome so as I was preparing for the talk today I was trying to think about the things in my life that had brought me to you guys in the first place right I'm 25 when I was 20 I did not have some perfect vision or perfect path that told me that on this day and time in the future I would be giving a talk about my company that builds in artificial intelligence that you can talk with that was not really in the cards for me so I wanted to tell you a story that could have wind back to when I was 20 and the the narrative that has brought me to all of the successes and happinesses that I that I have had as of yet when I was 20 I got an internship I spent a summer in New York City and I'm from Texas I was you know studying psychology and neuroscience and young great hook em horns for any of you who went to UC and getting to spend a summer in New York with this kind of dream I had over the course of the past several years to fallen in love with the idea of building technology of being a technologist coming from a humanities background coming from really loving people the idea that you could build things that people would work with every day just really I fell in love with head over heels I started to see human beings as technologists right to create all these theories about teacher and I became convinced outside of knowing any venture capitalist at all that the way that I was supposed to become a technologist was might be coming up in sure capitalist right to be there in the weed they had this whole vision in the trenches with the founders building this company is going to be so great and so in my time in New York I was lucky enough to build a relationship with one venture capitalist a man named Charlie O'Donnell who founded a fund called Brooklyn British ventures and the last day that I was in New York were getting coffee and I told him Charlie you know I'm very smart I have lots of great qualities of I very interested in being a venture capitalist out of undergrad kado Ikeda's and his response to me was like marin there are only perhaps two people a year who become the seeds out of undergrad you just don't have a big enough network to be valuable to a venture firm to which I reanima kind of immediately here and I'm walking away and getting into the subway thinking okay Charlie didn't just tell me no he just told me that in the next nine months I need to somehow build a big enough network of people such that I am valuable to a venture capital firm I ended up founding a community called interact you're welcome to go to join interact calm if you're curious about it of a hundred young technology that come together every year and meet and build relationships with each other because they like me often haven't built big networks of people who help them see their dreams through and who connect them to their next opportunities connect them to the has been the careers in the life that they're that they are aspiring to and the impact that they're aspiring to it was an unbelievably challenging community to build the first person who rejected me after Charlie approximately 20 minutes later right as I got in the subway having thought about this was my best friend Michael Italian right I call him I'm like we're going to bring 100 people too often it's going to be the best they're all going to South by brain get badges for everybody we're going to host everybody 100 people in Austin South by Southwest will be really easy well you know six or seven events super super chill he was just like marrying this idea is stupid this is never working I think though back to that first weekend and to having been able to build that first community of people and the number of nodes that it took to get to to get to that moment to get to that group of people how absolutely spectacular and impressive every single one of them was and how much they've all changed my life and how much that community has changed each other's lives and the things that I remember of course is that by that point in time I was no longer actually interested in being a venture capitalist right my my path and my ambition had changed I went on to get a lot of jobs to work in venture but having built interact having gotten all the nodes having read $50,000 in sponsorship having thought that I was going to have to take out a $20,000 personal loan having promised a million things to a million people and really carrying all that weight I became convinced that the thing that I wanted to do was to build something myself and that I had the capacity to to do that and so my dream changed right my dream change in a really big way and I subsequently ended up sounding not just Clara but another company that's already failed lots of failures behind me oh so I think the things I wanted to share with you guys is much better said by a woman that I loved named Maya Angelou now I'm going to directly quote her and not watch it she says you may encounter many defeats but you must not be defeated in fact it may be necessary to encounter the defeats so you can know who you are what you can rise from and how you can still come out of it if there's anything that I could do and having talked to all these awesome women who are very smart and very articulate backstage before this if there's anything that I think any of us could encourage you to do it and encourage ourselves to do and remind ourselves of it would be to remind you to take your dreams just desperately seriously and to take your your lives very seriously I think that it is a gift to get to find something that matters enough to you that it's worth rejection right something that is a vision that you have to see through such that you are excited about being told no hundreds of times because I think that those visions right those things that we want to hear know for that we accept the news for are the things that make us each have come alive and I think that that's just one of the greatest gifts that we get to have as people and one of the things that we should share and encourage in each other so celebrate International Women's Day tomorrow remember Maya Angelou if you ever if you ever need support and please just if there's something that you want and you're told no don't think that you have to know the perfect path to the thing that you're trying to get you don't you just have to know that you care enough about some that no is an accessible answer in most cases not all [Applause]

everyone Oni house yeah I'm big mentoring I don't know how to speak can be so thank you for that hello this is Lou I'm LuAnn the founding partner of nutrient capital I'm so glad to be here to share my story with you so I was born and raised in China that's a nice big mentoring and also I'm not from the big cities you know me heard about for Dan how Shanghai Beijing can do no I actually from a place called Inner Mongolia it's an independent province in the northern China it's kind of similar province to get back so we have our own president in this province they also have lots of different minority nationality lives there and I actually belong to one of the minority nationality when I think back when I stopped back I can realize my parents was the first generation of entrepreneurs in China they was working very big government-owned corporations at that time all the corporations good one owned by the government but they quit their job they want to do something by themselves so young couple decreed are very good job leave the in among living the Mongolia and went to a big city next to Beijing starter for start-up at that time we don't call we start out with our small business but looking back yeah they also start up but unfortunately they cook out she could not get a VC funding they could only like sell their house get along and the really good thing working so I really looked up to them and also when I look at look back I kind of feel like I inherited the personality from my birth parents that I would be a risk taker that's also the reason after I graduate from my college I decided to come to United States from my graduate school so I came to Stanford continued started engineering that's also the starting point that luckily I got this opportunity to interact with the whole innovation ecosystem here in the valley I was was engineering school majoring in mature sense engineering and I put lots of automakers as engineering here we are we have a saying that I met so many like mature scientists in the VC industry and the risk that always good and bad which means it's really hard to find a good academia research direction this build the omnibus conductorette has become venture capitalists so I was majoring in her science so I did lots of research during that field I did research in nano zinc film bowel sensor even they show my own battery doctor is I don't like Tesla battery so luckily I wonder my patent technology got supported from University so just encourage me maybe you could do a start-up by yourself to me that was brand new although there are so many undergrads and graduate student at Stanford from engineering school they did start off the job hop and they saw something really cool but as a Chinese I still grew up from a pretty traditional family although I choose some different jobs but I don't know whether it's a right way to go to to at such a young age to start my company but that mentioned earlier I was a risk taker I feel excited when there's a futurist and huge opportunity from so I took it I started my company I was thinking how hard would it be turned out to be super hard I was super super hard not only because it's a startup company also because I was working on one level so has application by diabetes diagnostic so I was working on medical device company I don't know whether we have founder here working in healthcare industry or running a medical device company to me was super hard not only the product and technology that's a product because we had to a hundred percent no problem the problem is and was the immigrant that the first year second year I came to United States and I was dealing with this most complicated system in United States which is health care we have mutual company they have Big Pharma medical device company they also have disappeared esse FDA approval process so I have to start not only Rendon company also kind of refresh myself try to learn all these new things every day do with lots of like this very experience at the a regulator and that I made lots of mistakes and luckily I kind of make them up and pushing forward and the company work the product work and that was a miserable time frame that I went through with us that many years and but unluckily yeah I got off from back after I graduate from Stanford I also got my company acquired a biotech medical device company although I had a dementia had a major a time when running my company because so much of work and also I got lots of challenge a Detroit are challenged every day I think I really don't have time to question myself whether I I could do it because I don't have time when I will come I don't have to gasping then that's a that's a life but when I sold my company I feel feel a little bit sad because it's not your baby no matter is a good baby is a beautiful baby is a naughty baby it's okay so for so much is your baby not American sitting so now when I become a VC Eliza when I talk about founder when they got an offer for finding that company I kind of understand wedding it's really hard for them to let it go so it was a really really interesting experience so after that I I start to I also want to give myself a break so I went to a large corporation borrowing semiconductor companies doing poor dumb marketing meanwhile I also got the opportunity to become a venture partner at the Silicon Valley VC firm doing emerging technology girls a late-stage investment ironically will now with the founder I hate VC I really don't like we see I think yes I got them could visit the poor me meanwhile also met couple of likely means many superman' receiving interact with my presentation they challenged my gender my age they also try to make her micromanagement my company so I think them but and but I become one of them hello so when I start doing my investment I originally I want to try to use this opportunity and platform to to see different things I think I did a lot of things with my company doesn't like us at the technology area I was at I also use this opportunity I want you I want you to use that opportunity to see different innovation in different category and along the way I also kind of make me because now at that time I start cooking the VC having to myself I start thinking from the VC perspective and I gradually feel I can do appreciate all the basic gave me hard time when I first got a company because they sell me stop me from like going to the wrong direction and also the keep challenge me make me become better the kind of feel is okay if I'm gonna continue doing this job because there's a way that I could become an entrepreneur family receives it specially because I have this experience as a firm enterpreneur so I don't I know their language I know their the company's life cycle I know there is no perfect startup I know every day's mission is still with problems so I see PwC health under deal with their problem and also try to be the go-to person within your health and then I found out maybe during this stage is hard because they stages capital where you have to fight against tough with partners sometimes with founder sometime to afford for the only interest so in 2014 I got this good opportunity from the other capital support so I start my own VC firm Eugene capital so that's a starting point that I really could do a firm and also build up a team based on the same mission and same personality and also same momentum that we really want to help founder at early stage so far we have 38 popular company under investment and up and our management right now and I remember three years ago after I become VC run my own firm there's after another sell from New York came over to Vida to do a interview for me and he told me a number which kind of surprised me a lot of it he said oh the ratio female partner in VC industry is only like six percent I think now grow up a little bit not to seven percent and then it's a huge job so since then I'll start thinking about among my life I always kind of got used to be the non special one that the fewer small percent of the community like I choose to start engineering when most girls coming hard to do literature accounting in China and I decided to come to the United States and decide to continue doing a startup company very few female founder that's a reason when I heard organizer told me most of them most of the audience today are females and I was so happy so happy to see so many female founder here and when I start working on the VC I feel same thing I got this racial number so when I look back I just have lots of very interesting stories relate to this for example when I went to Japan to have a meeting with our customer I have the team reported me locally but I found I'm the only female in the room and they don't feel comfortable I was there they just pretend I'm a shadow and they talk to each other and that they'd want to bypass me and when I went to the big semiconductor company Europe and I told them oh I want to go to retro and he said ah let me ask the front desk lady and then I found out I only have one restroom in the first floor of this five-star rich beauty and I remember i after i become the VCI always coming invitation to speak at a conference become the speaker our panelists it was so interesting that there was a panel the module retracts at first you master how do you think about the trend of Technology second one how do you help company was like uber type of business model the third one Oh like how to think about the IPO of snapchat like potential IPO of snapchat and to me how do you balance your life and the work I'm like I'm not only one half the balance has to have the work-life balance but let's say that that's a few times we have for for female special young female no matter its entrepreneur investor you have to balance your life but there's normally for fund investor to balance your life when you're running a company where we're helping with the startup company so I kind of start thinking like how I could better handle debt I do not do it very well when I first started I kind of gradually for them I try to hide my age I don't want to people know that I'm only 28 I want you to think I'm older I try to dress like like a semi gender things like let them know you're that okay I'm a female but along the way I think it is actually not work and I should not work and I remember that fear will stop because interval to me and the journalist asked me how do you handle your time I think May 1908 very well but and what I'm going to do in the future is I won't try to argue with anyone have a CEO type because they won't work I will do something I will get thing than to prove them wrong and also to myself as I realize that I don't need to care about your time because some people do you still type as a label to recognize the word and the community they don't really have the bad intention for people really have the bad intention no matter what you do out talk to them they may change very little but why should I care that's their problem not mine so why should I do something for other problems other than just be myself by starting myself I just realized I'm not just making all the decision and to other work based on what I want who I want to be and things I want to follow so that color is I'm so glad to see so many female founder here today the housing other who is increase the ratio of female BC we need more female founders and when you get a big asset please join us and join the VIP industry that get more percentage of the female we see in this industry and look for to that thank you [Applause]

hello so tonight I'm gonna share with you the founding story of TaskRabbit and some of you may feel like you've heard the story before but I'm gonna tell you the story behind the story the true story of how I found a TaskRabbit it started on a cold winter night in Boston was February of 2008 Boston I remember Miss February because it was snowing outside and it was really cold and my husband and I were sitting in our kitchen and we were getting ready to go out to dinner so he had called a cab to pick us up take us across town note that I said cab not an uber or lyft this is 2008 people and the cab is on its way when we realized we were out of dog food at the time we had this hundred pound yellow lab named Kobe who we kept very well fed and we thought oh no how are we gonna get this dog food are we really gonna have the cab stop on the way to the restaurant are we gonna drag the dog food with us the restaurant on what if all the stores are closed on the way home why is this such a big problem it's dog food it should be simple and that way the conversation turned into wouldn't it be nice if there was just a place online we could go say we need a dog food name the price who are willing to pay we're certain there was probably someone online that could help us out maybe someone in the neighborhood maybe someone who is at the store at that very second why couldn't we just connect with them so my husband's also in technology so we always had these very geeky conversations in the house and I grabbed my iPhone at the it had just come out four months earlier this is the dark ages you know no one was really using location-based awareness yet in their apps no one was building on mobile no one is building on the iPhone there was no App Store no one was using the social graph social networking Facebook was just coming out of the college scene but how was an engineer and I worked at IBM for eight years and I love technology and my husband Kevin was the same way and so I became really passionate and really excited that evening about what if we mashed up these technologies you know that the iPhone and mobile and location and social and what if we were able to connect real people in the real world to get real things done like is that kind of insane and so I grabbed my phone and I said all right such a site existed what would it be called and at the time the first thing that came to mind was run my errand and the domain was available domains are never available so I bought the domain name for $6.99 and on the spot that night 20 minutes later I hated the name but I thought you know what maybe maybe I should see if there's something here before I obsess over the name so the the cab came to pick us up and I gave Kobe lots of extra treats and threw him some some chicken I think we had in the fridge so he didn't starve that night but um over margaritas and Mexican food we've sort of started talking about this idea that evolved into TaskRabbit that was a pretty crazy magnet because by the end of the by then at that dinner we're meeting a bunch of friends we had a business plan for business plan for TaskRabbit and someone vomited in myself too so it was like one of those just like crazy nights right but we woke up the next morning and we're like hey do you remember that idea we had like my domain name but I bought run my own life do we really think that's still a thing and even in the light of day the following decade it seemed like a good idea so four months later I quit my job at IBM to build the first version of the site and get it launched in Boston now that's the family the story for TaskRabbit but how do they actually found TaskRabbit I believe that ideas are not inventions I believe they're discoveries and I think our job as an entrepreneur is to be able to discover those ideas because they're all around us they're like air we breathe them in we breathe them out and we have to be able to uncover them so the real story about family TaskRabbit isn't that I came up with this idea sure there's this moment of inspiration Kobe was out of dog food one night in the timing was great because these technologies were coming into play and I thought about how we could mash him up together but really it came down to how was i training myself to think entrepreneurially at that time the truth is is that leading up to that night leading up to that moment of inspiration I had been obsessing for months about leaving my job at IBM I was kind of bored and I was thinking there's got to be other things that I could be doing I was already starting to think entrepreneurially and I was in a certain mindset and I think as I look back that was the key if I hadn't been in that entrepreneurial mindset when that moment of the inspiration hit when we were out of dog food I never discovered the idea for TaskRabbit one of my friends Adam grant has this amazing book called originals Feliz some of you have read it if not I highly recommend it's awesome and in it he describes this concept of a day now Lucia day is the opposite of deja vu so you know deja vu is when you see something for the first time but you feel like you've seen it before like you've been there before can be explained as a simple glitch in the matrix but boota boota de is the opposite of that it's when you've seen something a thousand times and you're able to take a step back and look at it differently and that's what I did that night when we were out of dog food I confess it was not the first time we had run out of dog food for a portico be delinquent doggy parents now I have two children and I promise you they eat every single day but it was really about how do i how did I get into that entrepreneur mindset and I was actually talking with Adam about this exact things I said you know what I just that concept in your book really resonated with me because I felt like that being out of dog food that inspiration that night that was a vuja de moment and he's like yeah but how did you get into that moment how did you why did your brain lead you there and so I took a step back and I thought about it and I said you know what the truth is is for months I had been thinking about different ideas and trying to look at the world differently and not going on autopilot sometimes it's so easy to just go through your life on autopilot you have your routines you hit challenges you kind of move through them but if you can take a step back and you can slow yourself down that's when you can really start to see things differently now for me getting into this entrepreneurial mindset felt a little bit awkward at first I mean I was I was going through you know normal things everyday but stopping and talking incessantly about them and asking my husband Kevin what he thought you know it can feel really awkward but if you can force yourself to get there and I think it can be a really really powerful thing you can take the ordinary and turn it into something extraordinary so how did I take this idea for TaskRabbit and raise my first round of funding and turn it into you know where we are today well I had the idea quit my job at IBM build the first version of the siding got it launched in Boston now what it's September of 2008 the stock market is crashing very tough economic time worse time to be raising money by the way I didn't even know how to raise money at the time but I got accepted into an incubator program and that brought me out here to the Bay Area called FB fund and it was run by Facebook and dave McClure before he did 500 startups started this incubator and so I was flying back and forth between Boston and San Francisco a week in Boston a week in San Francisco completely bootstrapping the company on my own and I flew to Boston and had just spent the week in San Francisco and got an email from Dave saying hey we have a special guest come into the office on Monday this is Friday his name is Tim Ferriss and he's willing to meet with companies that are here yes oh man I just flew back from San Francisco and I'm in Boston and I'm supposed to spend this week in Boston and actually this company is live in Boston there's no one else but me like running this thing right now so I go online and I look at plane tickets and I see that it's like 750 dollars to get a ticket back out to San Francisco that's Sunday night and be there for Monday and I emailed Dave and I was like hey I'm not supposed to be in town but this sounds really exciting you know how much time are we gonna have with Tim he's like you have 15 minutes 15 minutes with him okay so $750 15 minutes with Tim Ferriss like is this really worth it like I'm this is going on my credit card um I don't know if I should do this or not but I thought you know what if I can turn $750 into the million dollar seed ruined that I'm with hoping to raise then it'll be worth it and that was my threshold I was like anything less than that is not worth it and simple I bought the plane ticket I got on the plane I flew to San Francisco met with Tim for 15 minutes that Monday and I said all right my goal is to get him on as an advisor because I think he could really help us and his book the 4-hour workweek had just come out and he writes all about living efficiently and TaskRabbit is like the perfect thing that fits in his portfolio and so I thought in 15 minutes I'm not going to convince him to come on as an advisor but I could definitely get a second meeting so that's my goal and 15 minutes just get a second meeting so walking to the Facebook office you know get the meeting with Tim sit down with him start showing him at the time it was still actually run my errand calm showed him aside and you know it's like 10 minutes 11 minutes 12 minutes he's talking and I'm like oh my god it's almost 15 minutes and I haven't been able to ask you for a sec meeting yet and so gets to 15 minutes and I was like you know what um this has been so helpful you know can we meet again would you be willing to spend more time with me and he's sort of hesitated because he's like saw the crazy look in my eye you know what you can email my admin and she'll set something up so walked out of the room and immediately you know email this admin and she said you know what Tim actually you know can do a call with you next week and I Sai called me in a phone call I just met him in person like I feel like I'm better in person and I've got to turn this plane ticket into a million dollar seed round how am I gonna do this and so I said you know what I'm gonna be in San Francisco at that time in the neighborhood ended up meeting Tim in person over lunch we've really hit it off and at the end of that lunch he agreed to come on as an advisor and he is the one that introduced me to an Morocco from floodgate fun to lead our 1 million dollar seed round but I made it happen and I think for me the biggest takeaways from that first year of discovering TaskRabbit and raising that money was ideas are everywhere I needed to be in the right mindset to find that idea and then just willing your way forward willing things to happen there was no way I was gonna let that plane ticket not turn in to that seed round of funding thank you [Applause]

hello how's everyone doing tonight wo so I love this new format because when they called me to ask me to participate they said I want you to tell a story and I'm like oh my God I get to tell a story and not a PowerPoint this is so awesome so I'm going to tell a very personal story uh one that's very meaningful to me and one that um actually taught me a lot in life um so it's all about immigration so who in this room is an immigrant or born from foreign parents immigrant parents awesome that's I think that looks like 75% of the room so that's that's awesome um I too am born from immigrant parents my mother is Mexican and Japanese but born and raised in Mexico City Viva Latinos and uh my my dad is is French American born and raised in Los Angeles in East LA so this story specifically is about my mother who is my role model my rock just my Force she's taught me so much in my life time and I think this story is worth sharing as a result so my mom and my dad met in Bangkok Thailand of all places my dad was leaving the Navy uh after 4 years and he was station in okanawa Japan and my mother uh was traveling to Japan for the first time in her life she was one of 12 in her family six boys six girls and she was the first one to be able to save up enough money to go visit her family in Japan so she actually got to meet her cousins and her her grandparents and everything so she was the lucky one of the 12 so she was 19 years old a very young 19 and she went with two of her girlfriends to not only Japan but Singapore and Thailand and in Thailand at the princess palace in in Bangkok she met my father and my father went up to her and said buenos di senorita without knowing anything other than those words she's like who's this strange man in uniform you know approaching me and he says I I have to see you again like I can't not live my life knowing that I didn't try to see you again so my mom was like well I'm in this little tour group and it was a very official tour group the one with the little flags and he's like I don't give a I'm going to go find you wherever you are and he was he showed up at her hotel and my mom is my mom is very conservative and she's like okay well if we go out you have to take my two friends too so my dad like the poor guy coming from the Navy had like $20 to his name really spent his last $20 on these on these ladies um but he didn't care he said I just wanted to be around he wanted to be around my mom and get to know her better so he said before he left uh um I will have three packages waiting for you in Mexico City and a letter and on this day they will arrive and on that day they did arrive and my mom was like okay this guy's serious I think he likes me and and he ended up going to Mexico City a month later and just trying to get a job with his very little Spanish and just wooing wooing my mom and and he couldn't find a job so he went back to LA but he's like I miss her too much so we went back three months later and try it again and actually started meeting the family which is a big deal in Mexican families and and um cut two 6 months later and they get married so he's accepted into the family very surprising given that my dad my grandpa is a Shinto priest Japanese like doesn't you know didn't want her to marry um someone from another race which is a little bit ironic uh but um the things that my mom learned when she came to the United States she spoke very little little English and uh she was taking a lot of risks coming to the United States without her family without her loved ones without a job with a man that she only knew for six months I mean this is a stranger really and she was also 19 okay I mean I'm like that that's a crazy decision knowing that in ret um so she she said I knew that this was the right thing for me I really wanted to take this risk uh um he was a man of integrity he is a man of integrity and and so she moved and again learning Spanish really trying to sorry learning English really trying to um understand uh um the language and learn the language fast so she could get a job and she did get a job she was working at um she got a job working for Mexicana Airlines which is no longer in existence and she was working at their corporate offices and she did well and she was there for 15 years and she said this is sort of a piece of cake like I can actually run my own travel agency easy um so she did she opened up her travel agency and um it was in Southern California and then she opened up a couple different offices started getting huge groups clients that would come to her groups of of people uh people that would come back and put groups uh travel packages together and things like that and she did really really well she made a lot of dough and she actually ended up making more money than my father who worked at the Walt Disney Company and ended up putting my sister and I through college and my sister went to UC Berkeley I went to UC Davis so and um so having a role model like my mother who sacrificed so much emotionally financially physically to come to this country and be resilient be boot bootstrap be Scrappy um not take no for an answer uh just yes I know I can do it I know I can build this business I know I can make money I know I can make a living uh she taught me so much and this whole point of um being a startup entrepreneur going out and finding your passion and purpose and building a company has a deep connection and correlation to being an immigrant right I mean you have to be Scrappy 51% of the uh it's 51% of the most um um successful startups I think it's the billion the US dollar million dollar startups are actually um built by immigrants so that's a really amazing stat and yeah and um the the the the resiliency Factor the fact that she was always saying you know you can do it you can follow your dreams you know we had it really difficult but here you have resources you have a community you have people to to answer your questions you have advisors you you know you have really great educational institutions and organizations to support what you're doing it's like you you really don't have an excuse right um so I think that's what she taught me is just really really be be Scrappy um you can do anything that you put your mind to because there's people out there that have a lot harder than we do and you know just think think like an immigrant be like an immigrant because I think in the end you'll be very very successful uh and resilient and be able to accomplish your dreams thank you

all right guys when you think of venture capitalists what do you think of well they went to Stanford they're Engineers they have big networks what else they were Patagonia they like K surfing and they're typically old white male well hi I'm shuy Gandhi I started aray Ventures I went to to a no-name school I moved to this country without any network um from India and um the whole reason I started R Ventures was to invest in awesome Founders that that do um deep you know that sorry that give me a big Applause here I need some energy thank you I've never done this before so please stay with me um so I invest in Founders awesome entrepreneurs who solve problems in AI ML and um big data so I want to step back and tell you how I did this this is my dream come true I don't usually talk to a lot of people I talk to a lot of Founders one-on-one so again um I would love your cheers once in a while I'm Shameless um so let me tell you a story in 2010 I decided to start a company I was in Chicago uh the company was called pensive it was is based on Harry Potter where where Dumbledore picks out his memory and puts it in a bowl called pensive so har can looked through his past that's what my company did it looked through your social past to help you make better Connections in the future sounds like a good idea to me right we all face his problems and I thought it was really important for someone to solve this at the same time a lot of Founders were solving this problem and they were raising a lot of money I on the other hand with my co-founder both of us technical um couldn't raise a penny mind you I went to a top engineering school for Columbia for my masters in computer science that's where I met my co-founder and I went to business school at y Chicago again my South Asian Community would love these degrees and and and Brands and so forth but it wasn't relevant VCS weren't biting it I could not raise a penny and I was frustrated I it cut deep I took it very personally so that is when I was drinking one day with my friends yeah um that's what we all do when we're all frustrated so I was drinking one day with my friends and I said let's reverse engineer this VC thing I'm going to figure out what do VCS look for in Founders when they're investing in companies well right like what's the best way to tackle this if you can't beat them join them so that's what I did I went in um basically worked for free for anyone who would you know hire me in VC I did research and you know thesis you know all the stuff I could do to just kind of beg for a job someone hired me and you know what I was actually good at it early on I raised um well sorry early on I was able to invest in companies that were able to kind of get acquired by Apple McGraw Hill Samsung and some other companies are now still alive and and raising series D and so forth from Southbank and other big funds yeah so I I was getting some validation there the other thing I learned was um back to my company was VC's love investing and creating patterns as we all know the pattern recognition that VC's talk about I did not fit that pattern is what I learned and you know why because I did not look like what they look like and that is when I decided again drinking with my friends that I was going to change and break that pattern I am going to create a fund that invests in people like me which is when in 2015 aray Ventures was born and since then I've invested in 15 companies um I'll be investing in 15 more again in the Enterprise space in AI ml Big Data space so if you want to raise m money please reach out to me on Twitter aty Shameless as I said um you learn the hard way so that's when I decided to um raise my fund but now that's when it brings me to this how the am I going to do this sorry for the S so I had no clue and investors in funds are not like investors in in companies they do not want to be found there is no database if there is a database it's you pay a lot of money for it I was not going to do that I didn't have money so that's when I said what am I going to do to make this work and I went back to my roots of just going out and reaching to as many people who could help me and had remotely anything to do with raising a fund and you know what when I reached out to them they gave me their time and advice and you know what I didn't take that lightly I think thank them I thank them with knowledge Network you know insights anything I could to really help them out so that's when they noticed me they believed in me they introduced me to some of their other friends and you know what I think that was that was the beginning people started to know my name I started creating a reputation they started saying that there's you know they started believing in me because I was beli believing in myself um isn't there a friend phrase that says that uh the the universe conspires to those who dream so that's what happened when I put my intent out there people started to help me out and then early enough a lot of people started to express interest in investing in the fund to take a step back I still didn't know what I was doing and so I was nervous and I didn't know if I should even take them seriously so I didn't I continued on what I knew how to do best at the time which is go talk to more people drink more coffee I continued to do that for a while until one day one day I ran out of Runway and I said you know what I have to test this I have to see if people really are serious about what they say so then I went to my lawyers um and I triggered an event when people who uh were expressing interest in me I started to um I had kept them lukewarm I started to send them paperwork I said guys guys here it is I'm ready to go and most of them converted to my surprise delightful surprise again and then not only did they convert they actually brought their friends in that's how investing works when someone likes you they want to talk to their friends about it they want to talk at cocktail parties about it and they invested in me that is how aray Ventures was born and I have to say that I'm still in shock that I'm here today sharing my story with all of you hopefully it's inspiring but if I were to give an advice to my younger self I would say two things be determined and don't stop dreaming thank you

awesome how's everyone doing tonight cool I'm excited to be here with you so today I'm going to tell all of you a little bit about a story of how I started my journey in entrepreneurship um I'll back up give a little backstory so I grew up in Scottsdale Arizona yeah and growing up I was always fascinated in technology my dad worked at IBM and one day brought home a computer for my brother and I and said you know here's a computer we're going to put this over here in the computer room you can use the computer for 30 minutes a day and the older I got those 30 minutes turned into an hour a day and then turned into a few hours on the weekend and I became obsessed with that computer more specifically I became obsessed with what I could do inside of that computer I was really interested in all the video games that my brother was playing and then I said you know why don't we go and create our own video game so my brother who's 2 years older than me we would sit down on the weekend and we would learn how to code and we would just go to Google and I don't know if any of you remember w3schools.com but it taught us how to it taught us what HTML was what CSS was what was JavaScript we started just teaching ourselves little by little once I graduated from high school my brother and I went to our parents and we said you know we've been learning a lot about technology and we think that this whole coding thing is really really cool we want to take the summer in between my high school and and first college year to go and start her own business my dad came back and my dad again being a very traditional guy who climbed the corporate ladder said if you kids want to go start a business you need to move out of the house and learn how to be financially independent so me at 18 years old was like all right I don't know how I'm going to do this but I've got savings saved up from birthdays and from chores and all this other stuff and my brother said I've also got savings saved up from birthdays and chores and all this other stuff growing up so we decided to pull our resources which was about $3,000 and decided to move to South Central Los Angeles when I was 18 and he was 20 years old we rented out an apartment that was a two-bedroom apartment we realized that if we had rented out one of the other bedrooms it it went from 900 bucks a month to 450 for the two of us and then if we split that there was 22 a piece and we could do that for 3 months in between high school and college so we were going to try and make this work so we said all right parents we're going to do this packed up our bags and moved to South Central when we got there uh we started our first company and we had this crazy idea we wanted to allow people to store all their usernames and passwords on one site and log into everything with just one username and password that's what we wanted to build that summer we called it my social cloud and that summer we were working away building the first prototype coding day in and day out living off of Doritos and ramen and finally one day I logged into Twitter and saw a tweet and the Tweet said come meet me in Miami for intimate cocktails donate $2,000 to charity and the Tweet was from Richard Branson Richard Branson for all you who don't know started the Virgin group so I immediately took that email address that he gave right after the Donate $2,000 and I said hello my name is Stacy Ferrera I am 18 years old so I am not legally old enough to drink cocktails but um but I would love to come to Miami and meet you with my brother we're two young aspiring entrepreneurs and we would love to learn from you about how you started your businesses we stayed up all night and got an email back from the secretary she said yeah if you two can donate $4,000 and be in Miami in 48 hours then you can meet him and I was sitting at my small little desk in the one bedroom that I had and I was like great here's an opportunity uh too bad I don't have $44,000 but did the only thing that I could think of to do at the time knowing that it is a once- in a-lifetime opportunity and I called my dad and I said hey Dad um I know that you don't know what Twitter is and I also know that $4,000 is a lot of money but this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to go meet Richard Branson can I please borrow $4,000 from you my dad at this point probably thinks I'm crazy but he came back on the other end of the phone and he said Stacy here's the deal write up a proposal for me why do you need the money where is this money going and most importantly what's your payment plan how are you going to pay me back so I write up this proposal for my dad and send it off over email and I get a call back from him and he says all right here's the plan this is a lesson in Money Management you can either take a $4,000 loan from me with the stipulation that you have to pay me back in 3 months before you step on college campus you have to pay me back or you don't take the loan and again kind of running through the list of things in my brain of you know what are all the things that I can sell if if something doesn't come out of this you know how am I going to pay this back but I said all right this is again a once- in a-lifetime opportunity I just I have to do this so borrowed the $4,000 got on a plane and flew to Miami to meet Branson over the course of the next two nights we got to spend a lot of time with Branson most importantly the first night was a room of 18 people who had responded to the tweet and all of us got to go around talk about our business and what we were working on right after that I went up to Branson and asked him if he could write down his personal email address on a piece of paper and he did he wrote down an email address and handed it to myself and my brother my brother immediately took it from me and looked at it and kind of inspected it and then he went over to the to Branson's secretary and said is this really is this really his email dress and she was like yeah that is so keep it close from there my brother and I flew back to South Central LA we finished up the prototype for my social cloud and then sent an email to Branson and said here's what we've built so far we'd love your advice on how you think we should take this to Market we got an email back from him shortly thereafter and he said this is great I don't do a ton in technology this was back in 2011 so he said you should meet my friend Jerry Murdoch who runs Insight Venture Partners a week later Jerry got on a plane and flew out to LA to meet with my brother and I and drilled us on our business asked us hundreds of questions what what was the business model how did we plan to monetize how had we buildt the platform so far what was the product road map how did we plan to keep building it what were we going to do about school we were so young we answered all of these questions and after answering them them we went out to dinner that night and Jerry said that he Branson and another investor Alex Welch would all invest $1.2 million in our [Applause] business that's really what kickstarted my own entrepreneurial Journey taking a risk not being afraid of what could happen and asking the question what do I lose if I don't do it that has that lesson has followed me all throughout my journey we went on then to build my social Cloud over the course of two years we sold it in 2013 to reputation.com just here in the Bay Area after that I went on to publish a book called 2 billion under 20 before starting my next company Forge the lesson that I want to leave all of you with today is it only takes one thing emailing one person who you might say why would this person ever respond or even just looking at your Twitter feed or sometimes asking the big question can I please loan money from you can I please borrow this saying yes as opposed to saying no has made all the difference in my life so take those risks and say us thanks

After deciding to make the leap to a healthier lifestyle, Kara Goldin knew she'd have to find something to supplement the ten to twelve diet cokes she was consuming per day. 

Juice wasn't going to do the trick as it contains an ample amount of sugar and vitamin water was hit or miss with preservatives and other chemicals.

Enter the lightbulb moment. She put some berries at the bottom of a pitcher and noticed her family couldn't get enough. Coming from a tech background, Kara didn't know much about creating a beverage company, but that didn't stop her. 

Fast forward to 2017 and $96 million in revenue, Hint Water has become the unofficial beverage of 'Silicon Valley.' 

Take a listen to Kara and how it all went down.

At these events, we only serve pizza and beers. We typically have space for around 100 people and these events always sell out.

Come meet other young, ambitious startup founders, employees, do-ers, and hustlers. We'll get crunk, have fun, and learn from the best.
