the world has changed where there's now this like robotic arm that's a general purpose robotic arm so think of it like an iphone right it's a piece of hardware that you could buy that you could program to do anything right so when steve jobs came out with the iphone they were like this is iphone it can access the internet it has a gps inside and it can make phone calls like that's what it could do and from there you guys figure out the rest right like initially they didn't have the app store but then when they did have the app store now all of a sudden you get the flashlight app and then the app that turns you know it's like a ruler uses the camera to like measure something then you get like strava it's like we'll use the gps to do this thing so it's basically like a programmable general purpose tool so that's what's happening with these robotic arms [Music] all right we're live bro what's up listen listen to this thing i'm going to tell you something i uh you know had been being really healthy this summer and didn't eat a lot of sugar didn't have no sugar other than like fruits and fruits and vegetables and like just no sugar added today i decided today was my planned cheat day after three months of like doing this and i ate some ice cream um i feel miserable yeah the cheat day is always underwhelming it's always like i'm looking forward to it i'm planning for it then i start doing it i don't even feel good while i'm eating it well it's like it's like um when you drink and then the next day you're hungover you're like why did i do that but then you immediately do it again like a few days later i kind of feel like that except instead of like three days it's like it's 10 minutes so like i eat something and 10 minutes later i'm feeling horrible i'm like oh [ __ ] it there's still some left though i should probably do it oh my god i feel so sick you have such an extreme personality you you always go to these extremes um you also i feel like this is also why people hate uh like fit people is because they like have these types of problems and normal people are just like what are you talking about uh like what is the big deal why are you doing this to yourself why are you waking up in the middle of the night thinking about ice cream it's like the way that you know the way that some people get annoyed about like crossfitters and you know like people who love to talk about intermittent fasting i think there's people who feel that way about us with business and money which is just like dude not everything's a business it's okay and i would say that if we succeed we we need to succeed in creating people that are as annoying as crossfitters as our fans i think that's my new goal yeah you need freaks and here you've got you you're at a huge disadvantage you know why right it's because you are what i like to call emotionally stable you have too much emotional health uh good emotional health in order to uh you know be extreme like some people i'm reading this great book about uh leaders and how the guy the author looks at a lot of like uh interesting leaders who we like like so for example abe lincoln's one of the most written about i think the most written about american figure ever winston churchill a bunch of people like that and he basically his whole theory is that during okay times uh a mentally stable leader is could be adequate but during bad times mentally unstable leaders typically are the best at leading because they understand like the ups and downs they uh are kind of like crazy enough kind of like when an entrepreneur like invent something or start something versus the type of person who just runs it and runs it like even keel and they're like well you kind of need some extremes and extreme times and it like analyzes history on emotionally unstable people and looks at like oh they're actually the best during bad times well i think people underestimate this because in theory it sounds like you want somebody who is stable in theory you want let's say you join a startup or a small company you want it to be like oh how do we make decisions you know we we talk about it as a group we get a bunch of different perspectives and then we sort of all chime in with what we think and we go with you know maybe the majority it's like a democracy and actually that [ __ ] doesn't work in startups uh it is not the norm and that would be the outlier if it was to work the the norm is what they call the benevolent dictator so it's basically we agree for better for worse that person's the ch the captain they're the captain and we're going on their ship and either we're going down or we're going to the promised land and that's how the best startups work is they pick a captain and they just go ride or die with that person and they say look for better for worse we need to make decisions fast so one person's going to always be faster than a committee we need to be extremely decisive so we can't be torn constantly by warring you know one group wants a the other group wants b we can't have that three we need it to be a little bit extreme because look we're trying to do an extreme thing here so maybe we need a bit of an extreme leader and so i think in companies you actually want a dictatorship and people don't like that they're uncomfortable with that because that's not what you want in your country maybe or that's not what you want in your you know your local city but it is what you want in a company and it is what you want on any creative project it's kind of my view you want kind of a crazy genius who's going to be the creative force driving the thing and everybody else get on board or get off and that's that's how you ran the hustle that's how i run my companies is definitely the way when it comes to to creating new stuff from scratch yeah and then it actually makes sense and let me explain how i was and you tell me if you're the same way but if you look at like with the ceo it like it doesn't really matter if there's a 30 uh not approval rating it's just like do the numbers like does it work you know for a publicly traded company it's like uh it didn't matter unfortunately or fortunately the way you look at it doesn't matter if you're an [ __ ] did the numbers go up and did you achieve what you said you're going to achieve and so it doesn't matter if your employees i mean it matters if it becomes a retention problem but if it's just if you have a 10 approval rating but your numbers are great it's great if you have a 10 approval rating and you're the president of america well you're you're jobless you know what i mean like you're not going to win the next election so it's just like all about appeasing to one percent and because of that we get used to this idea of like democracy and like you know i don't want to be led this is like you know don't lead me just like get me involved and so i remember when i started my company i was like yeah that's how i'm going to run it like look it's this is like a meritocracy we are all here working together and it is that but it is definitely more like hey i'm the boss i will take input in from everyone i'm making the decision and this is the way that we're going to go and it's my job to make sure that you feel inspired to be here and all this other stuff and i remember feeling really self-conscious about that and then there'd be times where i wasn't the leader like for example when i joined hubspot or maybe when you and i work on this podcast it's like well i'm not exactly the boss and i actually felt a lot of security and comfort when i said hey who's the boss of this project and you just say is this person the boss great hey boss uh what you know make your decision please and i felt actually good about like being a follower and then i realized that maybe i think my employees when i'm the bot like you have to have a boss i think and when you are the boss it is kind of cool but also very stressful but when you're not the boss it's like yeah i'm okay taking this role and i recognize we need a leader just tell me what to do right yeah what do they call it one neck to choke it's like there needs to be one neck to choke when it comes to any situation or any problem like if it's like if i don't know who's in charge if i don't know who's who actually makes the call then you lose one really powerful thing which is accountability and uh and so i think that's that's really important i think that uh you're absolutely right i don't mind whether i'm the person or i'm not the person in charge i just like that there is a person in charge i want a benevolent dictatorship because that's what i've had personally seen work best i remember when we were when i was at twitch and we did uh the first executive off site so it's like i don't know the the sort of like 15 exact leaders in the company go to whatever some fancy place they have a spread of you know like whatever tea and crumpets and even busters in daly city yeah fridays exactly you go to friday's during happy hour potato skins at the nuclear margarita yeah yeah you eat a loaded potato and you you start to decide the future of the company you got to feel like your customers you know you got to go to the applebee's you got to get the nachos so the the ceo and the ceo they get up there and they say hey look we we read the results from the last cer the last offside we did last quarter and it seemed like the big thing you guys wanted was you felt like the decision making was too top down and you didn't have a say and you feel it felt like your ideas either weren't heard or you know the groups you know it was it was all just sort of mandated from above and you just had to execute you didn't feel empowered so this time we're doing it different and they like spent the whole day and it was like what are your ideas children and then everybody writes down their ideas i'm sticking that's like awesome let's do a color voting system everybody vote on your top three and you're like yeah and then you go through know uh so you want to do a commercial with the rolling stones sean you know that that that cost a million dollars but okay we'll we'll take that into account yeah who here who here keeps writing billboards are back back from where what is this idea about right so it's like you basically and then you go through this whole day process where everybody's talking about it and you could tell the extent in a way they're interested but they're also like biting their tongue a bit because they're like look all right we said we're not gonna just like slam in with our opinion and just overrule everything and be like guys it's [ __ ] obvious we're doing one two and three what are we talking about here and so they didn't do that they let everybody do their things great come up and we leave the off site fast forward either the next quarter the quarter after that so three or six months later we go for the next off site it's like oh we're in the feedback uh we feel like we just don't know how decisions are being made uh we kind of wish that the leadership would just step in and give us clear direction on what we're gonna do like hey we're ready we just need some clarity from you guys it's called the long con man this is the long con and so they basically were like here we'll let you you know try this and i was just like am i the only one in the room that just remembers what the last feedback was which is the exact opposite which is like it's too top down and now it's like are the leaders gonna be leaders or not like we need clarity your job is to give us these decisions like uh we feel like you're just sitting back and then now it's mayhem and it's like and so that was like the affirmation of something i always believed the second part there's this uh there's a skit from the chappelle show where he wants to get oprah pregnant so he uh you know he wants to have oprah's baby and he gets her pregnant and goes gotcha and uh like that's that's how i feel emmett is just like saying to himself after like three months so he's like gotcha you guys said what dave chappelle gotcha i'm pregnant are you sure it's man it's yours that's your [ __ ] what a little [ __ ] [Laughter] the the second thing is war time and peace time i think this also matters a lot so you want this sort of like dictatorship when it is wartime and for for startup therefore company there's usually two wartimes there's the beginning when you're nobody you have no customers no product no direction you have no market share no nothing and then if you start to succeed you will hopefully enter some version of peace time where it's like the thing is working we don't need to everyday wake up and worry about dying or killing our competitors or like all the stuff like maybe you're working on you know maintenance fixing bugs maybe you're working on um talking to customers and making sure your support you know things that you kind of push by the wayside now there's more time to go do those things properly you work on security we work on server robustness whatever it is the same thing but more and better a little bit every time yeah you don't need to go and conquer new lands you're basically taking your existing land and saying oh you know we need to fix up some things around here that we ignored during the wartime rush but then you enter wartime again inevitably and that's when you know the competitive landscape changes you know a new platform gets released competitors emerge um whatever and the economy changes and being able to shift between those two gears is pretty tough i think very few leaders can be the best wartime ceo and the best peacetime ceo usually you're one or the other you're an amazing peacetime or amazing wartime and then you sort of stay too long dur when the when the when the season shifts it's i think that's the other thing to recognize because people will always say oh this person's good or bad and it's like well actually maybe they're just amazing at one season and the season has changed and now a different type of person would actually be best for what's going on now and so uh that's the other thing about like you know this dictatorship stuff that you got to know is like what season are we in if we're in wartime i want a wartime ceo if we're in peacetime i need a peacetime ceo and i need to know when to shift i always hated saying this because there were so many people who died and it was so bad for so many people but i remember thinking like dude covid was awesome like i loved i loved being in the trenches you know like it was actually quite exciting it's exciting now because i know how the story ends and things end well but at the time i was quite scared but looking back i was like oh i feel alive like this is this is yeah this is what it is and honestly i kind of hate the war metaphor because you know first of all there's people who are actually in war so yeah that's true this is a it's a borrowed it's a borrowed term and they didn't give us permission um the second thing is you know our war is fought literally at a keyboard with clicks firing left and right and so you know there's a part of me that just feels very lame so yeah i felt so alive when i was logging into google analytics every morning and checking out you know what was like well do you acknowledge that you're kind of a soft [ __ ] right like it's like okay yeah as long as i acknowledge that then it's okay to continue this yeah this metaphor but let's acknowledge it is a metaphor it is not like real in any any way but i know what you mean which is that when these big shake-ups happen or there's a downturn where most people's reaction is oh [ __ ] i'm sure you know this is bad for me and they just go with the sheep of like it's bad for me versus a lot of other people recognize hey this is happening whether i like it or not and given that it's happening the questions i need to ask are what opportunities does this open up for me where does this where am i now going to get strong in that i was otherwise weak in what have i been neglecting that now it's time to put my focus on right like just ask yourself better questions then you start to focus on cool i'm going to take market share in this area i'm going to i'm going to quickly pounce on this thing that i've otherwise been neglecting that now matters a lot or hey oh now that everybody's comfortable with remote work and stuff like what that opens up this new opportunity for us and just ask better questions and you'll get better answers dude speaking of so i've got two topics here that are like kind of related to like mad men and crazy people the first have you ever heard of this guy named brad uh brett adcock no have you heard of this company called veterie do you remember veterie not really okay but no i don't i couldn't tell you what it is so this guy named brett adcock he i just met him recently and he joined our community and i've been getting to know him listen to this guy's background so he's 36 years old he's from central illinois and in around 2012 2015 he started a company called veterie and it's nothing particularly sexy it was just basically like a job site and it was a little bit like hired.com and eventually hired.com tried to bully battery hired.com was also a similar business a job board but like you know more in depth more technology and they raised north of 100 million dollars fast forward five or six years later veterie ended up buying hired.com when hired.com went bankrupt and so veterinary was basically a job website to help people recruit engineers raise 10 million eventually was acquired for 120-ish about 150 i think so this guy brett he's 36 now so back then when it was acquired that was in like 2015 so he was in his 20s he made low digit tens of millions of dollars so he didn't tell me but i would imagine in the 20 million dollar range but here's what he did tell me listen to this he put 100 of his money minus a little bit of cash that he put down for a down payment for a house so when i say 100 he told me he goes i didn't own any outside equities i owned nothing i had my down payment my house and 100 of the earnings that i made which was low tens of the million tens of millions put into the business bank account and then he started a company called archer so basically they make like these car they some people call them flying cars they're basically like helicopters uh helicopters but they kind of look like a car body and i was like how did you learn about this and he said i learned it all on my own i read 50 engineering books and built three generations of electric aircraft in 2018 at the university of florida where i was doing engineering courses as an undergrad i had to build a lab there to have facilities big enough in 2018 and so with owning zero public equities outside of archer the archer stock he makes zero outside investments and he said because he needs extreme focus so he put all this money in archer archer eventually does a spec i believe they did us back but they but they went public so they sold like a billion dollars worth of these flying vehicles to united airlines or something like that takes it public for three or four billion dollars now the stock is you know like most stocks in the in the grow space is it doing so hot but i still think it's a billion dollar uh company and his net worth skyrockets to a billion i think now it's in the 300 or 400 range and makes all this money from archer and now i can't talk about his new startup but i can't soon he's told me he took basically 200 million dollars and he's put all of it into his new company and still to this day he goes the only stock that i own is archer and my house that's like the only outside investments and then now the new business and so i go you know is your wife and family okay with this he goes i've been doing i've been going all in and been doing this for 20 years they're used to it now by now and i said well what do you what do you think about people who say you know you're kind of nuts why don't you square away a little bit of money while you can and he goes i don't care what people think i just want to build the future and this guy he's not like one of these elon musk types where he's like hard to talk to and you like ask him a question he's like you know so smart that he that he can't articulate it he's like fairly normal i guess normal quotation marks but he's like easy-ish he's easy to talk to he's a personal personable charismatic guy and you're like oh you seem very reasonable and then he says he does this stuff and i'm like you are insane you're a madman and so really interesting guy totally under the radar from central illinois he's only 36 years old so i got along with him because i'm from missouri really fascinating dude and i'm on his twitter he's talking only about this thing called polestar is that his new thing or that is a pole star is like a subsidiary or their partner with volvo and they make really cool cars is that what the tweet is about i i don't know yeah you just talked about pole star cars the whole time okay uh wow amazing so uh so that's incredible the so they basically is it the are they actually planes are they what they call vtol like vertical uh takeoff and landing the second one so kind of like a helicopter-ish it looks like a helicopter it looks like four blades four helicopter blades attached to like you know a honda civic right and why do you need this what does this do differently than a helicopter i have no idea [Laughter] i feel like question here's sam's question does he ask you it's usually name where you're from and then instead of like you know what do you do it's like what other equities do you own and like how much of your personal net worth are you reloading into your next company wow okay let's focus on that i don't want to know why why you've created no idea what like actual helicopter does that's what a website's for i don't know to take cool pictures i don't know what are planes for it's just like a plane i don't know [Music] i mean i'm looking at the website oh it's also just cool pictures of the aircraft yeah i don't give a [ __ ] what the widget is it makes it's a widget it's just like this beautiful black woman getting into this helicopter in a dress and i'm like what's she doing what's the purpose here and then the next photo is she's on like a sand dune and dubai and it's like oh did she just fly fly to the desert [Laughter] actual thing but okay so hold on there's a little question or a plot hole about the story so it said that he had to he he was an undergrad in 2018 but you said he sold his company like in 2016. so he back to school before he was in school like he went back to school to learn how to do this stuff oh my god even more incredible this guy was interesting he became an undergrad yes and he told me he goes he goes whenever i do something i go all in he goes for example i'm i i'm going all in on my latest thing i went all in on archer he goes when i was starting veterinary there was a time where i took a personal loan one month because i didn't have any money in my personal account and we had to pay rent and he goes this is just what i do and so he said he wanted to learn about electric cars or whatever this this cool [ __ ] is and he went and learned about it at university of florida wow uh okay that's incredible speaking of people who go all in you know uh my buddy fer khan and he's been on the podcast we haven't had him on a while we should bring him back on but basically he was my co-founder at my last startup before we we uh it was called bebo and we we sold it um to twitch and then since then he left and he was i was like what are you gonna do well you gotta say what he did before of that oh before he he's got a kind of a crazy story before that he was a co-founder of a company called applovin that went public and it's like i don't know uh 15 20 billion dollar mobile ad network uh mobile gaming company so like one of the fastest growing companies ever yeah just an incredible story like they've only they only ever raised four million dollars and they took that four million of external capital so they took i think four million from the founders and four million from uh from like strategic investors and they turned that into basically like 20 billion of equity value which is and it makes insane capital efficiency three billion a year in revenue so it's like a big business and they like rotated they were a mobile ad network and then they went public and when they were going public it was like mobile ad network their comps were not very good because most mobile ad networks were like not doing very well and even though they were like well our business is actually really good but we're just going to keep getting compared to these low multiple other mobile ad networks so they basically executed a pivot mid-flight and we're like well on our ad network the number one advertisers are games that's who makes the most money on our network that's who pays the most money on our ad now or his mobile games so they're like why don't we just build mobile games and buy mobile gaming studios and so they built up this mobile gaming arm that i think does over a billion dollars a year in revenue i think they do two billion on just the like the amazon basic of games yeah exactly so they started buying up these little partnering buying up studios and building their own studio in-house and then they would just use their existing reach and their ad network to like grow their own games and uh insane and then they got valued much higher because they had like a different story than just we're a mobile ad network and that's it so anyways furcon's been doing crazy [ __ ] but he's been going all in since he was very very young so when he was 15 he worked at a.com uh during the uh like dot-com boom like his dad was like hey um i met this guy they raised like on beverage.com is like this guy raised 50 million dollars on a powerpoint he needs somebody to build his website he doesn't know how you know how to build websites like why don't you go work over there so at 15 he's working at a.com then he starts his own ecom site that's like selling uh like cool like mods for your computer you know people like trick out their cars with like rims and stuff he was doing that for like your gaming computer or stuff like that you could have like a see-through case with like blue liquid going through it or stuff like that and he goes to san jose state so not like a fancy school freshman year he's like is he an immigrant isn't it is he from well yeah his family's they're pakistani but they they've lived he grew up at the bay area so he grew up that's part of the magic it's like his dad worked i think at ibm and like when he was like five years old his dad would bring home like the early computer or the early printer and be like let's assemble this together so that's how he learned how to do [ __ ] so um so anyways he he's freshman freshman year at san jose state he's like dude i just keep leaving the classroom to take calls because like you know we're out of inventory or whatever and so he just quits san jose state he goes all in on the ecom thing he figures out one hack with the ecom thing which was like back then i think on google or yahoo or somewhere where people were searching for stuff you could just sort by cheapest so he just wrote a bot that would always price what like their their main like high selling sku one cent lower than whatever the cheapest price was and it was like his lost leader and it would always bring somebody to the to the site and that's what he that's when he decided to quit school was he was in a class and they were describing what a loss leader is he's like oh that's the [ __ ] i'm doing with my like i'm like i'm like selling this stuff at a loss to get traffic he's like i don't need to be here i'm learning this [ __ ] like in the real world so he just left and just like i dropped out and then he's like whatever goes on he spends a couple years playing poker as well like you know a bunch of different crazy stuff comes back starts doing startups and now and so after we sell and after app 11 goes public the guy never needs to work again he's got all the money in the world and i'm like so what are you going to do and he's like he's like i want to like i was like i'm going to buy a big space hey basically it's like he's creating his heaven on earth which did he buy that space or did he rent it it looks beautiful he's renting that one but he was looking at buying before then when covet started happening he's like i'm just going to lease these they're all like dirt cheap leases now and like i don't know he got a sick place over on the presidio yeah so he's in fort mason he's got like i don't know maybe ten thousand twenty thousand twenty five thousand square feet or something like that it's crazy and he basically created his heaven on earth which i've come to realize is like i that's actually what i respect the most it's like i don't respect because people will be like oh on one hand you guys go all in on elon or brett adcock these guys who go all in is that what you love but you also love this guy who's got this amazing lifestyle and works four hours a month that's the same thing it's the same thing they're creating their heaven on earth and i think that is that my best description of what i admire and what i want to do is create my own little heaven on earth which takes two i don't even like that description i say they're taking the world and they're just bending it over their leg to help the shape that they want it to be you know what i mean they're just they're they're spanking they're spanking the world yeah they're a dominatrix and the earth is their uh the recipient no they're just like making the world because that's what it feels like it feels like they're forcing things they're forced to see an industry and they say and they really go get my belt and then they bend the industry over and they spank it yeah exactly so he's also an all-in kind of guy because he he basically immediately created like a lot of work for himself he rented out the space he puts 40 there's i went there to visit there's 40 people working in there i'm like who are all these this is like a bunch of young brown dudes like who are all these indian dudes everywhere what are they doing i invested in one of them because they're just part of his thing i was like fur con are these guys legit and he like told me this huge explanation i was like all right so just say yes or no and i and i say less yeah yeah i actually want to just invest in the index because actually individually all of the ideas are a little bit crazy one of these is gonna work i just don't trust myself to pick the right one so i actually have talking to him about like how do i just index into all of your crazy like i would like a piece of every brown dude in this in this uh under this roof here like how do i do that and i think we're gonna work it out but i wanna tell you about one of the things that i saw there so dude the guy i invested in was a white guy [ __ ] oh yeah you're the nba gm drafting kyle forber you should take lebron i think um so so one of the guys that one of the guys i met in there they were doing something called orangewood robotics have you ever heard of this company no but obviously i'm in [Laughter] yeah so i go in and there's a reason it's called order but i'll explain in a second so they go in and i go i walk in and there's a bunch of people at their computers and then there's the big thing he he wanted to do was he was like you know a lot of engineers they want to work in a space with other smart engineers that's cool but one of the things that engineers struggle with he's like the first thing i bought when i got money is i bought like a 3d printer and you know then like this robotics thing and then i brought about this drone thing he's like i just want to have a whole bunch of hardware available for free to engineers that are building stuff that requires the stuff that's very expensive so they can come and hack on these these tools and they don't need to like go buy this you know fifteen thousand dollar machine that just does this thing and so that's what he did and so when i walk in i'm like what's going on in there there's basically a room with a bunch of robotic equipment in there i walk in and there's this company called orangewood and what these guys are doing is they basically are like i was like explain what this is they go oh we have this robot that can paint stuff and i was like okay why and they're like well you know like you know look around this room like you see that you see this you know there's this process called powder coating you ever powder coated something and i was like you obviously don't know what you're talking to yeah so i was like no um i was like is that for donuts what is that and he's like no basically it's this like process where you need to paint you know i still can't expect by the way that was a that was a good one thank you um you do that thing in text where you're like six out of ten eight out of ten on any on any joke that was a good one i like that one the powder coating for donuts so so basically they're like you know it takes you know a specialist you have to you know you have to hire higher labor labor's really hard nowadays and it's also like a chemically intensive process it's not really that bad basically powder coating like i do it with motorcycles so like your motorcycle frame is just metal and then they powder coat it which is it kind of looks like paint i don't actually know exactly how it works but you do it in like a room that's sealed and you do it with gloves on and it's like you're putting it looks like a powder on it and it's like a sealant slash protected thing slash paint right so they basically trained this robot to do it and what they do the trick is that the world has changed where there's now this like robotic arm that's a general purpose robotic arm so think of it like an iphone right it's a piece of hardware that you could buy that you could program to do anything right so when steve jobs came out with the iphone they were like this is iphone it can access the internet it has a gps inside and it can make phone calls like that's what it could do and from there you guys figure out the rest right like initially they didn't have the app store but then when they did have the app store now all of a sudden you get the flashlight app and then the app that turns you know it's like a ruler uses the camera to like measure something then you get like strava it's like we'll use the gps to do this thing so it's basically like a programmable general purpose tool so that's what's happening with these robotic arms these guys wrote software to teach that robotic arm they bought how to powder coat things and then they taught it how to paint floors and then they taught it how to weld things so this thing could literally just weld [ __ ] together uh they taught it how to um you know pick and pack things so it could take it could take things out of one place and put it into another place based on what it looks like and and the way you do it is like you just write a program that that does each of these functions and you need to specialize it and then there's there's more sophisticated ways they'll put a camera on top and they'll teach it to like recognize stuff so like my cousin was doing this where he was teaching this robotic arm literally i went to his office and it was straight up a robotic arm and a uh like a hole and his whole thing was can i get the arm to go in the hole and i was like what's going on here guys like this is a little like a sexual robot someone is good and he's like no this is where basically in the future electric cars are going to need to get charged but when they're self-driving there's no driver to get out of the car and plug it in he's like so you need the charging station to be able to automatically attach to the car otherwise we're never going to have self-driving cars that work that are electric because who will fill them up you'll need a person there always to be able to go do this and they'll need basic gas attendants at every gas station to do this which in my mind i was like that doesn't sound so bad but like you know there's a reason he pivoted but the point is they were training this arm to be able to use the camera to find the hole and exactly get in without scratching the car and so there's like this whole industry of people that are doing this they're just figuring out how to program these general purpose robotic arms and they're making very interesting businesses off them so these guys are doing it with painting i thought that was pretty cool because it's like a high value thing like you rent it for 500 bucks for the day and it'll paint all your [ __ ] and it's like that's cheaper than hiring a person to do it and more reliable maybe because they'll do it it'll do it like perfectly even every single time you don't have like human error and so the other one that that's interesting like this is cafe x which you've probably seen yeah yeah yeah in the malls which is basically starbucks yeah and like you see it you're like oh what was stupid and then you start thinking about it you're like oh my god the implications here are quite big yeah no i saw that i was immediately like this is this one of the smartest ideas i've ever seen so if you haven't seen cafe x because you're not like in san francisco imagine starbucks but now shrink starbucks down to the size of like a a jumbo vending machine and it's see-through and inside is just a robotic arm and you go you place your order you're like i need my you know cappuccino i want it you know whatever double shot and i don't drink coffee so i'll make it up but like you know oat milk and two sugars and basically the arm then starts to like move around inside and it makes your coffee that it hands it to you and then it waves and it doesn't dance and it and you get to walk away and basically you pay you know two dollars fifty cents and you're getting a robotic coffee so the why this is dope is it takes up like one tenth of the real estate of starbucks it has no like labor costs or very very low labor costs it's just the person who comes and cleans the robot at the end of the day and refills the ingredients so there's like you know very low labor cost and the robot like never gets tired never calls in sick it just like runs all day and just makes the per the exact same coffee all the time and it could do that with like you know 100 drinks or something like that and so cafe x hasn't quite taken off i think there's they did some stupid things and i remember hearing that like at one point like in the seed round the founder only owned four percent of the company or something they like effed up their cap table or something like that yeah i heard that too um and so you know that that particular startup i don't think it's going to work but i'll be damned if this is not going to be a thing like this is going to be a thing it just makes too much it has such an economic advantage and it only has technology risks and i think people really underestimate that because most businesses have extreme market risk we don't even know if the customers want it and we don't know if they're going to adopt it then it has but this has like well if the customer wants it it's not really a question the customer wants a fast delicious coffee yes that's not like that's not that hard to do and instead of making starbucks as a place where you go sit it's optimizing for people who want to get in and get out like subway stations and stuff like that like people who are quickly on the go and has such a big financial advantage if they can do it because the real estate and the labor costs now the only question is can you make the robot arm work well enough and actually that's a problem that engineers are good at solving over like a 10-year period so i'm trying to just do this math to make sure i'm right um wow okay so check this out so i i know a few a few of these guys doing these startups that involve so a lot of them use the word humanoid have you heard that word yeah don't like it yeah i don't like humanoid but basically it's robots that do jobs of humans like gas station attendant so i was just curious and this cafe x is interesting there's another one that's doing it for pizza i think it's called zoom is it called zoom that was one of the popular ones softbank put like i don't know 500 million dollars into it or something ridiculous which sounds silly but i and this is i only did this research while we were talking it could be way off but i'm looking at a government website it seems legit do you know what percentage of working americans work in fast food oh man it's gotta be high uh but i'm gonna give you the homie move and i'll say seven percent no that was way too much i asked that poorly so about about three and a half million americans work uh in fast food jobs which is like a point that's that's significant dude that's significant uh 10 of those work at mcdonald's so mcdonald's employs like 250 300 000 people um it's kind of astonishing i'm i'm a fairly libertarian person but when i think of these things i'm like what are these people going to do for work i mean there's just that's only we're only talking about fast fast food you talk about all these other things i mean potentially five or ten percent of americans of workers it's like you know they maybe don't have a lot of that many skills like when these things happen i'm like i don't know what's gonna happen with these people it's not a good situation it almost is more scary than it is interesting you know what i'm saying yeah people always say that um i don't know i just feel like it's there's really two questions which is like a is this new no for forever technology has been like making things easier and getting rid of jobs like okay you know maybe we were you know doing stuff by hand on the fields and then we got the tractor and that like maybe reduce the number of people you needed by 10x in order to run a farm and you know with all the automation by the way the farming industry has massive stuff subsidies i mean they like there's some farmers that are so efficient and so good and there's more nuance to this so someone's going to correct me but basically some farms my parents work in the agriculture industry it's kind of how i know this some farms are so big and so good the government will pay you money not to grow a crop because they say you're going to screw up the whole market if you overflow us with corn yes it's called the farm act i believe uh or is that the farm act there's a there's a couple acts a couple bills uh in in america where they will pay you money not to do anything because they say you're gonna disrupt you're gonna you're gonna make too much we don't want you screwing yeah and so the farming thing is a good example and what has happened is the government is heavily involved that sounds this sounds so stupid i i i really oversimplified that but it is basically the case where you get paid not to do something because you will disrupt the market too much that's insane to me i mean aren't there people that need food and aren't there are prices high higher than ever like that's crazy to me that we're not for like corn i mean corn i mean like america does like two a few things really well one we produce really good entertainment so like our biggest export you could say is like uh culture you know movies and music and fashion and the second best thing is corn like our ability to create corn is like phenomenal we create corn so well uh i mean corn syrup is in everything ethanol fuel is made out of corn everything's made of corn we are really good at making corn so i don't know i think with corn i think we're kind of we kind of nailed that one we kind of that's a home run yeah okay i don't know enough about this to really speak on it but i guess what my point is over time technology has just gotten more and more pervasive and it's like what's what happened to all the horse carriage drivers what happened to all the people that worked in factories what happened to all the people that did this and that and the reality is like they shift they shift around so you know some people will become robot attendants and they'll become good at like managing and cleaning the robots and fixing them when they when they bug out some people will shift into a new type of labor and like whether that's they become entertainers on social media they become you know there's new jobs that will get created from every single thing that gets done and like you know what's the other question is like what's the alternative do you pump the brakes on making things better faster cheaper like that doesn't seem like you it's possible or real or like yeah like i'm not gonna let i'm not gonna let like my feelings get away of like progress and technology i'm just saying like it that doesn't mean that it's not frightening yeah i i just think you know there's a little bit of carnage whenever any change happens whether it's you know change for the good or it's changed for the bad right like i think in any there's there's a little bit of collateral damage along the way and the question is like you know that also creates opportunities because if you created a business that re-skills people not only are there going to be a lot of people that need reskilling but maybe the government will pay you to help reskill workers in the economy so the free market can come up with a solution to how to absorb this labor how to reskill this labor and do things like that so i don't really worry about stuff like that but i do think that it's very interesting to me that these robotic like these general purpose robot robot like pieces can now be programmed to do just a variety of things that are otherwise you know today human labor i can't find this client info have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases hubspot grow better have you seen this tv show called the bear i've seen a few episodes i haven't finished it all right so the background and the show isn't necessarily the important topic here but it's a topic i want to ask you about but the background is basically a restaurant in chicago the owner kills himself and the br the brother inherits this restaurant and it's a mess and the brother is a trained chef from french laundry which is like the best restaurant in the world and he comes to this kind of like [ __ ] restaurant and he's got to turn it around so that's the whole premise and i'm watching this show and i used to work at a restaurant like most kids if you know 15 16 17 18 i worked at a restaurant and this show reminded this show reminded me how miserable they are and like this goes on the list like right below like music festivals of things and businesses that you should never start and run from no matter almost no matter how good they are and are like this wait why music festivals what's wrong with music festivals dude any business that you could that you spend 18 months working on and [Music] if it rains that day you're completely screwed like that that's a one out of you know 365 chance i mean more than that it's more than one time a year but like the odds that like rain come and ruin your whole years of work that's the worst that's like i don't want to join that business i mean like music festivals they're just horrible and they're horrible because the bigger and more people who that go and the more money that you make the worse the experience gets that's why i always disliked conferences i was like damn the better i make this for me the worse it is for the attendee and thus harder for the get them to come back over and over again and with a restaurant you see inside this kitchen at the bear at the it's called like chicago beef i think uh you see behind the scenes of the restaurant it is impossible this is playing business on the hardest mode possible people are angry people are vulgar all the time i remember when i used to work at a restaurant like there was a huge uh contingency of drug addicts you know you get off work at 2 am what are you gonna do you're gonna go immediately go to the bar and get screwed up and then come back to work next day at 11. lots of drug addicts lots of people calling in sick for work lots of people angry about a vulgar hostility this looks like a horrible business to be in your sushi restaurant was probably a little bit different than this but was it at all similar to what i'm seeing the bear well ours wasn't just because a we only ran it for three months and you know we were only open and live for three months and b we were the we were the labor for most of that we only had a couple other people the but what the way i experienced this was we went and worked in other restaurants to shadow to learn how do you actually run a restaurant right so like we worked in other sushi restaurants my buddy dan worked inside of a noodles company to see like how does a fast casual like process thing work or whatever and how does that work with a lot of salt he was just like dude like because we used to eat at these places he's like don't order the tomato bisque i was like the bisque it's a soup the soup is the good thing he's like don't order the tomato bisque i was like what's wrong he's just like bro you've never seen salt like you see in the biscuit i was like it's like somebody who is just like traumatized by what they saw and it's just like dude those people in the back don't give a [ __ ] they're gonna put whatever they want in this it does and the things that they're supposed to put are so bad for you and uh this stuff just sits around and like he's like don't don't eat this stuff i was like okay yeah sometimes the less you know like i remember when we were working in the kitchen and we worked out of a commissary kitchen so there's other people there the food truck people would come prep there the caterers and the worst was the guy who would sell hot dogs he had like a hot dog stand not no offense but like he would just come in with 350 hot dogs he would pour them all into the sink and we're like that's the sink where we do everybody does their dishes in there it's like pouring your hot dogs in a hot tub and then he was like just started turned up the water was just washing them and then he was just like chucking them to the side after they've been like rinsed for a second i was like first of all why are you washing the hot dog why did this need washing it was like if it came out of a package you washed it you washed it in the grossest sink possible and you just threw it on the side like somebody's gonna eat that like six hours i was like i will never eat a hot dog okay forget about what even went into the hot dog which i think in itself is gross like when you watch these documentaries about like you know farming and stuff like that and i was like just watching this dude watch the hot dogs before taking them to the ball game by the way you saying no offense is now going to be my new neg so i'm going to be like i'm just going to be talking about anything like yeah dude i was running this guy and he smelled so bad no offense and i'm just going to start saying no offense like all the time and like i was out walking around the streets and they were disgusting no offense and this person was so annoying no offense i mean nothing wrong with annoying people so no fans but i'm gonna start saying no fuss i'm gonna throw no offense there in there all the time that's amazing uh that's disgusting but anyway this show what's interesting about it though and this is a lot of similarities i see in what you and i do and what a lot of our friends do and a lot of listeners do is they are so passionate about this thing and at first i was like why are they so passionate about this and i started i was like oh wait no this is just their this is the just their shtick you know my outlet's a little bit different but it's like the same type of obsessed um they love it they love it so anyway cool show and and i wanted to bring it up because i i wasn't sure if it was similar to your restaurant experience i think it was like we used to do the thing you'd get off at one am and then you you know you the thing closed at midnight you got to clean up prep for the next day it's one before you get out of there and now you're hungry and tired you didn't want to eat your own food so you go to another restaurant they're getting off they'll just cook for you for free but then like you know two people are doing cocaine in the bathroom and you're like this isn't like you know the most productive lifestyle the restaurant industry i would say the bonding is very like the camaraderie was amazing and i would say there's something very soulful about like feeding people uh that's like really great but then the hours are brutal it is business on hard mode and there's a lot of like degeneracy same thing with like poker i used to play poker i loved the game of poker i hated sitting in a casino playing poker because i just felt like i was surrounded by so many degenerates and i was like this is not a high quality of living like just sitting here in this kind of artificial air with this guy who's like fell asleep next to me because he's been here for 42 hours straight like this is not who i want to surround myself with i need to get out of this situation um let me tell you about something that is the opposite of that kind of a an inspiring work environment so i saw this tick tock and it just i saw two tic tacs i don't remember i want to tell you about i'm not going to play them here because it'll take a little too long maybe in the youtube video we can we could play them but i want to know if you've seen these one went viral so it was did you see this viral clip of the picture on the mets coming out to the uh coming out to pitch he's like the closer so he was coming out to do his thing and it's normally on tv they just cut to commercial um in between like the chain like the the lineup change because it's like whatever it's gonna be two minutes the guy's gotta warm up he's gonna run out from the bullpen that takes a little while baseball's slow already he's got a warm up then whatever they usually come back but this time they stuck with it so they showed did you see this clip or am i just should i describe it keep going keep going the show from behind the guy like walking out from the thing emerging basically into the stadium so they have a dope camera shot oh and they're using that ufc lens have you noticed all these guys are using this yeah the ufc has got this beautiful lens where it like blurs out the background special yeah and then they and the guy normally comes out to this um song i don't know what it's called it's like whatever i don't know the guy timmy timmy trumpets is like the singer you know he's featured on it this guy with his trumpet but the mets had brought the guy there live and so he was kind of hiding and he comes out he's got his little trumpet he's got a microphone on the end of the trumpet and he starts playing the song and he's playing the song live the guy's running out into like the roaring crowd and it's just so dope and now timmy trumpet takes center stage as edwin diaz gets ready to come in [Music] [Applause] [Music] he's myself [Music] all right business is cool but like god sports and music just have this special thing this special moment these special feelings that you you can't there's nobody is that passionate about our podcast nobody is that passionate about this piece of software but when this moment hits the guy runs out he's the hero the trumpet guy's there he's playing the crowd's going nuts and it was just like this special moment and it was a lot of showmanship and so i i watched that and i get this feeling i'm like that was dope i'm glad that they went that extra mile for that showmanship does that create i will never watch baseball but like i'm a fan of like this guy that song you don't watch baseball at all right now way too slow for you right two slow too boring uh used to love it but you know when i was a kid so now i swipe up on tick tock the next video is this teacher and it says uh revealing the music the year musical part one and i'm like i don't know i just hung around for an extra second to watch he goes he goes all right and this year the musical is gonna be and he like reveals the whiteboard and there's nothing there and then there's like a small envelope and everyone's like wait what and then he's like he opens up the envelope there and he's like it's gonna be hold up this just says turn on the computer and then the students are like what's going on here and clearly the teacher had kind of set up a bit to like just make it more fun and like you know everybody loves this because it's like here's this teacher of like a middle school or high school or something like that they didn't have to do this like you know most teachers are just sort of like they want to just roll out the tv on the black you know like trolley and just be like all right guys just watch this [ __ ] movie for an hour and like just leave right like being a teacher is exhausting and like it's easy it would be it would be very easy to phone it in most don't and some like this guy go the extra mile so now he clicks his computer and it's a video and it's him and he's like hey it's me from the future and he's just like it's a silly bit but he's talking back to it he's like what are you doing here he's like i don't know i read the envelope it said turn the computer he's like you just gotta do whatever the envelope says and it's like it goes back and forth so he's like doing this skit with himself and he's like he's like uh and it freezes and then it freezes and it says wait everybody look under your desk and like one kid has this special thing and it was like this elaborate almost like an escape room leading up to this reveal and i saw that and so what was the plan video was viral the play was like i don't even remember it was like it was like not something like that cool it was like you know les miserables whatever it was like who cares but like by the end the students are going nuts because they're so invested at this point they sort of midway through they realized okay this is cheesy but i'm into it he's doing this for us and like all right i want to know he built up tension and the reason i bring up these examples is because there is a word that my trainer uses all the time and nobody else in my life i know talks about this my trainer all the time goes yeah you gotta have a little showmanship and showmanship is a word that i think like for most of us doesn't even enter our brain on a day-to-day basis and my trainer will always tell me he's like you know he'll be at starbucks before you know he'll go get a coffee before our session and he'll always tell me these stories he's like you know i decided to add a little showmanship so i told him my name was blah blah and they wrote it on the cup and then by the time the person was done you know i told them like you know whatever uh you know he'll you know he'll say you know bond james bond and then they'll just laugh they'll have a little chuckle and then they'll write bond he's like add the comma james bond and then they'll do it they'll laugh a little more and now he just like made their day a little more entertaining than it was than it had to be if he just said my name is john and okay cool you're just another john and so he always talks about adding showmanship and it's just like walking through life and just identify little moments where you could do something slightly different than like than the norm and i have a like i have kids now so i do this with my daughter all the time like we used to have such a hard time getting her to eat and my mother-in-law came over and like you know as a classic sort of like mother-in-law thing she's like always being like do this do that you guys are doing this wrong like you know it's true she's got like i don't know 30 years of parenting experience we got two but like it's also really annoying to be told what to do and how to parent better and how to like do this do that so we're normally my default was kind of annoyed but one day she was like uh she was like um like the milk bottle was like way less i said how did you get her to drink the milk and she's like oh she loves to drink out of this like little measuring cup instead of like the normal cup and she goes change of presentation and i go and i was like and so now me and my wife will always joke is where i was like oh god so annoying she was telling us what to do but then like like sometimes she does pull this like rabbit out of her hat and like you know we'll do something my dad doesn't want to do it and then we just change the like change the presentation of how we're getting her to do it and all of a sudden she's super locked in like i do this now when i feed her i couldn't get her to eat vegetables so i decided to create like my own version of the show uh chopped so i'm like okay close your eyes i'm gonna put one thing in front of you and in front of your brother and like take the bite and then you need to tell me is it one thumbs up two thumbs up or thumbs down and then i do a huge reaction based on the score they give me and she's like i want to play the close eyes game i want to play the clothes eyes game because she and i can get her to eat a whole meal if i'm willing to basically create a television show out of it it's really like exhausting for me but honestly it's like also kind of fun and it gets her to eat anything whereas otherwise that's actually even more exhausting to try to feed her something she doesn't want and so this idea of showmanship keeps weaving its way into my life and i wanted to bring this up because for somebody out there they're going to basically use this as like your word of the day find a way to like weave in a little more showmanship into what you're doing a little change of presentation as we say have you do you think about this at all i do and so i was i wanted i had to go find it but have you heard of this guy named tren griffin he's like this like 60s maybe he's 60 something years old white dude and his twitter bio just says like i used to work with bill gates at microsoft so you're like oh you're automatically like wise and interesting so he has a blog called 25 iq and i was reading it the other day and he had this article called a dozen beliefs about business money and life that kanye west shares with other great entrepreneurs and investors i was like oh that's an interesting title and the very first line has always stuck with me and it's about con it's from kanye and it says for me first of all dopeness is what i like the most dopeness people who want to make things as dope as possible and and by default make money from it and i always think about that quote because i also get caught up in like well this does this and this does this and this does this and so it makes money and i'm like oh yeah but this is super lame and not that cool and like this sucks my soul what am i doing like this isn't awesome you know and it's like well what is awesome i don't know exactly how to explain it but i do think about that all the time where i'll try to like nickel and dime things about what i'm gonna buy or like the other day i bought some uh uh like air force ones and i was like trying to like get like this cheap ones and i'm like bruh i can get the 250 air force once and i don't have to justify it like if they're cool they're cool they're dope i'm doing it no matter what and i always have to justify like certain decisions to myself was like this is just cool do it because it's cool i only have one life so yeah i think about this all the time yeah do it because it's cool i think it's a great like you know uh for most people who listen to this podcast they're probably like high achiever types and they're probably rational and like analytical about a lot of decisions and so i think for that audience actually you need to add more of this other ingredient which is the yeah for sure do it because it's cool eff it don't measure it and also honestly the same thing can either be done boring or dope it's like it's not the thing that's dope yeah it's how you do the thing that's dope or not dope and so you know the broccoli itself wasn't dope when i turned it into this game i made it more dope for her and therefore she has a different experience and i have a different experience in doing it and if i consistently do that well there's just more experiences throughout my day that are dope and what's a dope life it's a bunch of dope days it's a bunch of dope days it's a bunch of dope experiences throughout the day right you just break it down into moment like you can break it down into its atomic unit and realize that like the boringness or like routine of your life is uh like you know in your own hands and if you just add a little showmanship to yourself and to the people around you you can kind of change how the experience feels in many ways but like you know i'm seeing how this helps me and i wanted to share this little framework do you remember boosted skateboards yeah these are all over the place in san francisco people would like skateboarding up the hill because it was like you know san francisco is so hilly and it's like look like magic how are they going up this and now like electric scooters are the norms like the bird scooters and all those so that's like considered normal now but about eight years ago boosted skateboards came out with this longboard skateboard that would go 25 miles an hour i remember i bought one and it was crazy it was so cool and i met the founder and i was like tell me about your background he's like oh i worked at nasa and i was doing this other thing then i thought about like working in the government and like sending people to mars i thought that had been like interesting but i decided to launch this this skateboard company i was like well you know are you interested in skateboards he's like no i was like were you interested in this other thing he's like no not really i was like well you know why'd you go to skateboards he goes because it's [ __ ] awesome and i remember i remember him saying that and i was like well yeah you got a point yeah yeah it is it is awesome and i when he told me that i just i remember a shift happened in my life it's like oh yeah yeah that's a that's a good addition i gotta add that to my like box of checks check box you know of things to do like you know it makes money it makes my mom proud uh it's effing awesome uh i remember him saying that and i was like oh yeah you're right right yeah tony robbins has a thing he says which is like you will uh you will only meet the you'll meet your standards not your not your desires and basically like a standard is like more of a must a standard is like you know i'm not gonna eat at a restaurant if i saw flies flying around everywhere that's below my standard and so an important thing to figure out is like what are my standards for the things that i do in my life it sounds like for this guy one of his standards for like what do i work on is is this awesome or not whereas for a lot of people that [ __ ] is completely optional nice to have for sure it's not part of the standard and then you meet certain people and this is the best thing you could do like why do people have that phrase of like you are the average of the five people you spend your most the most time with is because it's because fundamentally you will adopt the standards of the people you're around it's not because they'll teach you things it's not because they'll give you good advice it's because fundamentally you will adopt the sanders like i remember we have a couple friends who are like you like you're one of my friends who's very fit i have other friends that are that are very fat or they care about being very fit and whenever there's a question of like all right yeah let's go grab some food what do you guys want to eat it's like i know that i can't suggest you know i can't cheesecake factory's not on the list you know like i can't i can't take these guys there that's not their their standard is that that's not what they eat and so like you know i automatically i will start to only suggest and therefore only go to places that i know meets their standard of what they they consider for the record i [ __ ] with cheesecake factory hardcore chicken piccata all day yeah i'm not above it yeah we have a couple friends that like it's like oh cool like what uh you ordered the gordita what's good here i've never been to this place dude can i talk about something that that i can't decide if actually and we could wrap up with it i can't decide if it's awesome and dope or not so basically i want to give like people perspective on you and i's like behind the scene so you and i shawn and i get dm'd or cold email all the time and a very common thing is hey can i like give you content to share and i'll do it for free or something like that and the bad thing about freeze you kind of get what you pay for so when it's free [ __ ] you're like oh there's too much work i don't want to share your stuff on twitter i don't want to share your stuff on whatever it's just it's not good i don't want to work on it for some reason i gave one of these kids a chance and i i say no to everyone i gave this kid a chance he dm to me and i was like you know i'll give you i'm going to give you my password to my tic toc and i want you to impress me i go send me a picture of your social security number card send me a picture of your boss and send me a picture of your driver's license and he did and i go all right if you [ __ ] i was like because i was like if you screw me over here i'm gonna get you back so like i have your information um here's my password to my tick tock i gave him the password by the way yeah that's great like if you do something bad to me i'm gonna get you and so i um i gave him my password to my ticket give me your mother's address because i will be mailing her your index finger in an envelope if you [ __ ] yourself because there's like no information that i could get to like get back at this person you know what i mean like i'm like i need you to have something yeah we're imbalanced you can really screw me by posting on my account what am i going to i need to equally be able to screw you okay continue yeah and i gave him the password to my tick tock it's been one week so in one week this kid has taken you and i's videos and posted him two a day on tick tock and in six days maybe i think one week's tomorrow he's gotten 1.5 million views and i went from basically zero to like not have an account to like eight or nine thousand followers as of now a handful of videos have gotten one got five hundred thousand one got seven hundred thousand a bunch got fifty thousand plus uh 150 or 200 000 likes tens of thousands of comments and i'm like that's kind of interesting but i don't exactly believe that this is true like i don't know if this is true and so i was like post a video where there's a call to action and so we did a video about my favorite book and it shot up the charts and i'm like all right people are actually like these people are somewhat engaged they're like buying a business like on amazon you mean yeah so uh and this is the second this is the second time that i did this so one time i recommended a book and before i recommended it i took a picture of its rating on amazon and then i recommended it and the next day it was number one in the entrepreneurship category and number one in the business category uh and i took screenshots of it to like prove it and uh it was it was the book called how to get rich that that tweet reached two million people this other video that i did i talked about the same book and it shot up i think now it's number one in entrepreneurship again and it's uh that video has been viewed 500 000 bro let's write our own book if you've got this kind of oprah influence i mean why you referencing this guy's dead he doesn't need your help come on let's write our own book let's see okay yeah look uh how to get rich is now number 30 in all of audible and originals it's number one in the small business category yeah look up how to get rich go look at right now look at the categories like it like skyrocketed after this video and i can't decide if this whole tick tock game is that i should just do it where it's like it's just simpler which is just like if you're a real person i i don't know if these tick tock views are real or not if you're real just put like a one in the car just type the number one i am going to see who's gonna do that you know because because i feel the same way about these tick tock views it's like our favorite words little little fugazi little fugazi there's a fugazi for your aussie element to these tick tock views it's like how you know is this really 1.5 million people what does this mean did they actually watch it what's going on here if so that's amazing but i'm you know some things can be too good to be true uh but that's cool yeah you've been showing up on my feed for what it's worth but i think it's because we're i have like two tick tock friends you're one of them this one this book video got fourteen thousand views a couple of them got seventy thousand fifty thousand one got seven hundred thousand lots of twenty thousands i can't decide if this is real and if it is real i don't wanna sound like gary vee but i'm like oh everyone should do this like this is easy this is this kid in miami he's just doing this and he just spun this up and it's working wonderfully and like you i don't i mean i think you're actually better than me but i'm not like that charismatic i'm not that good why is this game so easy and is this game is it real and also honestly is it worth it i'm not convinced that it's worth it well if you can spike a book to number one in the charts that shows that there's some value there there's some influence there like that's not just a number but yeah it's kind of lame like the most most there's a lot of amazing stuff on tick tock basically these 18 year old kids are like the most creative people i've ever seen but then there's guys like you and me these like money people and influencers and everyone's doing the same [ __ ] circle jerk alex or mosey stuff and it's really lame and so i don't know how to make it interesting and right now what i'm doing i think it's not interesting but the results are incredible yeah but is it effing awesome to go back to your standard tbd tbd you know what's happening awesome is when you create content and then like someone like legitimately famous and cool like hassan like hollers at you and then you're like yeah this is the awesome part about it so like like that you know what i mean like that's worth all the lame tweets that you and i have done is getting to hang out with like a couple of really cool people you know what's cool about selling your soul sometimes someone pays that price for it you know what's cool about being a [ __ ] is the money we're out [Music] you

all right so what's going on so basically there's streaming wars going on netflix disney hulu everybody's fighting for subscribers okay well how am i going to differentiate from if i'm netflix how do i differentiate from hulu and hbo and all this stuff basically they need original content okay so that's created this like huge imbalance of there used to be a lot of content and a small amount of distribution now there's a lot of distribution fighting for a small amount of content and all the distribution players have just decided like the prize is big let's lose money for a lot of like several years and invest billions into content and like let's be the last person standing and so they're they're investing on what you call a j curve where the curve goes down you lose a bunch of money and then a j like a j it goes way up and you make money later what that means for these production companies is they'll overpay there's a bidding war and they are willing to overpay for my content [Music] all right in this episode we are talking about the latest industry that i am totally completely obsessed with i almost can't think of anything else and i'm not sure why other people aren't freaking out about this so i go on a rant about that what else we got we talked about mark manson and uh how he's got this amazing empire on this book called the subtle art of not giving it an f i'll say f there and how it started just as a blog post and turned into this amazing business that's making tens of millions of dollars for for for him and then we also talked about production companies and how the breakdown is actually way better than we thought you know the the economics and how it works is far more fascinating than we anticipated all right enjoy all right we're live dude i'm in a horrible mood and the bad part about this job is like you have to like immediately snap out of a horrible mood and i can't exactly explain all the details about why i'm in a bad mood but basically it involves like a real estate deal that i did and someone i feel is trying to take advantage of me and here's what i think happens and tell me if this happens to you i feel like we i do a deal with someone or whether it's like a small deal or a big deal and then they like learn about what our stupid podcast is named or they google us but it's mostly the fact that the podcast has such a horrible name and then they like you know you get like you know like in hawaii where they got like the local price and they got the other guy price it's like it's like i get the other guy price you know what i mean and uh if even if it's just a little of another guy discrepancy it pisses me off that's hilarious uh yeah i i don't think that happens to me no one's ever ever referenced it i've never got that feeling in fact i actually get a bunch of credit the other way people are like look um you know i don't want to offend you with like a lowball offer on your on whatever or whatever it is i know this money doesn't matter to you and i'm like dude like i'm i'm showing up here the money matters like you know please don't not give me the money because you think it won't matter to me like you know well i think it does right so i think that it goes it cuts a little bit both ways people like i hate the thing where it's just like dude thanks so much for taking i know how busy you are i'm like dude i just like sit around in my boxes all day like you know i don't know what i don't know what you think i'm doing but like my son just threw up on me like two hours ago this is awesome compared to that like you know what do you what do you what do you think my life is that is so you know so busy and interesting because it's really not yeah it is funny when people say that i'm like well i am busy i'm talking to people all day but like i don't think you understand that like talking to just like slacking back and forth and like having conversations i remember when me first started the hustle like basically these like producers and this happens all the time these producers they email just tons of people who are even remotely interesting and they're like hey can we make a tv show about you and obviously like they didn't know what they're getting into like i'm not we weren't even remotely interesting enough but i'm like you guys do realize we're just sitting in front of a computer all day right like it's like the most unfascinating uninteresting thing it's not interesting at all but uh dude i'm shocked you don't get like that uh that uh that that other guy pricing it's it you have a b w right yeah is your house fancy you think or just normal normal nice my house is not fancy my house isn't fancy either and just like i don't know when they like maybe when they see that like i'm at home during the day i don't know why but like i just i'm always nervous i'm like wait a minute my neighbor's paying only 150 a month for their landscaping why am i why are you telling me 250. you know what i mean i feel like that stuff happens he has a podcast get your wallet out boys he's got a podcast [Laughter] so whatever i'm past it i got to move past it that's so funny you said the thing about filming by the way i had that same idea back in the day at monkey inferno because we had this really nice office and i thought building startups was the coolest thing in the world and i was like why isn't there a documentary crew here like you know the office but i'm the cool michael scott right like i'm awesome and so um you know i had watched hard knocks on hbo which basically makes like nfl training camp look like so epic so like you you start rooting for these stories all this stuff so i was like and they have like mics on the players and you hear like hey get up get him hey man what you doing like you hear like them talking like the pad's hitting you know what i mean it's like good yeah but then it also extends into it's like what you're doing it's like sorry man i'm just having a little trouble at home and it's like cue the music and they cut to the back story of like you know what's going on at home and i was like yeah we got these stories man we're trying to make it into the rough and tumble world of social media and i was like you know so it's like i thought we were cool and then this like filmmaker type person came to the office they're like wow incredible place um quiet day huh i was like what do you mean like normal day he's like everyone's just sitting there with their headphones on like not talking to each other like oh that's what we do all day he's like well what would we film and i was like well sometimes we have like a meeting where we look at the numbers i guess yeah i guess you're right we're lame as hell and so yeah that that is so lame i i it's always embarrassing when people like i sometimes our address in the daily email was in our email and people would stop by and i'm like yeah so this is the one room that we sit down in there's the bathroom can go to the left side or the right side you want to see what it looks like from this corner just like we just sit here don't talk sometimes for three hours at a time there's music playing in the background every once in a while your office was hilarious dude it's like why do the dogs sit in chairs and the people have to sit on the ground like i love dogs it's like why is you know what's going on here why is there only peanut butter in the kitchen yeah dude i used to eat like a jar of peanut butter every two days that was my step so then let me tell you this other interesting thing so i don't know if you remember this but there was a that's so funny by the way you remember the peanut butter i would eat so much peanut butter we also we also used to do eating contests once a month that's like a fun thing because like we were idiots and we didn't have a lot of money to like go into a family or like a team building thing and we would just go and buy like 500 burger king chicken mcnuggets because that's only like 50 bucks and we'd be like the first person to eat 100 wins which is a horrible idea for dozens of reasons the first reason being everyone's sick afterwards it can't work the second reason being it's just stupid and the third reason being like no one does it and they just puke uh and we would do a crispy cream eating contest a burger king chicken mcnugget contest white castle it was the worst i was an idiot dude i think these videos still exist online when i was doing my very first startup straight out of college which was like two buddies doing this stupid sushi restaurant thing living in one apartment you know like my buddy lived in my closet my co-founder lived in my closet and like you know we we all we would basically buy air mattresses and like return them every 90 days to target because we were like oh you could just like get your money back is awesome yeah yeah idiots totally living the high life with this and so um basically we were like i don't know why we were like you know the way to make our restaurant you know a restaurant's not open yet but what can we do that's like our scrappy mark i don't know why we even thought this was like remotely relevant we're like let's get people invested in the journey of building this to do that let's create a youtube channel and we called it the duel and it was me my friend and the opening clip is like a high noon like a standoff like we both walked 15 paces away turned around and looked at each other dramatically and it's like the music's on and then we we would take a challenge from anybody who commented on the youtube channel and we would do that thing and so i was like oh you're doing a sushi restaurant brush your teeth with wasabi as toothpaste for one minute and so we like did it and then we would it's like you know uh whatever we did these like really dumb things you get to see they're like in this apartment yeah i mean crappy uh ugly looking kids and it was pretty big i mean you had literally dozens of subscribers i remember we i went out to a casino one time and my sister was in town and this guy goes you're the wasabi guy and my sister was like what are you famous and like i was like what am i famous and it was like it was like the first hint of what was you know fast forward 12 years i created the podcast uh like but in that moment i was like this feels nice if i do dumb [ __ ] people will then know me and then it ends after that and all i tacked on later was like and then i could sell cohort-based courses that became the the end point but um anyways long story short i uh if you remember when clubhouse was popping off there was this group of also people in college like people just graduating college in college that created that show shoot your shot do you remember this yeah it was popular like really popular for four weeks basically and if i remember correctly it was like three good looking women and they would call up a guy and the guy would hit on him or would the girls make fun of the guy i forget so they created a room that was called nyu girls nyu girls on clubhouse which was already interesting because clubhouse was just sf dudes and so you go from sf dudes to nyu girls that's like a major like you know uh you know walking into a a room full of bears with a pocket full of honey it was like well what's going on there's there's interesting people on this app just like you just imagine a bunch of like good-looking soho women who hang out with james franco write poetry and like you know don't wear bras like like that's like it's like stereotype oh nyuh there's already no bras on clubhouse but now there's girls with no problems right so anyways they created the show and shoot your shot was basically call up a awkward tech dude onto the stage and he got to like shoot his shot kind of like basically like a a ultra budget version of the bachelors like come on here and spit game at one of these girls and we're going to talk for 20 minutes and we can either boot you off or we like you and like you're in the group you you kind of passed the rite of passage thing a little dating show and so it started organically but it got to be like the most popular show on clubhouse which was you know the small pawn syndrome right like you were the best thing in a small little growing pond and so anyways it was embarrassing i listened to i was embarrassed i was like it was it wasn't bad but i was like oh they're gonna make fun of them oh don't make fun of them or like don't say something stupid guy please like i was rooting for the men like don't do not to screw up you know they would get out they'd be like hey uh you know my name is uh you know akbar and you know typical sas guy and they're like sassy guy and he's like no like sass like b to be sass what are you saying what are these words akbar words so anyways they do you know what they're doing now so the fact that the fact that you said that phrase about them i'm already on board like in yeah yeah yeah for listening to this somewhere he's just like there's i could do it again like a highlight of my life so i met the main girl who was behind me i think her name is devin and we did a zoom call you know she's like what's up nerd yes and guess what loved it i did the zoop call you know when you beat a founder like within sometimes within 60 seconds you're like all right you're a star so you're a star that's established now now i just got to figure out is this your dumb idea you're kind of dumb idea or you're a good idea because you're going to go through probably all three and i just got to figure out where you're at in life uh have you met founders for sure and it's just like you're you're not you're not there yet but i i still am interested in buying the stock and getting it i think that's why a lot of people invested in me at the hustle same thing with me like i'm like god people gave us this idea for our sushi restaurant like you know uh and they were helping us and they really liked us like i thought that meant we have a good business idea and actually what was happening but now that i'm i'm in that position i'm like they're just like oh this guy's gonna do [ __ ] i like this guy's mojo this is his dumb idea and like you know whatever i'm on board to get to the good idea like i'd like to start this relationship now yeah so that as he figures this [ __ ] out you know things good things happen that's how i felt about this girl and so she is she's like an nyu woman like is she like uh that age yeah she was at nyu and then she graduated and so now she's like i don't know shortly out of nyu so she's raised six million dollars now what to build um her show mad reality so the old thing was nyu girls roast tech guys that's what the room was called on clubhouse which was great and now it's called mad realities and mad realities they have a it's a they they went to like web 3 and like all the stuff right like uh you know i don't know if you need to do that they basically gave nfts out to the audience audience gets to vote it's like the bachelor but the audience like votes on what's gonna happen in the show and so it's a reality show where the viewers kind of like you know they can kind of help fork the show and engage with the plot in some way and um fans vote them off or whatever and so they created the show you could be an nfc holder you get a you're a rose holder i don't know like they've raised i think 172 each so what is that today like at today's prices that's like 250 grand of sales of their nft so not not huge but you know not terrible but like the a plus firm in crypto paradigm um invested in it led the round i think do they do is their reputation to do anything that's decent or are they selective uh paradigm they're a little mix of both like they're the smart guys in the room but i also think like part of being the smart guy you know like the smart guy starts to do weird and crazy [ __ ] and you're like uh you sure this makes sense and they're like no it doesn't but that's why it makes the most sense it's like all right you know like uh like founder's friend you just invested in like i don't know like this plant that like only causes you to hallucinate in a bad way they're like hallucinogens have a bad rap and you're like all right like in 30 years hallucinations will be your morning cup of coffee and you're like i don't think that's true but you're so smart at you're good at chess and math so like i guess i'll just defer to you on everything in life that's yeah you you were paypal in 2008 you know what you're doing you know your hobby is cryptography and you created paypal so like i guess i'll roll with you on this like you know kombucha that you're investing in even though it doesn't really seem like that big of an idea so anyways that's kind of what what i felt like was going on here like here's their uh investors so paradigm led it paris hilton uh [ __ ] mccormick you know like scott belski friend of the pod uh you know our homie who's super smart but i think you know when i met this woman oh there's like a bunch of names i don't recognize besides that like you know probably you know i don't know edm djs or something people i don't know maybe yeah you have to like leave your house to know these people and say i'm out you know the the um but but i thought this was kind of interesting like to create a show and i've actually been i don't think that this is so two things can't came to mind one was when you're a star you're gonna get funded to do some dumb [ __ ] and that's okay i actually think it's a smart idea to like back these star people because they're gonna do amazing things in their life as long as they just keep taking attempts um i think this is probably not her best idea but you know three years from now whatever she's building is probably going to be amazing i'm on their site and i'm just skimming through their videos i don't know man it seems like they're executing kind of well on maybe a dumb idea it seems like a dumb idea but like my wife is a very smart you know techy woman and uh she like is obsessed with the bachelor or the bachelorette whatever i don't even know what it is uh like we have to have we have it in the house i know i think it's like tuesday at eight o'clock it's like on and like way to throw people off your trail there say the wrong date yeah like you don't sit down every monday with your with your glass of rose with sarah and you guys don't watch this together holding holding toes i can't that'd be weird i i can't stand it all i know is this season it's two women picking dudes and i just don't like i i don't like the thing at all but i know that it's a huge deal it's still like a huge deal and my wife sarah is like talking to all of her friends about it consistently so like i don't know man this is kind of a cool idea so it definitely does seem big and i i actually do think that you and i don't know about you but i don't know anything about the movie business or hollywood or entertainment i don't know anything about that and when people talk to me about like a production company i'm like what the [ __ ] is a production company like i don't know what that is but i do know that reese witherspoon owned one of them things she owned one of the production company things and it got acquired by blackstone for like 500 million dollars like a few months ago and i do know that uh one of the richest black men in america i believe his name is byron allen and uh when i was i was reading about on wikipedia i wanted to learn more about what this guy did and it was like talking about his production company and all these shows that he made like damn dude whatever this is it's actually much bigger and more organized than i ever even imagined so it's funny you bring that up i've been actually in the lab it's not ready yet but we're gonna take it out for a spin right now which is i've been in the lab learning about production companies and um i'm gonna tell you kind of like here's the here's my can i give you just like random rant like it's hard to understand right normally i have to have like a package like a take on it that's what i like to be but you brought it up so let me give you the unpackaged unfiltered raw yeah give me that so far yeah exactly exactly hey turn the oven down we don't need it we got a spoon in the dough i want this content extra gooey so all right so what's going on so basically there's streaming wars going on netflix disney hulu everybody's fighting for subscribers okay well how am i going to differentiate from if i'm netflix how do i differentiate from hulu and hbo and all this stuff basically they need original content okay so that's created this like huge imbalance of there used to be a lot of content and a small amount of distribution now there's a lot of distribution fighting for a small amount of content and all the distribution players have just decided like the prize is big let's lose money for a lot of like several years and invest billions into content and like let's be the last person standing and so they're they're investing on what you call a j curve where the curve goes down you lose a bunch of money and then a j like a j it goes way up and you make money later what that means for these production companies is they'll overpay there's a bidding war and they're willing to overpay for my content and so um so like just last year basically ruth witherspoon lebron will smith kevin hart they have sold stakes in their production companies uh so like for example kevin hart he has something called heartbeat he raised a hundred million from private equity first 15 of the companies 650 million dollar valuation kevin kevin hart 50 of their revenue comes from the studio arm which they produce shows for peacock for netflix and uh yes they make movies and shows explain what that means so uh they have writers on staff or writers come to them with an idea they go this is intriguing we're gonna pay money we're gonna pay a hundred or five hundred thousand dollars we're gonna get some actors and a set we're gonna make one or two episodes of this we're gonna shop it around and then someone will buy it and we make profit exactly so i'm gonna use a hollywood term that i don't know how to use but i'm gonna just like you know whip it out here they option it what does that mean when they option it it's like you know they basically like it's like they take an option on the future of this thing and they basically take you know they create a sizzle reel or it's like a two minute teaser or they create a pilot or they create nothing they just have the pitch and the concept and you're kevin hart you go walk into six studios you say um it's a movie where you know me and a tall guy you know uh we you know we or co-workers that don't like each other but then we get trapped in an elevator and they're like love it we'll take it you know and you're like you know how much does it need it's like we're gonna need a hundred million dollars to do this of that you're gonna pay the production company x millions of dollars to go produce this movie there's some margin in that and then um you know they're gonna and you're gonna you know whatever the revenue or the upside would be you know of the project we're going to have some some split and presumably also has other um you know businesses that that produce so 50 come from the studio arm well what's the other 50 it's a combination of other things like content licensing brand consulting work for companies like png lyft sam's club stuff like that i don't know what he's doing but like that's kevin hart's business but the value here is presumably kevin hart and team know about what type of content gets eyeballs and gets engagement they presumably have connections with all the big players and they have some money that they'll finance things up front and and and that's they're curators and operators and they're the influencer so it's it's like you know everybody kind of knew hey if you go get an a-list star you put tom cruise in the movie more people are going to watch well what these guys have realized lebron rhys witherspoon kevin hart the rock he has his own production company what they do what they realize is oh let's just go vertically integrated like let's not just be the talent that helps sell the tickets at box office let's also be the production company that creates the thing and then and then what they don't do is the streaming platform part they're like okay we'll we'll partner on that but we're gonna do these other components ourselves so they're also you know the big part isn't just that kevin hart knows what people want it's like one of the things people want is kevin hart so he's like cool i'm gonna own a little more of my upside if i do this and you know who crushes it this way [ __ ] ryan seacrest i was reading about ryan seacrest and american idol and this guy that guy is a workhorse and he has a production uh company that kills it yeah you know you know our buddy pomp pomp is like the ryan seacrest of the crypto industry right like he's just everywhere it's like dude you've got a morning show and then an afternoon show then you're producing this thing and then at night you do this like wow you your output is unmatched that's ryan seacrest yeah output is crazy it's like 20 years i'm on radio for three hours a morning for 20 years then i do this then i put on my suit then i host this then i produced the he produced the kardashians show yeah and then he's like uh then i go do american idol and after american idol i go do this other things like jeez man like uh like blink you know what's going on he's grinding man yeah that guy kills it then there's reese witherspoon she sold her uh company they they made the morning show which was that big show on apple tv plus big little lies for hbo she sold that to candle media which is basically like a bunch of disney execs spun off and with like blackstone back them for like a billion dollars or whatever and so she sold her entertainment company to them 900 million she creates shows around women that's like her shtick and so um she is awesome i'm a big reese fan reese witherspoon at brad pitt if you're in it i go to it you called a reese witherspoon earlier and i just thought that was a nice like touch i never heard that that rendition before i liked your remix um so so you know how much money this just raised you know how much uh money her thing made 120 million in 2021 in revenue or price and they expect revenue um so they expected to double it to 310 million in 2022 so blackstone paid like roughly a 7x revenue of where they bought them they bought um so it's kind of crazy and um so they basically they don't own any ownership they make the show for the streaming service and and then by the way they also when they bought the company she also has a book club that's like ridiculous do you know about her yeah she also has a clothing brand the clothing brain brand wasn't a part of it but daper james or drapper james or something like that what's it called i don't know dapper maybe something like that and then she has a book club it's sunshine something like hello sunshine book club is that what it's called i think it's just called reese's book club uh but it has 2 million followers or members in it i don't that's like kind of a silly number um so what she does is she promotes her favorite books and then what she does is she goes to those books she's like hey i'm about to blow your ass up but also i want the option rights to make a show out of your book if i can and so she's like market tests the books with her book club makes money there uses that leverage to get the rights to that book to make a show out of it then sells the show rights to the next girlfriend she's great man she's great you know like cut throat you know like media mogul wow like you know innocent rhys is just like that's an amazing model um so yeah i think that's kind of crazy and also she also sold i think the data so like um you know like either like you can like the people who bought it i think they get like you know access to that membership of the book club and then the data around them of what they like what they dislike so long story short this mad realities thing you kind of just did the pitch for them where i'm like okay the macro thing that's as an uneducated person that's that's mildly interesting that's a that's an interesting story you you kind of sold like this actually could be a huge thing this could be as big as any other tech company almost so that's interesting this young woman doesn't have you know she doesn't have the clout or connections likely that rhys or whoever has but like she's got the charm i buy it and and the hustle and i think uh if i was her so here's my brainstorm for her i think i might have told her this at some point but uh whatever i think if i was her i would not be trying to create this like standalone show so i would immediately have been shopping this i would say hey here's the deal i can make you the next too hot to handle love island love is blind i'm going to make one of these shows and what i would first do is i would build this i would build the audience on tick tock or snapchat so i'd first go and sell it to the social platforms that also want original cool content for a small amount of money i'd say hey i'm going to create cool dating i'm going to create a dating show on top of tick tock what's that worth to you guys and they'll say oh like we'll give you 300 000 or a million dollars out of our creator fund you know like because tick tock has i think a 200 million dollar creator fund right so i'd go to them and be i'd go get a million million a half dollars to create the tick tock dating show and then i would just take that popularity and i would say hey netflix hey whoever we have the small cult following and we could build these that you're you know bachelor these speak to like you know 37 year old women and up or whatever you know some random yeah i just kind of pitch it as an older demographic i'd say you know i can get you this sort of like 14 to 25 year old um dating show audience because they want this other thing and like you know like and basically create a production company that's creating dating shows aimed at my market and try to be the reese witherspoon of dating reality tv but i'd be not like doing web 3 crypto and and doing it on my own website i'd be going and shopping it to where there's a whole bunch of buyers and i'm sure they've they've had conversations i know that that's not like new to them but like i think that path can work and i would just go all in on that path because i think when you go all in on a path it's very different than just we've thought about that or yeah we've had a couple conversations we've tried it it's very different than yes i've bet the whole thing on making that work and come hell or high water i'm gonna wake up every morning and figure out how do i go get hulu to buy this how do i go get peacock to buy this how do i go get netflix to buy this and what product do i need to create that that's my end customer actually so let me ask you a practical question that that on on how easy this is to pull off so you know who mark manson is mark manson wrote the book uh the subtle article of yeah the subtle art i'm not giving a [ __ ] basically i was like just like i've hung out with him once or twice and uh seemed like a really nice guy and i was just googling like mark manson house and it said mark manson just sold this tribeca condo for 15 million dollars and then i was last year i was reading like the wall street journal or news corp or whatever the company that owns uh penguin publishing his publisher i was reading all their annual report and they said mark manson's book like revolutionized our business so like clearly this is a 50 billion dollar company and they're referring to mark constantly so i'm like wow that that's amazing and i started researching his book and it all stemmed from a blog post he he launched a blog one blog called this is the subtle art of not giving a [ __ ] and he that was a hit and then he took it on and he uh made it into a book another guy naval neval had angel list so he was already successful so it's not exactly the same thing he had a few interesting bits of content out there but then he had this tweet called how to get rich and it was long tweet storm and it like kind of was a hit and if he were a little bit hungrier like mark was then he could easily parlay that into something bigger than what it was you know whatever when you so you've done this before as well you've written maybe three different tweets that like got read five or tens of millions of times and i don't know if you would say it was career changing but like it was like somewhat trajectory changing i don't know how big that trajectory is but let's start at the root level of a tweet and like with a tv show or a movie or a broadway show being like the highest form if you were given 10 shots and you had one to two weeks per shot for a tweet and then let's say maybe a blog post and then let's say like a podcast and then let's say a youtube video how many of those 10 times if you had a week or so to prepare into research do you think would become a hit well there's two versions of a hit a hit can be it does well and then there's a hit like the clubhouse throughout or the metaverse threat or stuff like that where it gets to like 20 million people and like you know like those were hits those were like i don't know super hits or grand slams which one do you mean like the those like absolute bangers or just like this gets thousands of likes and gets shared maybe it gets read ten thousand times or a hundred thousand times a blog post that gets like well so let's just say there's friends in seinfeld and the simpsons and then maybe there's like family guy and then maybe there's like the bachelorette or the bachelor and then like below that it's like famous threads yeah below that what's another tv show that's like it's like it's actually it's like a hit but it's like uh like the goldberg there's like people busking on the street and below that is your threat no i mean like look like you know your version of family guys so far has been one or two things that you've written but then you've had like a bunch of like mild hits so i i think if i the po i think to answer your question if i tried the way you said i think seven out of ten would like do very well and then probably one out of every ten would be one out of every ten maybe one out of every twenty yeah it's gonna say zero to one probably gonna be like a banger yeah yeah okay so that's just like a tweet which is like easy ish to go viral to create um now let's go a step up a youtube video how many youtube videos if you had 10 tries do you think or let's say 20 could be like a hit honestly i i don't know if i'm gonna answer your question the way you want because i kind of think for youtube videos it's a little easier i don't know why i think maybe because we hung out with mr beast and i was like oh okay i get it like i get it i get what goes into like i get what a viral concept would be that people would click and that they would share i get what the hook would be and i get like you know how to like have the big payoff the big reveal um and also i haven't done it so you know things seem easier when you haven't done it when you haven't like gone and tried actually but i actually think i could have higher hit rate with youtube videos because you get editing you get like a whole bunch of things that go into it compared to a twitter thread which is very intellectual like a youtube video you can like lean on other things to make it interesting like the visual the like just literally the fact that it's like a visual it's a lean back experience versus like hey read these 15 tweets and like i hope i've tickled you like the smart part of your brain enough or you give a [ __ ] um so i actually think a youtube video i think if i try it on youtube i think seven or eight out of 10 i think would hit right like in a major way amp it up you have more time you have a million plus money dollars you have a little bit of a team you have to make a hit show once a quarter or once every six months or once a year at most or at least what uh do you think you could actually come up with a hit like how hard do you think coming up with a hit would be uh you have more money you've got more time you have more resources you have to hit you have to have a hit show and it doesn't have to be a friends but it has to be a we're happy that we gave you money for this and we're going to keep buying you how many times out of 10 do you think you could do that i think that's lower than the youtube video for me personally because i'll tell you the reason why because that's what we're talking about here yeah when you do a show you're you're basically you bet it all up front and then you find out way later the feedback loop is extremely slow compared to youtube youtube is like i can go from concept to production to getting the feedback of is this good or bad within a week two weeks something like that and um and so i'm gonna get a bunch of reps i can try a bunch of different things and so over the during that process i'll find a formula that works whereas with the show it's probably like i get one one attempt at it ever in life uh it'll take me like a year to produce another year to distribute by the time that's all done whether i was right or wrong i'm gonna be like i just hope that i got it right the first time and so i actually think my hit rate on a show would be way lower i think like you know two out of ten or three out of ten something like that that's crazy and i answered the way you thought or no yeah you did and an interesting exercise i didn't prepare for this but an interesting exercise is to think how many game-changing pieces of content like mark's book um we'd have to think of a few more examples we could probably think of a lot of books um just started with like a really small thing and they're like oh that's an interesting vein let's actually pursue that uh and that's like an interesting exercise because his book created tens of millions of dollars worth of value and it basically kind of almost on the headline itself it's kind of a winner and then i'm sure the blog post which i haven't even read i'm sure that was actually fire and amazing but i wonder how many amazing bits of content have i just started with a small little rinky dink thing right i i bet a ton and also i think for me at least the way i do things i'm that way where it's like oh cool i want to write the book let's just tweet out one tweet all right now five tweets about that same topic all right now let's tell them to subscribe to a newsletter right let's just see how much i got what what's resonating over like for example i'll go look at any thread if it's 10 tweets i'll go see which of these has the most likes that's like not like normally a thread will just have like kind of like in descending order like the first we'll have a lot of likes the last two you'll have a lot of likes and then it'll just fall off from there but what you'll find is when you have a good joke or a good one line or a good analogy or whatever that one tweet will get way more likes and so that's a great way to teach yourself how to speak better how to tweet better how to be more compelling when you do stuff is to like go look at that and you can do it with other people's threads too that's what i do i go look at other people's threads and i'm sort of looking at oh that's interesting that one seemed people really like loved that one liner okay that's that's cool i like how they did that that's i can pick that up for my game that's crazy yeah by the way one one other numbers here so lebron's production company 45 million in 2020 uh revenue revenue 100 million in 2021 and um they basically do the same thing but they do a bunch of stuff so they have uh like uninterrupted which is videos and like it's good i like it uh they also have like merchandise apparel there's like a clothing brand then they have the hbo series the shop then they made the new space jam movie and so his company spring hill uh basically created a bunch of these and they did the same thing they went and sold it to others if i was these guys on if i'm if i'm lebron and i have so much income coming from other things i would play a really long game because i think that going and selling the shop to hbo like the shop is actually a pretty dope show it's like this barbershop and they get like you know whatever whoever big actors nfl players players just shooting the [ __ ] in a barbershop setting and it's like really high quality it's great it's kind of like mfm but famous people who are more interesting better and getting haircuts yeah take what you see now yeah trim my beard first of all secondly we're more athletic more successful funnier cool you know all right so so basically that show is awesome but how many of lebron's fans right lebron's fans are like mostly younger people like you know that's like if you're an nba star your fans go from like you know eight years old on up they don't have hbo and so it's like if i'm him why am i not playing the long game jeff bezos style and just saying i'm gonna drop this dope premium content on uh youtube tiktok instagram whatever and i'm gonna put the whole thing here i'm gonna blow normal content out of the water here because i'm bringing production budgets to this and actually i'm going to invest like what michael jordan did with his like uh the last dance like the last dance like documentary it's like i'm going to invest a lot of money but i'm not going to like put it behind like netflix is okay because it's a paywall a lot of people have um but i would just put it on youtube and i would basically bet that if i grow my brand and my legacy through this content um there's a bigger payoff than what the streaming companies are going to pay me today and i would be willing to invest 20 30 50 million dollars in order to build like a billion dollar plus type of brand payoff at the end because you will just be like you know worshiped and adored even more than you already are and so you know you want to go on one end of the spectrum or the other you want to go like i'm getting paid a stupid amount of money and it doesn't really matter how many people watch this or i want everybody to watch this and i'll pay money to get it there because there's a bigger payoff for me outside of that you know like the logan paul method where it's like everything's free everything's on youtube i'm in your face and then i'll launch my like energy drink and i think their energy drink does like some stupid number like it's doing really well like 100 million dollars a year or something like well i i i don't know the exact number i heard about on the pod they were talking about how they did 10 like i think it was around 10 million in month one of sales um but i actually think that the that drink business um if like mr beast has a 40 chocolate business i'm curious if some of these low ticket items can actually become like legitimately great companies as opposed to just okay uh i think it's hard to sell a two dollar drink uh and make it like work really well so we'll see if they'll make it work but but dude all these water companies do amazing but many don't obviously i mean many times but if you got the distribution right like why is mr beast not doing beast water because he can basically pair it with like you know like that boxed water thing where it's like this is better for the earth yeah it's like mr beast likes that [ __ ] where he's just like oh we're gonna plant a billion trees and the way we're gonna plant billion trees is by not doing plastic water bottles all right everybody join me this is mr beast you know aluminum cans sparkling water like go [ __ ] lacroix up all right like go go [ __ ] these guys up like mr beast could destroy these guys right like uh you know like beast water like go into the things go go make products that everybody on earth consumes because you're the mainstream like content maker right so it's like dude when he when he had the chocolate i was like damn dude i want to like eat this chocolate because i want to like you know show you like appreciation for like being here and you brought your item and like yeah sure i'll eat some of it but i felt so bad eating it because i don't like eating that type of stuff i mean i don't eat a chocolate bar on a daily basis well i yeah and i love it and i'm sorry i thought eating it i was like i don't want to eat this but i want to be respectful and kind and because he brought this thing and i was like dude you need to make something different that i that that i like can consume guilt-free i don't know that many people that just eat chocolate like a like a hershey's chocolate bar you know what i mean you're correct in fact that's a filter i have if i ever just see you just eating a chocolate bar on a tuesday like i'm going to begin to distance myself right like i'm trying to be around a certain type of person that's like you know healthier come to think about it i don't know anybody that doesn't actually you know funny story uh when i joined monkey inferno i was like um so what was it like the last product manager the la the guy so i joined as a pm product manager the guy who was there before me was this guy alex too who created a million-dollar homepage back in the day and now is the founder of calm like a multi-billion dollar company he was the boss of monkey inferno not the boss he was he was like the product manager so he was the product manager there he quit to go start calm and um they were like i was like oh how's alex like you know i love that guy's work like you know millionaire homepage is dope calm interesting like meditation is he just like super zen or what like is he huge on meditation they're like you know that's the funny thing they're like i think he needs calm i wouldn't say he is calm i was like what do you mean like you know alex is a fun time dude he's like he loves to hang he likes to go out like he loves to have drinks like you know he's just like a young dude like in his 20s in a big city like you know he's he's not like waking up every morning going to his japanese like you know you know garden and just like sitting there for eight hours just you know contemplating you know the thoughts in his mind and so i was like what's the crate what's the most degenerate thing i was like give me a story what's degenerate thing the founder of calm is down they go i remember one time he came in and he was kind of hung over and he just got a bowl like you know for cereal like his office had like a kitchen he's like but instead of cereal he just went put a bunch of m ms in there with a spoon and just ate it i was like i don't know if this story is true or false but it's hilarious and i'm running with it that's awesome i remember thinking at that time if calm ever becomes a thing i'm always gonna remember that you know like you know that story there's like one of these like hilarious small small stories he's a d-gen just like us our software is the worst have you heard of hubspot see most crms are a cobble together mess but hubspot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous i think i love our new crm our software is the best hubspot grow better when we had our office i remember i was having a bad day and when i had bad days i like to like punish myself by eating poorly you know it's like that's like my version of just like drinking a 12 pack and i it was me and my writer connor were still in the office at like 8 p.m and i was like connor today sucked i was like i looked at him i go i bet you i can eat this whole jar of unopened skippy in three bites and i did and i did and i felt so horrible for like three days and so that was my that was my dj diet moment was just eating an entire jar of skippy peanut butter in 30 seconds that's crazy um all right let me give you the thing i'm currently obsessed with so the thing i'm currently obsessed with i brought this up maybe three four times people may be sick of this by time by now but i feel like no one is talking about it i feel like not enough people are freaking out about what's going on with artificial intelligence for creating art so uh we've talked about this before uh there's gpt3 which is basically ai that will write something for you so you could just give it a prompt it'll write the essay there's dali where you just uh type in a thing it'll generate images like as if you searched it on google but i now have like a bigger picture view of this which is you know like in the early days of the web the big winner was search engines yeah so you know google obviously was like a search engine because it's like oh the internet basically technology's now put a bunch of information out there so we need a search engine to basically find the thing we want now what's happening is you have a generation engine right a generative engine is you go search for the thing and it creates it for you right so it's like it's that's just like right there is like a mind-blowing concept instead of searching the internet for a thing that might be out there what's the closest thing to what i want it's just to say i i have basically the genie from aladdin and i can go say play me a song that mixes like kind of like beethoven and kanye but it's about you know taking mushrooms and literally ai will just create a song and guess what it doesn't suck and to me this is so insane this is so mind-blowing every demo i see i'm just like i drop immediately what i'm doing i'm like well what i'm doing is stupid like oh like cool a podcast you know like oh what am i doing like talking to my mother who cares about my mother there's a.i that can create [ __ ] that you just like spit out of your mouth and so i think i really just want to go down this rabbit hole and figure out what all this is going to be going to be able to do so now there's this new thing called stable diffusion have you seen this one no stable diffusion's the new demo that came out unlike dolly they basically they didn't like kind of pay wall it and so anybody can go and use it and you just type in a prompt so you're like like go to the subreddit stabled so go to stable diffusion subreddit uh just to see like what people create so it's r stable diffusion so just look at the top thing right so um i look at like um let me show you a good one okay go to the one that says wendy's do you see it like scroll down maybe top from one today or it's hot i just like normal sorting so hot and then go down five and just look at wendy's oh yeah oh my god and this is awesome so how does this work so basically you just type in like the prompt right so um the prompt that he gave was a beautiful portrait of wendy's mascot intricate elegant elegant and highly detailed and then it just creates this like beautiful redheaded girl holding a burger with fries and it's like it looks like this incredible art and um and so you could just and then you you could just you just hit the dream but that was the button like you know the google button is like search or i'm feeling lucky the one on this says dream and you hit dream and it just it'll just morph it it'll morph it it'll morph it it'll morph it'll morph it'll just keep making new ones instantaneously it's like working with a designer it's like try again give me something else no not that okay make it blue and it'll just instantaneously recreate something incredible uh right then right so it's like um it's it's just mind-blowing what it's creating and then you can see these videos so go down uh just do like a ctrl f and uh write the words preview of next feature um and it's a picture of a duck yeah it's a picture of a duck and it's like it looks like a guy in photoshop or paint making a duck right so he's he's in i think i think it's photoshopped as the actual tool but uh it looks like a microsoft paint duck so it's just like a yellow blob with an orange little duckbill right all right so it's a two minute video what he's showing is he created a photoshop plugin using stable diffusion that lets you draw anything crappy and then you just run the plugin and watch get to the end so like go all the way to the end and so he just adds a little blue and so by the end you see this basically like this like fancy looking duck wearing a monocle and like a blue like tuxedo shirt and it's like the sophisticated ass duck dude if i'm a web designer i'm freaking out right now hey we thought ai would like you know uh it's going to automate the shitty jobs it's like actually it's coming for your throat artist like dude so i i've been i followed this guy i've been looking for his name i found him his name is lou yah so l-o-u-y-a-h and i follow him on tick-tock and what he does is every once in a while he'll have a post where he he's a producer and he'll be like here's a rap country song that doesn't exist and he makes a song and they sound great and he's he's done this a bunch of times and um martin shkreli in one of his blog posts he said when i was in prison i had a lot of time to think here's a bunch of predictions that i have for the next 100 years as well as timelines so one of his predictions he'll be like we're going to land on mars by 2050 or whatever and another prediction is a artificially made song is going to be in the top 10 most played songs in the world and on billboard top 10 inside the next 18 months like he put a time limit on it and i and i'm on board with that i 100 believe in that i 100 believe in that and i don't get why more people aren't freaking out there are obviously pockets of people who really are really interested in this people see the demo but like it's kind of like um we just passed up a purple unicorn while we were driving on a road trip it's like oh wow barbara unicorn and we just like okay uh you guys want to stop at wendy's and it's like dude wait hold on there was a purple unicorn next to the road like pull over what are we doing like i think everybody needs to pull over and be like what the hell is happening this is gonna like this is so insane to me um and i just feel like these idea like there's gonna be a google-like company that's not a search engine it's a generation engine it's a dream engine you're gonna go there you're gonna say what you wish i think somebody's gonna make this for kids like i was like dude i could make i didn't i told you before i was like i'm interested in creating like a pixar like company but it's like why would i create one movie what if i created an app that my daughter could just talk to no no text input she can't type she just could say a duck surfing you know with an ipad and like you know holding an ipad and like she could just say any words and this thing would create not only an image but it could create an animation it could create a set of animations it could create a whole story based off that she could create her own movie just by saying you know a boy who loves soccer but he's sad because he doesn't get enough chocolate and it would create you know a movie based on that it would create a portrait based on that and like she could create art just with her imagination to me is wild have you ever heard this theory that your words shape your thoughts and it's not just like positive thinking it's like literally if that if a word that doesn't describe a particular type of feeling exists in your language then it's hard for you to have that feeling so this particular example isn't exactly proven to be true and a lot of people debate it but there was a group of africans who didn't have like the perfect word for square or like a 90 degree angle and all of their homes were in circles they were like circled and so they didn't they for some reason like the idea of like square and 90 degrees it just wasn't part of their their language and so everything a lot of items in their in their culture were circles or uh there's like terms for like you know i'm feeling depressed but i'm not suicidal or something in like a different country and like that's like a better word sometimes than like depressed and so people are like oh you know i'm just in this mood and they can explain it a little bit better and they feel that way and and it's almost like explaining to a blind person like hey tell me what red looks like it's like i don't know i can't i can't explain what that is when i'm it's too hard i don't have that my vocabulary with something like this i wonder if there's if it will unlock like a new way of storytelling or a new way of seeing art and it will actually could actually change our our mindset on a lot of different things because like if you if you if you want to make a movie now i mean you're going to be influenced by everything that exists and then occasionally someone's going to come and do something totally mind-break mind-changing and that one person is like kind of once-in-a-generation type of person and they just like are really unique like a steve jobs but when you have something that is collectively aggregating all of the data in the world that has ever existed and then coming up with something interesting do you know what i mean like right i wonder what like the the the that's how i've been thinking about it like man well the new stuff that this thing can come out with i can't i literally can't think of you know what i mean totally because what they do is they train it on like just you know they basically go scrape gigabytes and gigabytes and gigabytes of images from the web and they basically there's a big controversy around that some people are like that's unethical those people who put their images up on the web they didn't know it was gonna be it was gonna be used to train ai that was going to then put them out of work like that's you know that's not so great but like and by the way there's like a name for this some people are trying to do vegan ai you know what that is no but that's awesome vegan ai is basically ai that's trained only on non-copyright written work so it's like like worked out images that were like uh intentionally said to be royalty free out there for public use out there for use it however you want um it's like if it was only trained on that it's sort of like grass-fed well right what's like a perfect example of this and like is the ultimate villain move is github which is a website that uh developers post code on it's almost like uh it's part practicality they post code so you could share it but they also like it's like a portfolio almost and what github is doing which is owned by microsoft at this point i think they are basically like using ai to scan all the best code of all the code that has ever been uploaded and you can kind of like am i explaining this right you can they've using ai to write new code based off of all the users who have input data and the users are like oh cool so you're taking our portfolio you're and you're going to use it to put us out of work that that's nice right yeah and uh and i think nat freeman who is the i think he was this i feel like he was the ceo of github for a period of time i don't know if he still is but he just tweeted out he goes the 10 billion dollar ai first product idea hiding in plain sight is github co-pilot which is the name of the thing you said right like the ai assistant that helps you write your code for customer support you can fine-tune it basically you have this archive of all of your thousands and thousands of company like uh tickets that were like resolved like resolved customer support issues um and your support rep who's just like you know random person sitting in you know maybe the philippines or something like that gets dramatically more productive and your customers get better and like training becomes easier because you have any company with 20 support 20 or more support reps he says you know would buy this and um and and so you know like that guy basically like i think co-pilot is like a billion dollar a year add-on to a billion more than a billion dollar a year add-on now for github because so many software developers opt into it because it makes them more productive so it's like how many other areas uh is that going to happen to you dude when we discuss this i'm like this is this is the type of like macro movement that it's like dude just quit what you're doing and just join get in somehow you know almost yeah i don't really like crypto but almost like crypto in like 09 or 11 or something like that or uh it's like i don't know man it's kind of hard to miss if you're just kind of in the in the in the ballpark 100 100 that's how i feel about this like that's wait we drove by a purple unicorn pull over the car pull over the car in your career and basically go dive in and figure out what this is and if people are already driven in tell me because i'm trying to dive in i want to learn as much as i can about this over the next six months because i find it fascinating i'm gonna i can't show this graph but i'm just gonna tell you a graph real quick all right there is a company i wonder if i could say the name i'm gonna say the name maybe we have to bleep this out later so there's a company called have you heard of this yeah i don't exactly know what they do but uh they're basically like an i think they're just like an ai copywriting solution that's another website just you know they're they based out of austin i think i met the founder actually so sounds cute right oh you know ai helps you copyright copywriting is this little niche thing that you and i are wearing we help people with copywriting to we both have like a copyrighted course or product like that here's their annual recurring revenue january of 2021 january 2.5 million that that's their annual recurring this is their error uh rate that they were at so um january january 2001 two and a half million that's pretty good like congrats um fast forward to april 5.7 million oh wow you guys doubled in four months like really great progress i'm super impressed like you guys this you guys are probably onto something this could be like a 100 million company or something like that fast forward to july 20 million dollar run rate oh wow what's going on it's one year you've gone from 2.5 to 20 million fast forward to october 40 million it's like what is happening in one year this went from two and a half million to 40 million dollar run rate that is absolute insanity to me i've i've never seen an ar chart like that now i don't know how did you get super legit uh someone shared it with me so you know i don't know how legit this is but um i don't think it's fake you know uh it's crazy to me so but it's just like kind of a mind-blowing level of traction god damn yeah i'm on board with this stuff this is pretty cool that's insane i can't believe how big that is wow it seems almost too good to be true all right anything else that we wanted to cover no that's the pod [Music] you

not sure if people realize it but if your app does twenty thousand a month in revenue you're probably already a millionaire twenty thousand dollars per month times twelve months assume you could sell for let's call it four or five multiple yeah that's a million dollar selling price and when you put it that way i think that sounds and it is way more achievable than this idea of like i gotta build a million dollar business do i have the big idea whatever that is a pathway to a millionaire status that does not require like winning the startup lottery of like inventing the next big thing or working and saving and paying your crazy w-2 taxes for like 15-20 years to get the same same outcome

so in like 2012 2013 2014 he started a vitamin brand and it only did okay and then he started also tinkering with a skincare brand which it actually did much better it got to like 10 million or so in revenue he hired a ceo the ceo kind of like drove it into the ground and didn't really do that well so he started focusing again to his vitamin brand and he's like look it's doing okay but who's the best customer of a vitamin company dogs because you and this is it i'm not disparaging him but like do they work yeah why not like fugazi you know like forget it yeah forgot welcome to fugazi inc yeah supplements for dogs they'll never tell you if it works or doesn't work [Music] what up what up are we supposed to like start with like a catchphrase now hey boys and girls welcome to the business show where you learn how to make so much money that you'll get taxed out the ass that's what rich people care about taxes if you don't care about taxes yet you ain't rich do you care about taxes yeah i like i don't i don't i'm not gonna live my life according to like where the low taxes are but like it's like the number two or number three thing that i'm thinking about so i'm thinking about this whole new york texas thing and i like do the math and i'm like damn like imagine i gotta rent a place for let's just say like 20 grand a month like that's how much taxes i'm paying by moving here versus staying or you know whatever it is like a lot of money a month well you have a good thing you could do the like texas as your main residence and spend four or five months out of the year in new york so that's not so bad that's not so bad but yeah i i need to do it with uh new york and florida because texas winter is not like winter winter that's desirable enough that you want a winter there you know what i mean yeah yeah dude have you heard about this like the teddy bear law the teddy bear what's that so i was asking my text guys i was like where do you keep your like possessions yeah basically i was like so what's the rule is it six months out of the year what does it take to have residency in some place and he was like well it's there's a bunch of little factors he's like but one he's like there was a famous case with derek jeter the the new york yankee shortstop they're like jeter wanted jeter played for the yankees in new york but he didn't want to pay new york taxes he wanted to pay florida taxes because he's like look this is my home this is where i live blah blah blah but you also have an apartment in new york and you play in new york you say you work there your home is there and your kids go to school there i think there and so they ended up it got uh ruled in in court and they called i think the the the name they call it as the i haven't looked this up it's like the teddy bear law and it's basically like where would you keep your teddy bear so the place you would call home so like factors like where your kids go to school where are the possessions that you love it all goes into this like umbrella to be like where do we actually think your home is and um and actually when i first heard this i was like wow that's really like subjective for like a ruling or a law and actually it's one of the laws i kind of agree with i actually think that that is more like how it should be done which is like dude what's the spirit of this do you actually live here or do you just like stay here for exactly six months and one day every year and i have to you know i don't actually know where you are at any given time but if you know if you're working in a place your kids go to school there all your possessions are there all your friends are there your family is there like that's where you live as an avid listener of dateline one of the easiest ways to catch the husband who kills the wife is like three weeks before he either bought like you know a trash bag and like a shovel or he googled like how to dispose of a body and last night i found myself googling and i was so embarrassed to do this so i went to an incognito window i was like i can't google this yeah like they're gonna know that i killed her yeah and it was like how does the state that you're visiting no like like if i'm renting and i don't even know what to google by the way i was trying to figure out how to phrase this but if i live in texas how does new york even know that i'm there if i'm just renting a place dude you know so funny you said that i did the same thing and like my queries sound exactly like does the irish really know it's like somehow somehow that's how it's like formatted in my search like so yeah like google would like to understand dude google needs to understand italicized really like the asterisk and everything it's like there's one browser that's just like hmm this guy's only ever incognito and he's either looking at porn or taxes like what's this guy's life like right because like basically it's like you know i'm trying to google like um when you get you know if the irs does this you is that like jail or justified yeah are we bringing a rule or a law right is this are taxes a recommendation or a requirement well when i learned google this googling this was the irs and i like it makes sense but i didn't even understand it irs is for federal so like uh but i pay my federal taxes no matter what but i'm like okay so then how does the state of new york actually know that i was ever here and i'm trying to like figure i want to i'm googling that to follow the rule but i am curious and i was going to be clear in case they also listen to podcasts i'm googling this a for a friend and b to enforce the law on my friend because i'm not here for anything else and i was just curious i'm just curious i'm like literally how does the state of new york even know that i exist i'm the same way i i'm the same way we're all go down this rabbit hole then i'm like 30 minutes in i'm like why am i even looking for this is not applicable at all to me but i'm like i just want to know how it works like i'll be like when you keep the receipt does anybody ever go read the receipts like you know what what actually are like you know there's this twitter account i love called uh how stuff works or something like that i love it and today they posted a thing of like it was like how luggage gets loaded into an airplane so there's a guy in the back of the airplane and then there's like a conveyor belt shooting suitcases at him and he's stacking it like a perfect tetris grid and i'm just like i do i love this account because it's always these these things where i'm like dude how does the world actually work like i you know i know i give them my suitcase but what happens after that and it's like sort of the same thing with like either taxes or like uh like all google just like you know rich people don't pay taxes but how like you know like what are these loopholes that i hear about are there are there really these loopholes like are like you know universities have this endowment what the hell are they doing with that and i'm just like always trying to get to the bottom of like i want to have like an actual understanding of what's going on and dude i feel like i have so little understanding about so many things on earth but it's so funny that you you brought that book i actually wrote i'm like doing the thing with maven again the ideation boot camp course and uh i started talking about the book that i had as a kid called how stuff works and there's another one where they just like split like a power tool into two and you just see like a picture of like how school bus like operates or whatever and i'm like the reason why researching which is what you and i do for this podcast is cool is because whether you like it or not america and the rest of the most of the world is you know guided by capitalism and commerce and so like if you understand how like a business works just like these books show you how like the luggage guy works then you kind of understand like what's possible and what's not possible why laws are the way they are why art is the way it is like you can you it's not just money making but it's just like the earth like just how the world and society and so uh i actually was just writing that yesterday and i totally agree and i think that's why i like studying businesses is cool and by the way like i think most people do this for science they're like you know why is the sky blue and like there is an element of that i'm talking about just like here's a perfect example we'll use the luggage one for example it's like question what happens if you just never pick up your suitcase or like what happens if you just simply like i see those bags over there that say that they're waiting for someone to come get them what happens if they don't like is this just gonna pile up forever you want to know about the name of dr mario and then yeah i do know yeah i'll tee it up for you then there is an answer and it's actually kind of fascinating for somebody who goes and digs in and says like okay but then what right or like that you know like a kid like well why do they do that and why do they do that and why do they do that and then you get to what's it called unclaimed baggage or whatever it's called like that what's that was that the name of our company so basically the hustle wrote about it so if you go like the hustle unclaimed baggage there's a company in like rural alabama i think it's alabama or arkansas called unclaimed baggage and they sell 300 million dollars a year worth of unclaimed bags and they it's like a huge thrift store you know right and uh same thing with like the uh like you know the shampoo at a hotel like you know i use this thing once what do they do with it do they just refill it and give it to the next person i'm curious what are they like oh actually there's a whole company that recycles these they take the half-used shampoos from hotels and they say they tell the hotel hey we'll pay you nothing for it but we'll come collect it for you we'll take it off your hands because you can't give that to the next guest and then they take that and then they have like basically a way to repackage and resell those and their brand is around lessening waste on earth and they that company does extremely well and so you actually find companies at the end of all these because again this is like a giant little business ecosystem just in the same way that like you know there's plankton that eats stuff off the whale's head or whatever it's like you know basically there's a little business that's going to solve every one of these edge cases all around the world right there's a person whose job it is to do that thing and if you keep going far enough you'll like find those those little nooks and crannies well which is a perfect segment for what i want to talk about today because here's here's what i i wanna i'm gonna give you a bunch of example of things that i've i'm calling frame breaking businesses so like things that i've discovered that have changed how i thought about stuff and there's a story uh and by the way today i was i was thinking i was like today's my leg day because i'm putting you on my back and i'm carrying us for this episode i i i i've got a i've got like a side note by the way my mom yesterday while i work out with my mom sometimes and she was like sam parr's legs she always calls you sam parr full name i love it i don't know if she knows that's like your first and last but samparas legs man he's got strong legs and i was like yeah he's great and she's like i was just looking at his legs in the last video the mr beast video because you were wearing like shorts on the couch or whatever i was just looking at his legs i didn't hear anything all right mom hey uh shawn's mom text me i'll send you some more pics and i'll send you some pictures of my legs i got you it's it's genetics so people people comment on my legs it's just it was i was born that way so thank you i appreciate the love though um all right so basically the reason i thought about this was because uh dig so there's this website called dig it's actually not that popular anymore but if you're above 30 you probably know it digg and reddit were competitors and for a long time dig was kind of beating reddit but they were both like the whole like front page of the internet type of businesses that had like tens of millions of monthly uniques and kevin rose the founder of digg was on the cover of time as like meet silicon valley's new wunderkind the guy who is 28 years old and worth a billion dollars or whatever he was like the mark zuckerberg like the next zugerberg and dig ended up not actually winning this battle and they're currently for sale and i linked to their financials someone just sent this to me on twitter so it's not like i got this through um like i didn't like sign up for a service where i had to agree to confidentiality but someone just sent this to me right you signed an fda a full disclosure agreement where you're like i will put this on blast if you send this random [ __ ] to me yes an anonymous twitter account that's exactly what happened someone just said it to me i didn't ask questions and i just looked at it but i'll give you like the overview the overview is that over the last year they had 27 million users so what's that two million a month so two which is not a lot the hustle gets more than two million a month just on our website and we don't even try to get traffic on our website so two million a month they're revenue slam slam on dig nice it keep going they're okay so their revenue for the year was something like a million or like 1.3 or like it was like 1.2 1.3 nothing [ __ ] dig which was supposed to be like you know a great website only like uh 80 70 91 000 44 000 a month in revenue horrible crazy terrified small boy [ __ ] yeah yeah and but here's the thing is that this rep this this discrepancy we're gonna call it the gap the gap between how much we talked about them and their prestige and like you know the accolades that they get as but from but the the gap between where they actually are in reality that gap is huge so instead i'm gonna swap it and we're gonna have some frame breaking companies and we're gonna talk about the actual good type of gap um and i want to show you a few businesses that people don't talk about that are actually phenomenal and really interesting so i'm going to give you the first one the first one i we maybe talked about before but i was uh looking at michael bisping michael bishing's a youtuber for mma and a vpn company sponsored him and i thought that's kind of strange so i just googled like what's a good vpn and maybe i'll start buying a vpn basically a vpn if you're in america and you want to like tell the internet that you're in europe you use a vpn or if you're in like north korea or one of the koreas whichever one would this would apply to and you want to act like you're in america you use a vpn that's a that's a or if you just want to like just search the web anonymously and you want to google stuff about taxes um and that's what the vpn is for and so i googled best vpn and i came across this website called compare tech that was kind of intriguing so i linked to it you see vpn so i started reading it and i was like this is kind of an interesting site and i looked them up on similar web and they get millions of views and i scroll all the way to the bottom and i notice that they're based in england and the thing about england and the uk is that if you are a uk company name all the things you love about about england uh maybe the t maybe you like the queen and you like the fact that all companies numbers are publicly available yes a lot of people don't know this but if you are a company in the uk i don't know what the threshold is it could be as low as five it could be as high as 10 million and you do over 10 million in revenue you have to there's this thing called companies house which is a very british name it's like they're i don't know if it's like is it like they're irs or something like that where you can go and log in and see all these financials from privately held companies and i was curious about this little website called compare tech so i went and looked it up on their on company's house can you see what their financials are do you have it up i don't have it open no okay so i'm gonna pull it up and i i linked to it down there it said financials um basically oh [ __ ] it the link broke on me but basically their revenue for the trailing 12 months was 12 million and their profit was 10 million and this little website that just reviews vpns it's i'm sure it's more sophisticated than what it looks like but it's not good looking it's not like uh doesn't have like the best design and i believe this website ended up selling for like 200 million dollars and i think it only gets like a million visits a month it sold uh last year or six six or 10 six or 12 months ago interesting site right that's crazy it was also only started in 2015. so sometimes i see these sites that i'm like oh wow this thing gets so much traffic and they just send clicks out to whatever basically their business model is they write about which vpn to use and then they link you to the vpn and they get a kickback from any whichever link you click of the 10 they'll get a kickback from all 10 for you know some some dollar value right if the vpn says cool every customer's worth 300 dollars to us we'll pay a hundred dollars to anybody that refers as a customer and so these guys will do you know some numbers like that normally when i see those like really high traffic uh sites that sort of just look very basic it's like you know this was started in 2004. i'm like well okay props to you you had the foresight to know that like very early on in like the you know the internet days or google's days somebody was like i'm gonna start reviewing credit cards i'm gonna start reviewing vpn providers i'm gonna start reviewing what email software is best and they made what email software is best.com and like you know that they rake in six million dollars a year you know uh ninety percent profit margin something silly like that and like you know the person is spent the last 15 years trying to figure out you know the meaning of life because they won the business game already and so that's normally what you see but 2015 is like pretty new for a site like this it's pretty new and here here's their financials i went and found them on companies house in 2021 they did 15 million in revenue and 13.2 million in profit the year before that 10 million in revenue 9.5 million in profit that's crazy this is crazy right right yeah i i'm a big fan of these now by the way do you ever do you play with seo a lot because um growth tactics are like martial arts it's like you could be a black belt in jiu jitsu and know nothing about karate right or you know karate and you know nothing about taekwondo or judo you don't know how to do any grappling and any throws and that's how i feel about growth channels it's like i've spent a lot of my career figuring out virality spent a lot of my career figuring out paid marketing now with e-commerce things like that uh the thing i've never touched is seo dude i know i'm like absolute novice on it absolutely i know seo like an ivy league architect knows about construction like maybe i can have a conversation with the construction worker who's going to build my project and like kind of know but like i'm not going to be able to reference like which rivet to use and you could kind of lie to me sometimes and i wouldn't exactly know if you were right right right you put me on the job site and um i'm gonna ask for some gloves because i don't yeah i don't wanna hurt my hands yeah i'm just gonna everything's gonna be called a monkey wrench so like i don't entirely understand seo but i do believe it's the maybe the best one uh like it's like like if you nail it i think it's the best thing to nail or one like that that seed in the office when dwight's like uh you know trying to ignore jim and then jim's like dwight are they they're doing like a job interview which bear is best he's like that's a stupid question there's and he's like basically yeah well there's basically two schools of thoughts here wrong yeah that's that's how i feel about like you know is seo best was like i don't know is brown bear best or is it black bear best right like every every one of these growth channels is like has something awesome and then something terrible and the one you're in you know it too well usually and you're like this thing is awful i wish i could just go on facebook and spend money and get two more spend a dollar get two dollars back and the facebook guy's like oh my god you can get free traffic on google and the google guy's like holy [ __ ] this thing grows virally wow what is that you know and so i think there's no there's no best i yeah i would agree but and by the way this site comparetech it was sold for uh yeah it was sold for over a hundred million dollars i believe this year in 2022 um for like one figure give me give me another frame breaker that's a great first one all right another one a company can i give a ps here just in case something good happens a ps is uh with the milk road today we run our like our business model is newsletter ads and i had asked ben i was like ben if we were going to sell a product our own product instead of advertise other people's products what would be what product would work best what bear is best ben and he was like vpn dude he's like we should just launch our own vpn uh fits the audience you gotta come up with an amazing business model we just have to buy an existing vpn and plug in our distribution and so if anyone has a vpn they want to sell me i'm happy to either buy one or build our own yeah you gotta come up with like some cute branding like vpnope you know what i mean like you can't track me you know like you gotta come up with something cute just like you do with milk roads i think we gotta just get get rid of vpn that's just two whatever it needs to be like you know whatever mysterio or like you know some like you know you know secret juice and it's like ah i use secret juice i'm on board with this don't tell don't tell you know yeah just call it don't tell mom uh all right the next one quinn street have you heard of quint street um no all right google quinn street and go to their website for me all right i'm gone and tell me like what my guess is i thought this was a fashion brand if you told me nothing else but okay i'm guessing it's not all right quinn street i just see a guy and it says where performance drives digital and then there's like another stock photo and this guy accessing high intent prospects this guy's a horrible stock mod like these guys on here aren't ugly enough to be like a stock model they're not good looking enough to be like they look like they're like out of like a like spanish or like geometry telemundo yeah like they just look like just normal you know it's like it's they're so normal that they don't even look why does your skin have like you know normal people wrinkles and blemishes that's not right stock photo you need to be perfectly airbrushed right is this the founder it looks like the founder i don't know i don't know who the founder is but it's like a simple ass website that's not good looking all right dude i'm going through the slideshow this slideshow is hilarious dude this looks like you know meredith from the office this is like that's what i'm saying they're like so normal that they're not that it looks silly so this this company i'm gonna explain what they do i'm gonna tell you how big they are so what this company does is they used to own and i don't know if they still own these sites but i'll tell you what they what they still own now but they used to own websites like directoryofschools.com or campuscorner.com or learningandlife.com or findtherightschool.com just like these like boring websites that don't look that cool and when you google ohio insurance ohio auto insurance they come up number one you enter an information and they sell that information to the highest bidder for insurance people this website it's like ugly looking it's simple looking and you like a lot of people disrespect it they made about 600 million in revenue last year it's publicly traded it's publicly traded that's crazy right this is this is another frame breaking company like they have if you click their about page on queen street they're about or one of their forms like it doesn't work like it's like it goes to like a 401 like it they don't have it set up dude okay you know when you meet someone and you're like i can't tell if this person is absolutely a genius or if they're completely idiotic or if you're in san francisco you see somebody walking to a fancy restaurant with like a hoodie and like you know they're like wearing one all bird and one croc and you're like all right this person's either homeless or a billionaire right like that's like a pretty common situation in san francisco that's how i feel when i go to websites like this i'm like these are either the biggest dummies on earth and don't because i can't i can't understand what they do right their website is full of pages it just says like performance are our products or something yeah it's like going into a video game and like you talk you bump into one of the stock characters that just like it's like oh hey didn't see you there hello and this is that keeps repeating on loop some random [ __ ] that doesn't make any sense that's their website so these websites they're either like absolute money printers or it's like you know someone's aunt who's got some dream of like you know being successful and they're never gonna make it because this makes no sense i can't tell and now when i get to finally then i see the key money tab investor relations if you got an investor relations tab on your on your website like it's working right like you know put in the bill clinton clip where he's like i did not have relations with that woman that's how that's how i feel when i see the investor relations tab i know some shit's going down that's hilarious our software is the worst have you heard of hubspot see most crms are a cobble together mess but hubspot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous i think i love our new crm our software is the best hubspot grow better it's kind of this whole website and this whole brand it reminds me of like a fourth grade classroom with like the uh like you know like teamwork and like each letter like it spells a certain word do you know what i mean or like teamwork t is for teamwork these are everybody that's what the this whole website looks like but it makes 500 600 ish million in revenue market cap isn't very great because it's a uh legion company those typically just don't have good market caps but it's just crazy they just ignored all the unimportant stuff like how good does their uh website their like uh public-facing brand website look and they only focus on just the results i guess and they own all these other websites that don't look so bad and they clearly get results but it's like a really interesting company and it's another frame breaking business where they just don't give a [ __ ] about the things that most people care about and it works it's effective so i recently met two guys who run a business like this and they've run three other businesses like this and exited them i'm gonna share i can't share the story now but i'm hoping one month from today i could share a kind of crazy story about them so i'm just going to put that there crazy a teaser for a future one month from today you know there will be a crazy story about these two guys um i might even have them on the podcast i don't know yet but um but this is this is insane this is a sample special how did you find quinn street where where were you what was in the what vpn and private browser did you have open when you were searching for this two ways one a guy named jackie chu who uh i like just like tweeted at this uh tweeted me this a while ago and i just saved it and then number two joe spicer my partner and a bunch of stuff he told me he used to work with them he owned an ad network and he was like in the early 2000s like i worked with them they basically right now they do car insurance and things like that but they used to do university of phoenix so university of phoenix you they would you know they owned all these school websites you would google like what's a good online degree they figured out that and this what what the the these guys look unsophisticated they are not they're very sophisticated they like know how to get traffic to websites they know how to do seo like they look like a fat guy who like it trains jiu jitsu just like just like you talked about like oh this guy he's good and but then he like you know can like put you in a headlock but in three seconds that's what these guys are uh and so anyway uh i found it just by goofing around and talking to people this is crazy so they own insurance.com insurer.com car insurance.com cardratings.com money rates bank tracker m1 and modernize home services and then they partner with way more by the way that's a really great source for info is talk to people at ad networks yeah they know every people who like work at google cloud or aws they know everything they see everything they they know who's making money and who's not they know uh who's getting traffic and who's not and uh like if you ever wanted to go figure out your next gig go be like uh yeah i'll be janitor at this like mobile ad network or i'm gonna go be janitor at aws uh my payment all i need is like login credentials into the dashboard i'd like to i'll be a account rep for high value clients and therefore i need that list of the high value accounts that we have and you basically just mine that and you're like all right which one of these you know who am i going to copy dude there's a website like going through it going to a barber shop and you see like i'll take the number 12 the [ __ ] boy fade please yeah the line on the side exactly like that please do you guys do eyebrow lightning bolts no yeah okay fine i'll take the number twelve then that's so funny dude all right the next one is in your world not just because he's an indian guy but because [Music] he's he's an e-commerce guy for some reason come up with some reason that it's not just that i don't know man indian entrepreneurs you guys are taking over the world i'm sure you guys all are part of the same tribe you know one another kinda there's only a billion of you um so this guy all right so i was looking at the inc 5000 list of all the lists that's the only one that like kind of matters it's still you could still game really dude i see this all the time i see the random ass some digital agency that i've worked with that does not like nothing special they're like we're a three-time inc 5000 winner i'm like well you guys are based off of you could still it's supposed to be based on revenue and they're suppose so i don't trust inc anymore but i used to and when i did like i clicked the link for 2022 block fi is number one block five basically just went out of business like three months ago so i think that tells me everything i need to know in your goddamn they had already written the story though the greatest active athletes bill russell like he just passed away two weeks ago they like created the list and someone who works here like hey uh we gotta remove block five from number one and they're like huh seems like a lot of work they're like look i don't make up the rules here i just think them up and write that down according to us is 245 000 this year it's like yeah you forgot the negative sign dude like but it's like it's so far away the computer i don't know where my charger is that's what the 85 000 is to go to the office no [Laughter] i guess i could swing my best buy on my way home yeah but they're like oh it's happy hour daiquiri have you ever been at a uh have you ever been at like your company happy hour and like you'll hear news that something really really bad has happened and had you heard about that during the day you'd be like livid i'm gonna act on this yeah i'm gonna [ __ ] kill someone like this is livid and then you hear about it like when you're laughing at happy or you're like huh yeah and like that's like what happened you know what i'm talking about you're a bit like a company happy how do you like hear bad news and you're like 100. we used to do ours on friday it was called the friday wind down and it was like wine and cheese and like whatever you know that often you guys posh seems like a wine and cheese types of guy though like i know but the office before i joined the office was pretty you know adult and mature and like sophisticated people and then i joined i started hiring people that would sleep at the office and so like it became this crazy culture clash we ended up ending it but it was so funny because it would be like friday you look at the numbers like well still don't have product market fit i guess all right let's just head over to the office bar and just drink for a bit like servers downs like how much traffic you think we get on the weekends anyways yeah one guy would go back to his desk to like fix the thing or like check they checked their email like oh we gotta go fix this and then everybody else would be like sort of watch them walk away be like all right if he looks like he's having trouble i'll go too like no don't that's how you talk it's just the voice of like well let me know if you need anything which apparently just [ __ ] black but i didn't really i saw black pepper one i didn't realize that that was the company that like went out of business with so yeah the list is kind of null at this point it doesn't really matter but i saw someone who's number six or number seven it's called high key it's like a keto cookie business type of thing and the la the guy's last name i don't know if it says it on this list but this other list i was looking at it was patel and they used his real name but i was like wait i think that sounds like aj patel so who i recognize and high key was like six or five do you see what it is on the list yeah it's number five or six yeah and they grew by forty one thousand percent i think that just means 41 x right so like if it was a million they do 42 million now or 41 million yeah again these numbers by the way my favorite word have you ever heard this word yeah it just means like uh fake right yeah but i'm i'm all about the word fugazi i feel like i can own this corner i don't know anyone who says it and absolute pleasure absolutely treat to say the same yeah it's like well it's like the most popular line in uh wolf of wall street yeah it goes it's all good you know just carry the 12 you know like i just can't do this so this guy uh aj patel he started this thing called high key which i would imagine is in the 30 or 40 million range but listen to this guy so he's probably in his later 30s probably 35 or 36 so in like 2012 2013 2014 he started a vitamin brand and it only did okay and then he started also tinkering with a skin care brand which it actually did much better it got to like 10 million or so in revenue he hired a ceo the ceo kind of like drove it into the ground and didn't really do that well and so he started focusing again to his vitamin brand and he's like look it's doing okay but who's the best customer of a vitamin company dogs [Laughter] because this is a i'm not disparaging him but like do they work yeah why not like fugazi you know like forget it yeah forgot welcome to fugazi inc yeah supplements for dogs they'll never tell you if it works or doesn't work yeah you know it's like uh it's like uh what's that memory loss game uh where it's like brain teasers you know brain dacity or brain acid yeah it's called it's like it's like neuroscience yeah it's like having like like a like a like an ad campaign towards those with amnesia like or or with like alzheimer's like does it work yeah maybe uh so that's like what what like these vitamins for dogs are like who knows if it actually works and he starts growing this company pivots from like you know normal vitamins to dog vitamins and he starts growing this thing and it takes off after a while and any kills it he gets a 25 million in revenue and then he sells part of it uh to a pe company and he took 60 million off the table then he grew for another three years and sold it for like 650 million dollars and he still owned like half of it so collectively he made 300 400 million dollars at the age of 32 and this guy isn't in silicon valley he's not in new york he's not in brooklyn he's in orlando florida capital of jorts short city usa you know george city white new balance town 22 listeners in orlando they all just collectively looked down at their lap came back and nodded like uh the fact's a fact baby yeah yeah yeah like like you know the england or illinois is the land of lincoln florida's like land of dog the bounty hunter you know like and that's where this this he's born in india indian immigrant came over decided for some reason florida's the place and knocked it out the park and not really well known and i was just like researching him and high key is now number six on this list they grew 41 41 000 so 41 x so if they were doing a million in revenue or 500 000 in revenue they're doing 20 to 40 million in revenue now so it's another nine figure in value brand and this guy's just quietly crushing it and i love it and i watched a talk with him uh there's this thing there's this website called capitalism.com dude i'm reading the transcript of that talk right now as you speak it's pretty crazy so so let me just recap this guy's known mostly for he sold zesty paws that that company for 600 million i think right so the page it was over in the in the in the transcript he says yeah the public number is 600 but it actually got raised uh a little bit higher wow and he um he also has high key snacks in this thing it says his first business uh like his first kind of side hustle was he was selling he's like i played single poker and i got to a mill by the way i did this exact same thing that's why this stood out to me i told you you guys are brothers man you guys are yeah now i know the connection so he got to a million chips he sold it for 37 bucks i i did this on poker stars i grinded my way i got i accumulated a million that was my actual first million it was a million fake poker chips on poker stars and i sold it for 13 and i tell you what i've never felt like more of a prostitute in my life i was like wow i just worked so hard for like three months to get you know like just grinding the free money game and i got to a million chips and i sold it for 13 via paypal and then i proceeded to lose the 13 immediately on the real money tables and i was like i never felt like you know you should take a shower i just i feel dirty yeah i googled like can i declare bankruptcy just out of embarrassment like you know is there is there some like version of that because i was so embarrassed at like the the terrible trade i had done he said he did that same thing and he started doing that as a like as a market basically on ebay i think he made like 100 or 200 grand just doing the fake poker chips like buying and selling basically which is it's kind of like uh you know it's kind of like a a kid being good at chess when they're six like if you're doing that on ebay it's like yeah you're gonna yeah well just here's all my money just hopefully you'll figure it out one day just get me back when you can like that's what you do when you when you meet people doing things like that that's like just we need this guy on uh and i'll give you i'm talking to him i've been talking to him on facebook i got him he's he clearly has you know he comes from our he's cut from the same uh the same cloth i don't know what what kind of cloth that is but but it's definitely our cloth we'll assume it's silk but dude this guy he i started becoming friends with him on facebook never talked to in my life there's a software that i needed to use i don't want to out them but there's a software i needed to use and it's like 10 grand a year and i mentioned to him that i use it he goes oh here i have an annual subscription here's my password and he's been letting me use his free like 10 000 a year subscription so this guy this guy is my guy i'm mad yeah yeah and so wait what's the second reason why why we need him on here because i just googled his name aj patel now here's a guy sold a company for over 600 million sold another company he's got high key snacks you know he's sitting on store shelves everywhere across the country guess what google puts up in the the like google thinks i'm talking about patel aj md the doctor in san francisco dude no matter what an indian guy does in business the doctor is still number one he's still at the top of the ranks so he needs to come on this pod so we can we can get this guy's seo but it's like one what's uh jessica alba's company honest the guy who started that his name is brian lee he started like that shoe dazzle and like legal zoom if you google brian lee like he ain't coming up oh dude it's uh a wrestler it's a it's a guy who looks like undertaker or like a big show or something yeah like brian lee like it doesn't matter if you're a billionaire or not you you know you you can't which by the way fame is always way better than than money so wrestling wrestling beats being a billionaire but this guy in his talk he said something amazing so like he hired the ceo to run his skincare brand and he says yeah like it's stunk this guy like i gave him the reins and i told him to do it and he totally talked slick to me and i thought he knew what he was doing and he and it didn't work and the guy goes uh the interviewer goes well was it a sad day when you fired him like he must have been hard right and aj goes no it was awesome firing him was so easy because he was so bad and i felt so great like getting rid of all the dead weight and i look at business as a living organism and like i have zero emotional attachment if someone doesn't serve the business and i'm willing to fire myself or anyone else and i have zero sadness about it and i saw that and i was like hell yeah i call that you know what i call that i call that korean convenience store owner energy remember you remember here's why you remember um during remember like the rodney king riots like in the 90s remember like these pictures of like the korean store business owners with like shotguns standing on top of their like they're like no we like yeah like let's go i was talking to like some people i invested in the other day and they were telling me about their business and like how they're like things aren't going that well i'm like well can you do me a favor like do a screen share let me see your calendar and like it was totally open and like they hadn't booked a lot like i'm like what i'm like morning meditation afternoon walk yeah i'm like dude from 8 00 a.m to 8 p.m it's gotta you have to have sales calls set up with prospective customers and like don't give me this nonsense of like oh well you know it went out of business but we learned a lot or like you know like we just couldn't or the things that you're suggesting sam they don't scale i'm like no no no dude right now you need to have that korean store owner energy where it's just like if you don't make this work you don't feed your family and maybe you're gonna get deported like you need to have that like like that that energy of like starvation with a side of deportation is how sam likes his dish is served dude you have to have that energy sometimes like of course like once things going well yeah you got to get like beyond like scale and all that stuff but like early on call yourself a startup call yourself it didn't matter what you call yourself you're just a convenience store owner and like some convenience stores you go there and they have every type of kind bar you could ever imagine that's where i'm going other type of convenience stores like you know they don't have what i want i ain't ever going there again you got to be that convenience store that has every kind bar every cliff bar has a stick and it's just grinding and knows your name they are willing to call me like you know like what do you want the usual that type of that's what like a lot of startup uh founders need and so uh this guy aj patel he's got that korean store business owner energy you know that like immigrant hustle i love it yeah he's great and that's great and i feel like we know so many people that it's like i meet with them and i hear them talking and it's like oh let's just fast forward to the part where you write a medium article called my next chapter or our next our next adventure and then you're gonna sign off saying onwards yeah like you're a [ __ ] captain of a ship in the 1700s like ahoy matey your business is failing wake up do something don't just sit there and lose and then go work at facebook and write my next chapter i'm so excited to lead you know you know digital digital ad products at facebook now for the next two years of my life before i go out and do this same stupid thing again it's like wake up go figure this out right figure out something that's going to work i don't care what you do i don't even care if it's bad but like i need to see some like some serious action being taken you know and like realize your [ __ ] is not working and like i invest in startups and i know that the name of the game is you're going to lose most your money and only a few are going to like return all the money but when i hear like their updates i'm like all right i i'm okay with swinging and missing i'm not actually okay with it but i know that's part of the game and it's just a numbers game but for those not swinging it doesn't matter if i only invested five thousand dollars i reply and i'm like oh you're losing and you suck for these reasons and you need to improve because i give you my hard-earned money so you can have a good shot at trying something and you are not trying or taking a good shot and that's pissing me off and i told some of my other angel investor friends and like well i kind of feel that way but i never say that like what do you like what what why not why wouldn't you say this it doesn't matter how little or how much you invested you gave your hard-earned money to someone to like take a swing step to the plate dog like swing but don't like give me this nonsense we um uh we have this phrase i use in all my companies which is that all right people are going to make mistakes but there's two types of mistakes and you have to you have to decide when you when you make a mistake which one is it did you make an error of action or an error of inaction an error of action is you tried something and you did it wrong or it didn't work or had a bad result but you you know you were trying really hard to do something and you just messed it up that's okay that's a fumble no problem then there's an error of inaction which is your mistake was that you didn't do something you didn't think about something you didn't anticipate it you didn't plan you know you just forgot to do something you dropped the ball and that's the unforgivable one right so it's like i'm always like number one to be like bro no problem this was an error of action that's great i love errors of action that's how you get better and like never feel bad or sorry for an error of action for an error of inaction i now have a problem and so i feel the same way with founders that i invest in it's like some of them i'm like oh man they're just banging their head against this wall i will only ever say something to somebody if i feel like if it's if they're making errors of action when they're making errors of inaction my experience i did it twice now and i was just like hey guys like you're like your update makes it sounds like everything's okay but like read what you said everything is not okay and like you got to do something what could we do here and i like rolled up my sleeves and i was like helping them with their strategy and their pivot and then their investor deck to raise money because they're running out of money and same thing with the other one i was like hey guys like this is just not working like you don't have product market fit you have like two customers after two years like what's going on and they're like no we're really excited about the pipeline we think that that doesn't that's not fair and i was just like oh my god not only were you like not aware of it you're actually in denial of it uh wow this is like you know complete waste of my time and you know sure enough in both cases they you know my like several days worth of like full-time effort to try to help them uh resulted in nothing and so you know i now i'm picking i'm a little bit pickier where i'll test the waters and i'll see does this person if given a dose of reality do they take it and say more please or are they like oh i don't want this and it's like oh if you don't want reality then i don't want to you know i was just it was a mistake on my part i judged wrong you know my my check was written to the wrong person here as the great dr phil once said don't piss on my back and tell me it's rain all right i got one last one um i have an interesting one so it's like a billy of the week but someone who like people never talk about or at least they don't talk about a lot and he's got that gap and when i say he it's actually him and his wife and his wife is actually the more interesting person but uh this guy a little bit is more front-facing his name's stuart resnick have you ever heard of stuart resnick you know have we talked about him i don't know the name but i just googled it and now i know they do the the wonderful company or whatever so so give me his story all right so listen to this guy his name's stuart resnick him and his wife his wife's name is linda they're based out of california and so in the 1970s he started a janitor business and he just basically like was a janitor at one point i think and then he eventually hired a few more and he got contracts with buildings and once he was in those buildings and had the contracts he expanded to uh security guards and at one point he had a thousand armed security guards on staff so he like drew this janitor business into a security guard business and it was amazing he got some lucrative contracts to uh lax and it turned out to be a great business and he ended up selling it and he made a little bit of money and with that money he eventually bought the franklin mint which at the time was one of the world's largest sellers of uh coins collectible coins and oddly enough you know who owns the franklin mitt right now no no idea former mfm tai lopez does he really yeah that was my that was a joke yeah basically a good job so basically like in the 60s 70s 80s and even up into the 90s like all the marilyn monroe coins and elvis presley coins the franklin mint they uh they're the ones who uh started it or uh who produced a lot of them and so from there he parlayed that to a couple of things and now at this point his company it's called uh wonderful brands they own a bunch of really interesting brands they own landmark wines that's not that interesting teleflora you know what teleflora is it's a pretty big 350 million dollar a year business where you call it's like 1-800 flowers a competitor but here's the big ones that they own the first is wonderful pistachios you've seen those at the store right the second is palm wonderful you know palm wonderful yeah palm juice yeah pomegranate yeah palm juice and so basically the wife linda she uh she's like you know i love pomegranates but there's no this was like in the in the 80s she's like there's not really a good pomegranate juice let's let's do this juice and she goes you know what uh pomegranate it's good for your heart it's uh what else is it and she like learns about what it's good for and she was like you know it makes women have like an hour glass figure like it like is like good for you and like it's you know it makes you feel good i guess and so they made she made the bottle like a you know it's like if you ever seen it it's like a signature bottle yeah yeah it's like a signature bottle well they own another company that has a wonderful signature bottle called fiji water so they they also own fiji which has a square bottle and at this point they're privately owned they're one of the largest producers of uh one of the largest farm owners in america so they own uh almond and pistachio farms and they do four billion dollars a year in revenue and so it says in 2018 they were the wealthiest farmers in the country yeah and this guy there you know the the i believe the the wife linda she's jewish but she's got this like southern belle charm to her like she's from like alabama or something she might be like an old like you know faulkner novel like she reminds me of like a character in force gump movie and and but they're based out of california and then he's got like a little new york vibe where he like kind of comes off as like cool and hip but they're farmers they own they're huge farmers and they're like have the best brands out there fiji is a great brand and they created these they're not just acquiring these right no they made them yeah they make these brands and they own way more wonderful is a really good brand i love wonderful pistachios and so these guys just kill it they're just quietly crushing it and i think at this point i think they're like 81 or 82 years old and i still watch talks with them and they talk about how they go well how do you stay close to their customers and they're like well i just read twitter all day and i like read about and like sometimes they're just like us yeah they're just like us and so sometimes they they just like look at like what customers they're like we use facebook and we just like skim like our page and we just see like which complaints are actually good and which are are nonsense and we reply then we make changes and we just run our business that way and they're really interesting people so that's the billy's of the week stuart resnick and his wife linda linda wow yeah she looks like the type person that would give you a kiss on the cheek and then wipe off the lipstick what just happened yeah yeah i love those women they always smell so good yeah yeah like going to the bathroom at one of the at a woman like that's house it's just an absolute pleasure there's so many things you need to know so many cents since you didn't even know existed like you'll spend 15 minutes just trying to wash your hands to get out of there because it's like oh wow this this is like a handkerchief instead of like a towel this is amazing yeah at the end of this you're gonna be an expert on butterscotch candy like you're gonna know all about like those little like red green and yellow candies that like what the [ __ ] what are these things it's like fruit punch candies uh so i love this brand um this is amazing and by the way this teleflora 1-800 flowers thing why doesn't somebody create like 1-800 flowers to tell the floor flowers as just a ghost kitchen on doordash and on ubereats like why is this does that exist like what why can't i just order flowers i've seen a flower thing when i go on there but i think it's like doordash's own i think you could create like either edible and rainbows or a flower thing and just partner with local florists to fulfill the demand um and it's like it's like way better than food but uh i know whenever there's like a birthday or something like that that's my go-to thing now it's just like i'm gonna doordash them something right because it's like i never planned some what's like a good enough like i'll do like like the last one i did was like you know like a a bunch of boba tea like this person like really likes boba teas so i sent them a bunch of boba or i'll send them like you know uh pizza and wings or i'll send them a cinnabon and whatever or i'll send them you know a bunch of ice cream or chocolate or whatever because it's like i can procrastinate until 30 minutes before like their birthday you know is over and i could push this button and still be a great friend uh so let me do that you know that's a great idea machine noah kagan for my birthday gifted me like 200 bucks worth of 16 ounce bottles of topo chico from costco and i like that was it was like it was easy it was like a month and a half supply of topo chico and it's like all i drank for two and a half months or something it was awesome yeah on your birthday i tried to see like is there such a thing as gas station gift cards but they used to it was really tough to find anything that would work yeah that's so funny i was like can i open a tab in my friend's name at your gas station deliver time to time yeah you guys still dip and like yeah cooks your kids some nacho cheese [Laughter] if he brings his own cup can he just walk out with some hot cheese that's awesome that's disgusting that's the episode that's dude you you really did carry that episode that was amazing this is this is this entire episode is going to be called the sampar special and uh it's just sam bringing hit after hit after hit you want to know those quads to work you want to know what i'm most proud about guess how long uh that took me to prepare i think you would be proud if you spent a long time like 45 minutes oh that went the other way it's one pm now we started recording at noon i block off on my schedule from 11 to noon as my research time i did all of this in that one hour time and i even took a bathroom break and i definitely did some pull-ups so yeah did you like take the limitless pill how did you do all that in like 45 minutes uh i just got a good brain i don't know i just yeah i just my brain's good i just was on fire today i drank a bunch of coffee nice but that's it we're out of here [Music] you

it doesn't make sense for me to sell for 5x 4X most of my revenue is profit like the margins are really high especially remote okay it's like 94 margin uh pre-text so it's very high so I'd say 10x after 10x gets interesting I think the problems with booster companies you usually get three four five x profit or Revenue not sure which is too low for me it's like I might as well wait three years or four years and sit in this chair and the sites will probably keep running because they're fully automated and I barely need to work on them they kind of just keep going it's just that I won't build new features anymore and the site will start looking a little bit old because you know design Trends change but generally it will keep running

so basically we're gonna it's like shark tank but the viewers can invest and i think all right so we're gonna have six startups each startup gets two minutes to pitch and then we have up to five minutes to ask questions and last time i don't know if you remember the sean but last time we the companies that pitched ended up raising like millions and millions of dollars [Music] all right what up sean do you play video games of course i play video games do you really not as much i don't really play at all but um i mean i just i don't i'm not like a gamer but do you know what xbox cloud is i didn't know what that was uh yeah kind of i'm in the ps i'm in the playstation universe i don't really use xbox cloud but it's like the cloud gaming thing for them yeah but basically i i paid like a dollar to play flight sim do you know what flight sim is yeah of course you probably love that thing it's awesome i just started doing it and like because me and sarah are thinking about going to korea and i'm like let's just go like fly to seoul right now and see what it's like like you can fly around and i paid a dollar for it and i played it on my computer it's so cool i've never like been a video gamer but it's awesome a video gamer just gamer hello fellow millennials yeah uh wait so do we not see these pitches what's going on here so um i see a bunch of comments i've got a screen over here do you have the the comments set up oh okay here we go and then um i believe courtney or someone else is going to control it so someone's going to come up and they're going to pitch for two minutes okay great and are we we're really investing money this time maybe i'm not doing it if it's i'm only doing if it's good well yeah only if it's good of course i'm not uh not gonna just throw money at something bad but i'm ready i got the checkbook out so i'm ready today i think fifty hundred thousand dollars would be awesome to deploy if there's a great startup in here but we shall see what's up i can see the chat so let's give a background here all right so this thing it's called stocks.com it's like a live shark tank type of uh company i'm an investor in it so i have like a i have some interest here but um you're not an investor right sean of this company no i'm just working for free right now yes i don't care if people use it or not but i just i just wanted to disclose that but so six companies describe the describe the format it's cool there's basically a video screen where they pitch the investors there's right now 250 people watching live and then there's a live chat so people in the audience and they could tag themselves as angel investor founder vc just i don't know normal you know muggle and you they can chat during the pitches they can also express interest to invest uh which will let them like connect with that founder after the fact so it's kind of like a way it's a way to do angel investing no matter where you are in the world making shark tank you know the default process for investing which is pretty dope and uh yeah as calvin says no small bush stuff today that's my only rule with these founders coming pitching coming and pitching they always say what's your advice i say it's the same as always no small boy stuff all right so so basically we're gonna it's like shark tank but the viewers can invest and i think all right so we're gonna have six startups each startup gets two minutes to pitch and then we have up to five minutes to ask questions and last time i don't know if you remember the sean but last time we the companies that pitched ended up raising like millions and millions of dollars so it was it was pretty interesting so let's see if we get that uh life change just another day just another life change as far as getting concerned well because we so basically we're doing this live and then we're gonna air on our youtube and podcast and i think people can still invest at that point but so yeah a lot of lives were changed but let's check it out so let's we're gonna go uh the first one uh jesse you're gonna uh bring it up there you go two minutes and then uh we do five minute q a awesome hey guys luke from cherry here hey sam hey sean um so cherry is a uh exists to ensure accommodation businesses get more direct bookings and in turn giving consumers better travel deals so online travel agencies today like expedia booking.com and airbnb bringing around 250 billion dollars in bookings resulting around 35 billion in commission fees a average property can sometimes pay up to 30 commissions on those bookings with the market power that these guys have it's really hard for an individual property to get direct bookings and that's where we've come in meet cherry cherry is a free browser extension it gives you deals when searching for accommodations you can find it right now at joincherry.com so imagine that you're searching for a property you're looking on booking.com you found one you liked and bam cherry's going to pop up it's going to show you a better deal for booking directly with the property and on clicking get deal will take you directly through to the properties direct website we copy across the guests the check in the checkout and the promo code allowing you to check out with these now sam imagine we did this with marathon ranch on airbnb you could have cherry popping up showing a deal directly to customers allowing them to come through the direct guest booking engine on your own website all of our properties have a dedicated back end allowing them to manage their deal daily monthly or seasonally they've got full control the current product works across desktop and in the future months we'll be launching all your favorite travel deals directly from your pocket on mobile we're highly adaptable we work across all accommodation providers like city hotels resorts vacation rentals and the future proofing of our product is across attractions flights and also car hire within four short months we're approaching a thousand partner properties in australia new zealand and canada from all the major brands you might be aware of and by november we'll be launching to the us with an expected 20 000 partner properties we're the team to get this done we've got a mixture of great travel and tech experience and a graded sounding advisory board across marketplaces travel and tech as well so what do you say should we get back to traveling oh nice little closing do you work on that today yeah i did that's good that's good i like that this is really like shark tank so what do you say shall we fly through the sky all right so okay so let's start off uh sam give me your initial initial thoughts i don't know this space that much so my initial thoughts are i'm trying to figure out how this is different from just like expedia with a chrome plug-in or is that it is that like the dumbed-down version yeah we're essentially allowing uh properties to get more direct bookings by having it pop up on online travel agencies sending them direct to the property's website so they're not having to pay the large commission fees and there's only two-way incentives so the buyer gets a little discount and then the hotel doesn't have to pay the referral fee to expedia right correct instead they pay a referral to you presumably yeah we charge on a performance base and sometimes on a subscription base so are you cheaper than expedia then yeah correct so for us we charge a performance fee of uh 10 a month and then we pay 79 cents a click whereas some of these properties are paying you know upwards of 30 commission on some of these bookings and the way it works is you have this uh chrome plugin installed i go to hiltoncydney.com or whatever it is and it says hey sorry i go to expedia i go to some other website where there's hotels listed it goes hey by the way if you just click this little uh it's like honey so i just like see like a little notification on my chrome thing it says if you click that you're actually going to save ten dollars if you just come straight to our website is that right correct so how do you get the the chrome extension users right that seems like the the hard part so how do you get them today so as you said you had 3 000 of them so where did those 3 000 come from and where did the next 10 or 30 000 come from and how much does that cost you yeah so what we've done is we've been able to partner with the hotels that we're signing up which has made it really easy for from a customer acquisition point of view so for instance we're launching with around 300 new properties in canada at the moment and they're actually rolling it out to their loyalty base of around 2 million members from an email point of view and so we'll partner with them and that's the engaging point of view that we're we're going out with um and then we've got some paid media rolling out across youtube and reddit and those are the likes sorry so i don't understand so why does the hotel care to tell its customers to install cherry yeah so so they're they're almost sick of paying these large commission fees that they do to the online travel agencies so for them to be able to bring their members incentivize them to use the cherry product while they're searching across all of the different online travel agencies it's a benefit for them to then not have to pay those commissions every single time do you think that what let's say that you're you're you're actually advising people not to invest in you because the travel industry is so hard like what's like the honest truth that you would say because the travel industry like performance marketing in the travel industry seems like the most cutthroat thing there is next to like you know ranking for like lawyer terms like mesothelioma lawsuit you know what i mean like what else definitely um well i guess the data that we've seen travel over the last four months is that it's actually back and it's bigger than 2019 pre-pandemic levels that we saw and not just that it's it's back from a volume perspective but in terms of what people it's spending is higher so the average room rate of dollar value that people are spending is is going higher so yeah i'm trying to tell you not to invest at this point but um from from our regard travels back and bigger than ever so um it seemed like honey did a great job because they they found a way to acquire users for cheap and i think youtubers and influencers were like one of the big strategies it seems like you could do that with these like travel bloggers travel tips you know flight deals hotel deal type of uh type of bloggers youtubers that sort of thing have you guys started doing that and what do you see what's the what is the what does it cost you to get an install when you pay right because i don't know i'm not really buying this uh this idea that hotels are just gonna keep spamming their their customers to install your app that just see just because they're so fed up with expedia i don't know i don't really buy that yeah yeah so when we first started um we were noticing 10 12 of uh of a cpa on on facebook and instagram and we realized that that was just not continually achievable and so we switched and we pivoted very much into the reddits and the pinterest of the world and we were able to get down to sort of that two three dollar mark um but youtube is where we identified the big growth how much did you spend we were spending a few thousand dollars a month um yeah and then what and what what's what's the customer worth so what do those customers generate for you uh you know in a year yeah so the customers aren't necessarily the generators for us it's the the properties paying the performance and the subscription fee but the average saving for a customer could be up to you know 150 dollars a year in uh in travel savings gotcha okay they're telling us we're at time uh luke thank you thanks guys yeah me and sam will quickly debrief and then we'll move on to the next pitch i'm out i'm out not it has nothing to do with him it's just the industry i'm just i i it's not you it's not me yeah yeah so look i'm one of the very few so i uh there's this weird rule i don't know if it's a law or it's a rule but basically have you ever heard about this where um like expedia or some other company they there's this regulation that they have to display in like the same rate across all websites if that rate is going to be publicly available have you ever heard of that no but that makes sense so there's these guys i met who bought these um instagram handles like at hotel and now they have like 50 million followers across all their things and it says dm us for a good hotel deal and you dm them and they have a chat bot that figures out where you want to go and then they can actually spend send you way more exclusive deals because they don't have to follow the law because it's not it's a private conversation and i think that's like an interesting take this that's a that's a really intriguing take to me this take that this guy has uh luke i think it's also interesting i don't think it's good enough though to like be crazy different from all the other folks out there in an industry that's to me as somewhat uneducated seems like it's really really really really tough to succeed in i think the hard part here is i'm not installing this unless i'm traveling right like i'm not just oh let me just uh preemptively install this so i think travel is so infrequent it's hard to get people to install this and i didn't love that answer you gave at the end he's like oh our customers don't generate money for us well they do right they're the ones who go book and so you know on average of the people that install 25 actually go book something and of those 25 who book on average that generates 20 for us and so i can tell you no public math but let me just do it anyways that's you know whatever four or five bucks that that customer's worth for me and i i bought them for two so that's your spread there's gonna be some math like that so that's what i'm always looking for with founders is can you from a bottoms-up way explain how the money machine of your business works i put a dollar in here then it generates you know three dollars on the way out um and i've done that at this scale and now the only question is if i scale up will that money stay the same right that's that's what i'm looking to do so yeah i'm out as well i like the guy like the name but i think that honey for travel if it was gonna be a thing honey would do it and if it um you know and i also think that the and i think the reason they don't is because as a standalone thing it's hard to acquire users for this because travel is infrequent and expensive there's a commenter in the chat room that says my wife says she's out i agree with i agree with ben simpson's wife and in fact i want to know what all of your wives feel and if your wife's not around because she's not watching this at a 10 a.m on a tuesday um you know your wife and you know your husband so just tell us in the chat after every single pitch is your wife or husband in or out based on what you know about him all right next up yeah i want to know too and also ask them my wife is definitely out my wife is sarah out for you yeah she's not in and if you want to ask them what the what your wife's opinion is on sean and me as well as the startups we're okay we'll listen to that but only if it's a good thing next up hold on look at this cover from ollie i keep my wife my wife away from the show because you guys are too handsome look i if i had a nickel for every time i heard that you got like 15 cents i'd have three nickels yeah maybe 25 cents maybe we have a whole quarter all right uh hill pill up is the next startup what a name yeah hi guys pillow i am phillip yo that's why i took the name fill up cheers okay hi guys i'm ankur co-founder of pillop and i'm here to make you millions let's get started so 56 percent of patients in india have poor medication adherence and guess how many are chronic patients in india for 30 million so that's a big problem and a huge opportunity for us but what are the reasons behind this poor adherence number one forgetfulness people tend to forget to eat their medication due to old age or they're just busy with the schedule second one is poor medication management people take the wrong medicines at the wrong time double those it happens more often than you think financial constraints the fourth one is personal beliefs you know some people in india believe if they start to take medicines they have to take it for the lifetime and the fifth one is unable to read doctor prescription presenting you the pull-up solution we pre-sort your medication by time and date personalized as per your prescription but you will still forget to take medicines due to some reason right don't worry we got you covered we provide medication reminders on your preferred platform so you don't forget to take medicine but in case you still do your wife will remind you because we're gonna alert her after one hour of your medication time and lastly we convert this beautiful doodle art of the doctor into a pillow planner which is much easier to understand we provide a one-stop solution to improve your medication endurance through the app through pre-sorting pouches and our dispenser we are a team of engineer analyst and doctor i am a serial entrepreneur and a yc alumni dr manish has 19 years of experience he is a cardiologist and are conscious of brains behind this whole business to put things into perspective even if you miss one day of medication in tuberculosis you start again from day zero let this sink in thank you good job thank you encore that was that was awesome uh let that sink in thank you you started and ended with some major restaurant owner energy right there like you came in and said i'm here to make you millions and you left with let that sink in thank you i've never i've actually never seen that and uh i don't know i'm still a little shook sam you take it away that was great uh yeah i think you did a good job are you is this an indian company is this in india yes and you're like in down you're in downtown india right now i could hear the i could hear the uh where are you at i'm in the capital new delhi nice you uh you're wearing a y combinator shirt make something people want is this a yc company no my previous startup was a yc company and what was that yeah so this was in a winter 21 so me and my partner we pivoted and had a different vision for where to take the company so i started a new is this company basically pill pack for india yeah kind of but the customer insights are a bit different so pillpack was focused on medication management pre-sorting so that people can stay back at home and spend more time with the family while our focus is on to increase the medication a difference issue which is reminding people to take their medication timely intervention and to make their life more easier and convenient so i would say 50 to 60 pill back but there's more to it and why doesn't pillpack focus on that so is it that in india the problem is different like the people's behavior is different or why why wouldn't you just do pillpack for india pilpak's been quite successful is india itself not enough of a differentiator from there no so pilpak hasn't entered india because there has been a recent healthcare regulation change so that makes it possible for india the uh change similar to the upi if you're aware about the payments change that happened and change the whole fintech industry similarly the uhi change is happening in india moreover due to kovite the e-pharmacy have been booming in the last three years with the cheer of 45 percent and with the online payments it has made possible to get this technology out there earlier in india you know online ordering of medicine wasn't a concept you should change your shirt instead of uh make something people want you should say say uh uh make drugs people take and uh that'll be it'll be a head turner what is the um what's the traction like i i feel like you gave us the high level problem and solution pretty well but you didn't say much about traction so we launched two months ago last month our traction was 1300 we on an average get an order value of 200 from our customers per month and we have a high very high retention rate but the as the sample size is very small uh you know it doesn't make sense to say it is 90 sure and how are you going to get customers so we have three channels one is b2b so today also we made a b2b partnership with old age homes with whom they are 20 to 30 clients staying in their old age homes second one is we are pushing out the product by introducing it to the doctors through our sales channel and third we will be starting our influencer programs next month once uh what's up bought and all the technical side is you know on track and really important question is that zero to one on your bookshelf yes um i'm in yeah is that settlers of catan what are you what have you been saying to um american investors who say uh dude american health care is too complicated i don't know anything about that let alone another country that you know i may maybe don't even know that much about so i haven't reached out to the american uh you know investors yet so this is my first page i just wanted you guys to be my you know my investors because i love my first million and i've already received funding so that you know i can get into y combinator again and you know i have a clear part for the next two years the funding is secured and for the american investor as i said you know i haven't reached out to them yet and um you said that the e-pharmacies have been booming and that's i think that's just very true i i looked at investing in a um an indian you know you know e-pharmacy why don't they just do this um you know as part of your offering where they they're able to sort of um so their focus is very different so e-pharmacies right now have been working on two things out of the 15 problems we have identified they're working on the delivery part they want to do the delivery within three hours there are three unicorns already in this space and the whole market right now is discounted no one is working on what happens post delivery of medicines so that's the space we want to work in and that's where we are finding a lot of interest from the people and all our sales are mostly through word of mouth so we are in the pre-launch phase we just shared the product with 10 people and then you know we they just shared further and now we have 250 people and next month we are doing a proper launch and uh and you said you're raising two hundred thousand dollars at a four million dollar cap is that right yeah okay okay great and we're telling you 100 100 000. awesome uh we're at time we can uh we can close it up thank you so much ankur thanks for coming on thank you sean thank you sam thanks um what do you think i like it uh i'm in i would invest in this at precede now the the the questions i have the things i would want to know is he mentioned that his last company which was yc21 that's not very long ago it did not um not a red flag but something to ask about yeah yeah exactly but yeah there is some red i see in the distance i just don't know if it's a flag or like you know it could be around a sign yeah so why did his co-founder disagree what went into that how did they handle it um so you know that seems kind of interesting i'd like to know a little bit more about that and um i'd also like to talk to some of the e-pharmacy people and be like hey why isn't there a pill pack for india and just hear what they say do you have well i guess you don't need an indian based person to like tell you that but do you have like a like someone who's somewhat of an expert on india healthcare yeah i know a guy who runs one of the big e pharmacies there and then uh just in general you know this is i'm one one dm away from getting that answer so that would be the other contingency for me that's why i would pass is i don't have that i you know i i don't i don't like you could tell he could have told me anything about india his healthcare and i would have said yeah okay cool yeah so india has now floated it's next to china you're like oh man that's cool [Laughter] so like he could have said anything and i just it's really hard for me to to know like what the truth is right um so i don't know if i would do it also tell me what you think about this do you think that it's a good pitch or not to say we are pillpack of india we are blank but for this country yeah sometimes i'm like yeah okay i'm okay with that you don't you don't have to like you know you don't have to sell something he really don't don't piss on my back and tell me it's rain just tell me what it is yeah exactly he should have just told us what it is he should have said we're pulled back for india pillpack has built a x billion dollar business and was acquired by amazon and they don't operate in india because of that because of um india specific regulations like he said so uh the pillpack for india is going to start in india and it's going to be us now the things that we do that are similar to pillpack is blank blank that's been validated the part we're doing that's new is this that's how i would have pitched that business in order to like fast you know make it faster for the for the investor to understand the size of the prize do you feel partial towards indian startups uh more so than a non more so yeah more so than like uh i don't like a french startup or something uh yeah kind of like i think i know a little bit more about the market i've been there i've you know family there i've now invested in a bunch of companies there so it all just builds over time but also it's a humongous market that has just had those like uh you know what do you call those like inflection points or whatever basically a billion people all got mobile phones with internet in the last like couple years and that just like it's a before it's a dramatic before and after and um so you know serving that market building solutions for that market is really awesome like now as a it's a golden cohort of companies because they're all riding the back of this thing where one company basically gave away 4g internet uh essentially a dirt dirt cheap cost cheaper than in america so a lot of people got online you know what's [ __ ] up though is that big company that was that it was a big pakistani company that like everyone was a fan of air or something what was it called yeah air lift or something like that like all you i don't know if it was you but a bunch of my friends were like oh this thing's this thing's awesome this is awesome and i remember thinking like i don't know anything about pakistan but all my smart friends say this is a good idea and i was like really interested in it and i think i ended up passing but it went out of business and whether it's good or bad that impacts whether i want to invest in a foreign company because i don't like it's like oh i don't know man i don't know anything about this country so i have mixed feelings right now on on investing in locations that i know nothing about yeah my some of my worst investments came from well all these other smart people are doing it and i don't know why they did it i don't know if they're actually smart i don't know if they uh you know what their assumptions are what their context is what they can afford to lose and so i've made some pretty terrible decisions like that in the past so that's famous last words for me is like well well the other smart people are doing it yeah well sometimes that works so it worked once for me um all right steve campus inc campus inc college laundry close close close close close i don't know like i got like a stain on my or like a college tattoo parlor i don't know love it i haven't gotten that joke before but i appreciate it let's go ahead all right hey everyone my name is steven i'm the ceo of campus inc we're a d to c and b2b merch platform powered by college athletes and college students we build licensed merch platforms for universities so every athlete in every sport has the ability to sell merch and profit off their name image and likeness meanwhile we train students on those campuses in design sales and marketing so they can support the athletes and sell to other organizations like the greek system last year we did four and a half million dollars in sales this year we're on pace to do seven million sean you went to duke so i'm going to pick on you a little bit in another world you're a five-star recruit former coach k brings you in and introduces you to your new nil director you have the opportunity to sell your own branded duke merch through campus inc we're talking jerseys custom drops limited releases and you're gonna earn anywhere between eight to fifteen dollars per item sold your jerseys are gonna be sold in the stadium and online and when you go to the final four you're even gonna make money on final four apparel when you go pro sean you're gonna be able to sell your duke jersey for the rest of your life at the university of illinois we made our college basketball team over a hundred thousand dollars in the regular season at and mark cuban invested in us over a cold email he's helping us take this to every college across the country so far we have over 600 athletes in our queue we've signed 15 schools including duke uconn syracuse and most of the big ten our platform solves a few significant problems one we notice that universities are desperate to show they're supporting their athletes in this new nil space coaches are losing recruits because other schools are moving faster they need a solution we have it and we're there we're there for them there's also over 180 000 d1 athletes who are all micro influencers and don't have the time resources or skills to run their own merch platform we're there to help them finally we know that traditional d2c is throttled and at the mercy of facebook we'd rather reward the students we think we have an unfair advantage in acquiring customers when we sign schools they connect to athletes and athletes connect with fans and that's how we sell merch at campus inc all right wow wow no small boy stuff no small boy stuff dude i see you put me oh wow do you know small boys actually i got a bone to pick with sean sam sam sam sorry sam i designed you guys a merch platform here check this out oh i remember dude nice i remember okay let me that is awesome and i think i replied with send me that shirt i want it well i said i said we could actually the site is live right now i bought the domain too what is it mfmpod.shop okay let now let me tell you something i wasn't trying to be an [ __ ] to you i'm just an [ __ ] to everyone who sent well that's why i'm helping sean out with the duke stuff so we i get i don't know about you sean i bet he does and even more so i get like five or ten of those a week of someone saying i wanted to buy merch so we just like made a store for you and i just i i politely tell them to [ __ ] off and i think that's what i said to you right yeah i forwarded that to mark as well that's why i didn't want to come on the pod no i'm just kidding so now that we're friends i'll try you nicer yeah you're crazy we should do swag okay but um let's get back to his business business okay so uh so i really like a bunch of things about this business but i have some questions okay so so what do i like i like that you're basically riding the wave of this regulatory change the nil chains that just went into effect and that means all the businesses that need to serve that market of college athletes finally being able to monetize their name and likeness which is what nil is about um that though all those businesses are being created you know last year this year and it sounds like you're you were early on that wave couple quick questions can you use the team logos like you did there so you don't need a special license for that so that is a special license but but we go to the university and we basically pitch to them that we have an inclusive and holistic solution so every sport every athlete softball baseball rowing right good they grant us the ip and then we're able to build them a whole school platform and so yeah we're able to do what's called co-license merchandise which is a very specific segment of licensing and we've got those at 15 schools you're like we've sold tens of women's lacrosse sweatshirts well i'll be i'll be honest our biggest one of our biggest rev generators was women's softball at like virginia tech the girls just crushed it and they were in like world series and people are buying their stuff i mean it's not just football and basketball amazing what's a lear field someone was saying how learfield owns 90 of the licensing rights and if i know nothing about it other than uh three seconds on wikipedia if they own it can you also get it so learfield it owns collegiate licensing we get the license from them so they are the licensed clearing house on behalf of the university so when we go to duke for instance we talk to duke pitch them they say okay go apply for your license you go log on to learfield apply duke accepts it in the back end they're just the exchange that you use and is it in is learfield incentivized to let you guys grow like uh you know at some point do they see this as competitive to what they do well so so there's different parts of learfield learfield is a licensing arm for the university so they're there to protect the ip of the university but when we have something that's a really unique segment it's hard for the university to say no so if i just wanted to sell if like just duke merch duke would be like no we've got hundreds of other people doing it but the fact that we're in a very niche vertical the universities are more inclined to create the best apple opportunities for their athletes it'd be silly for them to say no because you'd be taking away opportunities for them by the way we have 500 people watching live i think your startup has 140 000 of total interest which is pretty dope uh people i'm 30. you uh you got that uh that young 22 year old dog energy there you go look there it is i'm a dog thank you for proving my point all right let's have a hot dog dude put those two shirts in in a package and please send them to me i'll venmo you um those are awesome he's like dude he's like i have a store just go buy it give me a yeah give me that coupon what about uh i like you're doing this franchise model right so you're basically going to get like kind of passionate cheap labor on the campuses uh and and you're going to have this set up on each campus where they do the design the marketing yeah and we already have that up until nil came about that was our thematic approach we teach college students design and sales so right now we have 150 students on 40 campuses they're really big into the greek system but now that we have the greek system and sports it makes it so much easier for our students across the country so okay so this is kind of a pivot error bit uh it's just it's just it's just opening our opportunity because before you couldn't do really sports now it's you can do it just about everything when did you uh start this company and like how much money have you already raised um so i bought out a little print shop right after graduating college i had a brian scalibrini design go viral when i was in school and so i had enough money to buy this little print shop out we've since scaled that and so we just got mark's investment for 250 000 other than that everything else was bootstrapped from the ground up so this is the first time we're actually raising capital so we still own most of the company um and we are cash flow positive we should be profitable this year there is like a first movers like we gotta land grab all these schools pretty quick okay you gotta stop sam's getting too excited uh this is a video at a family show we can't uh we can't cross the line here so you're saying all the right words yeah i mean i love you i think i love you i i bid and my wife is definitely no i'm i'm i'm totally interested i i think you've got a lot of charisma you got a lot of charm you're all the story about buying the small print shop and then getting mark cuban be a cold email i know that it looks like you have light bank on board they seem like sharks i don't know much about them but they seem like if you got that groupon yeah yeah so eric you you you have a very interesting uh energy about you so i'm definitely interested in learning more they're telling us it's time i got one last question for you which is these ideas sound fun and i often run away from fun ideas because you know a bunch of people go try to do it maybe the opportunity is not that big because it's it's fun and sexy um the the big like youtuber merch back-end stores like fan joy and some of these other ones like they pretty much all suck right none of them got huge what's the difference here okay sonic's got big but that's different so you have to think about like why we're defensible is because we're we're essentially enabling our athletes to do the marketing for us right and so if you have 300 athletes at the university of indiana all pushing this store every year the school's going to be adding more athletes and then they're going to be pushing those into our big funnel so like at the university of illinois we're sitting on 20 000 illini emails and now we can step up to fanatics and start competing with them because all of our customer acquisition is rooted in the kids that are actually playing does that make sense yes okay so so spring so teespring is uh the platform actually walker is one of my good friends yeah yeah yeah um and so like a lot of our stuff there's a small circle of us that have raising money in the tech space and apparel we all talk to each other so a lot of this is calling on a lot of each other's apis um and and using a lot of the tech there's them what you print through them no we we could print through like we have our own facility but that doesn't scale and so um our cto actually came from a company called printavo shout out bruce ackerman he got acquired recently and so we can connect to thousands of print shops across the country and so we have the ability to connect the same way teespring does customing all the bigger guys right where where do you live you live in chicago chicago nice dude sam's coming over yeah okay all right you're talking dirty to me midwestern guy doing all that stuff i'm i'm very interested thanksgiving great job talk soon thanks i like it man that guy had some charisma i think the business is more than mildly interesting yeah yeah he's a good entrepreneur you could tell right yes like a bunch of the little like green flags that you would have to be a good entrepreneur he's got and um and i think he's got a really interesting opportunity here because of the nil change and uh that's that answers the big why now question why okay the idea of printed t-shirt swag is like you know the oldest solution in the book but there's a new problem and the new problem is that all of a sudden athletes can do this they never could but they don't know where to start and they're not going to want to do all this infrastructure so being the company that partners with them that's true i think it's really strong these econ plays can be freaking tough man walker williams who the hard part here is upside right like is this is this a billion dollar company is this a hundred is this a 10 billion dollar company there's basically no way this is a 10 billion company unlikely it's even a billion dollar company so that's the hard part he's going to raise on like tech valuation terms he's a million cap right now yeah but what is his revenue uh i don't know yet he didn't he didn't say i said seven he said seven million this year i think he said i mean and econ seven million is like not very much right so but this is none four million last year he said uh this is it crosses the threshold uh so four million last year seven million this year it crosses the threshold of being interesting enough to not say no at least for me yeah the one thing i would want to be figuring out here is okay cool you're going to raise this money at 10 um are you going to raise money again and is your do you look does he think about this mentally like oh i'm a tech founder i'm going to raise my seed my series a my series b my series c if so i'd have to get off the train but if he's basically like hey i'm i'm going to fund this and value this based on the category that i'm in um which is you know let's say in this case e-commerce i think our tech enabled e-commerce i think that there would be a um a better conversation there so i think that's my only concern is how big is the is the prize i like everything he's doing but that part's not in his control yeah well i felt bad for being rude to him so i'll uh i'll look at it this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform where everything is fully integrated well i can see the clients hold history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago i totally missed hubspot grow better um all right next tara shroom jared from terrace room what's up guys how are we doing what's up i take it away all right sam and sean why do people listen to my first million podcasts well it's because they want to make more money coincidentally tim ferriss says of all the billionaires i personally know almost without exception use mushrooms on a regular basis so if you want to step up the podcast to my first billion you might be interested in what we're building so terrace room is really straightforward it's a patent-pending mushroom grow chamber that is intelligent and automated and so that way anyone can grow mushrooms at home effortlessly and the problem is is while a lot of people want to grow mushrooms at home growing mushrooms is complicated and it's an eyesore and i've been growing mushrooms for nearly six years now so i'm speaking from my own personal experience but mushrooms they're becoming a wildly popular and the space is blowing up with billions that are spent on mushrooms annually so let's transition a bit and let's talk about product market where we're at so the past about two months we've spent about four thousand five hundred dollars in facebook ads and this has resulted in nearly sixty five 000 worth of pre-orders and how our business model is set up we have subscription revenue basically growth supplies that we send every single month when you factor this in we're looking at over a hundred thousand dollars when you factor in this subscription ltv and this is the team that's making it all possible so a team is stacked with deep technical operational and sales experience we have multiple exits and ipos under our belt and one who you might even recognize is an old friend of yours sam as well as former guests on this podcast justin mayers so what we're looking for is uh 500 000 at 3.25 post money valuation this is going to help cover all manufacturing costs get it slated for a q4 launch and ultimately shipping out in uh q1 of next year so guys like if you want to be part of building a product that's helping people become happier healthier and maybe even produce a few more billionaires then we'd love your help to make this happen thank you dude that tim ferriss quote ambitious that's a very rich quote is that real he said every single one of his billionaire friends takes mushrooms a derivative of mushrooms we can say but uh yes interesting um well good pitch it looks good so explain what it is it's a it's a home brew kit for growing shrooms yeah uh any type of mushroom species so let me give a little bit of backup so um there's a couple companies that are kind of in space right now one is back to the roots they're doing over a hundred million dollars right now in revenue per year okay back to the roads is doing a hundred million in revenue yep and then there's mud water there's four stigmatic basically when you take of some companies that are in this space they're doing nearly a quarter billion dollars from three companies alone what we're doing right now is we have a trojan horse this is a beautiful grow chamber that gets people in the app ecosystem where we have awesome upsell opportunities into other verticals and long-term play is ultimately therapeutic so when you think of like the the science the research is irrefutable legislation's changing it's 2022. big pharma quite frankly they're they're scared they see the science um and so we just have a really really cheap way to basically super cheap customer acquisition costs get people in the ecosystem and ultimately down the line we can almost go down to like telehealth and a lot of like we're basically we're not selling atoms we're ultimately selling like ones and zeros or bits and bytes so let me pause you so you said back to the roots does a hundred million dollars and you're like that's a comparable but i go back to the roots and it's like you know moms and their kids and they're growing plants at home is what it looks like not like you know uh high achievers taking mushrooms to be happy because they the money they're cool yeah cool mom yeah it seems like a totally different thing so so let me uh talk a little bit about distinct uh distinction uh you can grow any type of mushrooms in this gourmet medicinal other varieties as well this is not limited to the type that you're thinking of as well as you can even grow microgreens i mean this is ultimately a containerized grow environment that gives you full control over all environmental settings so there's a lot that can happen in this and that's the exciting part is we have an iot device that's connected in the home you guys know what's happening with sodastream traeger grills doing hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue exact same thing and this is exactly where we're skating to where the puck is and so why do you pitch it like it's the like psychedelics thing versus hey we're sodastream for growing like you know veggies or whatever the hell like michael whatever uh there's there's a couple there's a couple of people in the whole space right now uh when it comes to uh you know like hydroponic growth solutions for like lettuce um and i think you know the truth is is like what we're just seeing is uh the green rush happened a couple years ago uh about a decade ago in california we're seeing the exact same thing happen in mushroom space and that is where there's going to be billions and billions of dollars to be made so you can sell i i know nothing about mushrooms so you can sell that stuff so here's the thing what we are selling uh just to be clear what we are selling is just the grow chamber we're just selling hardware and we'll say basically sell some raw and greens you can buy from the store or what uh what have you um then we will also sell basically the grow supplies if you want to do gourmet varieties fun fact it's not what something that most people don't know you can grow you can order any type of mushroom spore varieties if you catch my drip because they do not contain the psychoactive ingredient in 47 of the 50 u.s states this is a legal loophole i've been growing them for about six years all different types so it's something that not many people know but it's becoming very well established are you on shrooms right now uh okay this is okay he didn't answer [Laughter] no he's got his wits about him all right uh okay so you're so you're doing this and you think that also like you're growing through paid ads and through paid ads you're like okay we're not going to get um you know blocked by facebook for basically saying you know grow your own weed at home like you know that's what happened they wouldn't allow that but you're going to basically be able to show this terrain you know this home you know a little trade that you're gonna be able to buy yeah yeah so actually you know it's funny uh talking just amazing we're doing a huge pivot away from actually the whole like anything psychedelic so it's actually just very much like generic so um taking it very much more down a pc route to basically just grab a much wider audience wow um oh okay so so you have some interest here if you have 40k of interest but you've you're raising 605 000 is that right um i'm sorry am i reading this around he's raising 250k 250k at a 3.3 million cap 605 is like in this whole session how many people have been interested in funding things he's got himself and how is this business and what's going to happen like where what do you think the exit is yeah great question um so honestly i've just been working on this uh for the past few months uh everything from the cad modeling design you know literally everything you've seen uh done myself so basically we're getting ready for uh getting some engineering validation testing and then ultimately exit strategy is i mean extremely profitable um you know acquisitions i mean it's just like the truth is like we like to make money that's why you know we're on this podcast right but um there's a lot of different ways give us the unit economics real quick you can make them you can make the device for what and like basically the cogs plus the shipping is what do you sell it for yeah perfect so uh what we're looking right now is 49 and some change for uh manufacturing when you factor in cac when you factor in 3pl basically landed costs you're looking at about 128 uh msrp is 3.99 and then we have a 29 a month uh subscription uh so basically you're looking at total about seven hundred dollars uh for the customer ltv based off of like about a thirty some dollar cat okay all right that's time thank you dude thanks jared dude it's crazy man valuations have changed he's raising a 3.3 million dollar cap i was thinking about like the upside here um it got thing angel doesn't get far more attractive in the last three months yeah these valuations were all extremely reasonable uh and i think they were also very early stage so these are like pre-seed type of investments which is great because you know that's where a lot of money can be made um yeah my wife's definitely out on this one my wife who has never said a curse word never drank a drop of alcohol i don't think she's uh i don't think she's a believer that uh would would you ever do shrooms um i don't know probably not i don't i don't know i've been trying to tell my wife to do it this year i'm like hey before we have kids you should try lsd or mushrooms or something that'd be awesome i'm not gonna do it yeah you're like you should i'm not gonna do it like like the other day we were talking about this relationship book uh like like to make our relationship better i'm like hey can you read this for us yeah that's how i feel about mushrooms like hey can you do this for us you know it's supposed to change change people's lives and make them feel better and happier can you do it for both of us um yeah this is i i would say i'm mildly interested in this as well i need to learn more i don't know i his answer of is this illegal to sell is still a little no he's saying it's legal he's saying all we sell is hardware and then we sell raw ingredients and then 49 of the 50 whatever states yeah but he used the phrase if you catch my drift yeah you never you never want to use if you catch my drift and it's a legal loophole uh during your pitch because that just sort of says uh you know you're one inch away from this business collapsing yeah if you catch my drift yeah that's like that that's that that's really interesting to me more than two winks in your pitch i'm out like you don't want to be like yeah you know what i mean yeah yeah so i i i need to do uh i need to feel um i need to learn a little bit more i'm out but not for that reason i just uh hardware is hard so if i have the choice between investing in a hardware company a software company i'm sort of just leaning towards software unless there's a real outlier and then on top of that um i don't really know this market i don't know how real the shrooms trend is if it's just like a lasf new york type of trend uh for this type of thing i don't know how big oh wait i i think it's bigger i think it's i i've read a couple books about it another like people that are gonna buy a a four million a four hundred dollar uh like you know nest looking you know clean device versus just like you know paid diego across the street for like you know twenty dollars for some shrooms like i i of course more people take shrooms but how many people are going to do this like yeah that's a good just like sexy homebrew situation you ever grow i grew weed in high school in a closet did you ever do that i can't say i did well we used to like go to home depot and have to like buy the bulbs and stuff and like put a lock in the closet so your mom doesn't come into it these things like this plus amazon it's like the it's like the easiest thing ever like to to grow drugs i love it [Laughter] all right we'll go to the next pitch uh so i think in that case i was out you were maybe is that right i'm a maybe okay cool let's do the next one morgan from deal builder hey guys what's going on all right so um yeah my name is morgan i'm the co-founder of deal builder so shawn and sam have you guys heard of the baby boomer tsunami it's a bit of a ridiculous name but it's the 10 trillion dollars of baby boomer owned businesses that are going to need to sell by 2030. the unfortunate reality is that a majority of them will fail to sell and the reason why is because the current marketplace is confusing it's super expensive and it's really inefficient how do we know this well over the past decade my co-founders and i have sold over 250 businesses and have really mastered how to sell small businesses and what we've found is that we've developed a proven system for successfully selling businesses and we found the solution was to build a tech platform so we could rapidly scale and make the process more efficient and transparent and that's what we built deal builder an online marketplace to buy and sell businesses so what unlike uh typical listing sites deal builder makes uh the process guided through end to end which makes deals close faster and for a fraction of the cost we make money by taking up to a three percent platform fee of the transaction so our early traction so far we've closed four and a half million dollars worth of gmv on the platform uh we have another eight and a half million under offer and we launched the platform at the tail end of 2021 uh and currently that's been a year-to-date revenue of about 80 000. we have another 65 million that's listed on the platform right now and we're projected to hit a billion of gmv listed on the platform by the end of 2023. that represents another at our current 65 million listed about 600 000 on the platform and to put in the context that 80 000 of year-to-date revenue we're doing we did 24 and a half in august and we anticipate that a similar amount in september as well so we're just getting started as those deals are starting to land our lead investor is friend of the pod andrew wilkinson from tiny uh we've secured 450 000 of canadian dollars in funding and we're looking to raise another 250 000 to scale this and take on this trillion dollar uh problem and we want to have that chilling there grindset mindset from you guys on the cap table as well what's the conversion of 450 000 canadian dollars to real money oh it's like you guys are paying like 20 20 or 30 bucks i think yeah yeah yeah i was just i couldn't figure it out like what monopoly money to usd is yeah i know i think that in actuality i think that's probably like 150 i think or maybe a little bit more uh us something like that really okay dude this is awesome your site is great i think your branding is really is really slick and cool it's not you know micro acquire i think maybe it's because andrew was just being controversial on twitter i don't think that he's uh uh appealing to maybe all the right people i i think that what you're doing is incredibly intriguing it's this is very interesting why haven't you raised from for more people this seems like a pretty big opportunity and you only listed andrew he's great but that's just one person yeah so we started out bootstrapped like we actually just built this for ourselves for the first little while and then we kind of just saw we pivoted the business model at first it was just like uh all right small businesses that weren't a good fit for our brokerage you go and use this and pay like a nominal fee and then we're like wait this works with bigger deals and why not just expand this and that's when we decided to raise uh so that's we're kind of seeing that blue ocean right now and kind of going after it have you talked to all of our nerdy friends like well you're talking to me and sean have you talked to cody have you talked to nick huber have you talked to all of our buddies who are all like these influencers around this stuff not nick huber i've exchanged the ends of cody but i haven't finalized something but i also talked to xavier uh recently as well who's really in the space and everybody's like yeah this is absolutely needed because well like amongst our little like circle jerk group of friends who talk about buying boring businesses i think you you'd have a nice little influencer uh at least not like not a game changing but maybe a little game changing but anyway uh i would probably invest a little bit i would like to learn more and do some due diligence but this is really really cool how much how big is buy-based sell yeah so biz buy sell whatever way you want to do it is so it's owned by co-star and co-star owns loopnet and they're a public company i think they did 2.1 billion of revenue but they're just listing they don't take any transactional fees so our difference with biz by sell is that they i think businesses for sale is another competitor they do a hundred and they had 160 000 listings in 2019 but they don't they probably do you know 5 million revenue because they don't take any piece of the transaction so the their value capture is so low to what they actually could be delivering on but they're just a listing site so they only just send buyer leads they don't actually help guide through the acquisition sean why'd you ask about that versus um like fe international because uh it seems like that's the closest comp right business myself for the types of businesses you're selling like when i go to your site i see like chocolate shop i.t services company so like micro requires trying to do sas yeah we don't touch it specifically and um fe international is doing you know larger deals that are using basically like a kind of like a private banker um whereas it looks like this is kind of like how the smbs are going to trade hands is what you're trying to do is that accurate yeah an fe international could be a client of ours so we have a brokerage like a white label side so our brokerage now runs all of our deals through deal builder and pays a small percentage of every completed deal and we do their whole back office for them so they don't have so with brokers your cash flows like this because it's in between each commission so now they're only paying when deals actually come through so brokers have just kind of like flooded to it and asked to be on the platform which is really cool i think more than anything i'm invest i'm i'm interested in the i mean i think your brand is cool you seem nice and great and competent i think that i'm interested in the macro trend yeah you're handsome like a baby dolph lundgren um yeah like a little ivan drago i think that um i think that uh this macro trend is really cool and i would like to take a part of that so how do you get the crank going so how are you going to get a bunch of buyers and sellers onto this platform like what do what does that take uh i'm sure it's a bunch of brute force at the beginning but what you're doing to make that happen yeah so uh the sell side's harder than the buy side buyers are everywhere like everyone thinks buyers are the problem but it's super easy to find them and it's free to sign up so really low friction um feel free to sign up watchers and so on the seller side we've really grown by referrals so accountants other brokers so brokers refer deals to the platform as well and then just awareness like people don't know that these solutions exist so it's actually really nice from a marketing perspective you just say hey you can sell your business on our platform they're like great i had no idea i thought my business wasn't worth anything so it's really just getting awareness and getting into the right centers of influence and i think like you're talking about with some of those influencers i think could make a really big difference and your revenue this year is going to be a couple hundred thousand is that right yeah likely it's a little bit hard to predict when when the timing of deals will close but in our pipeline of 600 000 right now i know a couple hundred thousand of that will close for sure and just in the quality of the businesses um and we've already done 80 80 to yeah 80 000 this year already have you paid the bills on your team it looks like on your website it looks like you got a bunch of people listed uh yeah well the three the co-founders i'm the active operating co-founder the other two co-founders uh are really kind of advisor and and uh investor roles so they were and help out with some of the with the actual um kind of like breaking down the brokerage process and then so there's two developers myself and a marketing person one of them is on matt leave right now but uh yeah so it's like there's like four of us right now that are on payroll sick well thank you this is awesome i'm i'd like to learn more yeah same all right thanks morgan good job um sean the thing he said at the end little little funky little funky what the team not being the team yeah the team not being the team that's it that that freaks me out a little bit because in a couple years when things start working out well if i'm that kid i'm gonna say well what the hell man you're not even working here why do you deserve this equity and uh you know like there's gonna be some anger and we don't know that they have equity uh we don't know how much they're listed as a co-founder yeah but that might just be like it seems like so if you go to their website there's this like stock photos of like you know happy people holding you know coffees and like clipboards and like um you know it seems like maybe he just buffed up the team to be like look our team has tons of experience uh yeah no big deal so if it's a website marketing thing okay that's fine uh but if it's actually on the cap table or it's in the deck and then you're in the deck and here's our awesome team with tons of experience oh i'm the only one who actively works on this that's when i'm like okay hold on how many other things in this deck do i need to question so i think that's a little bit of a you know yeah that's all i'm saying i don't think it's the red flag i'm just saying i would want to dig in just a little bit more on that right but that guy just raised 250 thousand dollars it said it said he was raising 250 and he had 250 of interest so good for him i'm a million dollars of total interest for this session so um when you talk about moving moving weight when you talk about bringing size when you talk about really hitting all right let's go to the last pitch it is tim from field complete all right tim hey guys um field complete is a free app for your local plumber or electrician to run their business they live in our app and we become their bank over time we found a very unique wedge into this market as you know rentership in the us is on the rise over 35 percent of all homes are rented and it's growing it all started back in 08 when uh all the foreclosed homes or most of them were bought out by wall street and rented pair that would like the short-term rental airbnb craze and millennials not being able to or wanting to own heck now even like vcs are buying real estate portfolios right through adam newman uh so all these homes need to be professionally maintained by property managers and property managers use contractors and subcontractors uh to maintain them and so the problem is that traditionally contractors would either focus on the residential sector with homeowners or the commercial jobs and with property managers entering the single family uh rental scene uh as a contractor you're basically either forced to bootstrap your operation uh seven different apps to run your business or your resort to pen and paper which is basically 80 of contractors today um and actually my co-founder experienced this problem firsthand when he transitioned his construction company he tried the seven seven different app route ended up building his own and only after the subs and the property manager started asking like hey what software are you using we realize how huge this problem is so in a nutshell field complete is a free software for your local home service contractor to run their business and over time we essentially become their point of sale their bank their credit card think of it like a shopify for the home service contractor as far as traction goes we raised a small precede to rebuild the app uh we launched at the beginning of this year have over 200 contractors on the platform serviced over 19 000 homes over 5 million in gmv this year on track to do 10 million we're only currently monetizing uh the actual revenue on the merchant services so anytime a credit card is swiped uh and there we're on try to do a little over 100k this year we're raising a 2.5 million seed to integrate banking into the solution add job sharing which basically gives us more users pilot with a property manager and integration and hire some support reps um and uh this note we know this model works well because ever since we've removed the sauce fees we've been getting about three to four companies signing up organically every day so i'll open it up for questions tim you and i have interacted a bunch online haven't we yes we did i know you're uh i know your face um but we've never hung out have we not yet here oh let's what's going on nice to meet you this is a cool congratulations when was the first raise that you did yeah so the first race uh was um a year and a half ago about almost two years tim what why no deck um we went with the no deck that's attached to the the the thing a distraction okay uh all right sounds good are you running out of money now uh no we we have enough room we have more than like seven months of runway and this round is coming together so we have a lead for this round uh it's we're basically most likely going to close it in the next month or two here um so we have a lead all the investors from pre-seed basically exercise their paratha into the round uh and we have some new investors coming in and how much is how many people will work there and what's your spend each month roughly yeah so uh total team size is 18 right now um we uh burn about 60 to 70k a month today in netburn yeah and you're raising how much uh we're doing we're raising 2.5 um we can potentially oversubscribe it but we think that's enough money for us to get to like the next stage and last question on that what's the next stage yeah so next stage is uh basically this money will get us to either default alive or raise a bigger growth round um like we're on track so right now uh the the the companies are signing up organically through subcontracting and so the user base is growing uh on its own we literally only have two support reps on the team right now uh and that's like customer acquisition in this space is tough because it's smb and it's fragmented right um and so we found this wedge where through property managers they they work with multi-trade contractors and they sub jobs to each other on our platform and that and we get more and more users this way signing up um on their own and so therefore our cac is not as high like we don't spend money on cac basically all the users that we currently have on the platform are organic uh so say that again so how many users do you currently have on the platform and uh over what period of time were they acquired yeah so for this year we've had about 500 contractors sign up um all of those um basically 200 are active um and then this like some contractors are daily active weekly active monthly we're tracking all of that uh the daily active are the ones that live inside our software uh the weekly and monthly are the ones that would basically you use the app um like to receive work and perform work from the contractor so they're just using it to basically receive a job and do it uh with the new feature that i was talking about the job sharing that we're gonna release they're gonna get a full field complete account as well and they'll be able to use it for all the third party work and right now you're keeping one percent of the money that goes through you guys yeah so merchant services were out like when we were raising our precedent we're thinking it's gonna be up to one percent we're doing like and the deca says 1.07 the actual is 1.26 um right now but with a goal of 10 yeah so um yes the answer is yes and the way we get there is um we're going to release the in like q1 the banking solution that's going to average out to about two percent there's other other fintech offerings we can layer on top basically like settling invoices earlier kind of the way deal does it and other fintech offerings there and then from there we want to pilot with a property manager integrate with them and give them our book of contractors to dispatch work to and they will give their book of contractors back to us right and so let me ask you a question uh when you internally forget about the pitch when you look at the health of your business what is the number one kpi so what is the the main kpi for you yeah so we're measuring gmv across the board because that's what we can monetize we can add uh layers of monetization in terms of like marketplace fees so the gm gmv is your number one metric and gmv matters because that's what flows through your app directly yes so you're saying gmv matters because i take one percent of gmv yes today yes 1.26 um then and we without increasing the user base we can layer more offerings on top of that and increase the revenue as it scales what is the math come out there so you basically the last year you've done like 70k of revenue something like that 5.7 million of gmv and then you multiply that by 1.26 is that right yeah so uh for for this year right uh this past year we did we had about 5.7 gmv to date um we're at about 42 000 in revenue already uh we will be at the end of the year basically uh at 100 over 100k so i personally i like the concept of what you're doing which is basically the you know the sort of workflow slash um you know how to run your business if you're a blue collar contractor here um i really like that concept uh but what i don't like about this pitch is i'm just confused as to like how big your business is i feel like you threw a bunch of numbers you're like oh we service 19 000 homes 5.7 million in gmv these sound really big but what's the reality the reality is you have 200 active users and you made 40 000 in revenue this year right that's the reality of the situation and i feel like that was so buried in this that i'm like for me personally that's too much work to get to an understanding of your business which tells me that the under that the business if the business itself was super compelling you would have just led with the more clear easy to understand metrics that are like not like we serve 19 000 homes which is a total of 43 000 people because four people live in the home it's like oh dude like i don't know well i don't know what these numbers are but they're irrelevant to what your actual business is is your growth keeping you up at night right now what's keeping you up at uh keeping you up at night where you think like [ __ ] things are going well which everyone at all stages now business thing so when i'm not saying it for you but just like you're i'm not saying you have this only everyone has it so what what are you saying that about yeah so growth has actually been very good because we're getting organic users we're not paying anything for these users the pi is growing on its own how can you say that you have 200 active users how could you say growth is very good like i don't know yeah so the the reason why it's good is because we spend basically no money acquiring them right so we're getting through those companies that's just saying i have you know i have i have so many friends i have three friends but i don't go out so it's no problem you know it's like well my muscles are really good for not working out yeah exactly i can do two reps i never work out it's like well the point was to have really strong muscles the point for you is to have a lot of customers you maybe you should be spending to get more customers right yeah so where we're at now is like um we're onboarding customers like i said that that are coming in and then as far in terms of revenue it trickles in a bit later when it's a fintech solution right right so that that's that might be a concern for an investor but our investors online with us like if we were to turn on sauce fees today right we'd make up like i around four to five hundred thousand dollars in arr but we're purposefully keeping them low so when subcontract there's no barrier to entry and then we monetize the financial layer and so because of that it's basically we're prioritizing growth over immediate revenue right at this moment um and so that's our strategy again and our investors outlined with it i would argue so you're basically saying we're not charging because we don't want to have a barrier to entry any business that doesn't charge is going to get that benefit but then you should see awesome growth right uh and so that's that's that would be the counter argument the counter argument would be okay you've you've sacrificed 400 500 000 in revenue you're like you're saying and what have you gotten in return is some you know 200 active 500 total registered users if you had just just charged and actually had 400 000 in revenue you could go if you spent that money on advertising you could probably have you know 10 times more users so uh i don't know i guess for me uh those parts don't add up personally because i uh and i'm saying this too just because you know on the show there's a lot of people listening so they want to hear the full thought process which is um i think in general you want to have a capital efficient business it seems like you might have spent uh you've raised 1.6 million to date is that correct yeah so in this round already and yeah are like okay in the life of the company how much money has been like burned total yeah total burn is uh like we've burned about 1.8 to date right so what i would say is okay if if i knew nothing else about your business i would say here's a business that has burned 1.8 million dollars to achieve 200 customers and 50 000 of revenue this year that's the harsh truth about like the business now that doesn't mean you don't invest there might be tons of other reasons why that that burn was on infrastructure building product building a brand whatever there are other reasons but like just sort of objectively speaking that would be my main issue and i give you that feedback because maybe you can look at your model slightly if others share that point of view maybe they don't maybe they do but if others shared that point of view then you could say all right um the feedback from the investor market is that i need to either have an impressive user number or an impressive revenue number um you know and and maybe i should double down on one of those areas and do things slightly differently the stocks guys are saying we gotta end this this particular presentation tim we appreciate you a lot um coming on this is awesome thank you yes sam sean thanks thanks thanks sorry if i was too harsh buddy dude um i hate doing this because i agree with everything you say i hate i don't want to rip on someone but here's the here's the thing i think the business could be great i think maybe there's a chance that he just kind of missed the pitch a little bit but yeah that could totally be the case and or are we misunderstood right because without a deck you're trying to follow it while you're trying to read the chat while you're trying to look for the company's metrics and you go to their website so it's very easy to miss things during that process so that might be on us um and the other part of it is um some information the the the lead was buried when the lead is buried i get i get us a spidey thing goes off where i'm like i'm nervous what am i nervous about here now that doesn't mean that it's always the case or that he meant to do that but he could have just been nervous or something because there are a lot of people watching but there some the pitch the pitch was missed and i feel like you know on one hand i'm like you what you said was just like dude i hate kind of saying uh you know something not positive to an entrepreneur because i know how hard it is to be an entrepreneur and be a fan i don't mind doing it when it's just me and them yeah especially in this this format uh but you know if you sign up to do this if we us signing up to do this publicly and a founder standing up to this publicly that's the point right the point of this is it's you're putting yourself out there there's a risk and reward with that um i think you have to know that going in but but i think that you know the best thing that can happen is if you um i don't know if i'm right but if i was it would be short it would be a little pain today for a lot more you know benefit down the road right hard today easy later if we just keep it easy now and say oh this looks really interesting would love to chat more and just bounce i mean you never know what what why we might not want it you you you nailed it which was answered the question why it's it was 1.5 million or eight 1.8 million for 200 customers and 80 000 or 160 000 whatever it was in revenue um there is a good answer or there could be a good answer to that which is like dude we're building software just it takes forever but once these guys get on us they like are hooked forever and they tell their friends and like here's what here's how we grow uh and here's how the math looks like i just think that he kind of didn't present that wonderfully even if the truth is good right right right um okay so i don't know are we doing anything else here no that's it last pitch uh thank you to everybody who showed up that was that was great i think there was at least two companies in there that i know i would i'm going to follow up with which ones um campus inc i thought was really interesting yeah and the pillpack one uh was really good too i think those are my my top two what about for you i think i like campus inc and i like the business what was the uh oh deal builder deal builder also is a good one and all the valuations are fantastic deal builders at four million deal builders interesting well this last one was at 21 million that's why i asked him when he last raised was he raised 18 or 24 months ago when uh when things were hot and uh yeah yeah and if your valuation is 21 million the bar is higher on what you need to deliver right the pillpack guy's like ah we got two thousand you know he said like we've made 1500 in revenue or something like that but he launched two months ago and um he's raising at like a three or four million dollar cap right so yeah like that they don't push as hard on that like when i think about what i'm doing with my personal money right now i'm like man like i think some of these tech stocks like or just just the total index is just a little like under price at the moment and i think like there's gonna be some upside and then i look at like a 20 million dollar company and i'm like okay this is still super high risky and it needs to have a fairly good outcome to make the risk worth it for me whereas a four million dollar deal with just one guy working on it you know it's like you know yeah that could actually survive a little bit maybe higher likelihood it could survive in it and it the return could be great so down in a way that's where i am this is uh i love that the chat here these people are such like there's so many funny people and like interesting smart people yeah the chat makes it a lot of fun uh like henry just now just goes he's like this uh this this uh this pitch was wld whole lot of dogs dude i love this man these guys are great so i uh i almost kind of want to have i can do a pod every once in a while we have a live chat this is actually quite good yeah maybe we should uh and thanks for coming out if people like this dong sing this is the second time we've done this live pitch if it's cool we'll do it again dude these guys stocks like i'm biased here but i'm impressed every time i i go on their platform it is cool isn't it yeah it's pretty sweet so that's not like such a pitch sorry but it's really cool we're at 1.3 million of total interest was expressed so they really did help these companies raise money um pretty dope 500 people were here kind of hanging out and uh all right that's it we're out of here [Music] you

you're so bad at telling your own story what you just said the intro this is my story you want me to tell well well I would say yeah I would say I started a quilting company called Missouri quilting Missouri Star Quilt Company Missouri Star Coil Company it's a behemoth of a quilting company can you say what the revenues are uh yeah it's the biggest let's first start with that it is the biggest it's the biggest it's the biggest it's uh let's see we're we're 400 some employees over 100 million in Revenue like it's a it's a bigable it's a big old boy [Music] foreign it was like our Insider's joke and we in the email we'd be like you know like this young kid who just raised a bunch of funding like he's gonna be one of the greats like Elon like uh Steve Jobs or or Hoobastank or you know like when people notice would you get replies every once in a while so I put it on my LinkedIn I put that I'm the the webmaster of the hoobastankfanclub.com and when you endorse the skill it's like hoopa's thinking well and when I wanted to like make a joke with someone I would email them from Sam hoobastankfanclub.com yeah yeah I still haven't yeah dude you got to give your intro who are you what do you what would you say you do oh yeah yeah uh I'm Al Doan what do I do I uh uh not not as much right now I just shut down a a software company I own or I'm the own and the executive chairman of uh of creativity Inc which is you know it's got a quilting company a big quilting company and a a knitting company and an art company a lot of a lot of stuff in that space dude you're so bad at telling your own story uh what you just said the intro this isn't my story you wanted to tell well well I would say yeah I would say I started a quilting company called Missouri quilting Missouri Star Quilt Company Missouri Star Coil Company it's a behemoth of a quilting company can you say what the revenues are uh yes it's the biggest let's first start with that it is the biggest it's the biggest it's the biggest it's uh let's see we're we're 400 some employees over 100 million in Revenue like it's a it's a bigable is a big old boy you own the largest quilting company in the world it does over 100 million dollars in revenue and you also have now bought two towns it was so so the quilting company in Hamilton right we we bought the entire downtown district so 27 buildings downtown because you had to or because that's awesome no this was the so like when we started this Quilt Company the the challenge is like there's 3 500 quilt companies in America right like they're in every little city and you're saying that like we know that yeah like right you know yeah doesn't really pull the eyeballs in and so I like there's no ESPN for Quilters right I can't just go advertise for this so I'm like how are we gonna get this and so our uh like we were in this little town we uh we we grew big enough online that we had to like like we couldn't fit all the the inventory in our space they're in our in our store and because like we could either go open a warehouse which would have been the normal same thing to do or we're like we're like man it's awesome because when people come to our town There's normally no customers and so like the the impression you get if you walked in there it was just retail is like nobody's here and this is really sucky and so instead we had like 12 people cutting and fulfilling fairs you'd walk in and there's like this energy this Buzz that was happening in the shop and so we split it out and bought her and bought the the next building over and put fabric in there and then I was like man who has the most quilt shops of any town in the world right like that was like it's the biggest Wooden Nickel in Minnesota this was going to be my thing and uh some town in Germany I think had four and I was like we're gonna we're gonna take it you wanted to create a tourist destination yeah you're quilting just just be a novelty right it was just supposed to be a novelty and so then we ended up Dollywood or whatever I mean like if you're driving by on the highway you're like the most are you kidding me all right let's go see it yeah and so in that process dude we got like we people were coming to town we only had like Subway in the gas station for food so we started restaurants so we've got to sleep and so we're like it's a slumber party for ladies to come and they so you're saying it right now like it's like you know this is a natural thing to do but like the first part of the idea which is like let's create the town with the most let's create a tourist destination that's not what most companies do so you you have this idea from where and then aren't people saying yo this is crazy we don't have to do this and you know do you and your family own the whole thing yeah yeah so you're able to do crazy well we're bootstrap but like dude fabric a fabric company is a hard thing to bootstrap because like like fabric you order your fabric six months before you get it we're growing 200 a year we gotta hold the fabric for nine months recover your your initial costs in the first 90 days right so that you can cover terms and like it's like a really complicated we're betting the farm every three months and like if we're wrong we go under so if you do 150 million in Revenue how much uh eBay that can do uh so we're like a normal e-commerce or like e-commerce business so our goal is about 20 we're not there yet especially this year right but like well like that's where we that's where we'll end it but then you take the profits out and buy yeah I've made like seven nickels I pay myself a fine salary but like but like all the money goes back in right next purchase order next purchase order well because because we're growing by significant amounts every year and most that gets tied up in inventory in two years what do you think you could sell the business for well our goal right now man well I I I think we can get 20 growth for a couple years right which should move our valuation like a 5x Revenue so like a billion dollars yeah that's the that's the idea how many uh is your like is it like your wife or your sister your mom who who all is the shareholders so like your whole family's gonna get yeah so it's me and my sister and my buddy Dave or the uh are the are the main ones and then like all of our family just this year just this year we cut in like all of our employees that have been there for any kind of time and that's a cool feeling but you started it with your mom or your mom started and you no tell that a little bit so the idea like me and my sister been talking about starting a company for a while I was I was like a year out of college right and so like I I was uh I don't know everybody's sort of an entrepreneur right out of college that's what I'm gonna do and and we're sort of that same way and my mom had taken a quilt into it to the quilt she's you sew the top together and take it to a lady that's got a big forty thousand dollar machine and they're gonna Stitch all the the backing and the fluffy stuff in the middle and the top they're gonna Stitch it all together and this lady was out a year and she's like I made your sister a quilt I took it in I'll get it back in you know 2008 and I'm like nothing takes a year to do like you can build a house in less time than it takes to get this quilt done and so either she's terrible or there's a lot of Demand by the way that was literally my market research I was like there is going to be a market here for this are there others she's like yeah everybody's backed up and when you say quilt like literally just a blanket right shut up okay how dare you yeah but I mean like like because I know some people like hang [ __ ] on their walls yeah yeah so some people have like a decorative quilt and then some people like I had a quilt like comforter yeah yeah it's it's exactly that and like my mom's stick uh is she's like she's like the McDonald's of quilting right because quilting like most of these hobbies are very like I don't know like very defined you know there's there's a quilt police that's going to come and get you if the if the seams are off or whatever and if your points don't match and every I feel like getting into any hobby there's that sentiment meant that you're like I can't go to the group yet I'm not good enough right and so uh mom's like no no finish is better than perfect look and our big innovation did we made like the the Lego blocks of quilting right so it's a pack of five inch squares and a pack of ten inch squares and you sew them together and cut them like this and whack a mix of this and so like really simple tricks and techniques she was a costumer uh when we were saying McDonald's because he like kind of made a process out of his Burger making process where it's like anybody can make this burger well no I'm saying McDonald's because it's like it's like not fancy right it's not you're not spending a lot on it it's like it's you're trying to do it to get to the it's serving the purpose of filling you with food right I mean I mean it's funny because like quilting I never thought that uh you know cool my business buddies and stuff will sort of laugh at like my whiteboards like layer cakes up 17 turnovers down you know jelly rolls we gotta get these back you know it's like it's it's all sort of uh you know goofy terms for people that aren't in the space but like man it's it's a 45 to 70 year old demographic as the major already my customers and there are so few people building awesome experiences for them that like I I feel like a you know a line among sheep being in there just like we're gonna build amazing great experiences for these people and Sam Spray sure that is a a dwarf amongst midgets yeah no everybody normally says that a dwarf amongst midgets that's very clever it's not allowed anymore but we're both missourians we probably grew up in somewhat similar environments and that was a phrase and I like that and like it's the same people right is like a tall [ __ ] look like that's just a phrase I didn't even realize it was like don't cancel them all right I didn't realize it was bad another one is tough titty said the kitty but the milk's still good have you heard of that one yeah yeah sure so anyway what do you think it's gonna be like in two or three years if you ever sell I mean are you guys like you're gonna be the richest person in like by hundreds of miles we're gonna do just buy thousands of Acres no I mean what do you what do you do these are crazy because that's what he says this feels very aggressive the way that you're phrasing this I'm just gonna say that right now uh uh the the well the idea is not like I don't know if I don't know if we'll sell it right but there's a big question in my head of like of like I don't my my main say is like I don't want my kid to grow up and say I gotta be a quilter because pop was a quilter right it's like oh it's a business you got to get in here there's all this time there's tough titties uh but uh but like I so I'm trying to figure out how to navigate around that like how like is there uh how do you maximize value and create the most opportunity and all that kind of stuff I'm very attracted to a Finish Line right which uh an IPO or a sale or something would be but also you know get to the point where it's shutting off Eva done it's a very even gonna just keep running 12 years yeah you didn't know were you even like into quilting before that like were you in it no my mom makes me she's she made me make one quilt she's like you can't run this company and not be a quilter so I I've made one I'm making another right now a nice bear paw on point so what did you know how to do you didn't you you worked at you were a software guy these are such mean questions no I the funny thing is at this event why are you just basically been having an intervention because he's asking questions that he thinks are completely normal questions that everybody's been like and women can't hate you that's so weird yeah people are like Sam when you ask questions it's like a full frontal attack he's like what do you mean well he's like completely oblivious to the fact that these questions are outrageously aggressive so like his mom is like the face of like their YouTube and he was explaining to me what she was like and I I looked up the YouTube I'm like oh she looked exactly like I expected he goes what the hell I was like what I expected her to be like at night she's like that was a compliment very rarely is oh she looked exactly how I thought she would a lot of misunderstandings going on I was like I thought she sounded like a lovely nice woman yeah yeah and who's cool and I was like and she looks like it sweet Dorothy man but uh well and when he also said that you owned 200 acres and you like I do own so I like like this I'm 100 hillbilly Rich right like like give me a hundred million dollars tomorrow my life doesn't change at all right uh I've got I've got a a car that I like to drive I've got a house that I like to live in I got three beautiful boys and a wife and uh beautiful wife also I mean beautiful extent so all of them and uh and like I'm I'm done right and so it's sort of a weird spot where I don't need I don't need the Finish Line the the only value that a Finish Line would offer is like the past the mantle right like I no longer wake up and and have to stress about like what if we ruin it all tomorrow what if the person that we hired to do this like screws it all up what were you good at that oh yeah yeah what skill what what attributes did you bring to the quilting table great question great questions yeah uh not a lot like like uh I mean I so I came out of I came out of college uh and and my first job was with semantic like I I was a really good uh kind of networker right and and uh not not networker but like I I like people that I like and I hate people that I hate I like some guys that like you're the most popular guy in the house right now by the way I don't know if you know for real there's like 25 people here there's some famous people everybody's like big everyone's got a different nickname for you it's a big out then somebody's like big city because he's buying cities and other guy's like oh good and so big city is a cool name yeah it's like you know Tom big city yeah I mean it's like Hood it's like calling like a really tall guy shorty or something you know this is perfect it's better than big country I get big country a lot but big city no it's not funny when you are oh you know you'd have to be like tiny country or something like that'd be some opposite thing yeah no big cities okay I think but anyways you're super like I was calling out there like what did you go you go like he's Rich he's smart and he's and he's funny and I was like yeah you need to be the next Bachelor dude you know like this is amazing you meet him well I mean I don't even know Patrick was on the Patrick came on the Pod that was the first time I thought about the word quilt it's like 12 years well he was telling my story and all my buddies were like dude you were on this podcast dude you got to check this out so I'm like what the crap I was like oh man that's my story like if you want to hear it what's happening there's this there's this niche market of quilting that's way bigger than people realize and I was like what really we remember we were like Blown Away and then we were like what's he's like yeah there's companies that are huge the conversation was great because you're like oh that's red man love to hear it sometime do you bone I think I ghosted you for like a month yeah and I was like okay by the way yeah I do want to talk about that but more importantly you want to meet up in person and play basketball you didn't know anyone here right no no no yeah this is this is great did you even know Patrick no oh wow no I've never met any of these guys you took an amazing and I'm turning out to be like six foot seven and love playing basketball and uh yeah except you dude you smoked us for the for the championship game drained three threes in my face yeah I like the greatest moment of my life today so you know it's okay so okay so you do the you do the quilting thing no wait wait wait my skills before this uh just just buddies that like that like connect me up so I was working in a software company lost that job uh in dramatic fashion I've never been without a job at the time what does that mean like got fired yeah like me and 20 000 people got laid off in 2008 right and uh and so I'm you know I'm like Consulting and trying to like just hold you I was 26 in Missouri yeah yeah uh but like but well I was like living in Boston at the time they moved me out there and I was visiting my buddy up in Toronto and then I moved in with him and his wife and their new baby you me and Dupree style and it was like we'll start a company up here let's hear let's do it so we tried like three of them we tried an ozone cleaning technology that we'd sell to real estate agents and that was like a terrible time to sell to real estate agents since 2008 and uh we try to do a little wealth management thing because he wanted to be a wealth management advisor and so we tried to start that and then uh and then this The Quilt Company we had already and I wanted to do like a daily deal version because at the time it was hot right it was like woot.com and Steep and Cheap and uh and like chain love and all that stuff man I loved those in college because they were they were great and I'd wait up till midnight which in in Hawaii where I was going to school was like it was like seven o'clock right and I'd be like wait to see what it is still cool it's cool but like I but like it hooked me as a college kid and like every site was built for like for like are you a dude that loves riding bikes get chainlove.com and there's a new thing every night and but like nobody was building them for the 45 to 70 year old demo and so when I did the Quilter's daily deal I think it was literally the first time anybody had done a daily deal site for my demographic which is like a a discounted fabric well it I mean it was discounted items right okay and like it did at the beginning it was so funny because like I was I was the guy doing it all we were just scrapping our way through it so like I'm I'm not a good writer for my mom right where like I'd write these stories like hey ladies like so we started a forum and the the first six months of the Forum because nobody wants to join an empty Forum I was Genie B and Sarah Sue and my buddy Dave was Carmen and Elizabeth and we just had these like all day yes uh what kind of cool did you make oh that's so cute that's the brother and eventually now it's like 90 000 members and like it's a great old thing wow so that's really so you but your mom had must have had some following or something is that how it started no she had zero following nother with the Forum no no we launched so the the chronology we launched with the website that I like sat and built we launched with the store that we started she was doing quilts and then I I built this website on one and one.com if you remember that old shared hosting man it was a design they lost my site a couple times like I'll start over thanks guys and uh built this site and and it was a daily deal site that I would change at midnight I didn't have any Automation and I was just like go in you know be on a date and be like hold on a second I gotta talking to my quilting website and change it up tens of women are waiting for this yeah and we do we launched it I still have the Facebook post in like February 2009 and it's like hey I made a quilt chat for my mom check it out two likes right like zero orders the first three weeks and and but like every day I'm going in there writing these things you didn't give up didn't give up didn't give up yeah just like uh well I mean it was it was a marketing challenge at that point right like we knew we knew that we had a product that was interesting oh like like we're selling fabric online and like the other sites were like were like built on Yahoo stores and crap and I'm like I can like there's a way better experience for this and we're just gonna we're gonna take better pictures this is our novelty we're gonna we're gonna sell it better and uh and so we we kept working at it just thinking we had to figure out how to find people and our dude like I would write these deals every day and be like like they were always some version of the Pinocchio nightmare scene I'm like and then he turned into a donkey and then he was in the whale's belly and jumbo rickrack is 3.99 things I like I was just trying to be creative because Luke did it too they were pretty funny well dude I was modeling after that and just trying to like be humorous and and turns out like my mom's like this isn't good you need to stop doing this is weird my buddy Dave ended up doing it for the next the next while and he was much better than I was but uh so we we went three weeks without a sale finally my cousin Jennifer ordered something and so that you know we're like oh that's all right thank you Jed that's very nice and uh and we'd get like an order to a day and one day one day we meant to price something like 288 it was the Crazy Eights charm pack we meant to price it at like 288 accidentally priced it at 88 cents we sold like 11 of them but but shipping was five dollars right and so like our cost on it was four or something and so we're like we still made money like this works and the average order size was actually like 28 dollars like dude a loss leader we should lose money on this in a meaningful way and we can build this and so it turned in like the deals are are great deals people love them and uh but that's what ended up building our business and then as we went like wherever you get Fabric and supplies from we buy them from vendors so like even even today there's probably 40 vendors that we buy from then to grow it we started uh making videos like the the education stuff YouTube was only a year and a half old at that point and so like you know late 2008 early 2009 and uh there's like there's like this guy quilting Buck on there and it's like a webcam that he'd show on his quilt that and he was it was cool people were trying to do stuff and nobody had like done it well and so I bought like a Canon digital elf that was like the best resolution at the time and just like held it in my hands and and uh you know the manual zooming stuff but like got Mom to start doing these tutorials and because I'm a 30 year old bearded guy I'm like don't say you're lingo right I need you to talk to me so I can understand I'm not a dummy I have no idea what what a wolf is right with the fabric I mean like I'm like because normally teachers when they try and start teaching they'll try and like like give themselves some uh some validation by like look I know all the cool stuff and I'm I'm I'm nerdy like you guys and I just wouldn't let Mom do that so she had to speak in a way that anybody could understand we became this very approachable if you've never made a quilt you start with Mr with Missouri Star and because we were making this content every week we'd put it in our emails that we'd send out and it was so like we'd lead with that it was like we made this great new tutorial for you with all these cool tricks and tips and stuff and uh and we we had ended up with like a 70 open rate on our promo emails which is just the magic that we built around and you your 12 year you're 12 years in you're like 150 or something like that Revenue what were the first five years do you think uh first year was a hundred grand then we did a million then we did four then we did eight and then we did 14. and it did it it kept going at that rate yeah yeah it would and but but again man like bootstrapped through that was intense at one point were you able to pay yourself and make money uh so we paid Mom after three years right like it's crazy because I have I have like seven siblings in my family and five of them work on the quilt company like we couldn't have done it if they couldn't have just like worked for free for the beginning and like I mean it's it's like volunteers right well what year was it making enough money we're like [ __ ] it let's buy a town well so so uh four years in we bought our second building right or three years been we bought our second building and like we remodeled it all ourselves we did all the work and then we bought you know we we piecemeal the beginning one like it's we can look back on it now and be like oh yeah well we got we got everything this is great we did a good job but like that was never the intent in the beginning my thought was that like people would see that we were bringing more people to town and they'd start these other businesses and do stuff and uh and by the time like because we were running so far ahead of our own curve uh we just ended up with like our whole downtown and now we have like like there's a few other businesses in town but uh and just they're like because what normally happens if you start to like buy everything in a town like there's always like one or two people who are like I'm gonna hold out I don't know like you know oh yeah you negotiate like yeah because you need it you need to complete the set and then tiny comes knocking on their door you cannot promise you protection like did you guys run into that like like the average price for a building in a small Missouri Town like that was about 20 grand and uh and by the our last building is about 80 right so so we I just bought this other town down the road from us Kingston right and so like Steps in Missouri yeah so seven miles down the road is our County like with the really nice like King like well they have a huge is that on the way to Mizzou from St Louis no I'm thinking of Kingsland yeah yeah yeah no Kingston is not by me and uh on the other side by Kansas City it was seven miles from our town and uh and so we bought it's it's I think it's eight buildings and it's like it'll be like 70 000 for all of them right wow and so they're just these old like condemned sort of overrun buildings we'll we'll put two million into them to get them fixed up right but like but like the the real estate is cheap and the fact that it's already there and we're just kind of fixing what's theirs do you uh it's great I mean I lived in St Louis which is way bigger than where you're from but even that's not a competition but even St Louis I felt like oh [ __ ] no one gets me I feel like a freak here because I'm building this internet [ __ ] and so that's why I left and I moved us eventually San Francisco and there's a reason why like a lot of companies are started in San Francisco or New York or Chicago or Austin like these like bigger cities because you you meet people and you like spread ideas and you like are inspired by one another whatever and like rubs off on you each other other than the internet which is I mean where were you learning how to do all this stuff and did you ever feel like what the hell man I need to get out of here I can find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out-of-sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better uh so after college I actually left this part out this is a cool part after college I uh when I when I lost my job this was uh let's see 2009 I I declared my year of the MBA right I was looking at like going to back to Harvard I lived in Boston it was like I should I should really go SP it was like 200 Grand to get us to get an MBA there and I was like man that's that's too much money for this broke farmer and uh and so I declared the year of my MBA I emailed all the guys were like successful in business we're like What are the three books that you'd recommend I read and I got like a a constrained list of uh of like 37 books right and so I bought them all on Amazon for like 200 dollars and then I I had a bunch of buddies who were like doing cool stuff that I wanted to try like a guy was doing import export out in Hawaii and and another dude was doing like venture capital in Salt Lake and and so I was just like let me come work for free for you guys for like three months I just wanna I'll shine your shoes and make your coffee I just want to see how you run your business and uh and so I like I hopped around some of that and then I got into uh like like I got to be an intern in Tech Stars in 2010 right so like which one Colorado Boulder yeah so it was only Boulder Boulder in Seattle but like um and Nicole glero's 2010. and so like while I'm building this Quilt Company on the side we've got these like world-class mentors coming and like they'd Mentor these companies doing you know cool robots you're listening to all these office hours yeah dick Casillas super interesting what would you do if you had a quilt company man how would you like a deal daily yeah it feels like deals right okay it was so like I was getting like this I noticed you reached for your phone when I said that are you trying to tell somebody about this talk to me about what are you feeling right now yeah no so I was getting this way outsized like brain for for the internet stuff and I I always thought that I would do something like like I thought it was going to work for Microsoft or Facebook or something right and uh and and in the end in the end like I just took all the learnings that I had from this and my desire to sort of be an internet Tech entrepreneur and uh and shoveled all that into into this quilting company which is you know again like it's it's very technology focused uh way way early adopters on a lot of stuff and like it's given us a huge Advantage as we've as we built and stuff because there's no other like dude there's no kids coming out of their MBA school trying to take my margins and that's that's the acceptance once Patrick told all your listeners me over do you have piers and how are you do you have like peers in the internet world or Ecom world or you're like you're chatting with on a regular basis to be inspired by or learn from or share ideas like I got buddies right like I'm an angel investor I'm in 50 companies doing stuff we I have a uh early stage fund that I run with some buddies like like I'm still like these are still friends we still talk but but uh there's like from an e-commerce standpoint honestly man like I think I'm world class I think I I think I'm one of the best brains at selling stuff on the internet and that's awesome yeah that's awesome also the the envy that like give myself an NBA thing the way you approach that that's like that is so smart but also once you hear that story like of course this person is going to be successful as a hustler right because you you basically do the math you're like okay what do I want what's the normal way to get there oh this like kind of long two-year really expensive way can I just get that like that was my reason nine months for 250 and you're like oh yeah what if I just emailed all the smart people ask them what are the best three books I read all those books and then I like go Shadow you know the three stars for free for a dude for like three months like like Cohen and Glaros these guys they'll still go to bed to me for me to this day right because that three-month investment that I made of like and dude I was the first one in the last one out like I knew I wasn't getting paid but like I was trying to soak it all up and uh you I mean you do that and like they'll open every door you ever need to get through what was the most game changing book of all those that you read uh well honestly dude it's this book that's out of prick like I didn't I didn't read any business books that changed my life right like once you get through like six or seven I quit reading it because I'm like it's the exact same thing the the principles for business are the exact same just told in a different Parable every time and whatever your Parable is that's what you glom on to say oh man it's good to great that's the best one this one it's your Bible um but for me like the most impact was this one called coming out of the Ice by Victor Herman which is this uh this dude that like uh went over to Russia and like ended up being an amazing Olympian athlete but like Russia wouldn't take credit for us and he was like no I'm America so throw them in jail for like 50 years and it's this crazy story that I'm like this guy's an American hero somebody should know this story but it's uh like dude reading that well I felt like my life was so hard it was like oh oh no I'll be fine I do the exact same thing I'll read uh it's like better than therapy for sure you want the fast version of therapy it's David Goggins back in the day totally like I'll read like uh like a book about Navy SEALS or about like I just read about uh the Cherokee uh Native Americans oh man your problems oh I'm like I'm such a punk yeah you know what I mean I do the exact same thing it's way better than business books no it's like my favorite one out of that whole list because because just buddyman I was like oh this is the best book I've ever read read this and I was like all right I'm in man and uh that one's still this day it's like great but but like do the books and this is my problem with college is like every marketing class I sat through or something I'm like oh this is your great idea you say sell it for more than I bought it whatever I'm glad I'm paying for this right and it's all these professors that used to be in the industry that you want to get into that no longer are that might have connections that could open the door for you and so when I was looking at an MBA I was like this this like what if I just go to the people that are in the industry right now and somehow network with them like that's going to open way more doors for me how many they're great how many people do you we have 450 employees but how many of them are doing like uh like white collar jobs like SEO work yeah or like internet internet related things maybe 100 of them 100 of them how many of them live in the town uh gosh I I don't know I think how many of them are are on site in Missouri I think we have like 40 remote like fully remote like our engineering team is remote like where are they like all over from Seattle to Serbia right um and then we have then we have like our design team is mostly remote like a lot of one of the ones that makes sense to be remote or remote um but then like in town it was probably 250 of them they're like right there in town he's buying a town with good business besides like you had uh you have a business and this is kind of like uh adjacent helpful if I didn't have that but if I was like oh there's this kind of like abandon-ish town really cheap real estate I could buy this I can reinvigorate is that a good idea or no like I think I think every company should have a town well like they did you know so we can list a few for uh Henry Ford tried doing this in uh hello Windows is up in Iowa they have their own like like there's well a lot about uh Bethlehem yeah they did and when a lot of towns were built around like that big coal mine or something like that but but my thing is like is like every dumb Internet Brand should should have one right like like uh a buddy of mine does uh well this this is my thought pattern here is like it's like if you're a 10 year old girl and super into baking where in America do I have to take you nowhere right but somebody if they could just take that opportunity to grab and they're like and we're gonna have dutch ovens in this store just going and cooking stuff and then the KitchenAid mixer you come and have the the experience you're gonna come and spend two weeks here try everything they've gotten you're gonna learn how to make all this cool stuff and then go home and your mom's gonna be stoked to spend three grand to give you the experience because it's magic and the whole town is built around and that's what you're doing for quilting that's what we're doing for quilt that's exactly there are people people doing this for everything like if I wanted to go they're cooking people are like I need to go to Paris to get that experience but like if I'm into like cooking like let's say it's cooking right and you go to Paris you go to Paris and you take a class but it's like you have not gone to the cooking Mecca yeah right the the cooking Mecca looks like we bought every building on this street and uh and walk in this one we have we have all the cake decorating stuff in here and then we've got all the baking stuff in here and then we got all that you're gonna get in so you'll give tours or I don't know what you want to call it you know you sell the stuff you're a retailer right yeah and like tours tours are part of it like people people well because when I go there I'm all of a sudden a part of the community right it's kind of something right it's like you go to a brewery you can buy the stuff or a winery it's like uh like Napa is a good example of it sure like wine it's like Napa when if you're a consumer of it yeah right and it'd be cool to go and take the wine tour and do the whole thing if you're a beer maker where in America do you have to go there's no somebody should do it right I forget who I was talking to but they're like they oh uh Patrick right he's from Wisconsin I was like it's crazy man if I want to get into cheese making give me the town that like it'll teach me it has it has 20 stores and I buy the cloth and you have every kind of cloth and I'll buy the basket every kind of basket like somebody's just gonna take that branding and go build their their town around it and like it's the biggest Wooden Nickel in Wisconsin now and I gotta go see it because it's not what is this example you're giving out yeah so in Iowa dude driving down what what is it I-70 Iowa city has as the biggest Wooden Nickel in Iowa or in the world what is a wood and nickel what is that it's like a giant 16 foot buffalo nickel that's like you don't even know what I'm made out of Nicholas in the olden days yeah it's a buffalo nickel a buffalo nickel is just a nickel that was made before like I love that I'm looking at you like how do you not know Buffalo like 1905 any nickel made in the 1800s I think it had a picture of a buffalo yeah that's right that's it the nickel used to have a buffalo Topeka as the biggest ball of twine right like it's it's all that just the roadside novelty come see the biggest whatever the biggest pecan is in like Minnesota I think or something right and you're like all right I'm just gonna get off this highway and go look at this stupid huge pecan take a picture by it and like then buy it so what are the economics let's say somebody does this like what's a what's a vertical where you're like or like a category where you like somebody should definitely do it for an abuse so like we just had twins a couple years ago and I wanted like where do we have to fly to if you're gonna have a baby and they have the coolest experience you race the the the you know the stroller around the track and then you try 15 different cars in America yeah yeah it should be in like Lehigh Utah or something right put it right baby nickel you've ever seen yeah but like but like the novelty of they have 20 stores and you're gonna go and spend a week there and come out with eight thousand dollars worth of baby stuff is is the draw right you're gonna all your shopping's done there every baby products represented like that's that's the novelty of it and uh the economics the economics are going to vary by like like interest to interest where is the money made is it in the retail the sales or is it in the land appreciation because you now made a destination is it just just more is it just a retail business that has higher than normal I I worry that I'm doing a bad job explaining this and if I am like let's keep digging on it because it's great but like we're just like so so for for uh an internet business right that like our company there's a bunch of no-name warehouses on the internet that sell fabric right but we are a little quilt shop in Hamilton Missouri in fact we're we're a cool quilt shop with all this branding and all this cool stuff that we've done and we'll never be the nameless faceless Warehouse right so if you're starting if you're starting uh you know whatever whatever goofy company you're doing right like the second you open up a town so one of the guys here he's doing like firebrandt right yeah uh David Siegel and I'm like I'm like bro like go go open up a retail store because the second you do that I'm not just buying from your crappy Warehouse where you're you're importing it trying to calm lift because you're like we're a real place and like people like this you'll never come here even if you'll never come here because 99 of your traffic never goes there you're saying that that stands you out against everything brand and our split our split like we 90 of our Revenue online 10 is in store a little less than like eight percent in store but but like our marketing is 98 the town let me tell you the story about oh Susie brighter quilton oh look at this new display we did oh all this stuff right and that's that's the story that we tell uh wow most of our traffic or most of our Revenue comes from online sales right so that's why I'm saying like dude if you're if you have a brand that's fast so so many of these guys are just trying to flip Shopify stores like oh we import and it ships out of [ __ ] bomb and it's great it's like yeah but like people know they're just getting like scammed by I mean you're just buying to resell and try and make a profit and uh the second you build a little bit of a of an experience around it right like do the work to to build the physical manifestation of your brand it's the the company all of a sudden is much much more interesting in my mind let's say you uh you sell the company in two years you're you're you or your family collectively or maybe a bill uh worth a billion you're not working with quilting anymore what what do you want to do you want to start another company and what type of company what do you want to do with your time I have no idea I started a company I love called pretzel this last like two years ago and uh it was the it was the the photo roll meets the credit card statement right so we itemized all of your transactions and show you this very beautiful like oh here's all the stuff I bought it was I thought it was super cool and like the dude the SKU level data are aggregated around the user was so interesting to me and uh couldn't Finance it ended up shutting it down and so like that was that was my my big play at it and now I've I've got some major PTSD of like I never want to raise money again I felt dude once you take somebody else's money and like don't give them a return I'm like I'm an investor I know it's fine but I felt so bad dude it's so bad so what do you want to do then uh well so now I'm just doing Lemonade Stand stuff right it's like like my therapist says she's like I think you want to be da Vinci you want to like design a bridge and then a helicopter and then go paint a chapel and I'm like yeah I think that's what I want to do I just like I'm gonna do little little Lemonade Stand style businesses just like little things that can't scale like what's an example what do you mean by that like I want to do a barbecue place right like and I'm like oh yeah it'd be great and I'll like have a have the meat the pickle the and the sauce right like that'd be cool and I could do The Branding amazing and as long as I was cool to like Let It Die in four months I think I'd really enjoy it turned into like oh now I built this thing I gotta grind it out like I'd be miserable and uh and so I'll just try like little stuff like that I I mean at some point I'll get into another thing but like right now when you're in your early 20s and in late teens did you think you were going to be wealthy and then no no I I dude that's interesting uh no not at all right and it's kind of jacked it Jacks with your head a little bit and like I never I never dreamed in my wildest dreams that I would be where I am today right and so like I was talking to my wife a couple days ago I was like I think I might need can we do a vision board I've never dreamed of like what else is out there what else I wanna I wanna do with my life are you like overshot what you had yeah yeah you never re-picture it guys sometimes you can over plan I didn't expect this to work and so Landing here Landing here I mean it's a big it's a big thing in my head like trying to navigate like like in a very serious way of like I don't I don't know when you remove the motivation of money what do you do with the rest of your life because so much of our of our world is built around like gotta get money in the same year dude I stepped back from my company uh so the day-to-day work I got married I bought a house and we got pregnant with our first kid and I was like every Milestone I imagined I ever wanted to work for and like dude when you're dating it's very it's a great reason to go to the gym you're like I gotta look good and all of a sudden I'm married I'm like screw it you don't care how many push-ups I can do like I'm not going anywhere and it was like it was a full-on funky depression like not not like a depression like a lot of like grown-up people have it was like a baby depression for me but but uh like just figuring out what I was supposed to reach for was uh was a really hard walk for me and where'd you like what was the how'd you get out of that uh yeah um I I don't know well so like doing like any man I just buried it inside and moved on yeah I'm heavy with the reboot guys I don't know if you know like Jerry Colona over a reboot he's like the like the big exact coach yeah coach Steve Jobs some other who's he coaching I I don't know he's a nice man though and I like him a lot he's like he coached somebody famous like you know whoever yeah it was because you're like a retreat now for CEOs yeah like when I was running the company dude well because I was running the quilt company and it had grown to like 400 employees and I was like I was like 30 32 or something like I didn't know what I was doing and when you when you scale that fast and you don't you you don't scale your own capacity to lead uh I found myself like you know sit down in a room and and I was immediately like trying to make these other people feel stupid so they wouldn't notice that I didn't know what I was doing right you're throwing bombs in your own business you're like they get rich I can't believe he did this thing and then like after his opinion I'm not a yeller Rick baby I'm so sorry you know that's not me we're on the same team and uh and like like I came out I was like man I'm hurting the people around me I gotta fix so I went on a on a boot camp Retreat that they do and like I came out of that and I was like I either I need to fire my co-founders which was one of three co-founders and I came back it was like I gotta fire you guys they're like no that's not gonna happen and we're like oh what should we do so then we're like oh well I'll step back and like we could we can manage this transition but uh but like to get to that point where I could sort of say those words out loud like man I can't keep doing this because it's a family business and it's all it's the town like I felt all that weight on me and I couldn't get out and so what did a lot of the therapy stuff and at this point yeah psychedelics yeah no dude I'm so I'm so intrigued by psychedelics but like I I'm I'm Mormon right and so like the idea of doing you're Mormon yeah yeah no you don't you're the coolest Mormon I've ever met and you know Mormons here so that's nice yeah thank you you didn't have to say that there's one like in the room but the uh but but uh no like I like I think because the stance is very murky in my from the religious standpoint so I'm like I've got I've got it a bunch of mushrooms encapsulated in my medicine cabinet that I'm like Dre my wife I'm like Dre's Someday I'm gonna go walking on the land and I just don't know where I am yet I've never done it I'm completely sober but I'm totally into it I'm trying to convince my wife to do it my fears like I just don't want to be the one guy like oh he took it and then his brain snapped and I'm like no I don't think that will happen with you thank you I don't think it would either because I've got a good brain but if it did I do very soon drink no I don't drink never touched it well [ __ ] I always thought like if I'm because I don't drink either but I'm like if I freak out I could just get super drunk and I'll be okay you know so you don't have that this Playbook feels made up on the spot did you no what is science no I just don't like that's like my and that's my parachute you know that's my ex my escape hatch I was man I don't I don't know at what point I'll feel okay with it but like at some point I'm just like wait so you bought it or you have it yeah no a buddy of my a buddy of mine is very he's like I'm good at onboarding people in just like oh my god dude I'm like all right I've never done it no and I meet those people and they're like dude it'll be so great so controlled so safe he's emotionally stable though yeah I'm like I don't need this I was like do I need to get sad first the interesting part is just like it's just like the the guys are like I have my greatest ideas in there and I'm like can I just I just want to see what some of those ideas would be yeah I don't I don't think I need the whole like I don't need the trip you're only using 12 of your brand right now then you got like your Barber that's like I saw Jesus yeah he was there bro and I'm like oh that could be cool too I mean all right I don't know well dude this is awesome uh you came here not knowing anyone we got you on the pod this is pretty sick you're the most popular guy here did you enjoy meeting some of these people oh this is a blast this is a blast [Music]

[Music] hey everyone this is bernard from berlin germany my question is about testing your business ideas so i've heard a bunch of people on your podcast talk about this already and how it's part of what made them successful now i don't really understand what this means testing your business ideas the only thing i can think of is maybe running multiple ads and comparing the performance but beyond that i really don't know what to do so could you first of all tell me how you have seen this done successfully in the past and second of all how i can become better at it thank you all right the guy asked sean he said um i hear you talk about testing ideas what does that mean does that mean just like running ads to like a page and getting sales and the answer is yes that is away but he wants to know about testing ideas and how do you do that all right so we can share a couple of things that uh i think you talked about this in the last one question friday but the first is customer conversations and the mom test so the real there's a book called the mom test worth reading uh if you want to get better at the stuff but here's the premise which is talk to customers and your the rule is don't make the mistake everybody does don't pitch your product and just wait for them to politely be like yeah sounds really interesting let me know because that's like a false positive you're only allowed to talk to them about their problem so you do what's called a problem interview you just talk to them about their life what they're you know in their business whatever whatever your area your products in you ask them questions you try to see a is this a real problem for them uh b how big of a problem is it like dude this is the biggest issue in my life right now or uh it's nice to have and you can suss that out by trying to figure out okay so what have you done to try to solve this and if they don't really say anything well then it's probably not actually that big of a problem they haven't been trying to solve it if they've tried like eight solutions and none of it's working and they're just banging their head against the wall you know it's a real problem um and so you try to figure out the problem you try to figure out how big of a problem and you try to figure out the words they use to describe it as a problem because that's what you're going to use to create your solution and then separately you could say well i'm working on a way to solve that it'll be a xyz are you interested in trying it and then they say yes you say great and then you make them pay some price whether it's literally paid money or give give your information or connect your account so i can have your data or whatever make them do something that has some friction so you can gauge if they're really interested or not that's one way you could test an idea and that's exactly what you did this weekend we just talked about the basketball camp thing that sean did you told me what the idea was and he goes if you're if this interests you then mowed me 1800 right now and we all did and there was no website there was nothing it was just a phone call a text twitter thing and that's the way i typically do things oftentimes it'll take maybe 20 or 30 calls and i can probably get one person to show interest but that's where a lot of people fail is they actually don't talk to enough people um so for my latest thing i've actually talked to like 300 people and um you have to talk to a lot of people i invested in this one company and they're trying to get customers and i'm like well i'm gonna talk to you like well we talked to like one person last week and then the person the week before i'm like oh dude it's got to be from like 8 00 a.m to like 7 p.m and you're on calls all day um and that's that that that way i think typically works but most people don't have enough intensity around it there's another way which is you take a preval pre-validated idea so you take an idea that's already working and you just put uh you change it in some way so oh it's working in the u.s but there's no version of this in europe it's there's a pretty good bet that the behaviors in the us are going to translate to let's say europe or wherever and so you can skip the validation idea the validation point that way i actually think validating an idea is really really hard i actually don't think you're ever going to get this clear signal that like yep check i know that people want this it's just like a spectrum you're just increasing your confidence level that there's a reel there there but you're never at 100 and until you you know many many months in too far in the second thing is another way to skip the line is just work on something where you know you're the customer because if you're the customer for it i guarantee you on an internet scale that there are at least another hundred thousand people that are just like you that have the same problem as you that feel the same way you do you may not be able to find them you may not be able to market to them but they definitely exist and so one way to validate your idea is to just build something that solves a problem for you very rarely will that be too small where it's only you or only you and 10 other people that have that problem almost always there's a huge group this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform where everything is fully integrated well i can see the clients hold history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago i totally missed hubspot grow better and there's some times or a lot of times like let's say like hubspot or some type of software like riverside what we're using now where it's like it's a little bit challenging to get customers before the thing is actually built and that definitely exists and there's this company that i talk to called zooper z-u-p-e-r dot co and their headline is power your field service and deliver a better customer service basically it's an app where if you're an electrician all your electricians who work for you they go out and they it's like time tables and all this stuff and he was like i was like how did you do this and he said well i just spent all my nights and weekends talking to these business owners and i basically kind of interned for them and i got to know them really well and i honed in on the problem very specifically and i got like pre-commitments they didn't pay me but they told me if i can do x y and z they'll be my customer and so i didn't validate it in the sense that i collected money but i knew with a high degree of certainty what the problem was because i spent a year working with these people and talking to them and then when i built it it took about six months to get my first customer and i know another guy who did that uh al from next health it's like a billion dollar company now and he did the same thing he built software for doctors and he goes i quit my job and i became a secretary at a doctor's office for six months to learn exactly how they do things so i knew very specifically the software that i was building how it was going to solve a problem and so i didn't validate it in the sense that i collected money but like i validated it in my mind of i had a higher degree of certainty so to summarize three ways that you can validate your ideas the worst way or the sort of least fidelity way go talk to as many customers you can go nine to five go shadow them try to talk to them about their problems figure out how big of a problem it is and what they do to solve it today the second uh you know a higher fidelity way you actually have an offer it's a landing page it's a it's an ad it's a flyer it's an email and you try to get people to pre-commit to a solution that will also validate that there's demand to this and then the best way of all the ways is you know there's demand because you have the problem and if you have the problem you know it well you know what solution would work you have a place to test it you can be patient zero and you can test it on yourself and if you do all that um you know you're not guessing do is this problem real or not because you know it's real and all of these take a lot of courage a lot of people don't do them because they're afraid everyone's afraid you just got to do it and you can get done you can get a lot done by just having some courage and actually following these steps so that's one question friday [Music] you

this podcast is it's a brainstorm we've already switched topics like five times and we didn't really hit him with like a hard one at the start like what would have been better if it's like i don't

like something like that now they're going to listen all right so here's what's interesting we got me and sam we got husson minhaj who's a famous comedian netflix special we haven't announced it yet but yeah sure breaking news we got jimmy aka mr beast craziest crossover yeah you guys just met tonight we met like an hour ago yeah all right give me first impressions what do you think of uh mr b he's a cool guy yeah he seemed really cool what did you think coming in i just knew he was a a big like prank stunt he's the he's the voice of youtube he's absolutely you or he's how you thought he would be yeah i thought i feel like i feel like he's gonna get your turn too i feel like his like curiosity enthusiasm all that stuff is really cool yeah i listened to him on rogan he was really he's really fascinating and what about you what was your first impression i mean kind of the same thing like it was i mean you were just easy to talk to which i think was very nice like we were talking for like an hour yo sean sean just turned this into indian matchmaking so fast so he said something really interesting to me earlier we were just you and i were shooting the [ __ ] oh god what is that and uh we're uh we're talking about um business i i think i you said elon musk is like you i don't know if you said hero but you're like i think he's like the pinnacle of entrepreneurship entrepreneurship yeah sure and i was like well what what are you what's going to be your spacex or what's going to be your like big rocket thing you know and you said well uh elon had zip two when he was around my age so zip two was like his peer filing his peer sharing service that he sold and made like 20 or 30 million dollars yeah and then he took that and he did paypal and then whatever else you did and you said something like you know i think i can build like a hundred billion dollar company but if i'm being modest i'll build a couple uh a couple at least billion dollar companies but but then but and then you go but i don't really care about the money i just love winning i just want to win and i was like yes sounds about right i'm about this i like that i mean like money is cool but you know i live in my studio i don't have like a mansion i don't drive a lamborghini so it's like i like money because it can i can hire more people and grow my business but not so i can like increase my lifestyle or whatever so which you know most people when you say that's why i prefer to say i love winning because it it kind of encapsulates it a little bit more because if if you just like you know talk about money then people just think you just want to buy expensive stuff do your employees we went to his office today or we went to his studio and he's like took us on tour cool this is where we blow [ __ ] up this is oh this guy's trying to blew me off by the way yeah [Laughter] but we walked through he's like all right yeah this is this boardroom this is my office and so we go in and it's basically like imagine like kind of like a gaming chair computer that's standard next to it just like two other objects in the room just take any guess uh that he had yeah an algae and water bottle and uh just like this on the floor a bench press directly next to the desk and then the walls were just like a steve jobs quote an elon quote a steve jobs quote there was like a timeline like at this age steve jobs was here at this agency you're motivated by that [ __ ] stay ahead of it also some of those elon quotes aren't even real i love to just put fake elon quotes so if people read it to see if they're like oh that's inspiring or just completely mine well they're not that entitled one was just the one right in front of your desk goes work super hard elon musk that's one of the real ones but i have my assistant like trying to find the dumbest things elon's ever publicly said so i can put mixed with all the real quotes just to see if people believe them or not were you good at school like no horrible really awful yeah yeah that was like i mean i would act like i was studying but you know i was filming videos i actually my entire high school career never brought my book back home or anything i would just like throw it under like the bleachers and then the morning i'd just grab it your first video was what you were like 12 right yeah oh actually i started making when i was 11. yeah wow holy [ __ ] yeah and it's crazy because i see 11 year olds now they're like this tall and squeakers and i'm like how was i making videos this kid looks is your first video still live uh no because i got embarrassed because people have played in class so i deleted my channel and then i made a new one when i was 13. so a little but the 13 year old videos are still out yeah 13 or so wow yeah one that's dope that's like a message to myself in five years uh-huh uh calling the show you know what he's talking about so the greatest thing i ever did in my life is when i was studying for a history test like back in a long time ago when i had like 8 000 subscribers i was like screw this i just closed my book i threw it on the floor and i just recorded a video i schedule uploaded a video for six months and i go hi me in six months i think i'll have a hundred thousand subscribers whatever or no ten thousand subscribers i was like and then i hit stop recording and hit record high me in a year and i schedule up because you can upload videos to a future video year out it's like you better have a hundred thousand and i was like hi me in five years bro if you don't have a million subscribers you're a [ __ ] idiot uh and i just would talk to me five years from now i was just like talking about the channel but i filmed it when i had 8 000 subscribers a long time ago and then i did highly in 10 years blah blah so 10 years hasn't come out yet behind me in five years came out my prediction was i'd have a million subscribers so it goes live on the channel like two years ago and i had like 40 million subscribers but in the video that goes live it's like here's the date here's the time i'm like a [ __ ] stupid teenage kid and i'm like i hope you have at least a million subscribers and maybe you're doing this as a job i don't know i make like 10 bucks a month right now like i hope you can make it a job in the next five years and that went public and i completely forgot even did that and i just i was like oh [ __ ] i opened up youtube and i saw it everyone thought it was i thought it was one of the coolest things i ever did wow and you're like a little kid in it yeah and so in like three more years high me in 10 years goes up and i'm like i remember what's in it it i'm just like i hope by now you should be out of college yeah you're definitely out of college i think that's how i started it and you should be doing youtube full-time like there's just no world you're not after 10 years like you're probably making a little bit of money i just hope you are like i hope you didn't and how much were you at the time uh like i was that's 8k subs like making 10 bucks a month and so my prediction in 10 years was like i hope you're doing this as a job and so when that goes up i think that's gonna be crazy and when we were talking today you like you talk with a lot of certainty about like where you're going what you're doing there's like very like if everybody's got this knob that's like doubt your knobs set to zero on doubt that's my is that accurate uh yeah well i think it's we i don't know we probably spend like 20 30 times longer thinking of ideas than other people we probably film like 10 times more than other people we probably spend 100 times for a video more than other people so it's like we put in the effort but i don't know how to say where it's not arrogant i just believe in what we're doing you know what i mean um back then like how much do you think you believed when you when you recorded that video that that was actually going to oh no i mean those are just different times i was in the middle of fun [ __ ] nowhere north carolina so it's like everyone you know constantly wanted to remind me you're not going to be a youtuber grow up be realistic i think it's amazing that you never left north carolina though yeah you're still in bum [ __ ] nothing about it yeah do you still rap it really hard uh i mean i just i got a lot i mean some of these people over here work there i just got a lot of people and it's too much to move what was what was your metric instead of subscribers and like views when you were younger because with with with business it's like revenue or employees you guys are both business but you're also like a more creative thing so what was yours yeah when i was coming up it was probably can you do a set on late night can you do like a conan yeah could you could you be on i'll be a um i'll be a cast member of snl like those were the metrics kind of those like legacy media comedy institutions i'll be in a movie i want to be in a sitcom i want to be in a tv show and what'd it feel like when you started actually like you know the daily show and then selling it yeah that felt like a real like kind of check mark like wow you've turned the corner didn't you tell me that yeah that like right before that happened you were living in a basement i was living in an attic bro you know yeah addicts are actually above sea level but basements are below sometimes you know so yeah i was living like a kind of in a not a great situation though how i'm amazed at your confidence bro the level of the level of confidence like the in the video not just as a sheer amount of confidence you have because i i still think maybe a downside of comedy is you have to have like a very high level uh well comedians are you self-deprecation and self-awareness to be like you know what i mean well you told me something because i was like trying to be funny right you sent me these like imessage things that are like just gold like this you just sent me these voice notes and one of the things you would say he was trying to write he was like trying to do kind of like a comedy model yeah youtube video it's up there 17 000 views no big deal yeah um so but you gave me a little hit you go get the ego on this man bro you started right okay i'm at 17 yeah yeah okay but he says something you go comedy is low low status game you start low status is that a trade secret yeah yeah you know it's like there's high status and low status generally if you're low status they're gonna empathize with you you know what i mean so so like what's an example you get on stage you're being like i got 17 000 views in front of a guy who gets like 50 million views and right but that wasn't it we're gonna but we're gonna empathize more with you than we are with mr beast in that scenario because you're like oh man you know and if you're if you're like funny about it and to be confident about um that well if you kind of own it people are like oh like i even just now we did like an awkward icebreakers of the group yeah and i was thinking about this because you know i my prompt was say your name and say one thing nobody in the in the room knows about you yeah which was basically like you can't be like uh i'm mr beast i make a bunch youtube videos i'm you know it's like you can't use your claim to fame you gotta use something else right and everybody was saying something interesting and then i think silly was the first one was just like i played one game of little league baseball in my life because i [ __ ] my pants and they wouldn't let me come back really great yeah and there's a little status by the way that's going to listen to that one uh but he did a low status one where everybody else was saying a fun fact like a cool fact about that totally he went low and somebody else was like you know i remarried my ex-wife which makes me either the biggest idiot in the world or i guess the biggest idiot in the world i still remember that right because he's like hey group share something no one on the planet knows no one and then five minutes later all right podcast here's what they said yeah yeah yeah i mean [ __ ] you're [ __ ] your pants that little league pretty yeah yeah pretty low status and then yeah being like all right i double backed and married my ex-wife again like yeah like no one knows this jimmy were you confident as a as a kid in the career yeah just as a kid uh no i [ __ ] got off the acne when i was younger i still have a ton of acne cards so what are these even worse what are you not confident about so you're confident in your work and your ability to hit certain goals whether you're actually at least honestly i'm still trying to get confident speaking in front of large groups of people which made me want to ask you a question because we're talking about stand up yeah how um so let's if i dedicated my life to trying to be a stand-up comic how long do you think it would take for me to get good at it i mean what's the typical everybody says it takes you 10 years to get good but i just think it all depends on um like your natural capacity and inclination for it like there's some people i've seen when they're open mikers are amazing you know they just have great stage presence they have great stories they're amazing on stage so there's people like that comics that i met where i'm like the first time i saw them they were amazing um gerard carmichael was like that he was incredible he was just incredible he was so comfortable we would do open mics and he would just everybody was doing was turning left and he was just turning right like he's just his his vulnerability his stage presence people would do their set he would do things where like it'd be like a conan showcase and everyone would do their polished material like hey what's up i'm hussein and you know dating's hard he would just get up and he would just off the dome like kind of do a brand new set that night and you could tell you could tell you're like oh this is kind of crazy so how long do you think it would take him to get good i don't i mean it's that's like the question he just asked is like how long would it take me to because as good as ariana grande at singing you're like how would i even they're like it's not it's not a hack like or if you asked if you asked like a mma fighter like how long would it take me to get as good as you would like it's uh oh thank you um it's a see that's the you put them in low status you offered the two waters to me now i feel weird no i gotta put that one up nah dude low status i spent the whole life trying to be high yeah yeah i have to i have to i have to give mr beast his water you know what i mean jimmy what are you what are you doing you legacy media hack and i just gotta pour the water for them and they uh yeah it's just the [ __ ] out of here is your company ran like a normal company at all or uh and what would your employees say about working with you uh i mean you wanna just come say that yeah i don't know yeah that's a three question that's a true question i don't know have you had like how did you learn how to run a company do you ever have did you hire someone that's what's hard because like yeah yeah sure he wants come on in that there's a couple questions yeah you take over so the question was like what's it like working with them oh it's great i mean it's always different no it really is always the thing here's the thing here's the thing here's the thing here we know it's crazy like you're fired i'm fired i'm already fired like the house gonna answer that but not well listen let me ask you a better question all right so the better question is what's the [ __ ] employer what's the like extreme either extreme good part or extreme bad part about working with him we know he's overall extremely actually i will i will say that right now so extreme good part is is the experiences like i've done experiences that i've never could have imagined in my entire life like the traveling the doing the coolest stunts that we've ever done uh the the worst part is is i guess not knowing like what's next in terms of routine and he knows this best too like we all kind of go through it if if you work at mr b so but that comes with it you know what i mean and that's something that you kind of have to accept um but yeah i think that's my answer that's right well and the reason i was asking was because uh you are your favorite boss i'm a great person so far 100 percent yeah i was asking because my employees sometimes would complain that i'd be like too aggressive changing things too much but you seem more aggressive than i am yeah and for a certain type of person they like that but for you to achieve your goals you're gonna have to have a lot of people and then every once in a while process and every once in a while infrastructure and everyone's around planning are you a perfectionist well of course yeah um i you know it just i just like to make the greatest youtube videos possible and that's that's literally all i want so yeah i mean if it's not the greatest video i just want to upload it it's after you scrap a few videos we kind of everyone you know just kind of starts to figure it out does it scare you that you can't stop do you ever feel like damn i'm like i'm i'm just throwing all these coals on the yeah on the embers of the the algorithm i like to use better analogy it's like a treadmill we're on like 12. like full speed and i've been going out a couple of years no it doesn't scare me but so like i was telling him the way i like to work is like i like to go basically wake up obsess over something go to bed wake up obsessed go to bed like every second of the day until i just have a mental breakdown and burn out and then i like take a day off or maybe a day and a half off and i like to go right back to it so i don't like work certain days i just go as hard as i can every ounce of my entire body until i just crash and somehow that's sustainable what's that what time do you sleep uh right now usually around three a.m wow yeah and then and then and then you get up at like whenever whenever rohan or one of them knocked home tariq will wake you up and just like well yeah people will roll me out of bed they're like you need to go watch this video so we can submit it or i need help with a thumbnail or you got to go film it's like i don't know i'm kind of i they tell me what to do i don't think well i'm just shocked at like the numbers so like you're the the i'll let you reveal any numbers but you've some big numbers for revenue for your other businesses yeah and you have to have infrastructure for that and so that's why i was wondering i was like because you you are like this oh gotcha yeah so on the stereotype you're like this crazy creative person who's disorganized and that's perfect yeah but to sell that much of candy and or of uh burgers like you got to be yeah so those are all separate entities so for our snack brand we hired jim who helped build rx bar and we built the team around him so that's a whole independent company that doesn't even work out of her studio and same thing with beast burger so that's the beauty i like to just find people who are just the best in the goddamn world at their job and then just empower them and give them money and so how many people work at the studio uh in the studio like 60 because we don't have enough space to fit everyone so that's why we're trying to build more but building things just take forever do you do people like working for you you think [Laughter] the reason i'm asked is like these like creative types i'm like because the goal is to make one of us like a big deal everyone is working for that whereas a lot of other companies it's like no but it's like it's not necessarily that either there's also certain projects where i'd be like i'd love to learn from you so there's been shows and movies that i've done like the morning show like i've never done a sexy one-hour drama i want to learn from reese witherspoon i want to learn from jennifer anderson i want to learn from the show creators like how do you do that how do you shoot that what's that lens what are you doing is that a 50 is that a 75 how do you did it how did you do that tracking shot why did you do that dragon let me see the script let me see the future script there's all these things where i'm like i just want to absorb i just want to see how you do the whole thing right you know what i mean like and that's an additive like positive value for me because most people don't have that access to that you know yeah i mean samples tariq kind of made his idol today oh man bro tariq you got to set the bar yeah we had told them that you were coming today to the thing and like the look of disappointment when they saw it was i was the only brown guy there they're like that ain't how they're like yeah so you have like a big elon steve jobs like you admire these guys that's why you like the how to take over the world podcast because you like learning from them what's a story that you heard that you're like that like stuck with you like you remembered you referenced it like kind of changed the way you were thinking from those two in particular i think the biggest thing is like that steve became a billionaire from pixar you know um not even apple and so like the fact that he could go to this just not even hardware company more creative storytelling company and just kick ass and create films like toy story and all these other bangers um and just just build that company up to whatever it was like then disney buy it for 7 billion and meanwhile apple is just falling to the ground and about to go out of business and they you know buy them backward next and all of a sudden rebounds and basically the way they did it was just getting rid of ninety percent of products and just focusing on like four or five i mean it just shows like the power that one individual had even though both companies had yeah i don't know a pixar but apple had thousands of employees and pixar probably had at least hundreds and despite all that you know one man can make that much of a difference like the power of having good vision and just not relenting is like invaluable do you think your your biggest strength is probably your curiosity you're down to do anything well so i think what you have to do is you have to always be learning right that's how you can like so like with our ideas right because we like to do original ideas that no one's ever done before um and i might have told you this when we're talking on the phone thing is like if there's a hypothetical fruit in japan that if you eat it makes it where you can jump 30 feet taller right if that exists in this world right now you didn't know it existed so you couldn't come up with something around that that's very hyper specific but there's like a million things like that in the world that like if you don't know about it or you're not in taking the inspiration you can't really come up with something like if i were to try to get the stamp like that's how i would try to do something different i just try to take and take a bunch of different uh information and see what spawns in my head so i try to always be learning would the mr beast version of stand up be like i'm gonna do the longest set ever i'm gonna do the longest comedy set ever would it have to be would that be the mr beast like twist on it i would have to find something different because obviously whatever is currently out there yeah because i have a bunch of people on my team who are stand-ups like it's been done a bunch of times so we'd have to figure out something got it different uh which i would love to one day just because it seems fun because you talk to me about all the time but in general you got to always just be in taking inspiration from different places whether it be different podcasts books or different knowledge i have people that i pay that just teach me things just whatever like things that what's that i think i don't know what what do you mean by that like they'll just find things that they don't think i'm aware of or show me cool things and be like i don't think you know this is a thing here read about it and so that way i'm always like what's an example and how many how many of these people do you have this is awesome right now just like two or three yeah jimmy they call those people those are teachers yeah okay i mean he's like he's like they'll sit me down for about an hour at a time and what's what's wild is they'll focus on a subject yeah like the last one was like uh about just like crazy online um like which like these like little things where yeah they'll upload a file to reddit and then like inside it's an encrypted code which takes you to a website which takes you to a book and like these little like trace puzzles and like seeing if that inspired me i know it's just random i'm black so in point i'm trying to always expand my uh knowledge well in my head with new things that can draw inspiration i was given him props earlier where i said so much of people who kind of rev the algorithm are usually being divisive they're they're saying something that's going to make you mad right like i have a joke where i make fun of mds and do's and does get really mad and you know it's like that's like a niche physician's joke but people get upset right but while sam was so cool about um what you do is i think really what you've tapped into is joy and spectacle and wonder which is which is like a counter to that and it's very rare to see that really take off on the internet so what made you feel like i'm gonna do that versus do videos that that might that might agitate people per se yeah well i do think in general it is a little bit easier just to piss people off and get attention for sure a lot harder to do good and get attention so that's why i think a lot of people don't but for me because we just had this ability to go viral it's just kind of like there's a world where i make videos and i don't help people and there's one where i make videos and i do help people one where i do help people it's just a little bit more fun so that's why i do it i don't i you know pr wise i should have a better answer but that's kind of the truth our software is the worst have you heard of hubspot see most crms are a cobble together mess but hubspot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous i think i love our new crm our software is the best hubspot grow better what creators do you guys look up to oh i'm curious to see what you say what creators do i look up to youtubers podcasters comedians podcasters i was going to say creative yeah it could be it could be anybody anybody i think one of the first people that really inspired me i think was probably steven spielberg really yeah i mean he's one of the greatest storytellers ever what was the first movie that you saw where you're like oh my god i was blown away for me is jurassic park um as a kid i i only watched youtube growing up i've seen it that's it yeah made fun of all the time what was the last movie that you watched uh well i watched the spider-man 3-1 because but i never saw the earlier ones really yeah like you have no time for movies no it's not that time i just i don't know i i need to like i need to go back and watch star wars and harry potter and all that stuff to get brought up on culture but i was just like uh you did and so you didn't see squid game you just did the squid game i watched it yeah we did it like i wouldn't count that as a movie like i watched a ton of anime but yeah movies and weirdly enough like growing up i didn't listen to music or watch movies so i was like so out of culture part of i was an introvert there's this conor mcgregor quote where they're like you know he was on bbc or something like oh it's a bigger appearance not just niche ufc thing yeah what do you think about this team or this game he's like he's like you know the uh yeah that one you said they're great it was like it was like arsenal yeah and they're like you don't know anything about arsenal right he's like he's like i don't watch the new he's like i don't watch i don't follow the news i don't watch sports i don't do anything he goes i have lost my mind to the game i am obsessed with my game i have lost my mind to it i don't have time for anything else i don't want to know about anything i was like about this game when we were hanging out i feel like you had that vibe where you were like uh you said a couple things you were like i decided i was going to be a youtuber and i was going to make great videos and it didn't matter if i died the most famous youtuber of all time or 90 years old with a thousand subscribers i was gonna make great youtube videos like that's right yeah that's what i decided i was gonna do and that's all i do well wake up and i do that thing what was that first youtube video that you saw that like kind of filled you with that wonder where you're like wow oh well this guy actually uh got hacked like a very long time ago this like call of duty youtuber and they like leaked his earnings and he had made like a hundred thousand dollars a year the last few years and i remember being like 10 and be like what the [ __ ] they make that kind they make money doing this and i was just so mind blown that they actually made money more than my mom like yeah it was right there when i was like okay i'm doing this like i just don't care i'm being a youtuber or i'm gonna [ __ ] die i just don't care and that like the second i saw that was actually possible that's when i was like that's it and it's funny also talking about like obsession and stuff like this because it's funny how it changes right when you're like and maybe it's different now because social media is a little bit cooler but when i was younger like no one wanted to be a youtuber like most people when i was 13 14 didn't even have phones yeah like it was kind of like a little bit of an older thing and maybe it's just because where i grew up but it's funny because back then people are like get alive stop being a [ __ ] nerd like you're too obsessive you're weirdo and now it's like oh bro he was so obsessive he's it's so great right it's seen as a positive quality yeah and it's so funny like looking back on my life going from a [ __ ] loser nerd who's too obsessive and won't go anywhere to like damn that's really inspiring and it's like damn it was very hurtful back then but that's inspiring now and so it's funny to see how it changes but i like to bring that up because if there are younger people or parents who have kids who are obsessive like this that's typically what happens like younger kids don't understand that and it's different and so you don't watch the newest south park or the newest movie or whatever so you you don't talk about the same thing so then people are just like oh well you know [ __ ] sucks how would you how would you deal with that because you have kids i have kids if they go i want to be a twitch streamer i want to be a video gamer you're like let's go i had the same realization i was like oh so wait a minute we spend the first 18 years of our life trying to fit in that's how i felt in school i was trying to fit in all the time what what do people do that's cool how do i do that thing right and then once i was like in the adult world it's like oh [ __ ] now we spend our whole life trying to stand out like what was all that other [ __ ] why was i why was i so focused on fitting in if the rest of your life you're trying to stand out and i just realized like oh [ __ ] standing out has been the game the whole time and the way you stand out is not by trying to figure it out just like whatever you're obsessed with just let that ride because you'll go on a path that nobody else is going to copy and then you'll you know you'll land in a good spot so if my kid like my daughter's two right now right if she was into gaming or she was trying to be a creator all that stuff i would be all in on it because i know even if that's not your end game following your obsession is like the thing to do in life you know that will always work out but you know if you like actually go down that path what most people do is they hedge they like this thing but then they see this path that's more proven or shiny or they don't know if it's gonna work so they only half try right and then it's like that hedge is actually what gets you it's not that this career path was that hard it's that hedging is like you know what was your major in college biology the ultimate [Applause] that was different well what i think is actually you could be doing the like youtube tick tock show i feel like you can look at his videos and be like all right i get it i get why people like this i get why this pops probably pretty tempting to be like could i go get 50 million views 100 million views that seems nice no to do what he's done what he's done he i'm not gonna i'm not allowed to say you said you you spent x number of dollars every video oh yeah electricity i don't know it started off but you could say yeah our average news around 1.5 million dollars i mean that's well but look at his archive right it's like he took a plastic knife and tried to cut a plastic table and it took him 48 hours to do that yeah that's that's a dollar fifty video right yeah that's not a one point five million that's one point five into a hundred thousand zero it's a different thing it's a different thing so that's like a different type of skill set and muscle so the types of videos he's producing stand-up is different if if a musician was here if a dj was here it's not all the same just because it's on youtube so yeah we all do different types of media this is a different type of media are you tempted to like you know dabble yeah we talked about this right i mean i i the only the the thing that i uh would be um i would be reticent of is what if i have i have to put this thing out and i don't believe in it or i'm just doing it just to do it that's that would be the problem but i have to put up a new video every tuesday that's the just delete the video what do you do if you if you yeah sometimes we don't upload for two months you just only upload when it's a great video yeah that's all that matters yeah so i think it's dumb when people stick to like a schedule and they're like oh the video is not great but i upload every tuesday it's like who cares what are you guys trying to figure out right now because i think if you watch a lot of interviews with people it's like they it's all buttoned up it's all figured out they're already successful it's all working and then the person who's watching these videos typically somebody who doesn't have it all figured out right and they're just sort of like ah that's different like that'd be nice to have it all figured out but the reality is nobody's got it all figured out right like we were in your office the whiteboard's full because you're thinking of new yeah like where are we going what's not figured out we got to figure it out so what's on both y'all's plate of like what are you still trying to figure out in your game i'll let you take it first yeah sean what are you trying to figure out yeah what are you trying to do yeah come on sean uh i'm trying to figure out i'll tell you i'm trying to figure out if i want to go all in on content creating wow like i basically built businesses i have the most fun doing this but i don't know if i had the most fun just because it's a hobby and like i you know i only get the good i don't put all the work in if you love it then go i mean it's not going to be less do you love it i love doing it the way we're doing it now yeah if i was like him obsessed every hour of every day trying to be like how are we going to grow this channel i might not love it as much did you like doing the twitter thing uh for a period of time it got old yeah yeah you got it it was it was fun to chase the number can we get 100 000 in like a few months yeah this is fun to chase a number but that didn't that yeah i got sick of it too that didn't last so that gets me worried but that's the thing i'm trying to figure out it's like should i go all in on content creating or should i stay with creating businesses which one is like what what do i want to be when i grow up that's the question i'm asking myself that exact same question too because sometimes like when you're when you're creating business first and then go to content i'm like oh man am i just gonna talk about doing it all the time or am i just gonna [ __ ] do it yeah so i i know exactly what you mean yeah i feel exactly the same way what about you uh right right now um i'm trying to stay loose for this game tomorrow that's what i'm trying to do i'm not trying to get tight man i'm 36 pushing 37 like he's a young boy like he might run us off the court yeah he was like tonight yeah and i was like yo i'm like dude my l4 is hurting like my hamstrings are kind of tight from this flight uh we got to his studio and he was like uh he's got a hoop there yeah he's like oh we got we got six let's play a game yeah he's wearing his like yeezy slides i was like bro i need 15 minutes of stretching and then like you know i need like proper medical attention here do you guys want to evolve if there was an indoor choir we would do it yeah i played i played 10 1 21 with jimmy right now yeah okay that'd be a fun that would be it so that would be a fun video that would be a fun video you want to make it happen yeah let's do it you can just find a chord somewhere around here we'll with your with your answer okay oh what was the question what's not figured out what are you trying to figure out and uh everything so i'm just going to say a funny joke to change the topic basketball how to not strain my legs tomorrow there you go there we go [Music] you

this business i'm calling only problems because forget about crime the biggest battle is what's inside so people in life have basically the same five problems health wealth relationships happiness purpose in life everybody's got the same five problems right that's the dirty secret i saw tony robbins once he goes i've helped four million people in these seminars 22 years and guess what people have five problems and he goes if you think woe is me if you think it's a big burden on you guess what in this room right now there's probably 500 other people who have you know this can have the same problem as you whether it's with their their husband or their kids or their parents or their health or whatever and so a lot of people need therapy but guess what a lot of people aren't going to therapy it's too taboo it's too expensive it's too vulnerable they don't want to do it people would rather sit on netflix and just watch reality tv for distraction entertainment wait a minute is that a great idea is that a great idea i just heard yes it is you turn therapy into entertainment so it's called only problems it's only fans for therapy and here's how it works you are going to um you pay a monthly subscription and you get to sit in fly on the wall style to somebody going through an actual therapy session with the problem that you have right with the area of your life that you're most curious about you can go listen to somebody vent about their relationships about their health problems about their career problems whatever it is they're getting real therapy but they get it subsidized so they get cheap therapy maybe free therapy because there's 25 people anonymous people who don't know their identity you don't know you don't know the listeners identity that get to listen in and they get to back channel talk a little [ __ ] in the chat you don't get to see that and um they get to sit in on a therapy session therapists get more clients people get more help and other people get kind of second hand smoke help by being in the crowd and getting to listen to they get the entertainment and they get help [Music] all right so we're here we're gonna do a fan favorite the drunk ideas episode this but this episode started when i had some business ideas that i'll admit it i knew they were bad but they weren't all bad they were bad good and bad good is a separate thing altogether bad good how do you explain bad good you know what i mean when i say that right yeah it's like the lady who sells farts in a jar like when you're telling someone about it you're like that's that's the stupidest [ __ ] i've ever heard and then she makes five hundred thousand dollars have you seen that lady yeah yeah this this idea is like the beefy five burrito at at taco bell it's bad good and so so so basically these are ideas that i know are not great but there's some nugget of gold in them there's some truth to them and so they need to be said and so you know i think being drunk is like air cover to saying some silly stupid things neither of us i don't drink sam doesn't drink when's the last time you drank like 10 years ago ten eight years ago when was that eight years ago oh well i'm not like you know i don't have like my sobriety coin or whatever the hell like i just like i just generally i generally don't drink it's not like a i'm not a dork i don't have a problem yeah you should lie and say you did no no no i didn't have to overcome this i just kind of and the best drunk idea last time that i still think about it all the time was called the really long distance girlfriend which was a service where you just text a lady and she just becomes your companion but you never actually see her because she's just a really long distance girlfriend and she's the best kind of girlfriend she's only supportive why because she's paid that's it she's paid to be great and so you don't have to and you don't have to be great you don't have to be a great boyfriend she's just a great girlfriend but at a distance and so she's a really great girlfriend for like a lot of people and uh you know i should set up a call center in the ukraine because i think that idea still has legs uh all right so let's do we so this time last time it was just me this time we both were supposed to do this uh how was this for you i uh dude i'm good it was how are you all of my i've got a few but some of them are actually like good ideas and some of them are not even that funny but i've got a couple i've got a few but i want you to start so you only have most of my ideas are like bad bad ideas no i've got a couple of good ones most of mine are things that already kind of exist and i'm um shocked that they work and i have what those are all right all right and so all right so pitch we're gonna pitch each other these i don't know what yours are you don't know what mine are we're gonna pitch each other these and then ben uh producer ben young powerful producer ben man of god ben ben who can still dunk and we're going to see it this weekend ben he's going to be the judge at the end you're going to give us the the the best and the worst ideas you know you can give us the winner and the honorable mention all right uh i'll go first can i go first yeah you're gonna end up going first and second and fourth and fifth probably yeah it's like a fantasy draft where i have three of the teams yeah okay so all right the first idea sam it's called hideaway all right let me just i'm gonna ask you a question you need to think of the scariest things in the world maybe you're thinking about snakes maybe public speaking the right that's we've heard those studies but public speaking is sort of silly nobody's actually afraid of public speaking they're afraid of public humiliation and there's no greater humiliation than digital humiliation i'm talking about you're in a work presentation and you try to share your screen and you still got a tab open from last night you know that's that's public humiliation but the worst one is if somebody just takes your phone and opens it up and you don't know where they're gonna go with it you don't know what they're gonna open and the most i think the most and like when they go to your browser in the first letter they're going to type in starts with the p and you're like what's going to auto bill what's going to autofill please let me have google pbs recently yeah [Laughter] so what hideaway does is it takes the sensitive parts of and this is our first product right we're really all about preventing digital humiliation but our first product our keynote product the iphone of our mix is a private camera roll so it's actually going to combine two of my favorite ideas so one we solve the pain of somebody taking your phone or you're trying to show them a photo but you're scrolling through your camera roll of all your photos which is ridiculous of ridiculous invasion of privacy and one of my favorite ideas or something i've always wanted growing up was in a movie you see those secret you know the rich people have they have a room in their house with a secret book yes so they you know they pull the fourth book on this on the second shelf and a secret door emerges so it's that it's a secret bookcase it's a murphy door for your for your uh phone it is hideaway and so what is it it's basically a camera and a camera roll that is private and kept separate from your main camera and camera roll so you open up the app it's disguised to look like a harmless app it looks like an amazon kindle app it's like a book bookshelf but only when you tap the third seventh and eighth books does it flip over and it's a camera and then that that camera roll is for your eyes only hideaway that's the idea it could be a calculator app it could be a book book reading app it's got to be something that looks harmless that even a if your parent looked over your shoulder and saw oh my son is just browsing the latest books he's just doing some quick calculations they don't know that you're actually going to your secret camera roll all right what do you think all right let me let me elaborate a little bit on this um so do me a favor and all right you're on your computer go to search photovault app okay photo vault app and you should is the first result uh at apple no no the first result i see is private photo vault pick safe and it's literally the icon is incredible hey you youtube guy put the icon of this on the screen it's a manila folder but photoshopped onto it is a giant key lock and the key is just going directly through the middle of the manila folder which is incredible so this app it's been reviewed 807 000 times and it's 86 in the app store this app has been around for a while and i've looked into it a fair bit the founder his name is william sidwell siddell um he's based out of vegas i can't find much information about this company but you shouldn't yeah he he as i shouldn't he's done a good job but i believe he's one of the only employees because i can't find anything on linkedin and an app that's been reviewed 800 000 times i mean it must have been downloaded tens of millions of times and they have a premium version and the premium version they like it does the premium version is like 50 bucks a year and it does and it stores photos and stores documents and stores all this [ __ ] but what it does is like it makes your it makes the app look like a game and you have to do photo id and then type in like three different passwords in order to get to just the photo vault password it's pretty interesting and this app i've not seen a lot of people online talk about it but it's kind of a juggernaut man it's been around forever i have to imagine that pictures is one of the most popular category in the app store and this has been ranked 86 or it is 86 now and i bet you this has been ranked like that for a long long long time it's crazy the amount of reviews this this is incredible so you know so if you go to the google play store it'll tell you the rate download range right apple doesn't do that but on google play this has been downloaded at least 10 million times says 10 million plus so that means it's above 10 but less than 50 million that's that range and um and that's just on google play let alone and we i mean you know how i feel about android so yeah so we know you know i'm already i'm already thinking if google play if google plays at 10 million you just you know what my boys on apple are doing and by the way i don't know why i said that there's a guy in the youtube comments it's always like dude sean's always sean's always got a comment about android he just does a laughing emoji so i decided to make that my thing um but i don't really have anything against it uh but for the record i do all right the the key feature of this that i didn't have in my pitch decoy password so uh sometimes a nosey person wants into your private photo yes if you have a dummy password that will show you just a random set of safe images and they think they got in this guy thought of everything bro this is amazing dude it's fascinating so let's just if we assume that google has 10 million which would mean that um apple probably has five times that right so 50 million so he's probably has 50 to 60 million downloads ever if you assume okay yeah well if you well if google is 10 million right you said it's at least why would apple be 10 why would i have to be five times more there's more google users some more android users well then maybe my math is [ __ ] up so let's just say it's equal let's just say let's just say that it's uh 20 million you don't have to believe that he did that with two g's fugged up yeah two g's in fact if your kids are in the car turn the volume up that was fine what he just did so that was good like [ __ ] this shiv um [Laughter] it's good uh so like if he has 20 or 30 million downloads do you think it's i don't really remember uh like app conversion rates is it crazy to think that he would have a three percent conversion is it crazy to think that you'd have one million paying uh premium users not crazy not crazy so it's 40 which means this guy has probably gross in the lifetime 40 million bucks from his premium version let's just put it this way at the bottom of the page the copyright 2011-2020 says it's from legendary software labs llc and i just got a call from the state of delaware and they said there's never been a better better named company that company name was perfectly appropriate we've reviewed it we triple stamped the double stamp and that was correct this is a legendary software and uh my drunk idea is validated all right you're up [Laughter] all right um i found something that it seems like it came out of a a drunken like bar hangout one night so do me a favor go to santasclub.com santa's club oh god is this are we going nf nsfw here uh no it's safe it it that it could go either way but no that otherwise actually everything's safe for work now we're working it from home bro like that that thing needs to be gone all right all right that's a good point have you seen not not safe for life [Laughter] on reddit i go to these uh forums and some of the stuff are tagged uh not safe for life and it's hilarious it's it's a pretty like it'll be like someone popping a zit and it says not not safe for life okay so i'm on santa's club there we go thank you so santa's club it was started in 2020 this guy named will uh evelsizer started it and each year about 15 000 people come to his site and they spent around 75 and it only up this business only operates two months out of the year and basically if you go to the yes if you go to the website what you're going to see is like your typical look at santa claus in a studio and he you get to spend 15 minutes and you do a virtual santa sit on their lap ask what you want for christmas type of thing for only 10 or 15 minutes and he's got like a studio probably in nevada where instead of cam girls it's just fat santas and he makes according to i read some articles about it in the first year he had 15 000 visits and prices range from 35 to 75 dollars per visit which means he's doing around 500 000 to a million dollars in only two months and if you go to the website now he's got like a pre-sale it's 100 sold out you can't buy anymore the guy's got to go get more santas dude this is hell this is genius this is hilarious this is not even a good bad idea this is simply a good good idea so i like this i think i kind of like a little bit better cameo for for santa's so i'm gonna i'm gonna give you i'm gonna give you a little side dish there which is santa for cameos for santa's or sam jeff campbell in fact steven he came on the pod i think did he come on the punt former duke guy built cameo he needs to just implement this in the cameo this holiday season well this is it's very clear santa santa's club they just got to get the easter bunny the tooth fairy what are the other like uh characters yeah that's great that's what you gotta do uh ben do you guys got some holidays where you need a little uh character of some kind yeah like a joseph smith like a guy in a beard with like eight wives we got pioneer day yeah maybe you know a pioneer type dude that could work no we're just gonna we got the christian holidays we got we got easter and christmas sorry i can't do more for you we're going to call it fairy inc and the employees are going to be the fairies and um we're going to have easter bunny santa tooth fairy what else is there i i forget what i don't know what else there is there's are we gonna have any copyright issues because that's also what we call morning brew on the download oh [Laughter] this is a good business it's pretty cool so it started off as a drunken idea but it's actually cool i have this lady who i have no i think she listens to the podcast and she fretted me on facebook and she dresses like elsa like from frozen and people pay her money to do a call like she like has you know she's like a disney uh like this is great it's cosplay but like you know a paid little cameo call or recorded video that makes a lot of sense to me like i know that's like you know obviously copyright but like if it wasn't right santa that's that that's that makes sense easter bunny tooth fairy those all make sense that you should be able to do this uh you know and especially if you did it on demand somebody could just rip out like hundreds of these in a studio every single day just being like oh amanda you know ho ho merry christmas your mom wanted me to tell you you've been doing great job with blah blah blah see you later next video and like each one of those is forty dollars a pop you know how like on webinars i think you'll see you'll see like business webinars and it'll be like neil patel who's on the pod and i'll be like hey everyone this is neil are we live is this thing working is this on and it's like fake like it's a recording but he but he acts like it's real and you see people in the comments like hey neil what's up and he'll say like hey derek from chicago how are you and like you know it's just it's just a recording it's all fake you know you could do this you could obviously you could do the same thing i hate when what webinars like that well i don't know if neil does he probably does i think i have seen him do it but there's a lot of webinars that are like that and it's like a recording but what they do is they like put uh uh like replies in there and they just it's you know what i mean it's all artificial it's all fake but it they make it look real and it's pretty good wow phoning it in okay uh amazing okay so i give this a good good idea i think that's that's solid uh anything else on this or can i hit you with my next one hit me all right what's the name of a fast-growing company that does billions of dollars and serves creators all around the world it's bigger than twitch they provide private photos and videos to their fans if you subscribe you might be considered only their fan that's right only fans now only fans is a great business model the owner of only fans listen to this podcast and they crush it they are absolutely phenomenal business but i got to thinking what other space could you do this in and so i was sitting there and i was thinking and i and you told me about a app that somebody had built called police scanner police scanner plus or something like that this app that does millions of dollars a year and i just i couldn't get that out of my head i thought who would do this why would anybody want to listen to like a dude i listen to it all the time if i hear a gunshot or like a loud backfire of a car i immediately open it up and i'm like all right let's see what what what what's going on here was it real or was it not and so there's a curiosity component people i think just like listening to a train wreck in a way they like to observe from a safe distance do you have the app called citizen citizen is just like this yeah where it's like you know dude i had to quit using that because when i'm in brooklyn like i'll pull it up it looks like my phone screen has chickenpox like there's red dots all over the place and i'm like there's crime everywhere you know what i'm saying like i can't be doing that anymore so okay this business i'm calling only problems because forget about crime the biggest battle is what's inside so people in life have basically the same five problems health wealth relationships happiness purpose in life everybody's got the same five problems right that's the dirty secret i saw tony robbins once he goes i've helped four million people in these seminars 22 years and guess what people have five problems and he goes if you think woe is me if you think it's a big burden on you guess what in this room right now there's probably 500 other people who have you know this can have the same problem as you whether it's with their their husband or their kids or their parents or their health or whatever and so a lot of people need therapy but guess what a lot of people aren't going to therapy it's too taboo it's too expensive it's too vulnerable they don't want to do it people would rather sit on netflix and just watch reality tv for distraction and entertainment wait a minute is that a great idea is that a great idea i just heard yes it is you turn therapy into entertainment so it's called only problems it's only fans for therapy and here's how it works you are going to um you pay a monthly subscription and you get to sit in fly on the wall style to somebody going through an actual therapy session with the problem that you have right with the area of your life that you're most curious about you can go listen to somebody event about their relationships about their health problems about their career problems whatever it is they're getting real therapy but they get it subsidized so they get cheap therapy maybe free therapy because there's 25 people anonymous people who don't know their identity you don't know you don't know the listeners identity that get to listen in and they get to back channel talk a little [ __ ] in the chat you don't get to see that and um they get to sit in on a therapy session therapists get more clients people get more help and other people get kind of second-hand smoke help by being in the crowd and getting to listen to they get the entertainment and they get help have you ever seen this movie honestly honestly i'm gonna just say it right now i wrote this idea down and i got i got goosebumps under this hairy arm yeah you got a little little arm mountains dude have you uh have you seen the movie fight club of course so it there's like one of the premises of the movie is that this guy ed norton i guess he's tyler i don't know i forget his name tyler jordan and then he meets that woman that's like the love interest and what they do is they go to terminal cancer anonymous meetings and i don't know why i forget why but they like it makes them feel alive and it like makes them feel happy because they think that they're all screwed up and they're like i want to go meet with people who are actually dying and it's like oddly therapeutic for them what you're describing is kind of like that where you sit and you're like oh wow this guy really is [ __ ] up i'm straight i'm good you know what i mean yeah gratitude as a service right it ain't so bad after all we say so bad yeah it could be worse [Music] yeah and and that's the thing the crazier your problems are the more vulnerable and open you get the more people tip your little hearts in the app the bigger rev share you get as part of doing that therapy so you're incentivized to be screwed up you can just make stuff up to be honest with you but like you're definitely a jury springer right why do we like jerry springer why do you still watch your springer reruns every morning before work because we like to watch other people have f'd up problems and then see them deal with it and we like fights also but that's the that's what i'm tapping into here i'm but i'm doing it through an app i'm doing it it's called only problems and honestly if you're going to run with this you better hit sean at seanpuri.com that's all i got i need i need to see an email from somebody trying this idea i feel i genuinely feel like this is one of those ideas that's like no way and then it gets huge it reminds me of uh like the people who want to go watch someone do surgery have you ever seen like those like setups where you were first no so for um for like if you're a student like there's these medical rooms that have uh it's like it's like a two-way mirror almost yeah and you have like it's like watching an execution almost like you just like sit there and you just like watch what they're doing that's what this reminds me of have you ever been to this subreddit called uh popping no but i i was gonna bring up the addictive way that people watch you like pop a blackhead or a pimple or whatever dude there's a subreddit there's a subreddit called popping i've been on the front of it yeah you see i've been on the front page you see this scar right here uh yes yeah so i have a i have a big scar on my because i had like a ping-pong ball-sized thing like growing like on my brain and i had to get surgery like in 2014 to get it taken out and right before i go under i go to the surgeon and i go hey man do you have your iphone on you he goes yeah i go can you save my number and take some pictures uh when i'm under so you can like get some like before after and during pics of uh a surgery so i could post it on our slash popping and he did it he he texted me and i got these like beautiful photos of like this this growth like being popped and scraped off my brain and i posted it on that subreddit and i got uh like 80 000 views on my photo album and so uh i'm a member of our slash popping i love it and so you may not have a blue check mark on twitter but you always have this put this in your bio put this on your linkedin front folder front page yeah former front page major serial front pager of our slash popping dude i have it i i i have to find it and said it to you but you see like you know like and then he also like cut some fat from my stomach and then he like puttied it into the hole and like you so you like see this whole process of like there being a girl out of an apartment and you can hung up something so you got to fill a hole yeah he took a little fat off me and he just like putted that bad boy in and i woke up and like my stomach was hurting i was like dude i thought you're going to take it from my leg he's like no your leg was pretty muscular so we just took some off your stomach you had a lot there so it just kind of like tickles flex but okay yeah well i have muscular legs not always a muscular stomach and anything one of our creeds kudos is we don't mess with perfection so i couldn't touch the legs so anyway uh on board with only problems good idea thank you thank you all right uh you got one or you want me to go third also let me let me i'll this is the last one i probably have well i got one more but uh all right the biggest this is this is a little bit of a stretch but i actually don't think it is that much of a stretch the most popular business publication in the world by digital audience what do you think it is most populous what most popular but the most popular digital business publication in the world by traffic um so there's wall street journal there's uh marketcap.com coin market cap that's a good guess that probably does uh how much probably 50 million a month in yeah so there's wall street journal there's financialtimes.com there's coin market cap there's business insider business insider probably gets a lot i'd hypo i would say and i'd hypothesize the largest business publication in the world is run by basically two people and it is called slideshare you ever been to slideshare i love slideshare wow that's so i thought you were going to bring up drudge report again by the way no slideshare so slideshare is this site that was started by i forget her name uh but she's an interesting founder she's like pretty outspoken on twitter and i like her a lot anyway she's right indian woman yeah she started it and she sold it to linkedin for like a hundred and fifty million dollars and slideshare was most indian social network of all time just powerpoints that's what slideshare is like way to slack up but make your parents proud at the same time yeah did you see uh our our buddy sheila he just got engaged and he goes i have an aunt who doesn't speak english she only knows a few words but the only words that she knows she texts me all the time and it says are you married yet andy like posted screenshots of uh of the of her asking that in perfect english are you married yet please be married please be married um so slideshare it's just like a it's just a website where you upload [ __ ] right you upload decks um well linkedin bought it in 2012 and it just sat there and then scribe do you know scribed or is it scribd script scribd they bought it and i'm almost certain looking at linkedin and looking at the website that like one and a half engineers are the only employees working on this um and they were for sale for a little while so i so like i don't think this is entirely guessing but basically they get between 100 to 150 million visits a month and most of the content or about half but it could be at this point most is like marketing decks pitch to pitch decks conference decks on a business strategy and it makes virtually no revenue if you go there you won't see any ads and it's just this website that does 100 to 150 maybe 200 million monthly visits it's this juggernaut of a website with if you look at the website it hasn't been updated in years and years and years and years here's my idea if i were a b2b company if i were salesforce or a hubspot or if i were um i don't know anyone selling like software or anything that sells people to [ __ ] for people who goes to like you know these like business conference i would buy it and turn it into a b2b legion website and i think that you can make a ton of money off this website because here's why any website that gets a ton of traffic from user generated content once it hits a critical mass which slideshare does it's like impossible to stop you know what i'm saying it just keeps going and it's almost impossible to catch up with that it's really really really hard so i think that this website is just sitting there floating along not doing anything and it could actually be a business that makes nine figures a year through ads which is like the best revenue of all time when you don't actually have to like make anything yeah you have super high value customers because it's only business people that are gonna be doing this uh so and who bought them didn't linkedin buy them at some point or no linkedin bought them in 2012 and it just sat there and they did nothing with it and then they sold it easy to me yeah and they i think they paid 150 they paid nine figures for it and then they uh sold it to scribd and if i had a bet scribd like linkedin was like just get this off our hands just don't fire anyone who works on it and like assume all the liability and like just it's yours just go just go away so um check out this tweet i just put in the chat okay it says uh it's from you and it says free 500 million dollar idea reinvent and relaunch slideshare all right great great mindset like if if there's a talented engineer designer who wants to do this i'll give you money and share my one page plan on how to attack this all right dude we're on the same page here i think do you want to see my one page plan yeah you can't it doesn't exist i just wrote that out and i was like if somebody actually reaches out that's interesting for this i will come up with a one-page plan of how i would do this because to me slideshare is so ripe for the picking it is completely neglected it is extremely valuable as a like a potential tool it never really got replaced properly by something else and it didn't become obsolete and uh and it's just one of those like big opportunities hiding in plain sight and i would love to basically brainstorm how to how i would attack this kind of slideshare problem but the opportunity was missed linkedin if you know one of us or someone listening had a little bit of like charm and suave and was able to get connected with the linkedin people they would have given it to you it would have been like it would have been free i don't know about because scribd isn't a big enough company where they're like oh yeah here we don't give a [ __ ] just take it but when you're owned by microsoft they're just like i imagine they're just like we can't focus on this right now yeah an undisclosed price this would have been uh i mean i can't imagine this was that much i i could be wrong but like it didn't make any revenue i feel like they probably got like 10 million or something or less yeah wow or less missed opportunity that is a serious missed opportunity that's not that drunk of an idea but anyway it's an idea um all right i got another one let me let me let me make it i'm all out by the way i you don't wanna know how long this list is um and it all came to me in one giant flood uh i just dumped them all out what do you what do you do do you just like come up with like names are you like michael scott where he just like has a name for something and he builds a business around it no joke that's part of it um my thing was sort of like you have to find something relatable either something that really sucks or that's really awesome and then just use it in an unexpected way right so like um you're just smashing two things together exactly so i saw this like the hidden bookcase thing and i was like oh my god i freaking always wanted one of these where i hit the three piano keys and a door opens or i pull the bookshelf book i tilt the book out and it like opens a secret door so how do i take that awesome thing and just use it in an unexpected way and that's where that idea came from have you ever seen have you ever seen those for guns so uh you well i've thought about buying one of these where you can put like a shelf like you know how you have a shelf next to your front door that you put your keys on yeah you can buy some of these and you click a button and it opens a little bit on the bottom and you just grab your pistol and they're pretty sick that's pretty cool okay i like that put like my fanny pack in there maybe for when i leave the house like some cheez-its but would it fit a regulation-sized bag of corn nuts [Music] all right so speaking of work backers from a great idea here's the here's the name of this one i mean ben you might want to get your pencil out for the top winner of the episode instagram ahanas that sounds a little weird like benihanas it's benihanas for photo opportunities okay so here's how it works it's a restaurant that's not about the food it's a restaurant about the content like the museum of ice cream baby people roll in their eye it's like the museum ice cream but it's seated and it is uh like basically people go to restaurants they order food and they'll order like oh we got a fishbowl drink or we're drinking beer out of a shoe and like oh we got the huge like donuts at the end and they take pictures and it becomes content or like they use sparklers instead of birthday candles now i started a restaurant i know all the problems about restaurants you got all this food waste you got high labor costs you don't actually you're not running this like a restaurant so here's how it works it's like benihanas you go there's like i don't know 30 tables you sit down every table seats like eight people and you go as a group and you're going for an experience you're not going for the food and um two things happen so basically food is gonna come out that and each one is photo worthy food either because it's gross it's funny looking it's huge it's so indulgent it's right it's like you know a giant pile of sour gummy worms it's oh it's a it's the the mega green doughnut how are we ever gonna eat this oh look it's so funny to watch me try that sort of thing oh the this guy's gonna come out and you know we have to drink this giant beer can that's like you know 36 ounces or whatever i don't know but a big beer can 360 ounces let's say um and so that's the that's the idea it's all photo worthy food it's brought out like omakase and a studio we're gonna call it the uh the food porn cafe instagram mahanas is the name but um if you'd like to launch a competitor bring it on there's a drone camera that just flies right above the table and it's just recording the whole thing and it's just gonna it just dumps it in a google drive folder and there's a guy in india one guy who's editing everybody's photos all night everybody's content all night and at the end you're gonna get the three or four best reaction shots because the food gets revealed you know like no it's like it's like when you get a picture on a roller coaster exactly it's exactly but we're using outsourced labor the drone is capturing everything and um and and the food and it feels like a party there's a dj you know like those new york brunches for cool people this is that for fat people so instead of being cool and having to like know how to dance and stand up on the table and drink champagne at nine in the morning you sit and food comes out that's crazy and you get to eat it and you get to make a big mess and it's gonna your reactions on your and your attempts are all all photo and video recorded hundred dollars a person plus tips eight people per table i'm thinking you know 20 maybe 30 tables uh you know two or three turns per night and uh we're talking a million dollar a month easy on this food cost is way down because it's not even real food you're just doing like giant popcorn and silly stuff you know no proteins you don't have to worry about that there's no food waste because it's you're just bringing out one thing for the table to react to yeah yeah yeah lighting each person your f your five pound burger doesn't need to taste good exactly it's like benihana there's like a harvard business school case study on how amazing benihanas is and one of the reasons is like because they put there's no kitchen space they use the whole restaurant for like uh for dining because the the chef is at the table the stove is the table basically and um they have like higher labor costs because they have skilled chefs but they have way lower like you know uh they use a real estate better and like their food waste is way down because they have a limited menu so it's you kind of do all that smart stuff um how do you instagram honestly what do you think i'm in i'm into it have you ever heard the background of benihana the guy rocky i think is his name yeah so he's basically we wrote about it it was one of our most trafficked trafficked articles for a long time he's basically you know he's an immigrant came here with nothing and then you know who his son is is steve aoki the the dj oh no way i did not know that yeah and this guy rocky i think he i forget the article but it was like one of those like most interesting man alive stories where like he had been involved in like porn and then benihana's like got big and then went bankrupt then he bought it back and it went big again and then he was like this international man of mystery like uh it's a really interesting story and people love that company and it's still crushing i went i we used to go to team dinners there i [ __ ] love benny honda's but dude i'm into this bring it up dude when we're in like a car and it's like oh we're gonna be i'm like i think there's a benihanas around here but i'm just like i'm just waiting for that to latch somebody to be like that'd be fun never i never get any support on it i'm always tossing the little benihana you know test flare out there like uh you know i guess we could do big group stuff they got good tables no one ever bites i don't know why i'm like i've been i'm over 12 on this thing how is that remember that guy you brought up on instagram during the pandemic who started that cookie business that just made the most ridiculous cookies you remember like what's like a dealer i think is it how's he doing great i checked in with nominee i don't know i think they're doing fine i'm not sure i ordered cookies honestly they were not great something i'm sort of like uh what's the fuss but that's kind of how a lot of these food crazes are like the expectations get way out of whack and what about me's a museum of ice cream so the museum of ice cream they started a little bit before the pandemic and you and i like or a bunch of a lot of people made fun of them because they raised like 50 million dollars at a 250 million evaluation and basically i don't even think they serve ice cream there right it's just like a ball pit and like funny ice cream stuff and you pay like 20 bucks and you go to take pictures right yeah you've never been to it no it's like a haunted house you walk from room to room each room has its own like kind of crazy thing and sometimes you get to eat a little bit but most of the time it's just photos with like cool in a cool room it's instagram content in manhattan i walked by one recently and the line was around the block and i've gone by it a few times and there's always a long line to go in i think they they have to be killing it right uh i thought so but then the sf1 closed so i don't know what happened but uh well sf closed right so uh but the manhattan one the manhattan one is just i mean that's really when it's like sf just like shut down for maintenance so they just spit down for like four years um museum livestream said the same thing that every like tech person in san francisco said just ah [ __ ] it i'm out of here yeah it was like an audible sigh of just like ah fine i'm out yeah uh i think um yeah i'm on board with this i think it's good we did a breakdown where we talked about like the companies like crona and like fondue only stores and like all these companies it was like what do you have to do you have to take like you got to take a food and put it in a weird shape or a weird size or a weird color yeah or you match a weird container a weird container yeah or you mash two things that are kind of related but not entirely related like a burger in the shape of a hot dog or a cronut or something like this loco taco whatever the big taco bell thing exactly or you take something that's typically a side or a topping and you make that the only thing like a cookie dough only place that serves it in an ice cream tin or an ice cream thing what else were they i forget what they were you're like the the rain man of figuring out this food trick like everybody else just saw each one of these it's like oh that's weird that's weird and you're like i see the pattern yeah we're like i mean what what's wrong what's wrong with the left side of your face right now i need to go to you're downloading it i figured i'm figuring it out no it's it's all rooted in like an eating disorder like i go to i go to food therapy and uh uh like you know i need to go to your therapy and talk about i use i pay a lady seven hundred dollars a month just to talk about food every single morning clearly there's issues there yeah so i just used anything for the time yeah the amount of times that i've eaten a jar of jif peanut butter in one sitting is god damn just way too high it's way too high we need a gif of you just eating a jar of jiff in one sitting that's have you ever done an nft dude i've eaten a full jar with just a spoon multiple times it's just too addicting habitual line stepper all right i have more let me give you i got maybe one maybe two more let's see how it goes um you probably don't watch this show but there's a show that's hot on netflix called indian matchmaker have you seen it of course i watch that show you watch it okay i thought this might be only entertaining to indeed people because it's like no dude are you kidding me i watch it all the time and in my head i'm just thinking y'all are screwed up you guys are so weird like what are you kidding me like how is the suicide rate not higher amongst you people you're like yeah don't make me send the british back in there all right you guys got to get your [ __ ] together what the hell man like there'll be this like beautiful doctor in her 30s making money she's pretty she's nice and her mom's like yelling at her like criticizing her for not being married it's crazy i can't find this client info have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases hubspot grow better [Music] so my sister called me last night after she's like i finished season two and she just goes i need to ask you something it's not too personal i was like oh what's it gonna be she goes when you first met uh when you first met sonya did you did you have a game because on the show the indian guys have zero game and i was like like what do you mean like i guess so and then she's like no think about like she was like and she's like these guys they're nice guys they're smart guys they're like you know they're they're good job they're normal people they have no crazy drug habits the reason they're still single is because they don't know how to look at talk to or touch a girl and i was like oh yeah i had that problem yeah that's me too actually you're right dude i saw uh i saw someone post a picture of a painting of a naked woman from like the 1700s and it was all indian guys commenting saying like hey baby i love you i love you for a long time text me call me yeah that's like if if you're ever a girl who does like live streaming on like whatever twitch or like whatever periscope whatever app uh they're all like what is why are there so many men in like turkey the middle east and india who will just they just flood their chat and they just keep saying show bobs show bob show bombs and then they say he'd say show bob's so you didn't have game you were you were you were uh so so i asked then i asked my wife i was like i was like yeah my sister asked me this i was like i don't think i did did i she's like no you didn't and i was like uh i was like she's like you know you had a different type you had like intellectual game like she's like you were good at like telling stories or you would say interesting things and that counts like that's like the basic like man [ __ ] she's like you didn't know how to like kind of like you know there was no smoothness to like the oh we're walking down the street like let's just i just hold my hand without like us having like the first time like how do you do that smooth the first time or you know like in san francisco the streets are a little dangerous she's like you know you would always like walk on the inside of the street i'd be on the edge like right by the cars and the bums and like you know you didn't know to just like stand on that side just like the little kind of male protective instincts a little bit like you know pull my chair out you know let me sit down first that's like you know don't say like see ya when we leave like you know say something else like you know like and it's like i was like i opened the door for you she's like yeah you would like open the door and be like scoot in like screw all the way across and then i'll sit on this i'll get in after you it's like you know you're supposed to go to the other side and like open the doors for me and then you go to the other side i was like oh yeah like that's so much effort like you know it's fine um and so there was a whole bunch of things like that and i remember i dated a girl once in australia and i'll always give her credit she was she kind of was like an amazing girl and she taught me one thing which was she was like you know whenever you're i actually didn't even really dave was kind of in the flirting phase but she was like um she was teaching me how to she was like a dancer she was teaching me how to do like she was like [ __ ] like champion or some [ __ ] like that uh and or something i think [ __ ] is fighting [Laughter] and she was like okay so just like put your hand here and whatever and then she like looked at my hand i was like i put it right what you said and she's like yeah but look at it and i looked at him my hand's like you know like limp basically it's like my hair was there but like there was a firmness to it it was like you know it was nothing and she goes if you're gonna touch a girl touch with intent and i was like oh and i literally have never forgot that that was like 15 years ago and in my head i'm always like i got taught a real like lesson in like man stuff uh that day of like how to do like do things with girls like touch with intent and i was like i didn't even really understand what the hell she meant but like that was the first time i got taught so here's the idea basically it's swag school and it just teaches indian guys how to have a little more game so you go to a seminar it's like toastmasters or alcoholics anonymous and you go and you sit in a circle and first you just say uh you know my name is sean and i am awkward and then everyone says welcome sean and then the next guy says hey my name is pradeep uh dr bay area um and i am awkward ever since it just goes around the circle and it's going to teach you how to how to look at a girl how to touch a girl how to have some presents how to sit straight stand up straight how to dress how to go in for a kiss and there's just a girl there to teach you how to do it because guess what you can't learn it in a textbook so that's it swag is cool what do you think love it um have you heard do you remember art of charm our friend jordan he's got a new thing jordan harbiture but now it used to be called art of charm do you remember that it's like a um was it like a five day boot camp for men is that what was it five days i don't really know i know he has the podcast and i used to read the blog so listen to this he spoke at one of my events and he talked about it and so it was him and two other guys they had like a falling out so this is like before they had the falling out and the business was called art of charm and it was teaching men how to be more charming and he would also teach like he would go and talk to like navy seals and talk about like how to use charm to like you know like blend in and [ __ ] like that and so they were making if i remember correctly 10 million dollars a year hosting these what did you just say they used to go teach navy seals how to use charm to blend in with what like the water water like he was like you know what all this espionage training you're doing no no that's what he did you need to learn from me no that's what he did it was like uh like i don't [ __ ] know like uh that's just what he told me he was like he they called it uh operators or something like special op special ops dude i want to start a company that's called fortune 500 and so people can be like oh yeah i work with fortune 500 companies like you know hey you're not lying it sounds cool when you're pitching your services it's like dmv.org or whatever that works i'm gonna make this navy seals s-e-e-l-s and you could just say yeah i train navy seals well dude so he was making like 10 million dollars a year hosting these like four-day boot camps and i knew a guy who went to one and he said it changed my life and this guy ended up he was this dorky guy who i'm friends with and he married this beautiful awesome woman and i was like making a joke to him like how'd you pull that off and he's like man i went to this art of charm boot camp and he just taught me how to like be more confident and like talk to women and it totally worked so long story short swag school down on dtf with swag school all right well you validated me there okay great so i think we i have more i have so many more um but i think we save it if people like this we can make this a recurring thing this is the second edition of drunk ideas let us know what you think in the youtube pretty good right at least pretty good all feedback now in the youtube comments i'm replying i'm reading every single one i don't want emails i don't want twitter i only want youtube comments now are you all you're you're on board this youtube train it's going to my head is it going to your hands it's so much fun yeah like hey the videos get more views now we're out of the pathetic range where it's like 3.3 000 views i'm just like oh man like you know it's like i kind of want to it's like i need to like make a disclaimer it's like but the podcast is bigger like you know like yeah i used to say that all the time i'll be like well the podcast it's like yeah yeah it's mostly podcasts we just started youtube but now you don't have to print out your podcast stats it's okay no now i think a lot of episodes will get 20 30 40 000 views on youtube so yeah and i'm about it and the comment section it is interesting also some of these people are just really stupid there's so many stupid commenters like you see some of the stuff they post it's like what do you what's this have to do with anything uh so there's a lot of stupid stuff oh and there's so many scammers the typical scam is the scammer is so annoying so there's one scammer that acts like he's us and then there's another scammer where it's like um i totally agree with you and that's why he starts the first guy this guy he's pretending to be us he replies to every comment and his thing is my first million but he's using like emoji for the letters it's like and the m is like a yellow yeah yeah that's something he's like come join my whatsapp group yeah come in my whatsapp group he's trying to scam you on whatsapp and then the other one is so annoying it's always the top comment on every video and i'm like my mission in life is to like eviscerate this person i hate it and it says i totally agree with what you just said in fact that's why i started following aunt linda she's taught me all i need to know about forex trading and crypto trading if you're interested here's her information and then somehow they get like 80 people yeah to comment and so it like goes up number one and it looks legit and it's like the best i was skeptical at first but she really turned it around for me oh i turned 2000 into 18 000. thank you so much linda linda if you're reading this blah blah blah and it just goes on and that's all the comments and it's the top comment on every youtube video for any finance related channel it's so annoying it's like you know with the economy the way i totally agree but with the economy the way it is nowadays investing is harder than ever i'm so thankful for for you know dr baldwin's investing um uh whatsapp group i you know it's really been a life changer for me and then everybody's like dr baldwin is amazing and it's like the same thing every single day it's such a good idea it's such a slick scam it's a really well done scam and i can't but i can't stand it um so anyway yeah i'm on board youtube that's our place now which means you're gonna have to start like where this is my jacket so you gotta like start you gotta get like a jacket or something you gotta get like a look well i just have this so yes i gotta have a look you're absolutely right in fact i tweeted that out i said i need a look and uh people gave me a bunch of bad ideas so i'm still looking for a good idea um all right well who won uh okay am i giving grades or am i not giving grades pick a pick a best idea honorable mention and a worst idea i think uh only fans for therapy is the best idea it is like both funny and is actually a good idea and um i just like i would watch i know i could pass like four and a half hours on one afternoon like the first half hour i'm like this is so stupid but i don't quit the app and then like four hours later i'm like this is so stupid and i'm still honey come listen to this guy he's so stupid hey everybody on social media come listen to this it's so bad yeah it's like me and johnny k plus 8. um uh for worst idea i got a since i just pumped up shawn i gotta take him down a notch and say instagram ohana's worst idea uh because i feel like you need one food if your whole shtick is like all these different foods that are instagramable uh also just like a lot of people are doing this in different ways instagram mohanas zero out of ten one food would be enough but i just like to over deliver so yeah you know one of my greatest weaknesses and what was the pepperoni you asked for uh what is oh i was gonna say you can honorable mention one of sam's ideas perhaps because you know otherwise i you know my honorable mention is i wish that sam had done swag school i wish sam had come on here and been like so you know how indian guys have no game [Laughter] actually missed opportunity that was hilarious all right [Music] you

one of the things a founder has to kind of get good at is convincing really smart people to do this irrational thing which is join you in your startup if you can't do that if you can't make that sale which is the most important sale you'll make being able to attract people and then it's customers it's not going to work so you have to two things either recognize kind of superstar talent and give them something they can't get because it's beyond confidence it's like oh you'll learn more here or you have to say i'm going to be really good at identifying diamonds in the rough people that have not made it to the 200 plus 300 thousand plus dollar salary yet but they will someday i caught them early in their kind of evolution so it has to be one or the other form of arbitrage otherwise you can't play the game

[Music] yeah i just went on a really long walk and i went and walked around all these fancy neighborhoods in brooklyn and i started you know i do what what people do i pull up zillow as i'm walking and i'm like you know i wonder what it's like to live here and the houses that i like what i usually will do is i see a house and i go oh i would like to live there and i pull it up and it's eight million dollars and eight million dollars that's one number but then you actually look at how much money you need to come up on at closing and then you look at how much money you need to uh spend each and every month on the mortgage and on your interest and on maintenance and things like that and i started thinking i think i'm gonna live over here in brooklyn and i wanted to like map out how much money i would expect uh i would spend to live the lifestyle i want to spend and it is astronomical and i wanted to talk about some some of those expenses you want to talk about something walk me through it okay so listen to this first of all i'm gonna talk about the life that i'm gonna live when i move to brooklyn and all the listeners there's gonna be a bunch of them that's gonna say oh sam no one needs an eight million dollar house yeah i get it you know like all i need is like a bucket of water and like some apples and like a pair of crocs and i'm happy but this is the life that i choose to live so like i get it no one needs this but i'm picking this so get off my back on this hypothetical case that might be a reality in two years so i just got to get that out of the way but in terms of hypotheticals it's not entirely hypothetical because i went and talked to a couple friends who do this but listen to this [ __ ] so i found a home that i wanted to buy and i actually linked to it on the the mbd master dock okay so it's a street is on street easy it's a nice house okay it's only 3 000 square feet though but it's a brown stone in my favorite neighborhood of cobble hill it's five million dollars i actually think the range of things i want are between five and eight but this one i just found it was available it's five million dollars which basically means i got to come up with 1.1 million dollars as my down payment and then i'm going to spend around 20 000 a month in mortgage and interest and and things like that not including maintenance which is going to be uh more expensive it's going to be probably another two or three thousand dollars a month then i think it would probably cost on the low end 50 000 on the middle only end of like 150 000 to furnish it the way i'd like to furnish it right have you ever furnished a house yeah yeah it depends if you go like red like my wife she's like oh yeah i'm like what do you like she's like restoration hardware i'm like ah geez like you know every item in the like you know 40 000 to 10 000 and so you know you just add that up per room you're putting in like 20 to 25 grand worth of stuff per per room uh in the house which is pretty nuts yeah totally so like 150k is that's just kind of what it would cost if you want to go that route if you want to go west m west elm then yeah you can maybe get it done for 175 000 but it's quite expensive then if i'm going to get this fat house i'm getting it because i have two kids or a couple kids so i need my 40 fifty thousand dollar a year nanny i imagine i would spend around thirty thousand dollars a year in food and so basically it comes up to where i think i'm spending six hundred to seven hundred thousand dollars a year to live the life i want to live in brooklyn but here's the kicker if you're making over a million dollars a year in brooklyn or or for sure in manhattan it's even more than this half your money goes away to taxes so basically if i'm spending around six hundred thousand dollars a year i need to make 1.2 million dollars just to cover my my monthly number break even just a break even and if i if it's and i i talked to two friends one friend who lives in brooklyn he told me that he spends around 500 000 a year and then another friend that also lives nearby and he told me he spends eight hundred thousand dollars a year and he spent me he sent me his uh list but he goes i have an uh an additional house in north uh rhode island but if you take that uh vacation home we are spending around 650 000 a year so to to live like this it's crazy and when you go and walk on these streets you know there's a house every block if you go in manhattan there's this fancy apartment every block how on earth do you think people so many people afford this it's crazy like when you actually think about the logistics right well well a lot of the people who owned these homes they owned them before they were worth 5 million so go look at the you know the zillow history of this thing 10 years ago what was this home worth you know i'm guessing it's less than you know less than half this maybe 35 of this price 10 years ago 30 and so you're what you're talking about here is like you know a home that what that they bought in their basis is a million million and a half dollars something like that instead of five so now the monthly payment is less and now the property taxes are less and so you know you cut out your biggest expense in this case um you you trim that down so i think that's that's the answer for how a lot of people have this is inheritance or um or buying in you know 20 years ago 15 years ago when these were worth a fraction of what they're worth today and so that's why they can afford to kind of live above their weight well so i had four takeaways when i started thinking about this the first was that there's a story behind everything so all these people like a simpleton like me is like oh you just got to earn this much money and they did it by starting a business it's like no that's not the reality and zach crockett who works at the hustle he basically we were talking about this and he was going to write a story on this and he said that he researched a bunch of these homes and what he did was he uh for all the five million dollar bro for a bunch of five million dollar brown so it's an nyc he used a tool called melissa and he looked up the property records then he googled the names uh of each person who quote owned it and then he like looked at their family records which she just did this all through just sleuthing and like looking through stuff and he found out that a bunch of them like seven out of ten of them were like teachers or artists or or or a professor things that you basically like you can earn a bunch of money but you're not earning enough money to buy this home and what he surmised and came to the conclusion was like they just get a lot of help and so like it's hard to own a five million dollar brownstone when you're a reporter at the new york post or something like you know 120 000 your job so i think there's a story behind everything the second thing is i think you just have to earn a lot of money dude listen to this if you earn uh one hang on hang on that was a killer insight what the you got to earn a lot of money yeah where did you come up with that you got to earn a lot of money but listen let's let's put the math on this how many how many years do you think you need to uh how long will it take you to save 10 million dollars if you lived in new york to save 10 million yeah to get a portfolio of 10 million i have no idea i don't know let's say 20 years okay so if you make 1.5 million dollars and you're spending around 25 000 a month in living expenses it's gonna take you around 15 years to be able to save 10 million dollars which is pretty crazy now you've got to figure out how to earn at least a million and a half for 10 years or for 13 years which is like that in itself is impossible or not impossible very very very challenging and so hold on you refer your first thing was like these people are teachers and artists you said they got to have some help you're talking about like family help you're not talking about like there's nothing else right you're saying you have rich family yeah okay all right sorry i carry on i think that i think just having a like i underestimated that when i think about this i'm like whose parents would give them two million dollars for a down payment on a home and i think the answer to that is actually a lot i can i i can't imagine that but the answer like that that was hard for me to because you know i don't [ __ ] know that my mom and dad like the best gift they ever gave me was when i turned 21 they gave me a thousand dollars and that was like the last birthday present i ever got i i don't even think it's a down payment it's okay you're a teacher great your down payment is covered where are you coming up with 25k a month of your monthly monthly payment just for your home like they get allowed this is a this is an all cash here's your house free and clear you get to live here and you cover your life expenses if you're paying for a latte that's you but uh i'll buy you this brownstone i think that's got to be what it is i think that's that that has to be what it is or the second thing is you gotta earn a lot the third thing is i think you gotta i want how many of them do you think sell a business i think earning a lot like a big nut of 10 20 million dollars it seems like impossible to do without selling an asset you got to be in finance law um maybe medicine or consulting to be pulling in a million dollars a year of income i i don't think there are many other jobs that do that we're not talking about athletes entertainers because it's just a small such a small portion of the population but of jobs that a normal person can get that's going to make you a million to two million dollars a year i'm pretty sure you've got to be either a banker or a banker or consultant if you're employed or you got to be self-employed as a doctor or a lawyer or something like that to be able to pull that in so that's like am i missing one that's like those are john yeah those are non-entrepreneurial jobs like the other ways and then you can start your small business yeah yeah exactly you own a small business you own a big business you um you know you own a contracting firm you do construction around the city whatever it is those are the other way where you can do this and that's usually you're not earning some steady 1.5 million per year you're earning like nothing nothing nothing a lot a lot lot huge and then back to nothing you know like that sort of thing it's this it's this lumpy curve that an entrepreneur has where you're basically broke till you're very unbroke um so yeah but uh yeah what else you got to say about this and my third and final takeaway here is basically there's so much out there there's so much money out there there is so much opportunity you walk by all these places and again ben's laughing at me this is obvious but it when you see it in real life i walk down the street and i'm like oh that apartment that cost 12 000 a month to rent in that top floor of that brown store stone and there's three of those in there so like there's three people each paying 12 000 and they're just like home home home home home home home it's astronomical there's just so much money out there to be made it's just so much opportunity so anyway i did this three hour walk yesterday and i just i felt enlightened and i just wanted to come to the table and fill you in on that [Music] you

and his verification is for 100 million dollars liquid plus and so the guy has over 100 million dollars and he did it all through two or three of these apps and i believe with close to no employees and he did it over around like eight or ten years [Music] we have a friend who it seems like might get rich very quickly here let me explain richer they created a product or a service or an app and they every day they're posting a chart of like the growth of this thing and it's like an early version of a hockey stick it's like yep we went from doing a hundred dollars a day 500 a day thousand dollars a day today three thousand dollars a day today's gonna be nine thousand dollars a day pretty quickly like you know fast forward two weeks this person's gonna put a chart in there that's gonna show them doing 200 000 in revenue just today and it's gonna be nothing has changed it's just they just let the growth carry on and you see that you're like wow that's that's winning like that's the hov lane that's the fast lane where you could just go in and you could win faster like jeez i didn't realize that i thought i gotta bust my ass for 10 years and the reality is this person has been busting their ass for 10 years building up the skills so that they can launch a new product and they can do let's call it five to ten million this year in in potential profits now this person if you remember uh many months ago and they told me they told us this exact this exact thing they go yeah i'm just thinking about ideas that can make i forgot what they said 10 or 50 million dollars i want to make 10 million dollars in a year 50 million dollars in a year and i was like okay like you know yeah sure you know and i want jessica alba to you know add me on snapchat right now like but it's not necessarily going to happen like you could just say it but he was like no i've been studying there's apps that do that in the app store and he's like showing us give me two examples yeah yeah just showing your screenshots and examples it's like that does that yeah this does that yeah and you now you see 10 of them and all of a sudden first of all i never knew somebody who even stated a goal like that so just hearing it for the first time was like that's interesting i knew people that would say i want to build a huge company a billion dollar company that was normal i'd heard that before i'd heard i want to get a high paying job you know i want to make you know 500k a year at this company i've heard that before i never really heard somebody be like i'm looking for a way that i can make 10 million dollars in three months that was actually the exact thing it was how do i make 10 million dollars in three months and so i was like all right well never heard that that was new then i thought well my brain doesn't come up with any examples of how to do that that's like you know doesn't involve you know putting a ski mask on and walking into a wells fargo so like you know and then he gave me 10 examples and so it's like okay well now i got 10 examples number 11 doesn't seem so far-fetched at that point and i remember coming to talking to you and being like dude have you heard anybody think like this talk like this come up with ideas like this because i believe that there's great power in questions and i never really heard somebody ask the question how do i make 10 million dollars in the next three months and once that question was asked now my brain has to start coming up with answers and at first my brain was struggling and then as he gave me examples it started to get better and better and better and come up with examples about how you might do that and now it's literally happening like that right now scenario is actually playing out right in front of us what do you think of this i think it's awesome i think i think it's still too early i think anything that comes fast will go away fast or can go away fast but he called his shot and we are seeing on a daily basis whether it's com it's coming it is in fact now coming into reality and i think it's awesome i think that there's ways i think peter thiel said it where he's like what's your five-year goal and then someone says their goal and he says cool how can you do that in six months so i usually believe in that this guy took it even further which is what your five year goal do it in three months and it's awesome and there's another guy who i know that's done this and he's public his name is alan wong do you have the uh the the app on your iphone that lets you listen to police scanners it's like the police scanner app no but i know i know of these apps these are it's like they're weird yeah it's like 5-0 radio app i think like 5-0 radio app and this this guy alan wong he posted in reddit in 2013 and he basically said um uh he said hey i'm alan wong i was told to create name here have it up here yeah you wanna you wanna read it or you read it up here he goes yeah he goes i'ma ask me anything i'm a person in his 20s who went from rags to vicious during the recession he goes how i did it i develop apps my most popular app is called the 5.0 radio police scanner it lets you listen to police chatter around the world you've probably seen this used in the latest spider-man movie although they rebranded it uh and as of 2012 my apps have been downloaded by 20 million people by the way this is 10 years ago he wrote this so he did this in the 2008. i have an update on it that i can give you in a second so so he goes my parents were raised in the slums of china they fled here with my brother to new york my mother worked in a sweatshop in chinatown before she quit became a homemaker my father was a herbalist before he passed away unnaturally three months after i graduated from college after his passing no one in my family had a job and so he says i found a full-time job at columbia university i was the only one with income so i taught myself how to create apps in my free time and i created apps on the weekends with hopes of making some side income i didn't expect this to make me millions and then he says what does he say is money i don't think he says his money somewhere here but uh yeah go ahead fill in the gaps so he doesn't say it there but i found it so there's this other subreddit that i talk about all the time called fat fire and they've got this particular type of flare called verified by the mods where the mods the moderators look at the income or your balance sheet they look at something and they say yeah we believe it what you are saying is true and his verification is for a hundred million dollars liquid plus and so the guy has over 100 million dollars and he did it all through two or three of these apps and i believe with close to no employees and he did it over around like eight or ten years it says he by the way he says so he has three apps he has 5-0 radio then he has police scanner plus and then he has one more called what is it called um hang on he's got three apps that were in the top like the top hundred so so he goes this means i'm the only person ever in app store history this is what he wrote at the time this was back in i don't know 2012 2013 something like that i'm the only person in history to have in the in the app at to have three apps in the app store that were top 10 overall in the paid and free categories at the same time yeah man this guy's cool and then he if you google his username it's rego apps so r-e-g-o apps and then fat fire you'll see his posts from fat fire and he talks about uh what it's like to be uh different tiers of rich and he has all types of of like you know when i was at this thing this is how i felt when i was at this other thing this is how i felt and now according to his flair it's over a hundred million it's a this is a so you're asking who else do i know that's done this i don't know this guy and i can't verify that any of this is true but it's pretty interesting and it might be true well yeah and i don't know the speed that this guy did it but um still amazing by the way we should get verified in fat fire why aren't we posting in fat fire that seems like a that's our those are our people we should hang out i do post there i post there under a name that no one knows me as but i would post there more would you po do do uh you use this yeah i'll go browse i never post never comment but i'll i'll make an account and i'll uh let's do it let's get verified let's do an ama there yeah so look this guy's thing says i fat f i found his username he was i fat fired at age 25 i make 10 million dollars a year in my 30s 10 yeah 10 million plus a year in my 30s and i have over 100 million dollars according to which has been verified for the mods and here this is what he says someone says what's the difference in millionaires or in money levels he goes at 100k to a million you can tip very generously and be okay with that at one to five million you could fund some medical expenses and maybe a college college tuition or two maybe for an extended family member or friend at five to twenty you could pay off a handful of college tuition i guess they're asking about donation you can pay off a handful of college tuitions and some expensive surgeries and then he jumps to uh 50 to 50 million you can create several nonprofits and overseas

hey this is Ashwin my question is for Sam regarding customer Discovery I saw on a recent webinar that your calendar was booked with dozens of calls each day with potential customers for your new product I'd like to know what kind of questions you ask in those meetings and how you use their feedback to influence the business plan and product for your new business thanks [Music] all right so the question was basically the guy uh I did a uh like a little small talk for like a private group and I showed my calendar about how basically on Tuesdays and Thursdays and whatever like I'll I'll do like 10 to maybe 10 or 13 like 10 to 20 minute calls with customers and they asked what questions do I ask and so I do a few things the first thing is is if you haven't read it there's this book called The Mom test and it talks about like how to ask good questions but I'm not asking questions that a lot of people ask like would you pay for this I don't ask that I don't ask like would you use this I never ask that stuff so in my case or all the time not just in my case but in this particular case of this business I'm starting but in all cases I'm not even asking them if they want the solution that I'm saying is the solution to the problem what I'm looking for is I'm trying to get confirmation of does this person have my problem the the problem that I'm trying to solve and then I'm trying to figure out well if they don't have the problem are they even the target market that I'm going after and who like what type of like archetype of person uh demographic psychographic what type of person consistently do I notice has this problem and so I'll give you some example questions I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases hpot grow better I don't want to talk too much about the business that I'm starting cuz I'm not ready to like reveal it yet but it is working really well and we've done a lot we've done a lot in Revenue in a very short amount of time all from these calls but I'll basically so I'm going to use um I'm just going to like use some vague language so sorry about that but that's what I'm going to do so I'll say all right have you ever tried to use uh blank before oh you haven't but you've wanted to well why haven't you and they'll tell me answers like um well you know just like no good one has ever presented itself or the brands that currently solve this they seem a little old to me uh they seem a little old school and I'll say tell me about that why do you think that they seem old school to you why do you think they seem archaic and not like new and and and and they'll tell me they'll tell me me all these types of reasons and so in my head I use that feedback to say all right I get this Con constant pattern of people saying a they want to use a product like I'm offering but B they haven't already because they um none of the offerings like appeal to them because they're not new and they want something that's a little or because they're all old and they want something a little new looking so anyway what I'm constantly doing on these calls is I'm trying to get them to tell me if they do or do not have the problem uh that they're solve that I'm to solve and so the second thing that I then do is I try to close them and when I close them I kind of typically get them to sell me and so typically what I'll do is um well this product if you used it how much do you think it would help you and often times they'll tell me well it would help me by doing X Y and Z and I'll say to myself or I'll say to them well how much value would that bring to you like numerically like what type of Revenue what type of time would it save you well if I joined one of these things uh it would save me this much money and this much time and it would help this this and this and then at the end of the call I say all right well look I'm offering this I'm I'm solving this problem I have a product already um in the future I'm going to charge blank but right now because you're early I'm going to charge uh you know $500 which is like a fraction of what the cost is eventually going to be um if I if I can make all this happen are you in you want to try it out and by the way I'll refund your money entirely if you're not interested and often times they'll say yeah I'm interested and then I send them a link and typically I'm able to close like 80% of people and so on these calls the first half is I'm just Discovery and I don't ever say would you buy this I don't say any of that I'm just asking really broad open-ended questions to get them to describe if they do or do not have the problem that I'm solving for if they don't have the problem then sometimes I'll ask them why and that will kind of indicate yes this is actually a problem solving or no it's not but if they do have the problem then I get to tell I get them to tell me how they've tried to solve it in the past what has worked and what hasn't and why they aren't already using a solution that exists then and then when they do that they basically tell me the um the attributes that my my solution should have in order to appeal a customer like this person and then the second half of the call over the last few minutes sometimes I'll sell them and I I try to get uh I I want to close the deal right there because if I can get them in then I can get feedback quicker and I don't ever ask would you buy this I just say oh well you said you wanted this I'm offering this do you want it and if they B at it then I'm like well this isn't really that big of a problem like this isn't there's not that big of a need here and so that's why I try to sell them so anyway that's how I do calls when I'm in the discovery phase of a business I'll be on the call uh different calls literally 8 hours a day and I think that's something that people do that's not right which is they don't don't get on the phone with potential customers and they they don't spend they'll do like one call a week at most sometimes and I'm like no no no no no pack my day I'm literally back to back to back to back and I usually have a script and I take notes and I use this stupid headset that has like it looks like a gamer's headset and a microphone and I'm walking I go on walks while I'm I'm doing this because it helps me kind of um stay focused and be loose so anyway all right that's one question try it [Music] what [Music]

and his verification is for $100 million Liquid Plus and so the guy has over $100 million and he did it all through two or three of these apps and I believe with close to no employees and he did it over around like eight or 10 [Music] years what up what up they told us to do uh intros now of the podcast so this is my first million the podcast where uh we tell you 100 good ideas half are good half are bad but it's on you to figure out which ones this is my first million where I make fun of Sam about how he talks he makes fun of me about how I look and in between we squeeze in a few business ideas let's see what else what else we got for them and supposedly uh we're supposed to be successful people so it's like the reviews people say they say it's kind of like we're just sitting at a bar with a bunch of our successful friends dare I say I hate this word multi-million friends and just hear what they talk about but that yeah just a couple of deca millionaires hanging out on the on the dude um yeah how are you supposed to brag about that you know what I learned from from my last successful Venture I now take those learnings to the podcast can I just say that regardless of the DECA millionaire nonsense I did something a few weeks ago that I think was amazing I bought a $60 tattoo gun on Amazon and I let my wife give me a hand tattoo instead of wearing a wedding ring oh wow totally worth it let let me be the judge can you bring that a little closer here what's what is it it's just an X can you see is it right like an that's not focusing okay it's an X like you know it's an infected ax but it's an axe you know like where where something was there then it's like dead and you like put an X there that's kind of the the vibe you're going for or what yeah or like you know triple X on like a Moonshine Whiskey jug yeah something like that and she wanted to do this or you want to do this she seems more sensible than you so I don't know she want to do I just said Sarah I bought this tattoo go sit down right now or otherwise I'm just going to do it myself ah okay threats and I handed her an orange R and threats yeah like it literally I set it up and within 2 minutes it was done I handed her an orange I go right on that orange great I'll do that on my fist people always ask us what's the secret to being a decamillionaire and we tell them it's threats you got to threaten your your business partners your marital Partners you got to threaten all your partners actually Sam you you you kind of do use this sort of like I wouldn't call it threat but as they say it's always sunny um it's the implication of danger you I feel like you you do use this the the implication of things going wrong am I am I right about that what's an example in your management style like you know uh you're trying to get the team motivated you have two paths you could go down you could you could start with why and tell them why you're so excited about this why this is good for them or you could just hit him with a with a solid threat with the implication of of of things not going so well if if we don't do X which way do you go I like the second one I'm more of a guy who will do like if if I can all right tell me how you are if you can make a million dollars or not lose a million dollars which one are you more motivated to do for me not lose a million dollars and I think for you the same same absolutely same it's not to do something so I love setting my life up and I do this all the time with like my wife and stuff i' be like oh [ __ ] like I already booked it like we already we got to do this thing or uh you know I always set stuff up that if I don't do it there's consequences that's the way to live man and I used to do it with my employees all the time and you know what they always said they hated it and then whenever they leave and quit uh eventually they'll say something like yeah but I did so much cool [ __ ] and we actually got a lot of stuff done so I think people actually like it right yeah they tell their therapist as they to spend years recovering from you yeah I guess so dude can we do you have a bunch of topics I got a few yeah I got a couple too can I start on one that like I think it's blowing my mind and I as so basically yesterday I went on a long walk I did I went on like a 10m walk you ever go on a long walk I go on a walk I got a dog yeah yeah I just went on a really long walk and I went and walked around all these fancy neighborhoods in Brooklyn and I started you know I do what what people do I pull up Zillow as I'm walking and I'm like you know I wonder what it's like to live here and the houses that I like what I usually will do is I see a house and I go oh I would like to live there and I pull it up and it's $8 million and million dollar that's one number but then you actually look at how much money you need to come up on at closing and then you look at how much money you need to uh spend each and every month on the mortgage and on your interest and on maintenance and things like that and I started thinking I think I'm going to live over here in Brooklyn and I wanted to like map out how much money I would exp uh I would spend to live the lifestyle I want to spend and it is astronomical and I want us to talk about some some of those expenses you want to talk about something how much walk me through it okay so listen to this first of all I'm going to talk about the life that I'm going to live when I move to Brooklyn and all the listeners there's going to be a bunch of them that's going to say oh Sam no one needs an $8 million house yeah I get it you know like all I need is like a bucket of water and like some apples and like a pair of Crocs and I'm happy but this is the life that I choose to live so like I get it no one needs this but I'm picking this so get off my back on this hypothetical case that might be a reality in two years so I just got to get that out of the way but in terms of hypotheticals it's not entirely hypothetical because I went and talked to a couple friends who do this but listen to this [ __ ] so I found a home that I wanted to buy and I actually linked to it on the the MBD Master Doc okay so it's a street easy it's on Street easy it's a nice house okay it's only 3,000 square ft though but it's a brownstone in my favorite neighborhood of Cobble Hill it's $5 million I actually think the range of things I want are between five and eight but this one I just found it was available it's $5 million which basically means I got to come up with $1.1 million as my down payment and then I'm going to spend around $20,000 a month in mortgage and interest and and things like that not including maintenance which is going to be more expensive it's going to be probably another $2 or $3,000 a month then I think it would probably cost on the low end 50,000 on the middle only end of like $150,000 to furnish it the way I'd like to furnish it right have you ever furnished a house yeah yeah it depends if you go like like my wife she's like oh yeah I'm like what do you like she's like Restoration Hardware I'm like ah gez like you know every item in the store is like you know 5,000 to $110,000 and so you know you just add that up per room you're putting in like 20 to 25 Grand worth of stuff per per room uh in the house which is pretty nuts yeah totally so like 150k is that's just kind of what it would cost if you want to go that route if you want to go west M West Elm then yeah you can maybe get it done for 175,000 but it it's quite expensive ensive then if I'm going to get this fat house I'm getting it cuz I have two kids or a couple kids so I need my $40,000 $50,000 a year nanny I imagine I would spend around $30,000 a year in food and so basically it comes up to where I think I'm spending $600 to $700,000 a year to live the life I want to live in Brooklyn but here's the kicker if you're making over a million dollars a year in Brooklyn or or for sure in Manhattan it's even more than this half your money goes away to taxes so basically if I'm spending around $600,000 a year I need to make $1.2 million just to cover my my monthly nut break even just to break even and if I if it's and and I I talked to two friends one friend who lives in Brooklyn he told me that he spends around $500,000 a year and then another friend that also lives nearby and he told me he spends $800,000 a year and he spent me he sent me his uh list but he goes I have an uh an additional house in North uh Rhode Island but if you take that uh vacation home we are spending around $650,000 a year so to to live like this it's crazy and when you go and walk on these streets you know there's a house every block if you go in Manhattan there's this fancy apartment every block how on Earth do you think people so many people afford this it's crazy like when you actually think about the logistics right well well a lot of the people who own these homes they own them before they were worth $5 million so go look at the you know the Zillow history of this thing 10 years ago what was this home worth you know I'm guessing it's less than you know less than half this maybe 35% of this price 10 years ago 30% and so you're what you're talking about here is like you know a home that what that they bought in their basis is a million a million and half dollars something like that instead of five so now the monthly payment is less and now the property taxes are less and so you know you cut out your biggest expense in this case um you you trim that down so I think that's that's the answer for how a lot of people have this is inheritance or um or buying in you know 20 years ago 15 years ago when these were worth a fraction of what they're worth today and so that's why they can afford to kind of live above their weight well so I had four takeaways when I started thinking about this the first was that there's a story behind everything so all these people like a simplon like me is like oh you just got to earn this much money and did it by starting a business it's like no that's not the reality and Zach Crockett who works at the hustle he basically we were talking about this and he was going to write a story on this and he said that he researched a bunch of these homes and what he did was he uh uh for all the $5 million brown or for a bunch of $5 million Browns in NYC he used a tool called Melissa and he looked up the property records then he Googled the names uh of each person who quote owned it and then he like looked at their family records which he just did this all through just sleuthing and like look at through stuff and he found out that a bunch of them like seven out of 10 of them were like teachers or artists or or or a professor things that you basically like you can earn a bunch of money but you're not earning enough money to buy this home and what he surmised and came to the conclusion was like they just get a lot of help and so like it's hard to own a $5 million Brownstone when you're a reporter at the New York Post or some like you know1 $220,000 a year job so I think there's a story behind everything the second thing is I think you just have to earn a lot of money dude listen to this if you earn uh one hang on hang on that was a killer Insight what the you got to earn a lot of money yeah where did you come up with that you got to earn a lot of money but listen let's let's put the math on this how many how many years do you think you need to uh how long would it take you to save $10 million if you lived in New York to save $10 million yeah to get a portfolio of $10 million uh I have no idea I don't know let's say 20 years okay so if you make $1.5 million and you're spending around $25,000 a month in living expenses it's going to take you around 15 years to be able to save $10 million which is pretty crazy now you've got to figure out how to earn at least a million and a half for 10 years or for 13 years which is like that in itself is impossible or not impossible very very very challenging and so the hold on your F your first thing was like these people are teachers and artists you said they got to have some help you're talking about like family help you're not talking about like there's nothing else right you're saying you have Rich family yeah okay all right sorry car on I think that I think just having a like I underestimated that when I think about this I'm like whose parents would give them $2 million for a down payment on a home and I think the answer to that is actually a lot I can I I can't imagine that but the like that that was hard for me to cuz you know I don't [ __ ] know that by mom and dad like the best gift they ever gave me was when I turned 21 they gave me $1,000 and that was like the last birthday present I ever got I I don't even think it's a down payment cuz Okay you're a teacher great your down payment is covered where are you coming up with 25k a month of your monthly monthly payment just for your home like they're this is this is an all cash here's your house free and clear you get to live here and you cover your life expenses if you're paying for a latte that's you but uh I'll buy you this Brownstone I I think that's got to be what it is I think that's it that that has to be what it is or the second thing is you got to earn a lot the third thing is I think you got to I wonder how many of them do you think sell a business I think earning a lot like a big nut of 1020 million it seems like impossible to do without selling an asset you got to be in finance law um maybe medicine or Consulting to be pulling in a million dollars a year of income I I don't think there are many other jobs that do that we're not talking about athletes entertainers cuz that's just a small such a small portion of the population but of jobs that a normal person can get that's going to make you a million to $2 million a year I'm pretty sure you got to be either a banker or Banker or consultant if you're employed or you got to be self-employed as a doctor or a lawyer or something like that to be able to pull that in so that's like am I missing one that's like job those are yeah those are non entrepreneurial jobs like the other way is own small business yeah yeah yeah exactly you own a small business you own a big business you um you know you own a Contracting firm you do construction around the city whatever it is those are the other way where you can do this and that's usually you you're not earning some steady 1.5 million per year you're earning like nothing nothing nothing a lot a lot a lot huge and then back to nothing you know like that sort of thing it's this it's this lumpy curve that an entrepreneur has where you're basically broke till you're very unbroke um so yeah but okay uh yeah what else you got to say about this and my third and final takeaway here is basically there's so much out there there is so much money out there there is so much opportunity you walk by all these places and again Ben's laughing at me this is obvious but it when you see it in real life I walked down the street and I'm like oh that apartment that cost $122,000 a month to rent in that top floor of that brown store Stone and there's three of those in there so like there's three people each paying $112,000 and they're just like home home home home home home home it's astronomical there's just so much money out there to be made it's just so much opportunity so anyway I did this 3-hour walk yesterday and I just I felt enlightened and I just wanted to come to the table and and fill you in on that nothing nothing nothing um spectacular well that's why I'm glad you started the show with something unspectacular uh that that's why you know these Tik tocks that are like they stop somebody in a fancy car or fancy house and they go hey I just want to know what do you do for a living and the guy's like um and they're like you know first of all like is this like a trap are you like an IRS agent what is this and they're like uh I paint houses or they'll be like you know I um I work in real estate uh uh you know I work in the financial services industry and it's like oh okay what what's going on here but I think the reason those are popular is because wealth for most people is a complete mystery is a complete Black boox unless you come from wealth if you come from wealth and you grow up and at your you know you're going to 15th birthday parties where like Serena Williams is there to play tennis with the other kids you're like what the hell like you know this is everything is just nice everybody goes we summer in the Hamptons you have a place where you summer like summering is a verb uh and then you you know you you know that you're oh my godfather you know he's he owns like 44 Dental practices and so you if you grow up with wealth you you wealth doesn't seem like this mysterious unattainable thing you in fact you realize there's like a thousand paths and it's up to you to decide which one you want but for most people wealth is like kind of just this mysterious thing you don't even see how wealthy people live you don't hear like the numbers you talked about I think for a lot of people listening they're going to be like what in the hell is Sam talking about somebody pays $5,800 th000 a year of just their living expenses like that sounds like the most money you could make let alone spend per year and so when you're talking about spending more than a person's life savings in a year that's I think very foreign to people then you say okay well how do you achieve that and now you have maybe one example two examples you don't have like 25 35 45 examples to choose from and so I think that's why those Tik Tok channels are popular I think that's why this podcast is popular because you either react to this type of information with one of two reactions bitterness or inspiration for most people it's bitterness you hear about other people's success or their extravagant spending and you get bit you see the difference between what they do and what you do and you don't focus on the fact that maybe you want to do it instead you focus on the fact that they're wrong evil unnecessary blah blah blah whatever it is and how you know they only could have got it by by sort of cheating the system or some unfair advantages and you get bitter and that's where I would say 90% of people fall into the bitter camp but some people they hear those stories and they take inspiration and if you take inspiration you start to collect each of these anecdotes you start to collect each of these data points and you say oh I'm taking this foggy map that I have this cloudy map where I couldn't really see and I'm just pushing away the fog I'm getting Clarity on wow there's a thousand ways to win and wow winning it can be a lot bigger than I even imagin and once you sort of have that in your head that's when things become a lot easier because you start to notice all around you examples of people Building Wealth in unique ways and ways that are not always long and hard ways that are not always painful or require genius you'll start to see examples of somebody who does it by you know simply like you know starting a mushroom farm in California and it's like yeah that's what they do or somebody I remember I I met a guy who created the tread that goes on treadmills he's like yeah we're we're tread manufacturer I was like what and he's like and the these guys would do like 15 million a year in sales and they was he a marketing genius no was he a sales genius no he just simply was like oh there's demand for tread that goes on conveyor belts treadmills think I mean I don't know I was like I was like in fifth grade at the time I remember this my friend's dad and I was like what why is why is Jordan so rich and it was like oh Jordan's Rich because Jordan's dad sells treads on treadmill and then we met these other people that were rich and they I was like you know again I wasn't even asking the question but I remember my sister saying something like yeah they have like mushroom farms and I remember been like in my head Farmers don't make like tons of money and then I realized pretty quickly oh farmers can make a ton of money and so you know but I was just slowly collecting these antidotes only when I was in my 20s and I was like if I want to know how to get rich then I need to know like a lot more examples of richness and if I want to get rich fast then I need to get examples of people getting rich fast and um and this is actually a good transition we have a friend who is we were just in the group chat uh we have a friend who it seems like might get rich very quickly here and uh let me explain richer they created a product or a service or an app and they every day they're posting a chart of like the growth of this thing and it's like a early version of a hockey stick it's like yep we went from doing $100 a day $500 a day $1,000 a day today $3,000 a day today is going to be $9,000 a day pretty quickly like you know fast forward two weeks this person is going to put a chart in there that's going to show them doing $200,000 in Revenue just today and it's going to be nothing has changed it's just they just let the growth carry on and you see that and you're like wow wow that's that's winning like that's the HOV lane that's the fast lane where you could just go in and you could win faster like gez I didn't realize that I thought I got to bust my ass for 10 years and the reality is this person has been busting their ass for 10 years building up the skills so that they can launch a new product and they can do let's call it 5 to 10 million this year in in potential profits now this person if you remember uh many months ago they told they told us this exact this exact thing they go yeah I'm just thinking about ideas that can make I forgot what they said 10 or $50 million I want to make $10 million in a year $50 million in a year and I was like okay like you know yeah sure I you know and I want Jessica Alba to you know add me on Snapchat right now like but it's not necessarily going to happen like you could just say it but he was like no I've been studying there's apps that do that in the App Store and and he's like showing us SC yeah just showing us screenshots and examples it's like that does that yeah this does that yeah and now you see 10 of them and all of a sudden first of all I never knew somebody who even stated a goal like that so just hearing it for the first time was like that's interesting I knew people that would say I want to build a huge company a billion dollar company that was normal I'd heard that before I'd heard I want to get a high Pang job you know I want to make you know 500k a year at at this company I've heard that before I had never really heard somebody be like looking for a way that I can make $10 million in 3 months that was actually the exact thing it was how do I make $10 million in 3 months and so I was like all right well never heard that that was new then I thought well my brain doesn't come up with any examples of how to do that that's like you know doesn't involve you know putting a ski mask on and walking into a Wells Fargo so like you know and then he gave me 10 examples and so I like okay well now I got 10 examples number 11 doesn't seem so farfetched at that point and I remember coming to and talking to you and being like like dude have you heard anybody think like this talk like this come up with ideas like this because I believe that there's great power in questions and I never really heard somebody ask the question how do I make $10 million in the next three months and once that question was asked now my brain has to start coming up with answers and at first my brain was struggling and then as he gave me examples it started to get better and better and better and come up with examples about how you might do that and now it's literally happening like that scenario is actually playing out right in front of us what do you think of this I think it's awesome I think I think it's still too early I think anything that comes fast will go away fast or can go away fast but he called his shot and we are seeing on a daily basis whether it's come it's coming it is in fact now coming into reality and I think it's awesome I think that there's ways I think Peter teal said where he's like what's your five-year goal and then someone says their goal and he says cool how can you do that in 6 months so I usually believe in that this guy took it even further which is what's your 5-year goal do it in 3 months and it's awesome and there's another guy who I know that's done this and he's public his name is Allan Wong do you have the uh the the app on your iPhone that let you listen to police scanners it's like the police scanner app no but I know I know of these apps these are these apps are weird yeah it's like 5-0 radio app I think like 50 radio app and this this guy Alan Wong he posted in Reddit in 2013 and he basic basically said um uh he said hey I'm Alan Wong I was told to create name I have it up here yeah you want to you want to read it I have up here he goes yeah he goes I'm a per ask me anything I'm a person in his 20s who went from Rags to Riches during the recession he goes how I did it I develop apps my most popular app is called the 5 radio police scanner it lets you listen to police chatter around the world you've probably seen this used in the latest Spider-Man movie although they rebranded it uh and as of 2012 my apps have been downloaded by 20 million people by the way this is 10 years ago he wrote this so he did this in the 20089 I have an update on it that I can give you in a second so so he goes my parents were raised in the slums of China they fled here with my brother to New York my mother worked in a sweat shop in Chinatown before she quit and became a homemaker my father was an herbalist before he passed away unnaturally three months after I graduated from college after his passing no one in my family had a job uh so he says I found a full-time job at Columbia University I was the only one with income so I taught myself how to create apps in my free time and I created apps on the weekends with hopes of making some side income I didn't expect this to make me millions and then he says where does he say his money I don't think he says his money somewhere here but uh yeah go ahead fill in the gaps so he doesn't say it there but I found it so there's this other subreddit that I talk about all the time called fatfire and they've got this particular type of flare called verified by the mods where the mods the moderators look at the income or your balance sheet they look at something and they say yeah we believe it what you are saying is true and his verific is for $100 million Liquid Plus and so the guy has over $100 million and he did it all through two or three of these apps and I believe with close to no employees and he did it over around like eight or 10 years it say he by the way he says so he has three apps he has 50 radio then he has police scanner plus and then he has one more called what is it called um hang on he's got three apps that were in the top like the top hundred so so he goes this means I'm the only person ever in app store history this is what he wrote at the time this was back in I don't know 2012 2013 something like that that I'm the only person in history to have in in the app uh to have three apps in the App Store that were top 10 overall in the paid and free categories at the same time yeah man this guy's cool and then he if you Google his username it's Rego apps so r e g o apps and then fatfire you'll see his post from fatfire and he talks about uh what it's like to be uh different tiers of rich and he's has all types of of like you know when I was at this thing this is how I felt when I was at this other thing this is how I felt and now according to his flare it's over 100 million it's a this is so you asking who else do I know that's done this I don't know this guy and I can't verify that any of this is true but it's pretty interesting and it might be true well yeah and and I don't know the speed that this guy did it but um still Amazing by the way we should get verified in fatfire why aren't we posting in fatfire that seems like a that's our those are our people we should have hang out I do Post there I post there under a name that no one knows me as but I would post there more would you post do do uh you use this yeah I'll go browse I I never post never comment but I'll I'll make an account and I'll uh let's do it let's get verified Let's do an AMA there yes so look this guy's thing says I fat I found his username he goes I fat fired at age 25 I make $10 million a year in my 30s 10 yeah 10 million plus a year in my 30s and I have over $100 million According to which has been verified for the mods and here this is what he says someone says what's the difference in millionaires or in money levels he goes at 100K to a million you can tip very generously and be okay with that at 1 to 5 million you could fund some medical expenses and maybe a college College tuition or two maybe for an extended family member or friend 5 to 20 you could pay off a handful of college tuitions I guess they're asking about donation you could pay off a handful of college tuitions and some expensive surgeries and then he jumps to uh 50 to 50 million you can create several nonprofits and overseas that uh that are overseas and help people uh at a community level like building a school or local community or something so he like talks about this constantly throughout this subreddit and it's very very interesting yeah that's cool I like that uh that's a good story I um I uh I'm going to have another story to share on this in let's call it 30 days let's say I'm going to call I'm going to leave that little seed here 30 days I'll have another interesting story to share on this topic but let's switch to something [Applause] [Music] else million dollars isn't cool you know what's cool a billion dollars let's talk about um this guy Scott painter do you know who Scott painter is this is my this is my Billy of the week this this guy's Scott painter I don't know if he's a billy but he's got that big billy energy for sure and I'm going to tell you this guy's story and you're going to be you're going to be amazed by this guy all right go for it do you know who I'm talking about do you know who have you ever heard this name before no I'm just looking it up now so Scott painter is known because he was the CEO of something called true car and so true car is like a super successful um it was like one of the super successful early uh car companies on the internet so what they were doing was they were publishing price information so that you could go and figure out you know the what the true price of this car is so that um you know if before you would go to a dealership and depending on which dealer you went to and which salesperson you talked to and what how they sort of sized you up as a sucker you would get like a 30% price differential on the price of the same car so you could go to one place in the same exact car they'll they'll charge you um you know 30% more or less depending on uh which place you went so it's a huge spread after true car people could just go figure out well this is the price of this car in 1997 you know Mazda Miata is supposed with this many miles is supposed to be this price and in every Market they would go into the price gaps that that dealers were charging would spread would change from 30% down to like 3% and so they were like helping bring in price transparency but this dude is a crazy story he is built he has basically spent like 20 years just constantly trying to reinvent the Auto industry online so this guy did uh I'm just going to read you like his his LinkedIn so he's um he's the he starts off well he goes to the Army first of all and he's a Spanish interrogator which is just like a kind of a crazy little path that he took and he talks about like you know why he went there is like you know my you know Dad wasn't so cool I needed Freedom Army was freedom for me so I went to the Army and um so anyways he he goes and he becomes VP of marketing at 1- 1800 car search this early internet we're talking like 1999 basically and so there's 800 car search 1 1800 dentist he's like the VP marketing for each then he creates like a consult so he's just hopping one year one year after another he creates Dental Advantage it's like Consulting for Dennis about how to use the internet then he starts another one called Vision Incorporated it's again 1999 is and he's like um helping companies transform like for e-commerce like hey companies are going to need to do e-commerce I'm going to help them do this so he was right he was just way early on on this trend of e-commerce and then he just starts this like crazy run in the car industry so he he goes the he's the founder of cars direct they go from 0 to 650 million in sales in year one then he goes he start starts advertising.com yeah then he's CEO and founder of truear then he's CEO and founder of price loock which was like uh lock in your like gas prices then he was a Founder then after so he's he does true car he takes it public and he gets in this crazy scenario where he is the uh I think he's the largest individual shareholder he's not only the largest Sher he's buying up a ton of stock he believes in the stock like crazy they have an earnings Miss uh like the economy sort of turns car owner people start slow down with their car buying they have a big quarter Miss stock drops like crazy he gets margin called because he was buying so much of his own stock and he's basically forced to borrow money from friends to pay off his Margin Call and he he resigns from the company that same month he basically has to step down as CEO he lost a ton of money on his own stock he he gets a divorce and his literal house burns down and what does he do the following week the following week he incorporates fair.com to a new way to buy cars and this was like basically the idea that like hey car buying is super super complicated you go you buy a car I don't know if you've ever done it but like the process of you have to buy a car you have to qualify for financing like you know 80% of cars are financed in the United States no nobody buys cars all cash here and um and then you have like this complicated like credit check payment thing then you have your your insurance on top you have your title insurance you have to do the registration you have to do all this different stuff he's like what if instead it was like you know what if buying a car was as simple as like buying a coffee or Netflix like subscription so what he would do is you would just put in your phone number it would like find out all your information it would and it would say what car do you want you pick a car it'll be like cool that car is $500 a month and you own that car and you could turn it in at any time if you don't want that car it's it's like a long-term rentals basically was what fair was doing Fair grows like crazy they raise hundreds of millions of dollars because a this guy is got this crazy track record B he's very like kind of charismatic and uh formidable like you see this guy as a Founder you're like God I would hate to be competing against this guy in the same market and he thinks very big he's like you know we're going to change the way that car ownership is done we're going to make this faster cheap or whatever SoftBank piles in $300 million into a series B round and um and they're on their away and fair ends up going up really fast and then crashing really fast because uh the few years ago I don't know if you know about basically as the tech markets like valuations Turned SoftBank was was was the big whale in the space started losing money they lost money on Wei work then they lost money on uh what was the other big one SoftBank had like I don't know three or four like huge things like uber like they had h a bunch of huge things go like the prices crashed from where they had invested and so he couldn't raise any more money money and he had built this like very complicated thing they lay off 40% of people Fair doesn't really work out and now he's back again because I see this thing that says this new startup autonomy has placed $400 Million worth of purchase orders to buy 8,000 something Teslas this year and it's like what who is buying 8,000 Teslas who is paying $400 million to buy Teslas and it's a startup called autonomy that is trying to make it where you can just rent electric cars simply like you you there's a lot of people that want to own a electric car like a Tesla and um they can't afford it it's too expensive all in so here pay this monthly fee and you get to rent a Tesla you get to own basically you get to like have a Tesla you're not renting it like day by day it's a long-term rental he's back and so they placed $1 billion dollar of purchase orders across different electric vehicle manufacturers to do this so he's he's back he must have raised a ton of money again plus raised a bunch of debt and uh he's back with his new startup Drive autonomy and this guy is fascinating I went down to Rabbit Hole listening to interviews of this guy isad interesting dude because of this autonomy thing I worked backwards from the last thing I told you where I was like but why were you just looking up purchase orders of electric cars Milli I saw TW I saw a tweet you know you I follow on Twitter like you know Elon and a bunch of like these like kind of Tesla Fanboy and Tesla hater accounts like I follow both sides like there's basically a huge group of people that are I should actually say it's a small group of people that believe Tesla is a giant fraud and is going to zero they're called Tesla q and then there's other people that believe that Elon Musk is you know the second coming of Jesus and I follow both and in the second coming of Jesus Camp they were like Tesla you know the huge you know here's more good news for Tesla these guys drive autonomy has placed $400 million of of orders for for Teslas because there's so much demand and Elon had replied saying um he was like demand has never been the problem it's Supply like manufacturing like production of cars is our problem like yeah this is good news but like we don't have a demand problem we have so much demand we have supply problem but I I was curious where is this you know half a billion dollars of demand coming from I've never heard of this startup before what do they do and um and that's what they do what was he like when you hear him talk is he charismatic he just looks like a a normal charismatic very matter of fact um so he's basically like he's a good story teller he's quick and to the point he um he reminds me a lot of like you know that other guy we like Frank slutman the guy who runs snowflake who wrote that amazing blog post amp it up which basically describes like you know don't be such a wuss like you know run your company to win and we're here to win and like this is the plan to win and uh that guy's just been like a Serial CEO of companies that just grow really fast this guy's like that um so let me tell you some of the kind of like interesting little nuggets that came out of this I'm just going to keep rambling on this guy so he's basically he's like uh he's like I'm a multi-time College Dropout like I have dropped out of college multiple times I dropped out of like my kind of prep College I dropped out of undergrad um I dropped out of grad school and he's like I basically had a ton of failure do you guys know me because I've tried like 25 things and three have worked and he's like you know but that's entrepreneurship like you know you need three to work out of 25 in a 20-year career and like that's that's like what winning looks like um he's like you know I always loved cars he goes cars are a where am I at in life purchase he goes I can just look at a look at a car that I owned and it would tell me a story about where I was in life you know like you know when I'm graduating from when I'm graduating right I'm coming of age or when I like you know when I moved or when I got a got a my first good job or like whatever he's like a car basically marked you know each chapter he's like that's how it is for most people I kind of had that Insight which is like a car is like your avatar that you use when you go around the world says something about you and uh you know when you when you go upgrade to the minivan it's cuz you're going into family mode and like that's what I kind of realized he because people spend a crazy amount of money on cars because in the interview the guy's like how have you been able to raise so much money he goes well I play in like the biggest Market he goes 15% of all people's gross income goes to Mobility half in buying their car and half into fuel taxes repairs Insurance Etc he's like so when you have this thing that makes up 15% of what everybody makes or or just put differently like I think it's like a third of your net worth you know if people are spending on new when they buy a new car he's like the Tam is just enormous like you know it's like five billion five trillion a year uh goes into cars or something insane like that so he's like you know that's the easy answer to how have I raised so much money I went and played in this big space and then I tried to reinvent it at every every time I would do one I would try to reinvent it so he's like you know we were the first ones to be like we put The Upfront price of a car on the internet nobody was doing that at their in the early days I think that's the cars direct is he successful you said that he got margin called does that mean he was broke uh doesn't necessarily mean he was broke it means he didn't have enough collateral for like what he borrowed for his stock now if the stock recovered which I don't know I haven't looked at true car true car their market cap 230 million yeah that's that's yeah does not look like it has done very well since then so uh yeah it's like basically you know a third of where it was back in 2014 so yeah that's that's not doing so well um and he says that in his thing he's like I've he's like I made a bunch and I've lost it all many times over um and so you know I'm sure this guy's done well like I I don't think you can build multiple companies that get valued at billions of dollars take a company public I don't think you can do that and like you got a real you got to be like kind of really [ __ ] Reckless to walk away with less than you know 20 million at at the end of all that dude I love people who to swings even if they miss like consistently or like you know in this guy's case like he didn't entirely Miss he did actually build some amazing things but like maybe he was just shy of what it could have been another guy who's doing that right now tell me what you think about him Adam Newman the founder of Wei workk he just raised $250 million in seed funding for A1 billion apartment business I don't exactly know what the business does but it sounds like it's we live the thing that we talking about where you you know it's like fancy apartment buildings that are all mostly the same you pay a premium cuz it's all pre-designed and looks really nice and it has a community on it which honestly I think is awesome I also think wew work is awesome uh what do you think about a guy like Adam Newman taking another swing our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best hub spot grow better I think it's great I think it's so easy for people to [ __ ] on him uh and you people [ __ ] on him for two reasons one is well I'll forget the reasons I'll give the explanation the reason is just simply like you know it's fun to hate on somebody you know that you don't know that like too high they they got too bigheaded and then they they crashed people like that but I think the criticism is what the criticism is wework failed well wework didn't really fail it just didn't achieve the like you know what's wew work work today wew work is still like you know uh like five or six billion company more valuable than than anything that we've ever built you know so it's like uh yeah we work is valued at 3.96 billion right now publicly traded um you know so it's not like it's not like we work actually failed it's just you know he raised too much money too high valuation didn't live up to that uh that dream at that that promise and a bunch of people got burned if you bought the stock or you joined the company at that really high price yeah you're underwater for that so that's the first criticism the second is he lied cheated steal you know he licensed the he was like paying himself out of the company for the trademark of Wei he like you know did stupid things like you know this like summer camp where everybody got drunk and whatever those things to me are somewhere between ah a little whack a little messed up to actually like understandable and more common than you think when it comes to these like hypergrowth companies led by think hard charging kind of ego-driven people but there's crazy good there's crazy bad is he crazy good or crazy bad what do you think mostly good but it could be in some cases it was bad but I think that when I at least when I read about him and I don't know the guy I've hung out with um Miguel the co-founder and my my read on these guys is I don't think you're lying I just think that you got some things wrong and I think that you're just like incredibly enthusiastic and I don't know like is it when you paint the picture of the future and you end up being way wrong you're you're not a liar you're just wrong you know you're optimistic but you still called that wrong but you're not a liar or at least you don't you're not a liar if you believe that it's delusional is different right right delusional or irrational is very different than like lying or fraud and I think there's a line who knows if you crossed it I don't know all the details I'm not involved in all that but from from the outside it looks to me like he was one of these guys who is huge dreamer un irrational self-confidence so unbelievable self-confidence that they are going to pull it off that they're going to pull off this crazy crazy dream I do think they get you know high on their own Supply where they start to think that like you know the stuff that got them to the to the point where you know you're on the cover of Time Magazine and everybody's throwing money at you to fund you then all of a sudden you think you know I can't be touched and I've seen this play out many many times I've gotten burned on some of these so I've you know like I uh you know I invested in ter in Tera which was like you know um the Luna like cryptocoin right and the the founder of that was the same way this guy dwan super smart charismatic uh unbelievable confidence that his thing was going to work and some the some people all along the way were saying he's crazy and then slowly but surely a bunch of smart people gave him money you know because it was like this guy's crazy but he's kind of pulling it off and maybe he is just crazy enough to pull it off and we have many examples in history of people who are crazy enough to pull it off let's see if this happens and um and and then over time his ego ballooned and it ballooned and it ballooned and he kept basically taking larger risks and tempting people to uh to you know sort of call him on his bluff and then and then somebody did and the market like a series of events happened and it crashed and all went to zero and everybody looks dumb and you know I lost a million dollars of like you know what I had in worth of Luna in like two days because I believed that this guy was going to be one of The Crazy Ones to pull it off I didn't think he was not crazy I thought he was crazy and like might be the good crazy and uh was worth a bet and so on on other times I've bailed because I thought you know what I'm not falling for this sort of the hero entrepreneur the Charisma the the Visionary entrepreneur thing I owned Tesla stock when it was uh really really low I remember um I remember at the time Tesla was valued at maybe like 2 billion and 2 3 billion something like that and I remember investing in it my dad was like Tesla they don't make any money and I was like yeah but I think that like you know here's my reason why I think they're going to be big BL a BC and then I I said he's like yeah but like you know it's already valued at three billion I was like well you know at the time I think GM was like 25 billion or something like that um one of the big companies I what's Tesla now like 500 billion yeah I mean it hit a trillion so like you know I would have rode two billion to a trillion I can't do that so basically this was my it was the first stock that I bought I I think I put in like 25k or something crazy like that ex numbers but Millions right yeah at one point I calculated it was a $5 million I would have had $5 million I what I did was I turned the 25k into like 125k and I sold because I started to get suspicious that like damn this guy really overpromises like and he he does overpromise he overpromises on like when something will be built how good it'll be like he's he's pretty much wrong on the timing always like he's he's been saying that the cybertruck is coming out he's been saying that the uh you know the model 3 would be more affordable than it is he'll say that autopilot like he's been charging people for autopilot like the self-driving full you you you buy FSD full self-driving and it's like not full self-driving you've been paying thousands of dollars for like multiple years now and he always says it's see right around the corner right so like this guy does have this I remember when I was reading the the the Twitter stuff about like people who were basically saying this guy's a fraud Tesla's scam um it was very very convincing there was a lot of convincing evidence I remember like they went through 20 CFOs 20 CFOs in like a four-year time span and like the new CFO was like some guy's never been a CFO before and like somebody really smart once told me like just follow the CFOs the CFOs know what's going on with the company they know the company Health better than anybody and like that made a lot of sense to me I actually still believe that principle it just turned out to be but no no it it was right which is that was on the brink of collapse consistently and uh he kept pushing he threaded the needle he pulled it off yeah he he pulled it off he threaded the needle he pulled it off and there's still a b a mountain of evidence as to like that it was very close to failing that um he basically overpromise slash that overpromise would be the generous term you know sort of lied manipulated you know to keep the stock up uh to prevent it from getting like you know basically uh crashing and and and going out of business there's a bunch of evidence that that supports that the bottom line is he pulled it off and I was you know $5 million wrong for selling early and um and so I've been on both sides of this and I I think where I nett it out is some people literally are just con artists and they are literally just going to scam you and their Charisma will um will manipulate you and dup you into into believing in them but there the some of the best entrepreneurs do have this same have such a similar profile where they're irrational delusional um willing to like run into a you know a fire pit and they're like there's no way you'll make it out and then you know nine out of 10 don't but the one out of 10 who do you know like change the game and so I've just sort of landed on you know what I'm GNA lean towards I'm going to lean towards optimistic on this because even though I would be right if I was pessimistic about it nine times out of 10 I'd miss the I'd have a false negative on the one that actually works out and that one will a pay for all the losers in investing terms and B like you know it's just more fun fun to sort of like follow these entrepreneurs and and understand what they're doing you know and why they believe they can do this and uh be more optimistic than a hater towards them that's kind of where I landed with this that's a good one all right let me tell you I'm G to I want to end with two things one is the lamest thing I've seen on the internet in the past few weeks and number two is a company that is making way more money than I thought and I'm absolutely going to clone it eventually I'm going to start with the second

this one's called how to choose an HR Software System is that like what people call a a magazine on the Internet eing is that what it's called it's it's old so this one's there's one called how to

website it's owned by a company that owns like 20 or 30 of these websites and it only has about 3,000 customers but it makes around $400 to $500 million a year in revenue and the way it works Sam no no no I refuse to accept this reality no no way cut this out I don't like this I don't like this it's public it's a publicly traded company it's a publicly traded company with a market cap of about2 and a half or3 billion so it's owned by a company called this exact thing bit pipe makes that much or the whole company makes that much the the whole company which is roughly like 10 or 20 of websites like this what's the company called Tech Target so every company on this bit bite website you see how it says this is from computerweekly.com or this article is from networking uh it's like flow route social networking.com this was from um like this other website that talks about Global Knowledge which is your guide on Information Systems so they own like 10 or 20 Publications that talk all about like buying software for huge companies and they get very few people coming to these websites a month very few but because the article is called how buy an HR system for a thousand plus employees there's around 200 companies in America that will pay them money to uh do a couple things the first thing is they want to contact the people the lady who is giving an art her email and information on an article on how to pick an HR System is a lady who maybe 30 different HR customers will say hey I'll give you 500 bucks if you can give me that lady's information so I can call her the second thing that they do is they they'll track that lady that lady Linda she's going to go to computerweekly.com and look at an HR software thing then she's going to go to information system and look at a cloud uh software thing and then uh what tech Target is going to do is they're going to go to their clients and be like hey hey [ __ ] you there I got a lady who's about to buy this thing that thing and that thing you want to talk to her you want to holler and that's what they do and that's how they make their money and they make hundreds of millions of dollars a year that's all they do they go hey this motherfucker's about to buy Some Cloud software you want to holler yeah they own a website actually called what is and it's just like people Googling like like that but that'd be their phrase like hey what it is bro yeah yeah I got this Chief Information officer at Garner yeah yeah they want a score man yeah she's texting me yeah yeah yeah you up this is insane sorry so but why do people why is that person who's the head of HR why are they landing at this website that looks like it's from like 1979 why are they this looks like you know back when the internet was called the intranet and it was like six computers this looks like a intranet website it's not even an Internet site and cuz what the [ __ ] are they going to Google figure out ver just Googling because dude if you Google like what is a good software if I'm if I'm uh you know like so if I'm the the Chief Information off officer of a 10,000 or 5,000 person companies I'm going to get my information from a few different ways I'm going to watch loads of very specific webinars that are on like a trade show a trade magazine I'm going to read trade magazine and by trade magazine I'm going to learn about them because they're hosting like a 100% trade show that all talks about like how to pick an HR software in Vegas and it's really just a really fun way for me to go and watch the Chip and Dales like get do their thing but then I'm going to go to like a vendor that day and like we're you know we're going to hang out and do some blow but then that so they're going to go to that website and learn all about it because that's how they know them and then occasionally that company's going to do a webinar in order to access the webinar you're I'm going to give them a bunch of information and they're going to sell that information to the eight companies that could possibly service me and that's how the tech Target makes money and so this lady Linda she's going to go to all these websites and meet all these people because such a small It's a Small Small industry there's like maybe tens or at most hundreds of thousands of people who would do this and this is what I've been thinking about this B2B media world it is awful say it with me it is awful it is a horrible horrible industry it is awful yes with a with a barrier or a uh uh uh the B it's such a low bench line or B uh uh threshold of what's good and what's not good the content is horrible and people love it and these businesses work why aren't we starting a company that just beats these guys why aren't we starting the most boring B2B media company but we put our spin on it just like Mug shotties did to mug shots we are going to do to the B B2B media industry why B [ __ ] that's what we're going to call it the B2B [ __ ] hey where're the BB [ __ ] what's up yeah it's going to be like a like a radio show where it's going to be like hey it's the B2B [ __ ] today we're going to talk about Information Systems you know like yeah exactly we're going to have a podcast that's a radio station actually we're just have an AM radio station and then we're going to have a you know we're going to give pagers to every CIO in America and be post up it's goingon to be like B to [ __ ] in the morning yeah this is going to work exactly yeah you know my favorite thing by the way those radio stations that do the cheaters segment you see this they like basically call it's like hey will you call my boyfriend and just see if he would cheat on me and like they just like call the boyfriend and then she's on the other line and they basically trick them into being like yeah all right I'll meet you at Home Depot what time and then they're like actually Rebecca's on the other line and Rebecca's like you son of a that's what we're going to do we're going to get one vendor your existing HR Solution on the line and then we're going to call being like hey are you interested in a new HR solution and when they say yes we're gonna be like um we got workday on the line workday what's up he's going to cheat on you he's going to CH and it's called churn Busters and we just catch them in the a no one has ever laughed at this style of content except until or up until right now we're the first people to ever make Tech Target a fun topic to yeah but dude this is interesting right the the this business model is crazy fascinating to me they make money through webinars they make money through like these e papers or they [ __ ] call them a Zen I mean that's just like who's working here um my next business I already have started a company it's like this community thing I'm going to add this this style of company I'm going to add it to uh this is going to be in our portfolio of products now let me show you the last thing dude last week I said can I just say before you do that can I just before you do that this is this is yet again a number seven we got a number seven a sar special this is a sar special it's like no one's even heard of this website somehow it does hundreds of millions of years a year it it looks like it's from 1982 and like you know how do you even know these I don't know but this is a Samar special this is why I like to talk to you because you bring these things nobody nobody I know in my entire life I could I could hit up every single person I'd say hey you ever heard of bit pipe I will get the answer no across the board you're the only person that I know that knows about this stuff well look up Tech target market cap what is it is it like 2 point it's like multi-billion it's like one of these companies that's like in plain sight but no one pays attention to yeah um so it's there is uh let's see the current price so it's trading at $72 a share with a market cap of 2.1 billion dollar and like what was its peak its peak was probably five or six or seven I mean it's not like a little thing uh yeah double yeah basically double where it's at now all right last thing the lamest thing that I saw last week so this guy posted on LinkedIn a picture of him crying and it he's the post starts off this will be the most vulnerable thing I'll ever share I've gone back and forth whether to post this or not but we just had to lay off a few of our employeers and he talks about how it's his fault and how he made all these decisions and I'm going to have to file this under things that I'm going to take to the [ __ ] grave I cannot believe this post I cannot believe this post what happened to like a man being stoic and just like you know like just taking this just take these feelings and just push them down you know what I mean just accept it and push them down it's hey on that shelf that just has daddy issues make room we got something new I need to put on the shelf that I'm buing deep down in my gut yeah yeah yeah I want that problem to walk over be like excuse me mind if I scooch in right here that's what needs to happen with this I cannot believe this person shared this is that ridiculous I mean I didn't even understand it by the way uh he goes he goes uh I've seen lot of I've seen a lot of layoffs over the last few weeks on LinkedIn most of these are due to the economy or whatever other reason hours my fault I made a decision in February that I stuck with for too long now I know my team will say we made this decision together by the way they won't they'll say you made this decision they're not going to be like we all made this mistake boss um yeah so then he basically writes this long thing and he writes it like in the marketer style where it's every other line like single line enter one line enter and then he posts this picture of himself looking into the camera crying and this has um I think it has 50,000 likes and 10,000 comments but most of the comments are just [ __ ] on him which is hilarious oh sorry you said what it has 50,000 it has 50,000 likes 10,000 comments and most of them are just making fun of this guy so as as is deserved to be honest like you know at my first feeling we don't condone bullying but we definitely don't condone absolutely faking the funk like this guy's doing the the the top comment that I liked was some guy was like hang on did you turn your ring light on before you took this selfie because I can kind of see the reflection uh it looks like you turned a ring light on to take this selfie of you crying to post on LinkedIn and uh that's like that just calls it out so perfectly the the the inauthenticity of the fake authenticity that this guy tried to tried to portray I condone some type of bullying I condone bullying this guy because if the bullies had they done their job nerds like this wouldn't be going around existing this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen I saw this and I was like bullies you failed us how on Earth did this guy get away with this is the you need like you know in every ecosystem it's like yeah well these the plank didn't have to be there CU they're absorbing This and like you know these parasites actually you need them because of this that's why we need bullies otherwise [ __ ] like this is going to run rampant if there's no bullying yes this guy someone need he needed a big brother he needed a big sister someone to be like look this isn't how you act this is not this isn't the right way to behave when something like this happens you dork I cannot believe bully we're pro bully here at the my first million podcast dude there's just going to be a generations of cool uh a generation missing cool kids because of this um no I saw this post man and I thought this was this is the definition this is the definition of small boy stuff like when we say this is what we're talking about yeah this is th this is this is small boy stuff this is this is a small boy as it gets I saw this and I was like oh man I've seen I've seen a bunch of these like Miss like Henry Ward from um CA wrote this letter of saying how he screwed up and I was like all that's cool whatever this is the worst example I've ever seen of this I I think that what do you think's going to happen to this guy's career like if you're a customer of his I'd be like oh we like your code must suck like you know like if your if your product is even 50% as weak as you it's not going to work [Laughter] do you know what I mean you know what I mean dude some of these comments are hilarious they're like um Brandon Braden I understand these things happen happens for a reason focus on the positive let it go rest easy My Sweet Child rest easy like starts off with a serious comment it's like sleep sweetly My Sweet Child is that man this is actually the best content ever on LinkedIn this is the best content on LinkedIn like the comments the combination of the post and the comments all of a sudden LinkedIn was the most entertaining uh you know like social media of the day from from this one post dude I was gagging reading it man it was this was crazy I I I felt embarrassed for I just felt so embarrassed for him you know how like um we talk about cringe stuff I legitimately cringed I remember my face being like like I just had that my face was changing shapes reading this yeah like I have this tooth that's like a little sensitive and it just started like ringing when I read this I was like ah ah like I ate too cold of ice cream like that's how it felt when I read this just like this uncomfortable this uncomfortable feeling that I just needed to pass all right so that's the episode uh go tell your friends tell your mom uh you know go add us on LinkedIn go do what you got to do this is my first me [Music]

have you heard of this thing called live golf i think it's called live i don't know how you pronounce it liv nah what's live golf live golf okay so you know about the pga tour it's like the the main yeah like the nfl tennis club right no the gulf so so live golf is a competitor to the pga that just imagines the saudi arabia effect exactly a saudi-backed rival and these guys are basically trying to it's like they're trying to spin up a new league by brute force they're investing hundreds of millions i think they pledged yeah me too big big swing so this is not this is the opposite of sps right so this is uh bde yeah so so basically they they put the saudi public investment fund put in they pledge 400 million dollars to start the league i think they've even committed more than that i thought they offered tiger woods like 500 million or something crazy news came out yeah they offered him 800 million dollars and he said no which is like just kind of an insane thing so but they have signed other huge stars so phil mickelson uh you know dustin johnson this guy you know brooks kefka or whatever who who recently won the the he won like four majors or whatever um cameron smith who's like this is a young star he signed a 100 million dollar deal dustin johnson 125 million dollar deal phil mickelson 200 million deal they offered tiger and didn't get him yet [Music] all right what's going on dude um how are you fantastic so i have something that i've been thinking about that i've been wanting to talk to you about i started um have you ever seen that video of adolf hitler at the birth uh the german olympics in 1936 when he's watching the olympics and he's like rocking back and forth have you ever seen that bro you can't be blonde haired blue eyed and coming on here starting off saying have you ever seen my favorite video of hitler no no no have you ever seen that video up the charts bro we're trying to go up have you ever seen that video of him like so he's like basically he there's this video that i saw a couple of weeks ago where he's at the olympics and he's rocking back and forth and he's very clearly on drugs like some type of coke or something like he's on drugs and i started getting curious about it and i started looking into this and someone in the comments said that there's this really good book called blitz so i bought it it's right here it's called blitz and basically it's a it's called blitz drugs in the third reich so basically uh after reading it hitler and a ton of the nazis as well as just a ton of germany starting in the 1930s like morphine heroin and meth was invented and they used to think that it was like a miracle drug doctors were like take this meth it makes you feel great um it's like this it's like a it's like a it's like a miracle drug like you get euphoria you want to stay up all the time you'll eat less it's this wonderful drug and like it was a legal drug that bear you know b-a-y-e-r the drug company now they were like selling this [ __ ] and they would even put it in chocolates and there was like a chocolate that you would eat that had a little meth in it and it was like always satisfied or something like that and like it was so common and turns out hitler was a junkie he was getting injected with meth uh for years and that's one of the reasons why you know like when they were getting bombed the very last minute he was like oh no we're doing great because he had like these like you know he was like hallucinating you know he had like thoughts of grandeur typical meth [ __ ] and i started thinking about this what other stuff in history was supposed to be one way and be happening like one time but turns out it was for a totally other reason and i started looking into it so for example henry viii he was the k have you know what protestants are no i've heard that word a thousand times i knew no so like there's like the catholics and then there's the uh the protestants it's basically like if you're like an evangelical christian if you're a baptist if you're like all these other different types of christian religions you're probably a protestants maybe by definition you are anyway someone came up with it like martin luther came up with it and and and in the 1500s the king of england he basically like had like eight divorces because he couldn't have a kid like it was it was him he was infertile and the pope was like hey you can't have these divorces anymore this is [ __ ] and he's like nah [ __ ] that then we're gonna switch to protestant cause that allows like you know me to get a divorce and i can have all these kids and so now like there's a billion protestants in the world because he just turns out like won a divorce and then like there's this like there's this like story that you're you never know how barcelona people say barcelona really funny like barcelona yeah there's like this urban myth that the uh king of spain had a lisp and someone's like hey you know it's pronounced barcelona and he goes no from now on it's barcelona because you know that's just how i say it that's just my first million yeah yeah it's like you know mike tyson ruled the world uh i was thinking about like what other stuff did we think that was gonna be like you know was for this like grand reason but it was really just like you know like the guy's dad said something like like george bush invading like you know looking for weapons of mass destruction because like his dad was like you know you're not strong like your brother and like he or you know because he couldn't find the remote one time yeah oh he had this like leftover like mission accomplished banner he's like well we gotta do something with it you know like what else like what else in history has been done just for like totally the opposite reason i don't know but i bet there's so much like i think about this with food all the time when i see oh you know you know people are like oh you know that the active ingredient in advil or aspirin comes from this like oak tree and like blah blah i'm like yeah how did we figure that out like who was just gnawing on trees and was like you know this one i had a headache earlier and now i don't have it anymore right like all foods was like oh this one kills you this one's good for you it's like uh okay but like you know who were the testers who was figuring this out along the way i actually think that that was probably like what's the most fun time to be alive was then when nothing when no one knew anything about anything like you didn't know what was food and what was not food like how much just random soil has been eaten by somebody being like this has to be food and then somebody else is like you know sees a chicken running by he's like no i think under that feather under those feathers there's something there there dude there's all types of good stories like that and i never research it so like have you heard about like the invention of lsd no the guy uh he was a european doctor he was trying to like a doctor right yeah he was just trying to make like uh i forget what it was but some type of antibiotic like just something normal and he got a little bit of the [ __ ] in his skin like he like touched it funny and he was like oh my god this is awesome and then he like starts tinkering with it even more and he goes all right let's try this and he gives himself a huge dose and he starts running home on his bicycle he's like nothing's happening like this didn't work and then all of a sudden hits him and he like has the biggest trip of his life and then you like you know it changes everything yeah i feel like penicillin there's a whole bunch of drugs that were discovered by by accident for sure um yeah it's it's i mean i don't know where you want to go with this topic but i don't want to go anywhere i just thought it was interesting this book like i just been reading this book about drugs and like the nazis and i was like it's crazy like the book says that they at the time in the 30s and 40s when world war ii was happening that something like 60 of german doctors were addicted to morphine and they are the ones like you know voting on what the laws were going to be around you know how these controlled substances are handled it's it's crazy it it changed my perspective i guess didn't change my perspective but you know what i mean it's just like a an interesting read let me tell you an interesting story have you heard about this math teacher in florida no no these stories can go one of two ways yeah yeah yeah dog the body hunter i'm not i mean this could go a bunch of different ways yeah is there a funny like viral video of him in a 7-eleven no so get this so uh so brandon was telling me about this this is kind of amazing so there's this guy okay so you know like um you know there's like kind of like school competitions whether it's spelling bee or math competitions or whatever so there's this math competition and there's this kind of strange thing going on where one small schools not a private school has won like 15 out of the last 17 of these math competitions and people were like god what is going on at like buckholes high school and the story is kind of amazing so there's this guy will fraser he's a he starts as a banker on wall street and he's doing like bond trading or something like that and the guys you know this is like in the 80s he's like you know this is the heyday of of where you know you've ever read those books like liars poker and things like that it's like the heyday of wall street people making tons of money um he retires by 27. so he's made a bunch of money he's like dude this is too stressful of a lifestyle how much should he make i don't want to do this anymore i don't know exactly how much he made but enough to retire at 27. so let's assume it's you know like i would say 10 million at least okay that's my guess so he buys a ferrari he drives down to florida he's like just dreaming of like a slower calmer life he's like you know what i'm just going to go to florida bought this ferrari i'm going to just play a bunch of golf play a bunch of basketball and i'm just going to hang out do ferrari he does that yeah for a decade he's you know that guy you see on like tuesday at 1 p.m just like hanging out at the park and you're just like how do you know you don't have a job like what's going on he's that guy he does it for 10 years no income 10 years he's just chilling and he plays a bunch of golf and along the way he's sort of like yeah you know what like i'm feeling a little aimless don't have a great purpose in my life at this point so he's like he reaches out to a local high school and he's like hey um can i teach golf over there they're like ah sure he comes over and teaches golf he was like i like teaching actually even on wall street i actually i i liked teaching the young guys so he's like um what else can i teach like a finance class you know i'm a former wall street guy made it big retired kept teaching finding like no we don't have finance but uh you can become a math teacher if you want and he's like all right i'll do it and so he goes and becomes a math teacher and he walks in on day one and he's like listen let me tell you this right now i don't need this job yes you guys give me any [ __ ] this will be my last day and they're like okay uh you don't respect and so he gets one day he's like checking his mailbox as a teacher and he sees this math competition coming up he's like oh like that's cool let's try this so he enters into the math competition they go there and they get smoked they get fifth out of sixth uh place so this is the second to last and um and he's like dude i couldn't even solve some of these problems like this was hard but like the flip you know the switch got flipped the competitive switch in him gets flipped and he's just like actually i liked that competition i missed the competition of wall street where it was just like completely doggy dog and you were like high intensity and so he decides to do it again and again and again and he beca and he he goes and they get fifth the next time then they get third and so on and so forth and he basically decides that we are going to dominate these competitions and that's exactly what's happening dude isn't that now that's what we're like 15 out of 17. the 15 isn't that the best when someone just like sees like a small opportunity and they're like no one takes this as seriously as we're going to take this let's do it you know what i mean i love it that's exactly what just like that cheerleading movie that we watched uh on netflix that it's like they just like it yeah they take it to the the highest discovered yeah the one that you made popular so the so the guys so people are like dude what's your secret what are you doing differently blah blah he's like oh i just took a different level of intensity he's like it's just insane hard work he goes you know um average math teacher gets 72 hours of classroom time with their students per semester um and then they hope that after school some of those kids come and they learn for an hour uh you know once a week or whatever that's what they're putting in he goes oh i just switched it first i took all the good math kids i put them in the same class kind of like almost like you know like blended of age but like he's like i put all the best people in the same class that they would compete with each other then we used our class time to start preparing for these competitions then i started creating summer camps where we could get 80 hours in four weeks so the equivalent of a full semester of teaching in this high intensity thing is like and i just developed a program because they're like are you the best at math he's like no i don't even teach the advanced math stuff like one of my former students teaches like the hard stuff i just build the program he's like i put the high school students with the middle school students um and that because the middle school students sort of idolize the high schoolers they teach down and then the the middle schoolers rise up it's like so i built this program where one alumni basically like the older kids teach the younger kids the younger teachers get to even teach the even younger kids and we just put in way more time he's like then i started scouting like this is like you know alabama football so he'll go and he'll look at the scores of other schools and he'll find the high-performing kids and he'll recruit them to his program and then the reputation got built where they started winning so now parents are coming inbound and being like please take my kid and he's like we only have so many spots i'm sorry and so he's built this like talent pipeline and not only that they actually the town pipeline goes even further now companies like mckenzie and the big banks wall street they come recruit from his high school the big schools ivy leagues for interns from his high school because they want his students now so he built like a a platform for where they can go which helps them recruit even better students and so where did you see this what's that where'd you read this it's just like the i think that so it's been in just like the local florida news for a while and then i saw something and but what were you doing right article who's brandon no he sent this article from the wall street journal or something it was like paywall so i only got the first paragraph i'm too cheap to pay for it but i was like oh what's the story and then i found all these local florida papers that had the the rest and so um they said like during kovid they were like oh you got to teach remotely and he's just like oh okay yeah we're gonna downgrade the intensity he's like hell no i resign and then he went to a church rented out the church i was like hey if you guys want to come and train here we could do this and 140 kids went and trained daily in his church during coven when everybody else was lo had to lower their intensity he ratcheted how old is this guy now so now he's like in his 60s and so he's been doing this now for like you know a number of years so he was basically 27 he took 10 years off so he's closer to 40 10 11 years off and then basically from 40 to 60 he's just been dominating this one thing uh isn't this incredible that's incredible this is incredible i think there's a few things one just the intensity number two i think sometimes if you pick like a lot of people including me we want to move to san francisco new york la and try to become like a medium-sized fish in a big pond i think there's so much to be said about being the best or a big fish in a little pond and like you can make a name for yourself and have a way better life like this random dude is having so much more impact by creating a map being like the guy for like this very small math contest versus you know a rich he's probably way more fulfilled than being just like another 100 million dollar banker dude i i want to get diagnosed with a bad case of sps i want small pawn syndrome like i i am a huge believer in this dude when i so i lived in houston uh in high school and houston uh i went to a big public school 5 000 kids and kids from all over houston and basically um i my life was basketball i loved basketball and i remember a game in ninth grade um the varsity coach i was on the ninth grade team and i you know the goal would be to someday be on varsity the varsity coach watching her game and for some reason i think i scored like two i had like two threes to start the game and then all of a sudden the most athletic kid on their team decided like nah this guy's not gonna like see the hoop again and he starts picking me up full court basically like from the moment i can move this guy's like in my shirt and um you know and i i ca i literally can't get by this guy like i'm trying to go left i'm trying to go right i cannot get by this guy and i don't know what to do and i'm just basically like getting frazzled so coach calls time out the the coachella's timeout the varsity coach walks under the huddle and i think he's going to give me this like epic advice maybe like that varsity advice how am i supposed to get by this guy and he just goes you will never play varsity back oh my god thanks coach hollingsworth and he's just like if you can't handle this guy you will never like he's because he's like i thought you might be and now i see no as like some motivational thing then he just gave you a wedgie and walked away [Laughter] is there a checkbox for faculty but but he was right and in in the houston pond i was nowhere near athletic enough to be whatever now luckily my parents uh my dad gets a job in beijing we moved to china in the 10th grade i go to china first day i started playing basketball you know that's for autism these kids don't get protein over there yeah they just don't get protein everybody's scrawny i'm blowing by everybody varsity coach walks over he's just like hey what's your name uh i end up being captain of the varsity team you know i got a girlfriend like my life changed for the better like everything got better because i caught sps i got small small pawn syndrome and i was able to go be a varsity player over there captain of the team the captain of the of a football key of a football team in rural alabama with 100 students they live the life screw the big city live that life you know what i'm saying and there was a part of me a foggy part of my memory that remembered like you ain't [ __ ] do the man squash that down it got washed away yeah it quickly got washed away and like i forgot it became like you're the [ __ ] you're the [ __ ] you're the [ __ ] and that's what you want to do in life uh this guy this guy's doing it right i actually have this dream too i was like i just kind of want to retire and coach high school basketball like i think that would just be a lot of fun and um and yeah you know this small pawn thing i think we're onto something i i've thought about this for a long time i thought about moving back to st louis for a minute but my wife wasn't down but i was like dude i could just be the man here uh you know i could buy a million dollar house and it would make the news you know what i'm saying right a million dollars in san francisco or new york is a studio but i was like it would be it would be one of the biggest purchases of the quarter i would make the news it would be awesome but then i realized i you know i don't want to do that i have straight fire today if you want uh if you want more all right i've got fire too i think did you see what i have in there uh no i don't have the thing open oh well [ __ ] um well you could screw give me one well okay so i spoke to like a bunch of different companies this week and they gave me all their revenue all their profit and a few of them are interesting and i could just like bullet point and quickly go through a few of them you want to do that by the way explain why does somebody yeah why does somebody just give you all their revenue and give you all their profit as you say because it sounds like a unrealistic and b like you sort of like tricked them but that's not the case no i said it's actually okay so um i've got this like uh community that i'm running that i'm not gonna talk about yet but it's like a ceo community and when they join they tell me all types of interesting information so we can place them in the right group and i messaged eight of them and i said hey can i talk about you on the pod and can you answer these questions and am i allowed to reveal all of your information well if i am i allowed to reveal the information that you gave me and they said yeah sure so that's how i got it so nothing like crazy um which one you want to do all right i got a couple of them actually give me the most interesting one first let's do uh okay well here's one that's actually not i don't even think i put it on here but have you ever seen those pedal taverns in um like nashville and denver it's like the bars that you like pedal with like a they're honestly pretty obnoxious but you know what i'm talking about no pedal whatever it's called i guess you don't like leave the suburbs of san francisco but in a lot of other cities denver austin nashville like these like style cities there's these things called petal taverns they kind of look like um imagine a bar in the middle and there's eight people sitting on one side and eight people sit on the other side now imagine that being on top of a four-wheeled platform and you're pedaling that platform while you're drinking booze you've never heard of that but you're outdoors right outdoors on the street yeah yeah so yeah it's like a some party thing yeah the guy who created one of the first ones is in the group and his name is pete and his business does he bootstrapped it from nothing just out of school it's getting close to eight million a year in revenue and just the pedal taverns do about five million a year in sales quite profitable and they're using the profits to buy the real estate that their pedal taverns stay in overnight that's a pretty interesting business um let's see another one is uh have you heard of um let's find another one have you heard of uh you probably never heard of this so here's an interesting one there's this business called the peak it's ran by this guy named brett so it's a daily newsletter so just like the hustle morning brew whatever mostly bootstrapped only and it's in canada and so every day it gives you the news you need to know about canada canadian news uh only a team of 10 90 000 news newsletter subscribers not that much and doing about 3 million in revenue with 30 with a million in profit pretty good business a small team of 10 90 000 subscribers 53 open rate 67 000 monthly podcast listeners the guys were like kind of good uh writers but not really that good and they just started like writing and cold emailing people and hiring writers and after two or three years it's already about two or three million in revenue so what are they doing differently because that's more revenue per subscriber than most i think so right yeah it's pretty good but basically he they just said that uh um with in canada like there's not that many there's not as many publications and b2b advertisers soft software companies they don't have that many money places to advertise and so these guys have just done a really good job of getting the banks the telecommunication companies um b2b software companies all these like high-end enterprise companies to advertise with them gotcha that's pretty good um okay uh we'll do one more i want to tell you about a company oh fine you can go okay okay i want to tell you about a company that you may have heard of have you heard of this thing called live golf i think it's called live i don't know how you pronounce it liv or live wait liv yeah just live nah what's live golf live golf okay so you know about the pga tour it's like the the main it's like the nfl right no golf so so live golf is a competitor to the pga that just imagines the saudi arabia effect exactly it's a saudi-backed rival and these guys are basically trying to it's like they're trying to spin up a new league by brute force they're investing hundreds of millions i think they pledged yeah me too big big swing so this is not this is the opposite of sps right so this is uh bde yeah so so basically they they put the saudi public investment fund put in they pledge 400 million dollars to start the league i think they've even committed more than that i thought they offered tiger woods like 500 million or something crazy news came out yeah they offered him 800 million dollars and he said no which is like just kind of an insane thing so but they have signed other huge stars so phil mickelson uh you know dustin johnson this guy you know brooks kefka or whatever who who recently won the the he won like four majors or whatever um cameron smith who's like this is a young star he signed a 100 million dollar deal dustin johnson 125 million dollar deal phil mickelson 200 million dollar deal they offered tiger and didn't get him yet but um and phil can only be on it can only be on live and not pga exactly so it's a competitive thing so pga is like there's like i don't know uh 60 events a year or whatever and then there's like four majors what these guys are doing is like there's eight events and they all matter they're going for more of like the nfl model uh versus baseball right baseball has 100 you know almost 200 games a year and you know they don't really matter but there's sort of always something on whereas the nfl is like there's like 17 sundays or 18 sundays and like each one is gonna matter so that's what these guys are trying to do with the golf model um and to like put this into context you know tiger woods has earned 121 million dollars in all of his pga winnings like over time you know obviously he makes more through sponsors and and you know um other sort of like paid events and things like that but just from the pga his lifetime i think earnings are 121 million so liv is coming out strong and basically giving these guys like tiger woods lifetime money as a guaranteed contract instead of the way the pga works is it's like there's a prize pool for every tournament there's nine million for every tournament the winner gets three everybody else gets like a piece depending on how you finished and they just do that over and over and over again and so they do 48 events a year and um and and so live comes in and they basically are giving guaranteed money away instead of saying you have to win in order to be there and so pga makes like a billion and a half dollars yeah i'm looking right now revenue 1.5 a little bit over 1.5 and you know 85 percent of that is like their their tournaments and the media rights and ads and all that stuff that comes from that they have like a nine year car they're in year one of a nine year contract and then mr still your girl comes in and is starting to just take these stars away and uh and basically is trying to you know compete with them they also have like prize prize money as well and so they need you know they would need to generate like a billion dollars as well to sort of like have like a similar economics but what's the play here is do like middle easterns watch a lot of golf is that the stick is like this no i i i don't know if that's why like maybe uh like you know there's like that weird thing where like russia really loves like women's basketball i don't know if you know that no like if you're a great women's basketball player you play college in the united states then you try to make it to the wnba and the wnba pays you basically nothing like you know you'll make like 70 80k yeah like a shoe salesman salary and then you'll get like 300 400k for playing the off season in russia yeah and everyone's like why does russia care this much about women's basketball like nobody asks questions and like yeah it's a little bit whatever i don't know exactly what's going on there but um but that's like you know they disproportionately like that sport and so maybe there is something in saudi arabia for this or it's just they have a huge amount of money and they see the business opportunity where pga basically had a monopoly on this and if you can create a successful sports league these are worth billions and billions of dollars like we both love the ufc ufc sold for i think 4.2 billion dollars um which in my opinion is under now like very low undervalued for where it is and that's like the oc is like fringe compared to nba nfl like these major major uh major leagues what's more popular golf or p or or ufc golf right i think golf is not more popular but it generates more revenue but what's more lame because it's like sort of the wealth who beats up who are with their club or ufc fighter with his hands i i [ __ ] hate golf i hate golf i can understand golf golf's out of sport golf's activity honestly how much of your thinking at the end of the day boils down to who could beat up who most most i think that i think because that's like that's like something that we're all like uh like we're all afraid of like the guy who at the end of the day is like oh i can kill anyone in this room with my bare hands he is uh you know he's the true the true dog you know he has nothing to fear somebody said this once i was reading like a nfl scouting report like there was a draft there's four quarterbacks they're all like top prospects it's like who's gonna go number one who's number two and the guy who does like the draft he said this line that i thought was so badass he goes if they were all on vacation and going for a you know they they're walking out to go to the car they would all throw the keys to mark like they would check the keys to park mark's driving and it was like this like alpha male thing and i was just like what was this analogy and why did i love it so much like if you just said if it was like hey elon jeff bezos mark zuckerberg bill gates go out to dinner uh who's paying who's picking up the chat yeah yeah yeah who ordered the uber yeah none of these guys are driving do you uh when you're in a room like at a restaurant who sits aisle how how what percentage of the time when you're at a restaurant do you look around and be like whose ass can i kick and who's can i not zero really but i know that you do which is why i asked you this question because it's hilarious think about that zero zero percent of the time dude i cannot stand golf any sport that you wear khaki pants to to like play it's not a sport that's not a sport it's an activity it's a hobby it's checkers but it's not you know like it's barely a job if you have to wear cats it's barely a job like a sport sport is out of the question khaki's in a collared shirt that is not that's i mean that's not a sport like you you don't sweat it's an activity it's a hobby uh this is amazing though i i i don't like let's get rid of the saudi arabia thing uh i think it's pretty cool but if you're phil mickelson and you have [ __ ] you money hardcore and saudi arabia who has you know a lot of human rights issues offers you this what do you do do you take it or not so you double your net worth probably if you're him so i think you can't take it alone in a vacuum because you're not trying to go sit on an island doing nothing uh by yourself and like lose all your relevance you lose your future earnings if you do that but you what i do is i say to them look i'm in if you can go get 40 of this list to join and you could tell them that fills in if you're in and i would basically say you need to sweep th a critical mass of us so that this is relevant that this is considered the top class i'm not gonna go play in the b league or the d league uh by doing this and i would tell them that and i would say i'll do it you're gonna have to cut the fattest check of your life and you got to go get 40 of this list so there's a fact there's a price that you would take for sure oh of course of course if you know if somebody said hey you got to go to this podcast on on android and i'd be like android even is there a podcast player on google and they'd be like yeah yeah it's we're putting a lot of investment into it i'd be like all right all right i'll do that i'll take this podcast to soundcloud i'll take it to the google play store but i'm gonna need to see seven and a half million dollars that's what i would say about this podcast i would i would move this podcast for seven and a half million dollars that is my price there's a price to paid to be a [ __ ] i'm down but uh so we actually were going to do this so at one point in time i had a startup that was based on uh like streaming uh video games and twitch was the like 900 pound gorilla in the room that was like it was the big streaming platform and we were just like we were trying to build a tool that worked on top of twitch like streamers could use it when they use twitch and it was working and every day we'd come into work we'd work really hard on this tool but like there was definitely a part of us that was like dude how did we end up here we're making this like tool for twitch streamers that like is free and then we're hoping that we can like after they all use it then we might be able to monetize this other way we're just like this guppy in this like in the in the in the ecosystem of this food chain we're like that little fish that like swims in front of the whale's nose like whatever that thing is called like we're that and i was like i like defer con i was like man don't you just want to be the whale and he's like i just so badly want to be the whale and i'm like yeah so what could we do he's and we're just like mate we went to the room which white board are like how would you like compete with twitch itself how would you just beat twitch and i was like dude look at the numbers so we like ran the numbers we're like twitch has this insane power law where you can see that the top you know x 100 streamers if you take the top 300 streamers they basically make up all the viewership all the all the meaningful viewership like you know i don't remember what the exact ratios were at the time but like any power law it's like you know the top one percent or whatever make up a very significant portion right viewership so let's just make up some numbers let's say the top 300 made up 50 of the viewers at any given time i was like so twitch is worth twitch sold for a billion dollars like a decade ago or whatever you know seven years ago it's probably worth five seven billion dollars now you're saying that if we could take you know half of that half if we can get to a quarter of that we'd be worth a bill you know we might we might have the equivalent uh 25 of the traffic would be worth you know a quarter of what they're worth which is like a billion dollars today how much money would it take for us to throw at those people right go get 25 of that through top 300 how much money would it take for us to go through with them to be like come join our new thing and we like game theory the whole thing out we're like all right this guy makes this much today we basically need to offer him like 10 times what he's making today how much do do some of these guys make just on twitch so shortly after that the contracts exploded but like at that time the top guys were making like single digit millions uh per year off twitch so like let's call it between one and five million uh plus those are some endorsements you don't really know how to track and you know they they sell some amount of t-shirts it's hard to know and then it sort of explodes guys started signing like you know 10 20 million dollar uh deals but they're they're they're like multi-year deals three-year deals or something like that so you know they're making six million guaranteed or something like that five million guaranteed 10 million guaranteed so uh that was like the kind of like what our estimates were for the very very top guys we thought okay so how much would we need it's like we basically did the math and we're like okay i think you need i don't remember what the number was today but let's call it let's just pretend it was 150 million we need 150 million dollars to go through with them but it's like if i told you you could go raise 150 million and you're saying you needed 150 million dollars in order to pay the streamers and tell them bail on twitch come to our platform and when you come to our platform you're going to bring your audience and we're going to make all this money eventually through other people coming you get this much guaranteed all you have to do is just continue to stream and you have to promote it in this way and let us promote you can i make a product we're going to be 5 million to build this platform my prediction is that would never work i don't think that works okay so tell me why i'll tell you how it obviously it didn't happen so you know you're probably i think it could tell me why you think well i know that you didn't really try to do this but uh or i don't know in earnest i don't know if you didn't raise 150 million dollars i think maybe the pga tour could work maybe but doing this for consumers you need to have like a brand and you need to have some magic about it it's kind of like you know even if you put all of like the resources into creating a boy band like sometimes that [ __ ] just don't work even though like everything like everything on paper it's like well we got the the blonde hair kid we got the mixed race kid we got the uh the dancer we got the singer like on paper this checks out you know like this should work you know what it'd be we should be popular in korea by this point and it's just there's there's just no magic right it [ __ ] just happens and then like you have some like you know kid who just like sings a funny song and makes a joke about like wearing a cowboy hat and he gets hugely famous like lil nas x or something [ __ ] just happens and i think that there's like a bit of magic that probably would be missing out when you're because with consumers it's quite challenging to like grab their attention it's like getting a cat to play with something it's just sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't right so so so i do think that that that's part of it but there have been instances where people have thrown money at the problem and it actually worked right for every quibby where you just raise a bunch of money you go try to do the thing it doesn't work for every one of the or every 10 of those there's one where you're like no actually they did kind of just brute force their way in i don't know if you remember this but when tick tock first launched tick tock was lame as hell dude tick tock was lame as hell it was pigeon holed as like the lame version of musically which was a pretty lame thing it was like 12 year olds lip syncing videos and now tick tock is huge and one one thing that happened in between i remember meeting a guy and he was like yeah you know tick tock is going to spend a billion dollars marketing the app because i was like dude there's billboards in san francisco like at bus stops to download tick-tock i was like do they really think this is going to work and we had an intern uh not an intern like a kind of just like a junior guy working for us he was in ninth grade and he worked at our company and i was like he started mentioning tick tock and i was like is tick tock actually a thing he's like yeah you know we just kept hearing about it kept hearing it kept hearing about and then they started just paying all of the top youtubers and vine people to just make tick tocks and like it worked you know eventually it just worked like it's like we all think it's lame but like we all kind of started to use it and then sure enough the lame thing fell away too by the end of it and it like you know it became like a pretty mainstream thing like tick tock really did brute force their way down they did a bunch of other things right good product great algorithm they did a bunch of other things i'm not saying they didn't do that but it's not like they started with this like brand love and authenticity and like loyalty and things like that so let me tell you how this this twitch thing played out so i had a hunch that you might be right so i approached discord and i said hey discord you want to buy us and they're like uh maybe who are you and like what do you want what do you do i was like oh we do this thing today but here's what we would do with discord we would help you compete with twitch you have brand love like discord is one of the most loved brands in gaming it's like you have the brand you have brand love but you don't do this today we will build the platform and like we can use this strategy to do this and they were like well okay this is kind of like a crazy big pivot idea like respect the audacity who did you email what role i don't know ceo and you said hey ceo i'm sean this is what i do can i come to your office and pitch you and then you went to the office and told him that or you told him this all exactly except why did he take your meeting and he at the end of it at the end of it his his take was basically like we will acquire you if you want uh i don't know if we'll pay the most so you know that's that's i don't know if the deal will happen um and i don't know if we would do this but the fact that you can come in here and whiteboard this on a wall makes me want you to like come here and do things and like that's like that's the biggest [ __ ] artist like i've ever heard of and you almost pulled it off what was the guy like he's amazing he's a young guy right he's like a young nerdy girl jason citron yeah i was like i never met zuck but i was like the way he talked about their product their strategy and like his like calm like confidence he's like quiet nerdy confidence i was like oh i don't want to compete with this guy and i see why they've kicked everyone's ass like this is like this guy's really smart and just really uh like has a point of view about the way this needs to go and like it's just simple it's understandable it's different why do you think he turned through he just feel like he's gonna actually get on that um i think i had gotten a warm intro through his investor his lead investor i told his lead investor hey we think about selling but i went to him and i was like hey we're thinking about selling would you do this deal or not and he was like well you should first talk to the discord guys and i was like great you know that's exactly what i was hoping for you know because i i just need to create a bidding war of some kind to get the you know best deal possible so can you make that interest so he just emailed him it was like um you guys should meet er like you know here's his email he's like yeah i think he warm intro you should meet and i just said hey i'd love to come by the office today and like uh you know 40 minutes i'll sketch out what i have in mind and like you know you could decide that's so funny nuts or if uh i'm genius arm nuts and you could decide for your first but he respected it i don't know what i said yeah he was just like you know would you like to come like be one of the like c-suite type people because i don't think we're going to do that plan that you outlined but i like you you know like you know there's not uh i don't i don't we didn't get that dude this is how we should be a leader everyone needs the confidence of a sean purry this is a great story this is um proof that you can just create [ __ ] out of thin air value yeah you can create value i always say this like at my last startup the the best thing i did ultimately in that in that company was i did write by the team and the shareholders of like at the end i put my best foot forward to try to get us the most value we could um that was like you know of all the things i did that was the best one and like i tried to do many other things so i tried to find product market tried to scale tried to hire a great team and i did some of those okay some of those poorly the one thing i did great was this this process let me let me finish the story here so then so i'm like okay these guys don't want to do it but maybe we could still do it and so we start trying to set up a meeting and i realized pretty quickly oh you have to do this as one you have to do this as like a coup because it's kind of like a rebellion and that i was like we need to do two things we need to wait till people are pissed off about something that twitch does which big companies will shoot themselves in the foot they'll come up with policies they'll they'll make some statement they'll change some feature they'll change the revenue split and people get annoyed i was like so we need to capitalize on that and then secondly we need to get everybody all at once you know that movie that's out there people like every everything everywhere all at once that's i was like that's how we need to do this we can't just get we can't just slowly negotiate one by one it won't feel like there's enough momentum and so i was like we need to do this at twitch's big conference where all the streamers will go to all the big streamers go because most big streamers they don't leave their house they're like they're like me but they actually have like you know they're actually you know rich and famous from their streaming but they can't leave their room that's like their job and so they go on vacation very little they take very few days off the one thing they do is they often go to twitchcon because they can meet their fans and it's the big event so i was like we need to do like a dinner the day before the day of or the day after the conference probably probably the day before i was like you know this might be the worst time because they're going to be up and you know the twitch kind of like ecosystem but it's the only time we get them all in the same room i was like and we'll lay out our case which is basically look you guys are going to make stupid money if you all are in there's no risk to any of you individually because you're if you're all there this will actually work and see like you don't have to play by twitch's rules anymore like you have you know say in this thing i can't find this client info have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases hubspot grow better dude there's this like there's this like famous meeting that happened in atlantic city in like 1930s and that's when they it was all all the mafia guys that got together and like al capone and all these guys and that's when they like formed like the syndicate or whatever you know like the mob and like you know it's us versus everyone that's basically what you did you had like your little mob meeting and that sounds awesome i didn't do it i wanted to do this i didn't even get there why because there was one thing that happened and when we ended up getting acquired by twitch uh emmett was like hey let's grab a drink we'll celebrate so we go to the first time i met him like outside of the office and we go to this bar and you know we're talking about stuff and i was just like you know uh i was like what do you think's it how would somebody beat twitch he's like hmm he's like he's like it's pretty hard we do have like a pretty good business and like you know it's hard to compete against these like marketplaces once they get back you know about your meeting but you know no no so i go i go i go we had an idea i don't know if this would have ever worked we got very close we didn't pull the trigger ultimately uh but i always wondered like would this have worked and i told him the idea he goes he goes yeah we've thought about that like that i don't want to quote him but like the the gist of what he said was if you're gonna do it that's the only way to do it but we knew that and that's why we started signing exclusive contracts with all these guys and specifically exclusive contracts that don't line up so we would make one expire in june and another expire in january another one expires and the following year he's like so that nobody could ever like they're all off cycle payment all off cycle contracts so that nobody could come and like oh they're all going to be for one of them all right tiny ass detail tiny detail right and i was like wow and then sure enough this actually did end up somebody did try to do this so uh microsoft came out this thing called mixer and they went and they tried to get the top streamers they gave ninja like i don't know some stupid 20 30 million dollars to come stream on make sure he said yes because he's like dude if i'm making four or five on twitch and these guys will give me 30 guaranteed um to go sit here for two years all right i'll do it and they tell me like this is integrated with xbox it's gonna like drive me a bunch of new viewers cool and then they tried to get shroud and try to get a bunch of others but they did it too slowly and so um so this attack did actually end up happening but that nobody went out of business didn't it yeah because they couldn't get the critical mass they couldn't get enough people to say yes um but like this did happen like the chinese streaming platforms tried to do it like a whole bunch of people tried to do this against twitch at the same time and just did a you know a fairly good job of not only this off cycle contracting but also figuring out is crazy there was like this this uh this like theory which was how many of your favorite streamers need to move before you move and so they looked at like okay if i'm a viewer if i spend 100 percent of the time just watching sam and sam leaves okay i have a high likelihood of leaving but as long as i can get you to watch like four people the odds of all four leaving are very low and if if one leaves i'm like 95 percent a chance to just stay how about the fact that they probably hired some like mit like rocket scientists and he's like thinking for years like i'm gonna i'm gonna help get man to mars you know i'm gonna help i'm gonna be part of saving the world the human race i'm just a little small part of this but i'm helping and he gets his job offer from spacex and it's 135 000. and then he gets this job offer from twitch and it's like 140 000 and he's like yeah they got free lunch though uh like you know like it's like the office is down the street from my house um i can do it like this this space thing will always be here you know like um their office is beautiful yeah and then they take that twitch office and then they spend the next eight years of their lives and the only point is figuring out how to make it so a streamer can click a button and like a cat pops up on their shoulder like like an emoji you know what i mean or it's like how do i just make it so like on monday night football the first yo the the down line the yellow line moves perfectly with like the you know how do i do that you know space will always be there though but like how do i get this like first just imagine someone like dedicating their lives to that that that sounds horrible to me that is um not far from the truth and in fact some people try to use that to their advantage um like you know steve jobs did that thing where you're saying recruiting john skilly or whatever he's like you know when are you gonna stop selling sugar water to kids and come like help change the world and uh uh scott harrison the ceo of charity water he's like i remember he came to silicon valley he was recruiting for charity water and i was like how do you recruit from like google you this he was trying to hire somebody from adobe i remember he said yeah she makes four times as much as i'm gonna offer like why would she take a like a huge pay cut like that like 4x less he's like i just got to hope that she wants to do something that actually matters i was like well okay and he actually did succeed in recruiting a bunch of really interesting people um but yeah you know it does happen like when you're at these companies it's like what percent of your life goes towards like being like you know can we get you know chat engagement up by 0.2 percent like can we get the uh you know if i add this emoji of this like you know bouncing cat like are you 34 more likely to come back next week like you know there's a lot of life that comes down to you if you work a big tech company you're working inside of a slot machine and you're looking at this like person sitting down on the stool and you're like can i get another four quarters out of them like what do i need let's hey make that light flash over there hey hey cherries get a flash yeah that'll do it my wife you know went to this fancy ivy league school she's this brilliant woman and she was at facebook when we started dating and she was telling me what she did she's like i'm a pmm what's at stanford product marketing manager and i was like what's that mean she's like oh well we just help people um like we want more people to use facebook i'm like oh are you guys like the thing that puts like the jet above india so like they get free internet access she's like oh no not really um well what do you do she's like well you know i create um different products to help people to use facebook like okay but what do you really do she's like i'm uh making it so you could put a sticker on your picture and more people will spend just a little bit more time on this app and i'm like oh okay yeah you should quit right and like that's what she quit she's like yeah and when did something that actually she cared about but uh yeah i remember hearing about them like oh that's why you went into debt for all these universities and that's why you did all that we'll see you can you know walk around the facebook campus for like three hours a day and make like a sticker of like poojing the cat or whatever the [ __ ] that thing was called remember that thing poojing or what was that thing it was like it was like a japanese cat no idea it was called like poop remember how uh facebook they would have all these like japanese cartoons there was like that dog with his tongue hanging out i don't remember it's a thing it was like poo jean it was like a cat that was asian and like it was like a series of stickers that yeah it's the thing in snapchat that that dancing hot dog which has been seen more than like any cartoon or animation ever uh they've been seen like 10 billion times 100 billion times or something like that it's like yeah this hot dog is actually more popular than mickey mouse just on that tv show silicon valley one of the apps that they said was amazing was nip alert and it alerts you of erect nipples uh in your vicinity i'm like ah this sticker thing that's nipple alert sounds good yeah honestly when i was there when i was i didn't think it was like you know a waste of sort of time and energy in that sense like i don't know maybe i think twitch is actually okay because twitch is like this is like this cool subculture we're nerds no one likes us we finally have a space that we can do this stuff facebook i think is different and i respected the game theory of it i was like when this whole like contract thing was going down and they were like you know how basically the question of how much should we bid i was like i don't know you know like it's like in sports there's like this money ball movement where you're trying to figure out the value of a player and if you can accurately forecast the value of a player you have an edge in winning in the in the league the same the same thing is true now for all these like big media platforms that are like in which case here they were bidding for content so they're bidding for for this and you know i went and met with people or like you know talk to people who are at netflix and it's like hey how do you decide how much to spend on the production of this or you know how do you figure out if it was worth it to spend you know whatever 100 million dollars on house of cards and like and you go there and you me you know you meet the guy who's doing the same thing right like the brilliant data scientist who's like job is to like a b test the thumbnails of you know like the new garfield movie to figure out which one is going to lead to higher engagement like lower churn and it's like yeah you know you're you're a b testing thumbnails for for you for for netflix and youtube and all this stuff like yeah that's like it kind of feels like you know bringing a gun to a knife fight type of thing like you're you're you're damn like really this is where all this i know but there is it's a scale it's not binary it's a scale you know and so for some companies it's like oh no this is just way too lame for others it's like oh this got a little pinch of lame little half a cup of lame but like it's mostly pretty cool right you know what i'm saying netflix i actually think that's cool it's like oh i'm giving the world a little bit of entertainment facebook it's like i'm just making people hate themselves yeah the thing that i the way i ended up thinking about it was um like do i matter here like uh if i left like who cares i call this the django law like if you remove this block from the jenga tower tower still there i guess that wasn't a key block like you know sure we'd love to have it there it's more it's better if it's there but like nah nobody really cares believes like if i don't really matter here then like it's very hard for me to get excited that's kind of an ego thing but it's also like an impact thing like if i at a startup like i can i can just by myself create a product give value to customers that didn't exist and i can capture a huge amount of value and at a big company i'm neither the key person creating the value nor the key person nor the person who captures any of the value right like your value capture inside of a company is is is fixed like you you get paid what you get paid in most cases you know aside from like maybe a bonus that you could get um whether your product succeeds or fails which is why a bunch of products fail or go really slow inside these companies because it doesn't matter you don't get you don't get a prize if it works uh you know you get you get praise and so and and then the other side which is like you know does this matter and i think there is a counter argument like i talked to um let's get josh ellman and uh and actually even the the chief product officer at twitch skydan i was like dan why why do you always join you know worked at google worked at next door he worked at now twitch i was like why are you doing these big companies like have you ever wanted to go do your own he's like yeah but i wanted like impact scale and i was like i was like oh that's weird like in my head it was always if i'm at a small company i have a bigger impact i am big relative to the company he's like yeah but that's not how you think about it like here if i can improve one product that 10 million people use or at google a billion people use search uh you know every single day and so if i can make that better he's like i created the book search you know feature i was you know on the books team we created that project so now you could like search for books and like a bunch of people on earth do that how to start it would be very hard for me to do that and i was like okay like that is the counterpoint is like if you're if you're working at apple and you're working on the app store like you know the app store if a billion people use it every single day i guess like making that better reaches a billion people you know making their life one percent better or whatever you know that that days is higher impact than at a startup but it doesn't feel that way the action doesn't feel the same to me no i agree you want to do another topic can i give you a framework that i think is uh pretty dope that i heard so i was talking to somebody about like you know um i guess i can't really say what i was talking about uh but i was talking about something it's sort of like you know let's say the topic of money like should i do this should i do this it's going to yield this amount of money or not and the person was like well the way i think about money is um you know because the value of money is what can you say no to if you have this money and i was like what do you mean by that that's interesting i started he he actually he didn't even respond but i was like uh in my head i was like that's interesting i've never heard that before and so like i started thinking about it and i go that's true like people always say you know i want financial freedom i want freedom you know i don't care about money i care about freedom that's like a common thing you'll hear and it's like what does that actually mean i was like oh it's actually not the freedom to do something it's the freedom from having to do something so it's like what can i say no to so let me give you kind of like so i started thinking about my own life i was like when i had 25 000 in my bank account i could say no to a really shitty job like i didn't have to go flip burgers or be a janitor because i could i could pay my like monthly bill uh and i could do that for like you know six to 12 months and like cool that means i didn't have to go get a bad job a shitty job today but then at like 100k in the bank you could say no to like a shitty manager it's like okay i don't i can't just retire but i can like quit this job take a gap and like find another job and i don't feel like there's like financial stress in doing that so 100k lets me say no to a shitty manager i was like half a million that's what i could say no to like i don't have to work for a couple years i could just say no to work for a little bit temporarily saying six to 12 months yeah i could go for a year i could try a startup or go trap backpacking or whatever like i could pursue a passion of some kind so that's a new thing you could say no to it's like work for a little while then it kind of like i would say 3 million you can just say no to jobs like uh i'm only gonna work for myself i can bet on myself and and give myself enough time to figure stuff out without having to stress about it at 10 million i think you just say no to working in general it's like like my money makes enough money i just don't need to use my time to make money if i don't want to and then it kind of goes on and and you say no well like i've been thinking about this as well um at like between some number maybe around 100 you say no to having to be in one location so for example right now i rent a place in one location and i own a place in another location if i had 100 million dollars i'd probably own three or four homes and it's just like hey let's just go from place to place to place i don't have to spend any time organizing a rental or or anything and then maybe around like two or three hundred it's i'm gonna say no to wasting time at an airport i'm just we only yes you know we only fly so i think it's that but the numbers are a little bit less i said at 50 million i think you could say no to any inconvenience that money can solve you could i think you could but you could fly private at 50 million you'd have to own the jet but you could fly private you sure for sure you could hire assistants to do anything you need you can hire you know chefs and drivers and and you know errands and and accountants and anything you don't want to do you don't have to do i talked to you i talked to 50 million i talked to a guy there today who owns a jet and he said it's about two and a half million a year um in expenses right and he owns it uh if you want to rent it i think you could go most you can go to a lot of places and spend half a million dollars a year and if you have 50 million that's that's doable but you can't own like an 8 million house in brooklyn and then a 3 million dollar house in austin and then a five million dollar house in la but you could own pretty nice [ __ ] in those places right and so you know like the top ladders you get 100 million and i think you could say no to the way the world world works you get to change some rules and at a billion i think you say no to like politicians you say no to the police you say you say no to a bunch of people uh when you get to a billion because you have the ability to kind of fight back uh you they uh they kind of there's there's a different level of respect so to me i liked this framework of what does this amount of money allow me to say no to that i want to say no to did you um yeah what would what hourly rate would you say no to right now for uh for a project that you don't want to do for a one-hour phone call what would you have to accept uh so like i think they there's like what you say and then it's like what you actually like what the market clearing price actually is so you would you would right now i charge two thousand dollars an hour and i take about two hours a week of phone calls um would you do that or not so that's the exact borderline so on glg that's like what you get the max you can set my rate to is two thousand and if i get a if i get a bid and i'm like uh this phone call doesn't sound like it's going to be a lot of fun um it's like right at that borderline where i feel like i kind of should like for an hour i i should i don't think i don't take the calls because i need the money i take the calls because i feel guilty saying no and so it's the same thing right like feeling like i should means feeling like i want to say no but i don't think i should and therefore if i say no i kind of feel like i made a you know i'm guilty right like what i've done well has this i've used the app intro and i just like for example i'm flying down to your event and then i'm flying to la i um i schedule it so i know when i'm gonna find the money well i know when i'm gonna be in the uber and i just make my availability there so i'm like sick i'll just take this in the uber and now i can afford like i could justify a 200 uber black because i'm making two thousand dollars in this hour and so i'm gonna be comfortable and i'll order even early so if i arrive early at the airport i can just sit outside of the airport and finish this call so that's kind of how i've been justifying it now but right it feels weird selling time per hour and i don't even know if i like that in general yeah exactly so i would say my true answer is if i don't want to do it right now i think that the number is something like two or three thousand dollars for an hour if i if i just if i don't want to do it i actually just don't do it but if it's like borderline if i'm not sure if i want to do it or i don't think i would like it but it's not so painful i think that's my current thing uh but i'm i'm actively trying to get away from it like um something that came up yesterday that was like this and i was like i was by default i was just gonna say yes and i was like should i say yes to this let me just like recheck what i want to be saying yes to because i think that you know one of the most important decisions in your life is what are the things i'm going to say yes to and what are the things i'm going to say no to so there's your default box which is like oh i i obviously say yes and no to these things then what are the non-obvious things so it's like i want to be saying yes to things that i know will be fun and help me grow but scare me a little or put me out of my comfort zone right so it's like i know i want to say yes i know i want to say yes to if my friend is in town i want to go pick them up from the airport or if my mom needs to get to the airport i want to drive her there like i want to say yes to tasks that like um i don't want to do but i actually want to be the person who does those things so i'm just like i'm deciding consciously what are the things that are like what should i be moving into the yes box and what should i be moving into the no box what's some [ __ ] i do today that i should be saying no do you have a polite way of saying no to all the inbound or do you just ignore i used to just ignore and then i realized like it's totally fine to just say um hey this sounds cool but um i just got my hands well i don't want to do anything else or like hey this uh you know um hey you know thanks for reaching out um i don't want to do any more phone calls that i'm doing right now but if that changes i'll let you know yeah and like i'll just say something and i think you know people hey they just appreciate a response more than a blow-off and b i think there's some level of respect for um thoughtfully yeah for you know somebody just being honest and like just saying look i don't like i don't want to do that um you know i i've decided i want to travel less you know um so i'm going to say so i'm saying no to trump dude i had this guy messaging me saying he wants to come on the pod and i was just like i ignored it i ignored it because i hate when people ask to come on because i'm like dude why are you gonna make me say no like i say no to everyone practically even good friends like we just say no to most everyone and this guy he was like uh i was hey or he was like can i come on i'm a huge fan and i just said like thanks for reaching out like i didn't even i tried to avoid it like it was quite obvious and he's like uh hey so can i come on and i go you know this isn't a good fit but i really appreciate you listening and he was like um can i get some feedback i was like it's just not a good fit and he goes okay but why and i was like uh okay because you're not interesting and you're not that successful and uh he was angry at me and i was like dude what what the hell i mean i was trying to like you know make a point of like avoiding this topic and being kind but you if you're gonna ask for feedback and i'm gonna tell you you know what what what it's about don't get angry right he's like what's not interesting about it he said i go it just there's you know i just don't care about you so my my goldilocks thing here was i was too cold when i just blew people off because they didn't like that and then they would just stop like you know i found i would miss opportunities because i wouldn't reply to things uh miss opportunities i cared about uh in the long run and then the too hot was i would just be like i don't do phone calls i was like okay you know you're sort of a jerk for just being like i don't do phone calls or like i don't meet with people i don't know or like you know i i don't do this it's like too hard of a rule and i found that the sweet spot was somewhere in the middle of just saying uh you know hey thanks but uh but you know i'm trying to do less of this right now or or sometimes i'll say like um they'll be like hey did you want to do this i'd be like um you know i haven't decided and uh you know like i don't know i don't even know what i want yet so let me get clear on what i want and then i'll come back if i if i you know when i get clear if i ever get clear on it but like it's not about you i just don't know exactly what i want to do right now and like i'll just say like something honest like that and i found that that that tends to work um a little bit better dude we went from hitler to saudi arabia to saying no to people mental models yeah mental models good pod um you uh i'm gonna be in la on sunday you're not coming right to l.a on sunday no i don't think so but then i'm gonna see you in what are you going to what are you going to like i told you about it i'm hosting an event there dude for the new york event that i'm hosting we've got like 1300 rsvps i'm eager to see how many show up you got to cut that down right you can't you can't do it you're going to do a thousand person event no that's how many people said they're coming but it's free so like maybe half will come um but we put up ten grand you're gonna do a 650 person event dude it's all guys by the way third number it's all guys i like scroll through it's all dudes i could smell that event already yeah it's [ __ ] up man so many chads are gonna be there and then i'm doing the same thing in la and that one has like five or six hundred rsvps um i just uh you and i were talking about an event and i was like kind of like actually this is like a toilet decision and i just wrote it on eventbrite on my phone and just posted it right away and people signed up and i said we're committed so we're doing that and then i'm gonna be and then we're gonna go to uh the carolinas for uh the thing you're organizing which everyone's been reaching out to me did we talk about it last pod yeah we mentioned that they had the last spot dude so many people are reaching out to reach out about they want to come uh they basically people wanting to come and i'm like this isn't no no sorry it's not my thing but so so i came up with a i was like what do we call this and i was like i want to call it camp mfm so it's camp mfm and i was like we could do these but we could do a bunch of these we could just do like adult summer camps basically great ideas what what is something that's really fun because i don't want to go to something that's like like even this like a thousand person meetup like i'm sure it's cool in the school well it serves a different purpose it's a party versus an experience yeah so i want to have experiences you know when you were like yeah i'm a [ __ ] artist man you know that's how i have like i don't have experience this is gonna be a good one now we gotta come up with another one let's go to like hope and so some of these will be like this one which is like ultra like more like super exclusive right there's only there was only supposed to be 12 people going it's expanded to 24 and um you know that's a lot i i wanted it to be more like 12 but i'm like there'll be those and i think we should do some that are for like dude if you can like if you know the phrase you know we don't do public math manifest cowboys you know uh sam wants to own a lake like if you know the inside jokes of this pod then you're that's your admittance into the to this this camp and i was like i think we should do these like twice a year um that are just like fun and awesome and get people together quarterly i mean camp mfm should be the thing i never wanted to do the work for this um and neither do you and so that's like you know one of the challenges but but it wasn't a lot of work for this one was it kind of feel like it is it's a lot because as soon as i try to do something i'm like well let's make it [ __ ] awesome then like you know and so like all of a sudden like for this basketball thing we got like nike's giving us all like like sneakers like from like one of their players and they were getting like custom swag we rented these like dope airbnbs we got like a chef we got like all this stuff coming together i was like well if we're gonna have good people let's get like some like good names in here let's get like some people we're excited to meet and then it's all coming together and like but like each one of those now i'm like now i want it to be like awesome if we're going to do dude we got one like we you know we get experience we can get a sponsor to say like all right you get you get 300 000 a year to do cool [ __ ] but we get to be there at all the events yeah okay if somebody wants to do uh sponsor camp mfm you can do this all the money will go to basically hiring a planner to actually like do these things for us and uh and secondly to uh to you know the venue and logistics of it all right that's a part i'm out [Music] you

I'm a 25-year-old I used to work in banking at m&a I made like low six figures and it was a cool job but I recently quit after listening to you guys and now I own a bunch of vending machines and it's allowed me to make 10 grand a month and uh do a bunch of running and he said quote do memorable things which is what you guys talked about at the end of the Pod this is pretty amazing all right I think we're good we good dude Sean thanks for dressing up you look nice all right so for those who can't see the YouTube video right now Sam is like in some kind of like uh I don't even know where he's at he's in some kind of like La some kind of Playboy Mansion podcast Studio I don't even know what's going on not a single wall is normal one of them's like a 3D texture one of them's got like a plant from you know the the Amazon jungle and he's got like five people there he's got like a movie crew somebody just came and P his nose I don't know what's going on I'm still in my bedroom and I recently woke up so you know we got a little yin and yang going Thunder explain what you're wearing Sean a I'll say a SLE aess hoodie no what Sam calls shirtless if Sam sees a shoulder he has like a minor panic attack it just uh you know I've it's something dud we can't all dress like Arthur so I was hoping that if I came here so I came here the other day to record a podcast with this guy named Danny and I came here I go I called Ben like right when I was there FaceTime I go Ben book this for like in three days this is where we're going to record from now on and I was like if if we do this here maybe it would Inspire sea to like record with more than just one airpod in his iPhone and a plant in the background and maybe we can make something happen so hopefully I'm going to wear off on you and we you'll do it right on your end because I think we'll get more views on YouTube finally yeah the last time I felt this much peer pressure I ended up you know on shrooms and so hopefully this just ends better but I do feel the pressure now I will find you know I don't even what is this place that you're at you give them a shout out what is the name of a called you don't say their name but what's it called WF media WT W WTF media I can't that guy you know guy that guy Danny you were on his thing too he's been emailing used to work for me oh really okay cool well I came on his thing and I came here and it was awesome I think we paid a couple hundred bucks I don't remember to be here and I think this is the actually the same Studio that Andrew Schultz and Charlamagne I think record their thing right yeah and it's like pretty easy so I just took you know rode my scooter here and and did it just like Charlamagne the God does yeah all right let's let's uh let's jump into some stuff you have some topics I got some topics where do do you want to start we got a bunch of different ways we can go wait we got to do this uh did you see this email that I got from this uh listener no where okay so I forwarded it to you so basically uh we were talking about like adventurous [ __ ] last time and this guy emailed me and let me pull it up so basically he said he goes all right uh you you wrote you guys talked about like living an adventurous life I wanted to write you and fill you in on what's going on I used to be 230 lbs and like pretty overweight but then I started running and I uh started listening to you guys the whole entire time while I would run in fact I did a 50-mile race and I only listened to MFM the entire time and I've lost a ton of weight and now next week I'm doing a 100 mile race and I intend to listen to you guys the whole time as well and I'm a 25-year-old I used to work in banking at m&a I made like low six figures and it was a cool job but I recently quit after listening to you guys and now I own a bunch of vending machines and it's allowed me to make 10 grand a month and uh do a bunch of running and he said quote do memorable things which is what you guys talked about at the end of the Pod this is pretty amazing I forward it to you it's that's that's a good story right yeah dude that's my my version of torture though like having to run 50 miles while listening to my voice in my head that would be like that would be like you know worse than waterboarding for me personally but dude props to this guy this is amazing uh you know Fitness got influenced by you listening to the Pod got influenced by both of us you know did the vending machine side hustle that we had talked about got to the 10K a month and now he has the freedom he's thinking about doing short-term rentals I think this might be your best friend I think you might have just found an adult best friend yeah this is my little brother man I like this guy his name's Jack so I I saw that email and I was like we got to bring that up that's a good one but um this is he ended it with hashd do things and I like that I like do things that's the serious version of no small boy stuff which is the official motto of my first million uh very cool I like that all right where do you want to go good job Jack Jack yeah good job Jack Jack nurur good job um I want to tell you about an idea that I saw recently I'm think I'm going to invest in this uh but it's kind of just like one of these really low-key doesn't even seem like a business things but I think it's going to be kind of big so have you ever been on YouTube and seen this thumbnail of like this kind of anime character wearing headphones and it says lowii chill beats study music have you ever seen that they kill it they have they run it on live like YouTube live and there'll be hundreds of thousands of people on it and I think like the other day it like was paused for like a few minutes or something like that and it was in the news right it got banned and then it got unbanned after 133,000 people like signed a petition to be like unban this right now that's crazy but okay and what about it so let me tell you about it so Loi basically the channel has 10 million subscribers it's one of the most like sort of longest watch time things on YouTube because people will just sit there for hour hours studying and just having this as background music they have a Discord of 700,000 people they have their own talk about well it's just people that are chilling it's people that want us people that are trying to study they're trying to focus and they just want to be in a group of other people doing the same thing it's like a virtual study hall so this is kind of like an emergent Behavior it's just a thing that started happening it's not what YouTube was trying to do it wasn't you know some company started right away it's just kind of like this thing that people wanted like oh you know like I had this when I was in college my buddy would it's like oh hand him the aux plug cuz his music is good for us to just chill do nothing to it's not going to be distracting that sort of thing and he would kind of be the DJ so this is like a thing now and I found uh but but it's still like kind of informal it's on YouTube it's not really like easy to use in that sense like you you know you don't know who these other people are you can't do a private room that sort of stuff so there's a startup called study verse that is trying to do this and what they did was they basically turned this into like its own experience so me and me and Ben use this now when we work we basically go into study verse and you go in and there's like a jukebox basically so you can just put on yeah like chill hipop Style music or chill electronic Style music or whatever and both people are hearing the same thing at the same time you could turn your camera on or off if you want to just be there microphone on or off and uh you can like put your to-do list there and other people can see it and as you knock them out it makes a little sound so you can see other people knocking off their to-do list uh there's a little chat and so and you can just set the background so you could be like let's just give the yeah yeah we're working remote we're uh you know like I'm in this little home office here nothing too Grand but you could just set the scene like no what if we were by the beach or what if we were you know in space or wherever you want so it's just a cool little product um and they're going after this use case of virtual study hall people getting together to study hang out or work uh but it's really around studying I believe and this is like a big deal there are millions of students every day who do this and they do it with strangers they're not they're not necessarily hanging out with their friends they some do but a lot of people just want to feel like they don't want to feel kind of alone and bored when they study and so just having any other people chatting or they see their screen names they see their profile pictures it just makes them feel less alone when they're doing it Howes make money I think this is going to be big so the the LOI uh the LOI thing on YouTube I don't know if they just run ads they just monetize that way I'm not 100% sure I know they also have like the music is their own music they have lowii records so it's all copyright free which is kind of cool um because that would be the other problem if you try to do this commercially and um but for these guys I think they'll probably have some premium version or some uh upsell or so I don't know what they'll do to make money like the main thing right now is can they get to like a million students a day who are studying with this thing which is like at that point it's pretty valuable to be the Hub where a million students today are spending like multiple hours basically what did they rais money now yeah so so I'm investing this thing um not a ton yeah I'm gonna do it this it gives me heavy like twitch Vibes in a in a way where I'm like it's kind of a behavior that doesn't really make sense until you start to think about the use case and like yeah that would be fun actually but there's thousands of them I just Googled it there's so many of them what like virtual study halls yeah yeah there there are I don't think there's thousands of them there's one serious competitor that's like been around for a little while uh forgot what it's called but they have they're close to that point yeah I think a study together I think that's the one um they have a million people in their community and uh and so you know these guys are trying to build like a better user experience than that um so this I think this could be big on study together it says that there's uh 30 34,000 people concurrently online so at the hustle we are getting let's say that we are getting 2 or 3 million monthly uniques basically that means that which is like 2 to 3 million a month is pretty good if it's the right Niche you can make like you know a million a month off two to three million people a month if it's the right one and at any given point we would have 2,000 people online like it it really would never get maybe occasionally you would get to 3,000 and 4,000 but virtually never and the fact that this has 33,000 that's pretty insane yeah that's right now I mean I don't even know if school I think it's like still summer for for people that they're not even like in school right now and if you are in high school or anything else like you're you're you know it's the middle of the day you can't be doing this while you're at school so this is only going to be like college or summer school right now I bet this number could be three times as high for them during like kind of peak Seasons um you know definitely so so I think that's kind of amazing and you know like you know whether they sell you know like little emotes like Discord did like Discord makes millions and millions of dollars off of just their like their super emoji that you can have or uh you know yeah that's discord's business model is you pay $6 a month or something like that for Discord Nitro and all it gives you is like your o your little your group can have its own Emoji like you can upload your own emoji and you could use the premium emoji that they have and uh same thing with twitch like people subscribe for five or six bucks a month to a um a twitch Channel and like it's not like they couldn't just watch it for free they can watch for free too they do it to get a little badge that says I'm I'm a paid like patron of this person's Channel and secondly they get to use the custom emoji of that channel that's right really the only perks like sometimes it's subscriber only chat but but that's not usually the case and so um so yeah you I think you could get pretty big with something like this uh but I think it's one of those like uh under the radar niches most people don't even really recognize that this is a niche so I think this is a cool idea I'm excited to see how it does we talked about it before um all right let me run something by you because you you just actually have been talking about this so check this out so you know who Scott Galloway is of course the uh Professor G Prof G yeah for those who don't know there's this dude named Scott Galloway popular on Twitter for making all these like Tech takes and he gets made fun of for being wrong a lot but he takes a lot of swings so he's going to be wrong a lot but basically he started this company called L2 which I think he sold for like 200 million bucks so he's like really successful already whatever and he's got this new thing called section four which I think is just like courses but dude check this out so New York Times it said Mr Galloway who is already wealthy from selling two companies and taking a third public also makes more than $5 million a year from speaking gigs he said largely from corporations and Industry groups that pay him $50,000 a year or 50,000 for a virtual event and $250,000 for an International Event I should be broken up he joked which is pretty funny but that's that's a ridiculous amount of money for speaking that is huge how how how does that work cuz I know that you were talking about like it it has to all be it has to all work from uh Book Sales right or for you know just like being a New York Times bestseller yeah I think it's like a combination like you just you're in people's face enough with like you know you you sound polish because you know they have a podcast they have uh he's got his blog which is pretty famous he's got he's been he's been doing this for like he didn't do this forever dude I feel like this guy's been publishing content for like 10 15 years at least something like that isn't isn't that right he's not like some some new guy no he's not he's not just a guy I mean he's he's he's he's great you know he's good and he's hilarious I listened I was at when I was in Germany he spoke he was very good and like I've hung out with him he's a really nice guy and his stick online I don't always agree with a lot of his takes and I think that sometimes he's unnecessarily a hater but without a doubt incredibly entertaining when he when he does talks like he's got a little bit of like a comedy stick on there he's kind of like a little Fu and he like says like hilarious jokes about him being like old and like bald and stuff he's hilarious he's good and this is that but that's so much $5 million a year from speaking is like the equivalent of having like $50 million $5 million a year of income is is is astronomical you know what I mean what it really is well just it's true it's like it's funny that it's uh it like it's funny that you're absolutely right that is an absurd number to be making in speaking fees every year you're like a pretty good NBA player at that point yeah exactly but you're just like giving a presentation on you're using PowerPoint and often by the way it's the same presentation it's the same one you can do it for 15 years you know what I mean it's like in your free time a little bit uh this is crazy it I just I heard that number and I was like I I couldn't believe it at first because it is it's it's an astronomical number how much is like David Blain make cuz Prof Prof G is basically like inviting a magician to your conference it's like oh here's the entertainment uh we all know and love this guy Scott Galloway he comes on he kind of does his little routine and he entertains you and like that's the that's what he's getting paid for is to be kind of like a name people recognize adds legitimacy to the event and um and you know provide some entertainment that's not like completely off-the-wall circus stuff it's like well this will be entertaining but it's still relevant here's the thing here's the rub his pod it it gets it's two times the size of ours so we get like between we get like in the 100,000 sometimes more sometimes a little less uh range per episode downloads per episode he's at 250,000 so in my header and him or who is it yeah yeah that I I don't know what it's called but it's like him and Caris swier it's on I don't even [ __ ] know what it is recode it was like recode or whatever now it's something else and in my head I'm thinking I'll take half that right I mean we got to be doing this I'll do you one better I'll take a third of that I'll undercut Sam and I will I will how often whatever the hell you want how often do you get asked to do it uh I don't get asked that often I I don't get asked that often the number is always good whenever I do get asked but I don't get asked that often um and also I'm not really that interested in doing this because like you know for this you got to travel a bunch uh to do it I think to do it well you got to travel a bunch I don't think people are gonna you take your kids with you on like a trip somewhere right you don't want to see Kansas City bro yeah exactly like uh no I do not want to I do not want to take the phrase take my kids somewhere is like already you know the prices went up uh so so no I wouldn't want to do that now but yeah later in life yeah that'd be great so by the way funny you mentioned Scott Galloway there's a couple things people should know number one he's very entertaining great at content number two his business takes are pretty awful for the most part he's been wrong famously wrong many many times in fact somebody created the the anti- professor Galloway index or something what's that website called where it's literally just says anytime he says to buy or sell something if you just did the exact opposite here's how you'd be doing it's like he's down x% you know S&P 500 is up y% and this is up like double the S&P 500 you the market it's the website's bet against the professor introducing the anti- Galloway index and what do the stats what does it say how has he done or how's the thing done against him so his worst prediction was that he said that Ma I think he said that like Macy's was gonna like outperform Amazon so like not that good and then he also said that uh he also said that um Tesla was a Bad Bet so like I I don't know even know how to use it so let's see um since October 2019 tech companies that that the professor has predicted would fail have outperformed the S&P and seen a whopping 61% return so you would have made 61% exactly so that's really funny whoever did that uh I I I do appreciate that uh last thing is so so I just talked to a guy yesterday about this course business so so he's got this thing section four and I was like dude how much money does that make he goes actually I kind of like I've been you know I'm in that same Niche so I've been doing research on it here's what I think so here's what he thinks he goes he's I think section 4 does like 14 million a year in Revenue they've raised like $37 million they just did some layoffs because you know yeah um and he's basically like you know that's an average of $1,000 a year per learner um you know 30% discount let's say it's $700 and he has 21,000 people uh you know paying paying to learn um or something like that maybe 2.1 is what that was supposed to be I'm not sure but uh but yeah that's kind of like kind of crazy then he was like you know also reforge you you know reforge it was like the yeah if I se 4 is basically like some marketing School dude I would guess that reforge is in like the 18 to 20 range for Revenue yeah do you know how much money reforge has raised how much I have no idea if this guy is right reforge has raised a total of $81 million that just kind of absurd for for what they're doing but they did acquire some other marketing training company so maybe they raised a bunch of money just to buy something that had like established Revenue in iida um so anyways these little like marketing schools that people have created like these can be kind of big like we should have if if we wanted to monetize MFM this would have been the way to do it is to just me and you create like our own marketing School I'm pretty sure with our audience and like what we actually like we've actually done this like we've actually done marketing to grow our businesses successfully owned and exited multiple businesses now uh brought multiple businesses to this to this like you know seven eight figure in Revenue uh Point like if anybody should be doing this uh this should be us not not these guys uh but you know who wants to go do that I don't know so let me talk tell you about something that I question if I actually want to go do that but I hear the numbers and they're amazing so uh B2B media so media companies that make content for other businesses I was talking to this guy the other day and check this out he's got this company called Aging media okay they make newsletters for nursing homes so I guess people who own nursing homes and people who own hospice Hospice Care businesses and it's like I think only three years old it's or four years old it's not a very old company but he was telling me that this year they they'll do around 10 million in Reven Vue and like 3 or 4 million in iida and completely bootstrapped and they have got 40 employees and if you go go to It's called Aging media go to the website and look at their [ __ ] it is so simple is such a straightforward business and I see this stuff and I'm like oh man I could totally do this for X Y and Z and that's a small example there's a bigger example there's this company called industry dive industry dive was just acquired like uh a week ago I think or two weeks ago they acquire for $500 million they do um let's see they were doing where is it they were doing $110 million Revenue they're doing 110 million in Revenue with 30% profit 380 employees 53 newsletters across those 53 newsletters 2.5 million uh subs and pretty straightforward like not not complicated not necessarily easy but not complicated and straightforward their content I think it's okay it's just like it's basically just bullet points it's an email with bullet points of what's happening in like the restaurant industry or whatever but these companies the bar I think to be good is so low for B2B media because it's just like you know like it just mostly all sucks they like think that like you have to write a certain way but in the way they monetize and make money is so much better than a consumer Media Company because if you are a person who's selling software whatever to a hospice care owner like you you only have a couple places to go to and one sale gets you you know hundreds of thousands or maybe even millions in Revenue like a pretty huge number and so like these guys basically what they do they have ads on their site but they do webinars with a sponsor and like 15 people sign up for the webinar or the talk it's basically like a podcast just like this but you got to enter your email to get in they give that email to the sponsor and that sponsor hopes to go and email the 10 people that signed up and uh like hopefully they buy their [ __ ] and it's like 20 or 30 or $4,000 to charge for like getting those 10 30 50 Lees it's crazy the bar is so low yeah this this thing is crazy they have um their big like verticals or like they have waste dive waste dive is for the waste management industry then they'll have like far like Pharmaceuticals and then they'll have finance and then they'll have like you know these different uh things I think their biggest ones so marketing dive is 510 subscrib 510,000 subscribers uh biofarma dive 275,000 subscribers construction dive 300,000 subscribers HR dive 455 uh 450,000 subscribers and then they have just a bunch of others you right utility Dive restaurant dive retail dive is their AB their biggest one 700,000 subscribers it's pretty crazy this is not a media company really like you know yes they're Media company but like the game isn't are you good at making content the game is are you really good at acquiring users and like acquiring subscribers in this industry I don't think you have to be that good if you're if you're like a d Toc dork like you like you don't have to be that good at this like because you're already pretty good at like trying to acquire user for $2 so you can make eight bucks like you're probably better more skilled you're just choosing like a less lucrative game and here's why this is interesting the guy who started industry dive his name Sean he previously was the president of another company called Fierce markets and they did this exact same thing but they did it starting in 2005 or like 2002 and it was literally the same thing but they just did a different like slightly different Industries it had 1.2 million subs and it sold for hundreds of millions of dollars the reason why this is interest interesting interesting is it's the same [ __ ] over and over and over again they just like kind of like have like a dart board of like boring [ __ ] and they just like throw a couple darts and like yeah yeah yeah let's do that one we do one yeah like that's I mean obviously I'm oversimplifying this but it it's incredibly fascinating to me because the bar is so low to be successful yeah one thing I have noticed though like so I agree with you this is uh one of those blueprints that's like a good blue really good blueprints doesn't take like genius doesn't take um a ton of luck and so you know in that sense it's a good good blueprint to go after the downside is now that this is like this game I think was really awesome like over the last 10 years I think over the next 10 years that window is closing the same thing happened at D Toc um the same thing happened at drop shipping the same thing any time the blue anytime the blueprint is easy I think that when a company sells for $500 million doing something there's a bunch ofar sharks like you and I who hear about this go study their their blueprint and you get 15 new like aggressive people who now know how big the prize is for something like this and now have a blueprint to follow all doing the same thing I still think you could win and some somebody will win but it is I would say 10 times harder than it was over the last 10 years in my opinion because you're going to have that set of people this is exactly what's going on in in D Toc which is that cost of acquiring customers are going up why because people realized oh you could just do this with like you know pick a product run this run this Facebook ad blueprint use Shopify use clavio it's like this stack of like I just need to do these six things there's so many more people doing that than this there's so many more people starting deodorant and like jewelry Brands than there are this boring [ __ ] but but for those there's you can have way more right you can have how many jewelry Brands can the market hold it can hold a ton because people are going to have a bunch now if let's say that the industry newsletter a way to find out what's going on in your industry um how many is somebody if I'm in the waste management industry how many of those am I going to read every week I don't know two one or two right probably one or two okay industry dive is one now everybody else is going to fight for two and then if you're not going to go for Waste Management you're going to go for the next best Niche and the next best now industry dive has already done 20 of these niches 30 of these niches themselves um other people are going to keep going for more and more of these niches so you're going to get to the less valuable niches or the ones that are harder to require subscribers for because you're all fighting for that same one or two slots and so um I think that still somebody will win but it is way harder than it was when this when the word wasn't leaked that oh this all these industry newsletters can be that big that's crazy right I think you're I think you you you you're giving people too much credit I think that uh not that many people are going to get involved in this it's just so much cooler when you're 22 to like you know like what's that one kid who sells like sex chocolate like that's just so much more fascinating what's that called tabs tabs chocolate that makes you horny that's so much cooler to like everyone in La than any of this yeah do you get some of that included when you rent the podcast Studio space you're in because it seems like it should just be on the desk in front of you all right let's do another thing um okay so I have one so here's another kind of like what I'll call boring idea hidden in plain sight Aunt Flow have you ever heard of this company Aunt Flow wait is it aunt or Aunt wait you say Aunt I say aunt but it's also a okay whatever all right but I understand thect yeah yeah your mom's sister like I yeah Mom yeah exactly that time of the month it's the slang for that time of the month so what these guys are doing or these gals are do I don't know who's behind it what they do is they go to a school or a company and they say hey uh you know your restrooms need to be a little bit more female friendly here so why don't we install this little like case that's going to dispense tampons um and you know other kind of like female menstrual cycle products any anything that you could think of that goes in that that that category we're going to install this dispenser and now you're just your place is going to be more welcoming for um you know for for for females that that are attending your space so maybe girls at school or University or in your company whatever it is and uh they just made it sexy so they this these kind of hygiene products already exist in bathrooms but they're all like we all know what they look like they're that boring you know silver box that looks like you know if I open this up am I going to get tools or a circuit breaker or like you know an what am I going to get out of this thing it's hard to hard to really say they just made it look good and feel good and like really nice packaging and design and it's like it's like the Tesla of these things that are in the bathroom wall and they're doing great so uh let me pull up their numbers so they have I think 900 um I don't know if I have all these numbers correct but they have 900 um orgs that are that are working with them and basically you pay 300 bucks to install the thing and then you pay like a $1,300 a year for tound refills or pad refills and so that's basically like $99,000 for a school with 20 bathrooms um and and think about that there's just a lot lot of high schools like there there are like you know I don't know 15,000 high schools in the country that's just high schools in the US then you have colleges then you have companies and uh they just made it like a sexy D toy product like the the logo looks cool the Box looks cool and now states are requiring some schools like in California Colorado Michigan that you have to offer products for this um and they do this like you know for every 10 that we sell we donate one to a menator in need like they have like a a whole thing around it it's like kind of crazy our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better I uh last year I was pitched like three different of these when weever we did that vending machine pod I had so many people reach out like I'm doing like smart vending machine things or something like that and and a lot of them were were like either tampons or like hygiene things or or then they were like healthy food right and I looked at all the numbers and most all of them were horrible and the ones that were the best they just sold Coke and M&M's like just like normal like everyone wanted to do this like one particular thing it's like man America just wants coke and M&M's and that like crushed it what what are the numbers on this one on track for 10 million in 2022 uh Revenue uh um so it tripled from last year I don't know when they started uh but they you know now they're doing Princeton University every Apple retail store offices like Google Netflix Disney Twitter quick and Loans four-year contract for all K through 12 girls bathrooms in Utah like why am I not investing in this this is such a defensible business like once you get the contract they're not going to have again they're not going to have two of these at the bathroom and so like if you're the brand that like looks good and you can like Sprint into Market something like this would get I think to like 30 40 50 million in Revenue they raise money I need to chase this down uh yeah they're they're raising money or they're they already you raise some money did you uh you ever seen those dick pills at like the counter at 7-Eleven can't say I had yeah surely you have like it's like a goat it's like toad I forget what it's called I don't go into 7-Eleven I don't leave the house I definitely don't walk into 7-Eleven look they're in these vending machines they like it's like Viagra or something like that it's like some type of like I I actually have no idea what it is but it's like a it's like a herbal supplement and it's like yeah your wife was telling me about this got it keep going you can have that one and uh and uh you ever think who makes those and what are their business meetings like you know what I mean is it just like a bunch of dudes like serving Monster Energy drink like sitting around like you know what I mean have you seen that uh have you seen that m is just done over Xbox Live just like yeah just like we be a serving Mountain Dew and and monster in order to like get this meeting started I've always wondered what those things are like and how you could be proud making that crap this is way better than that it's not the same thing but I I've been thinking a lot about that Define a lot how much have you been thinking about this well like like you know these um uh so we talked about uh milk boys and like the send it thing or what's it called Full send send and so many people reached out to me after that and they go they make money because they're sponsored by this crypto poker thing called Ro what's it called roblet you know talking about rubet yeah and I saw this video where they were talking about it and it does like tens of millions a month in sales like it's just like astronomical just huge and I was thinking I was like that's pretty cool but I think like gambling like I'm okay that it exists but it's just not for me you know it's like what do I always say like uh cornrow and sleeve tattoos it's cool that other people have it not for me and by the way that's catching on I did a meeting with somebody and they I was like oh nice tat they go yeah you know what Sam says cornrow and sleep tattoos it's not for him but it's he's glad some like wow I I I respect its right to exist but you know it ain't for me but these like these these businesses that do like let's say gambling I'm like that's kind of like it's most likely a little bit Shady it's definitely not legal in America but there's definitely it's related to shadiness like it's in the same family and I just wouldn't be proud doing that on a I wouldn't be proud doing that on a daily basis you know what I mean right and that's what I think this as somebody who spends a lot of time gambling uh and has you know did I ever tell you in college how we used to drive from North Carolina where I went to school down to South Carolina a three-hour drive then we would board a riverboat casino that would that would sail into international waters turn off the engines and then let us gamble for four hours and then it would drive back and that's what I was doing as like a 20-year-old and like L you know I was playing poker once and the guy next to me either fell asleep or died and I was like oh my God like what am I doing here why am I hanging out with these low Lives who are this guy's like this guy you know like those people whose Nails go so long they start to like cork screw like this guy looked like that and I was like this guy has moved off this boat in like a century and I shouldn't be here but uh couldn't resist sleep or dead I don't know I just left the table I was like I don't I'm not going to tap this guy and find out it's like Schrodinger's box is the cat dead or not I I didn't want to know so so I just left but uh yeah lost a bunch of money doing that so I don't know I like gambling I think it's cool but also for sure like it's not a business I would start because I feel like I don't want to start things where the end is me and a Netflix documentary it's like what is the percent chance I have to like be on the run at some point in this business venture I don't really want to flee the country uh I'm not looking to like you know find out that like you know we have a huge amount of like you know child pornography or you know you know money laundering on my my app it's like dude I'm not here for the stress like I'm not I'm not trying to do all that and I don't need to make like a trillion dollars in a year doing this like the state guys I I I told the story about them on the Pod they do like 40 million a week in Revenue no way they issued I I think a is that what's that like net revenue versus gross this is their take um they did eight I heard they did a $800 million dividend to their because they can't sell the business so I heard that they distributed like $800 million and this could be to this could be wrong but I don't think it's wrong by like more than 30% so so that's pretty crazy these these things this guys these guys are printing cash these are the guys who bought that like they didn't know who was behind it until some guy like a $36 million home yeah and they were like how did this 26-year-old afford this and they're like oh where's the source of your wealth he's like I own stake.com did people just B corre did people just message you about what and they told you that number whenever we talk about any of this crap I so many M my same friend who told me yeah my same friend who told me about them in the first place when I featured them on here he was telling me about like you know their dividend and stuff like that rubet is also big yeah these these things are really big basically it's an online casino and so like you take one of the best business models in the world a casino and you strip away the biggest costs of it which are like you know the the building the giant building and having all this Labor uh because all the games are digital and there's the the casino is digital and now all you have left is the marketing cost to acquire customers and you can acquire customers from around the globe in their bedroom and they don't have to like fly to Vegas to do it right it's a kind of an amazing model and like it's pretty obvious why it's why it's huge but yeah you you know it's not for everybody um all right what do you got okay I got I got another one um I got a framework and then I have actually I got two Frameworks I got one framework for I got a quick one and a long one I'll do the quick one first I realized this the other day I was like um some yeah Brian Brian Armstrong the founder of coinbase went on Lex Freeman's podcast Le was like so like what is what is your startup advice what is your advice for starting a startup it's like it's one of those questions that as you know as an entrepreneur you kind of hate because you're like well it's like saying you know like what is a good life um so but he gave an answer he he kind of broke it down he's well there's like there's like two separate eras pre-product Market fit and post and I was like that's I agree with that 100% like the things the way life is pre and post is like important but like then okay so for Lex you got to Define like what does product Market fit and like it's kind of hard to Define product Market fit I don't know how you felt it for the hustle cuz you kind of went from events to like I flashy blog posts to the newsletter you don't think the newsletter had it I mean we got to we have 2.5 million people a day reading so like I guess that there there's definitely something there but like people when my friends talk about it they're like oh man it just started working like it never felt like it it felt like a slog the whole time it never felt like things were just working I mean do you feel that way with the milk Road it just seems like like it I guess maybe technically there's e exponential growth because it's growing like two or 300% a year but it it wasn't like I can't keep up you know what I mean right yeah so I I'll tell you the Frameworks I've heard about this so one is uh EMT who's the founder of twitch he said this once and I I was like oh that sounds right he goes in a startup there's a big period where it just feels like you're pushing a giant boulder up a hill and you're pushing and you're pushing and you're pushing he's like and then there is a point if it works where all of a sudden you're not pushing anymore the bowler starts to roll down the other side of the hill and now you have the opposite problem you're running chasing to try to catch up with it um because it's rolling faster than you can keep up with and uh this is what other people say too like you know your customers are like demanding you know you can't you basically you run out of inventory people it's flying off the shelves like these are the phrases people use to describe this feeling it's where it starts to feel like the market is pulling you rather than pushing and so I heard that I've experienced a little bit with our D Toc brand where we would but it's not like it's not like this magical Eden where it never feels that way it never feels hard again like that's kind of how it sounds in my head it's like oh at some point I'll stop pushing and it'll start like rolling by itself and I'll have to run and chase it it's like it's kind of like starts and stops of that it's more like like a mountain range where the you go up and then down and then you climb the next Mountain it's a little higher then down then the next mountain and down like that's how it feels like so for example with with the with their e-commerce company um okay getting the product made and getting it to Market and getting people to First hear about our brand that was pushing the boulder up but then literally as soon as it like I remember it went viral in like a Facebook group people started sharing it and like enthusiasts of that category they started sharing it and so we all of a sudden I remember like the third day we did like $3,000 in sales without like spending anything on marketing and I was like where did that come from that was awesome I didn't do anything and like people started buying it and by our second month we ran out of inventory um and we had a we had a full our third month our sales sucked cuz we just had no inventory so that was like what it felt like to pull but then to get the business to grow even more well that's you know like that magic you know sort of slowed down and sure people were still telling their friends but I wanted to hit a bigger goal so now I had to push again so it's been kind of starts and stops with milk Road I I feel like the growth is pushing the boulder up a hill but then I look at some numbers like the number of organic people who like people who join because they got referred the thing it's like a really healthy percentage I'm like okay so that means people are liking it if they're sharing with Friends and um the feedback like the replies we get are not just like oh that was a good one today it's like they like they're using our own language and sense of humor it's like they want to be friends with us they're like they're like oh you know the milk was so hot this morning it turned into butter and like you know it's like who said who like goes into a product uses it that day and then comes up with a funny review just cuz you kind of want to be boys with the people who are making it like that's that shows that they really care some way and we get like hundreds of those a day so so that shows me it's working but still to grow and fill the revenue slots like that feels like a SLO like that doesn't feel easy that feels like very very difficult so um so yeah I don't have a good answer I've seen it firsthand with two different people so the first is I used to share this office uh called Founders Dojo you know you it was uh Dave gr blad and a bunch of us when I was starting the company uh the hustle and there was these two guys that were like the most stereotypical like Sil Valley nerds it was like a skinny Indian dude and then this white guy that looked like this jock he was like really good-looking jock but he was like the dorkiest dude ever and they were partners and it was a hilarious com combination and they created this technology that would basically I have no idea why they wanted to create this technology honestly kind of pointless but basically it would crawl the internet and it would find the most shared and most popular HD gifs gifs whatever on the internet that day and they they built this thing and then they would spend hours making the search so if you just typed in one letter it would autofill with like things that you could search like gifs like if you typed in like the word c it would autofill it cats and then like the search would just pop up and I remember we'd be like staring at the computer with them just saying like look how much faster it is and it was like you can't even tell like you know how much faster it was from the previous time but they like nerded out over this and they launched this thing and it did okay it did okay it did okay and then one day we get into the office and they've stayed there all night and they like slept underneath the table that their desk I remember and I remember like Dave had bought them pizza because like they were working the whole time and we were like what's going on Raj like why is this why is this happening and their website was called the worst drug which is pretty hilarious it's called the worst drug. TV I think basically some porn guys got a hold of it and the it like they he they somehow I don't know how it worked but the most shared gifts on the web are almost all porn and so they like disabled like the safe for work feature and it was all porn and we get to the office and they had this fancy setup like this a huge Monitor and it was the highest DEA porn you I've ever seen and you click like space and it would autofill with like a new porn drift and and like at firstly I used this by the way I remember seeing it it went viral like in 2014 or something it was like somebody shared it in our IRC they're like this is a crazy website and it was like full screen HD immediate like porn and you're like whoa and you touch any key and it just reloads another one instantaneously it was like whoa what's going on it was like Tik Tok before Tik Tok so basically there was like eight of us GA eight eight guys and like we were gathered around this computer and at first we were like shocked it was like hardcore porn like shock shocking porn that would go viral or like like people like click on and like the whole porn thing we got past it and then we were like wow that's really high deaf look at that like oh if you click space like it really it loads so fast and there was just eight of us like gather around us and Tim westeren see the hair on his thigh yeah it was crazy it was disgusting and Tim westeren and his assistant I forget her name but they I was supposed to interview them in preparation because they were speaking at hustle con and I told them to come to the office and they walked into the office of Pandora yeah the founder of Pandora they walk into the office and there's eight of us gathered around this screen just like staring intensely at this porn like wow good good job Raj like what do you type in see it really autofills like really quickly like you know like this is amazing and they walk in and they like oh hey what's going on you guys want to see something check out this techn like it was and they had uh like millions of people a day coming to the website overnight and they slept there at the office for weeks trying to like you know do something with the server to keep up with the traffic and like increase the speed just a little bit and eventually something happened where like someone in Romania offered to buy it they flew there and it turns out that it was like some gangsters and then they like all had like guns on them and they came back and it was like a whole whole ordeal but that's the one time that I really saw product Market fit work so I've heard stories like that like uh when Instagram launched it was kind of the same thing they like they launched it they put it out in the wild you know first hour was pretty slow or whatever the guys kind of go to sleep they wake up and like or like not even they go to sleep it was like late at night and it was early in the morning in Japan and the app had started to go viral in Japan and so they were like dude what are all these like why are there all pictures of tea and it's like oh this is in Japan people are having tea in the morning and they're taking Instagram pictures of it and they had like 25,000 people downloaded that first or second day and uh the server is like you know basically melting and like pretty quickly the only problem became how do we get more server capacity it's like oh you you stop thinking about features you stop thinking about the logo you stop thinking about names you stop thinking about hiring it's like all I think about is like how do I add more servers and so actually I started to realize that there's this there's a test the simplest test to product Market fit because people have tried to come up with these tests before in fact um there's a kind of famous Silicon Valley one which is you survey your users um this thing which is if our product went away if you could no longer use our product how would you feel very disappointed somewhat disappointed or not disappointed and the idea was if 40% or more say very disappointed you have product Market fit sounds good in theory it's sort of like likey you way to this myal and Mar Andre said this thing he goesit is like sex if you if you're asking if you have it you're not having it and like you know I think that's more real uh which is like there isn't this 40% survey number you can't survey your way to finding out you'll know because it kind of hits you like a punch in the face and so what I've seen is that the people who really have it like their thing is going to go supernova they only care about two things those two things are if it's a tech product hiring more servers and if it's any kind of product hiring cust customer support people and anytime I meet a Founder now who's like yeah dude I just really need you know any good like customer support people like where do I find more support people or like hey do you know how I can get like AWS credits I'm like running up a crazy Bill I'm like um let me invest first and then also yes let me help you with that because I know when that happens that is the almost the truest sign of product Market fit it is the survey you don't need to go do with your customers when a Founder stops thinking about features stops thinking about like future plans and marketing and you know company culture and everything else and they're like dude the [ __ ] is melting so I asked Michael bur who was my my former boss and then became my investor at my uh idea lab and you know Michael basically sold bio for $850 million and I wanted to know like and he had struggled before that for three three and a half years to like make something work and so I asked him I was like you know what was it like kind of before before and like you know when the Turning Point happened like did you were you just feeling like so good once it's once it clearly started to work he was like Well he kind of described the boulder pushing up the hill thing he's like well before when I was like I quit my job we had two kids and a third on the way we had mortgaged our house and like I had told my wife give me 6 months to try this and now I was 3 years in and I still hadn't figured out anything that worked but I felt like I was getting closer and closer he's like that was hard I felt like I was pushing the B up the hill then with bio we like I finally put together all the pieces I knew that social networking was a good product to like a good category like this before Facebook like I knew that social networking was going to be big people were going to talk to other people on the internet they were going to have profiles and comment on each other's pages I just felt like that was true and then I knew how to grow it which was like these viral like kind of fill in your profile quizzes and share it with your friends I knew how to grow it and like so I I I launched the thing he goes in N9 days we hadit a million users and he's like back then a million users was like so huge on the internet he's like he's like you know N9 Days Later none of them came back I had a retention problem but he's like I knew that I had like something that could light fire so I turned it off I started working on the retention to like give you a reason to come back every day he's like I knew this is going to work he's like and then then when it worked he's like I didn't feel like this immense Joy like yay I finally overcame it he's like I felt even more pressure he's like dude now this is act you finally did it don't don't F this up like this can actually be valuable don't mess this up he's like that became a whole new level of pressure and like burden that I felt and he's like I worked so hard and I think after they sold like what four years in or something like that I think he had like major heart surgery like 5 months later because he had been like so working so hard and under so much stress and pressure that whole time I'm sure that could contribute to something like that but when he described that I was like okay so I've never felt that like I've never felt anything that you just described that means I've never felt the like the violent version of product Market fit when that like a billion dollar company feels so what did Brian say uh he didn't say what it feels he didn't Define it as much he was just he had said basically some something along the lines of you know um you know you're making something that people want and um you know that you know there's like you know whatever true demand for you say something sort of general like that but I've been thinking about how do you know because that's so General that you're going to be optimistic and think you have it when you're don't cuz God it would feel so good to have it and man it really sucks to not have it so you're always kind of like squinting and looking for these like this evidence and what Brian said was he goes act he goes my lucky thing was that I wasn't a big analyzer or a big thinker I was just like action produces information so I would just do a thing and I'd it produce some information like oh people want this or they don't want this or they want it but there's something wrong with it um like the the the bbo thing where oh they it grew but they didn't stick around okay but that produced information that first nine days produced a lot of information and so he's like but okay I built this wrong but now I know what's wrong with it so let me do another round and like he's like actual produces information so as a Founder like just focus on the action part and like it'll either hit for you or or it won't but like action is really the only way you're going to get to it and like you know Smart Action meaning you take action then you sort of like accurately assess what's working and what's not so that you're not taking blind action have you ever thought about the logistics of that though so coinbase uh there was this article a couple years ago written about them and when they were when I think in 18 or 19 when like the first cycle was happening and they're saying how like they've torn down walls at their office like just because they don't have enough space and like they they people needed to be in the same room to like shout at one another and then they're like we're also just taking meetings uh in the park I I forget where their office was but it was weird near where you and I lived in San Francisco and they' be like yeah we're taking meetings in the park because there's just physically not enough space and if you think about the logistics of it you basically have this idea and this small thing in 2015 or 16 or whatever and so right now they're at I think 4,000 employees which means they've probably hired 6 or 7,000 if you count for turnover and if there's you know 360 days in a year or whatever it is 350 days a year that's like B you're basically adding 10 to 20 people a day in headcount every single day for three years it's pretty wild that's wild right in order to add 10 or 30 people a day or whatever you and that's not even like that much compared to like a Facebook or Google but like the that means that you got to talk to five times 10 times more yeah yeah it's he says that in the thing he goes we have I think he said 3,000 people now he goes but and I he's like I personally I think was involved in the hiring of maybe the first like I forgot what he said like 300 or 500 he's like but then to hire those 300 500 I had to talk to maybe three or 5 thousand people so he's like so I've done a lot of interviewing now and I have a good idea like I like the interview he's like I got totally burnt out from it if you just think like all right how are we going to get everyone a laptop or um how do we like make sure everything breaks everything breaks it's crazy have you ever experienced that firsthand not that but I I've heard sto again I've heard stories and that's how I know I didn't have product even when I thought I had it and growth is happening I've only ever felt it one time with blab when our servers kept melting down and was during a period where we went from about zero to 2 million users in like a six-month period and like we just kept like our vendors servers were going down then we're like [ __ ] what do we do like dude you how is talkbox going down how is cloud flare you know going down what what's going on here like it was like and we were also getting dos attacked and [ __ ] like that but but basically yeah was that's the only time I've sort of felt it but that was like you know a very brief window of time the there's this guy Dan Rose I don't know if you follow him on Twitter he was like a very like number three number three guyb something he was very early at Amazon maybe like first 50 or 100 people uh I was guess something like that but it was early early days like he was around when the doc bust happened right so 99 2000 2001 time period Then he went to Facebook and he was he ended up being like the number three guy at Facebook behind Zuck and Cheryl and um so anyways he shares these War Stories from the from back day and he says these things that again you don't feel unless you're building one of these like you know Thunder lizard type companies that are just like these Godzillas and he's like yeah at Amazon he's like we used to just do meetings in the stairwell because there was just no like we ran out of desk space we were we started putting two people at every desk that didn't even work I was just working out of a stairwell for like a three-month period I like just imagine like he's like yeah I just took my laptop I just sat there on the top stair and I was just like somebody would be walking by be like hey hey uh for that thing we're launching tomorrow like hey can weit and I just walk with him down the stairs while we talk and that was our meeting and so he shares these stories about like what it was like his Twitter follow his Twitter is is a good follow for sure did I ever tell you uh did I ever tell you about the Airbnb cafeteria no so uh when Sarah my wife works there and I used to go to the office because my office was right next door to it for dinner time all the time basically they had this beautiful office and every office or meeting room is made to look like a popular Airbnb like you know thing you could rent and it's like this beautiful office you know Brian and Joe they're like designers so and everything like in their office looks exactly like that and their cafeteria can you know seat three or feed 3,000 people or whatever however many people they have there and their whole stick was every single item was made there at the office so the Red Bull they had like Airbnb bull the ketchup the mayonnaise made right there the trail mix like they made they they made everything 100% except for the beer I think that's the only thing that they didn't make but besides that if you consumed it like they didn't have Doritos you couldn't get a Coke in that office it was all made right there on the spot and I remember thinking like this company just that in itself is like a pretty amazing feet and that's not even close to being like their thing you know what I mean yeah yeah that's exactly that's like that's not that's not their thing is logistics you know that's their version of of lunch table sticks to get people to work there and I remember like thinking like how on Earth do you pull that off cuz like just literally 5 years ago or maybe three years ago I had interviewed there and it was 200 people and it was like an okay office but it it that that alone I remember seeing that and I was like this is just amazing this is this is absolutely ridiculous dude I had the same experience I went to um zinga's office back when zingo was like you know still Airbnb used to share an office with them I Believe by the way I went to that Zing office as well and that office is crazy first you walk in and there's like a tunnel to enter like you remember that tunnel the light the lit up tunnel so it's like you walk in it's an LED tunnel so you feel like you're entering a special you feel like you're entering a spaceship of some kind or like you know you're walking out into a stadium and then there's just dogs everywhere I was like oh well do people have allergies here how's this allow it's like oh yeah I don't know we're just it's like this free free land and I met uh we met the chef this guy Matt um Matthew I think is that D Trumble was was his name just sounds like a chef name and so he was like yeah let me give you a tour and so he was the one who brought us into the office I was like okay uh he's like yeah I'll give you like the kitchen tour and I was like okay cool this will take like you know two minutes and then we'll go see the other thing and like the kitchen tour took an hour because it was the exact same thing he goes he goes so this is our staff he goes everything that you eat here is made on premise and I was like okay he's like see that like I was like you guys have like a he's like you want anything to drink I was like yeah I'll take like a sparkling water or whatever he's like cool it's on tap here and it was their fizzy water I was like you make your own fizzy water he's like yeah we make our own seltzers ciders beers they made everything he's like um yeah this like you know this salad here like we grow all the the like we have a micro Farm on the roof that's crazy and so like this mushroom was grown here this like arugula is grown here it's all a circular system I was like what and then he's like um I was like but what about the you don't have like animals for like a you know uh he's like no no no we do get animals but we get the full animal so he opens up the walk-in fridge and there's just cow cows hanging upside down full cows and I was like what is this and he's like yeah we break down the entire carcass and we like you know use every bit of it for our things I was like you and what army dude he's like oh we have 45 people and our Chef executive I'm the executive chef and we have 45 people on our team I was like you have I don't have 45 people in my company you have 45 people on the lunch team and I was like this is just absurd it was insane and I was like wow the arms race for like you know pampering tech tech things and like building this like culture of you're building something special was you know kind of amazing to be honest it it was really amazing I I I was blown away by that I have cows on my at my Ranch on my Airbnb property and I've we have like 18 of them or something like that and I've and you know they butcher them so they like every year they send away like four or five and then I see the new ones being born and I thought it'd be cool to get a freezer out there and you like paid 20 bucks and you could get a steak and be like yeah this cow is you know like the mother of the one that you see right in front of the off like like on the you know because you could sit on the porch and like watch the cows come up to that's too sad for me and uh it was too sad for me I couldn't do it I need like distance from it I need to like I ignorance is bliss for me when when it comes to eating meat yeah I didn't end up doing it cuz I was like this is just TMI can't handle it because I like I see these guys playing and I get to know them and they get to know me and I was like oh [ __ ] right I'm not nearly as tough as I thought I know all right should we wrap it or because there like are you uh paying by the minute now uh your search charge here your your studio cuz I'm free here in my studio um yeah well uh you know Ben's still getting used to like the logistics of this so uh I'll just leave it at that but I think I think our our time is up what do you think do you are are you inspired now to look better or you just still don't give a [ __ ] I am very inspired the inspiration isn't the problem the uh the uh skill to do it is the problem to like upgrade my own space's gonna give it's gonna like do it do you use that room for anything I use it for for this and my wife works out of here too so but but we can use it for however we want it's an office though right it's like well like just like it'll look like a CNN Newsroom just have her in the background like working like it it'll look fine just make it look a little pretty they'll put some of this crap on there dude send them I'm open to it the door's open ring the doorbell all right well I guess that's a pod we'll see if this uh actually changes anything but it might [Music]

here is how i set goals so that i can actually hit them and this is coming from some guy who is you know frankly pretty lazy and um you know i don't um i'm not like you like i'm not like oh i need to lose weight i must have a 500 calorie deficit therefore it is done i will now like you know track this thing that always felt like too much work to me but let me tell you what does work for me um by the way the exact opposite it's less work to do it that way because then you don't think you just like do you just do what you're supposed to do classic thing that somebody who has discipline and willpower says like oh it's easier to just do it right the first time yeah we know bro if we if we know that that's true we just don't live life that way like it's okay you know i i speak from the procrastinators perspective [Music] all right you want to tell us about this game or what well first of all i think we need to spice up the intro i think the intro needs to be like right now we're just casual with it we just come on like it's just a conversation and people love that they love the authenticity but you know what you know what works when you become a cheese ball and you just start performing and making a show and you give a proper intro you do all the things this is my first million the podcast that has two future trillionaires that come at you oh by the way did you see this guy who went on linkedin and then quoted the manifest cowboys thing wait whoa what happened i tagged you in it some guy was talk he's telling the story oh bro i'm going ham on linkedin right now like what do you mean like trying to get pocket i told you i hired that content remixer guy brandon and so brandon's been amazing what he does he just takes my old good tweets he posts them on linkedin and people on linkedin bro it's a gun to a knife fight they're like wow incredible content this is wow what a conversation this is stimulating because you know linkedin is like the most boring content farm generically right so like i've been over here fighting on twitter against like you know [ __ ] professional tweeters who are researching eight hours a day and like creating these like epic threads and you know i just come off the dome bro like you know i i i'm that painting at the top of the sistine chapel i'm just off the top and now i bring that to linkedin and it's a whole new it's a habanero pepper for them and so it's a ghost pepper it's the last wing on hot ones and they don't know what to do with it and so this guy's been posting so i just get to check the um the notifications and i'll be like oh [ __ ] he posted that thing from like a year ago that i said and people on linkedin are loving it but today it's getting popular yeah i think i added like i don't know a thousand followers this week or something like that dude by the way i i knew this woman named candice you maybe knew her too and she was an entrepreneur and she owned a bikini company and she was like you know what i'm just gonna start this in 2015-16-17 she goes i'm going to start posting like stories about our bikini business and like you know how things are going and so it like like new product updates whatever and it was all like you know hot ladies and bikinis you know like right like what the algorithm it went crazy it broke people's braid and she eventually got banned and she obviously did the right thing of like making a public fuss about it like what i'm just talking about my business what's wrong with this this is professional content i sell bikinis i've got it so it worked awesomely for her and so i think that if you have a business that is like uh related to something like you know like that you could kill it on like it but anyway so you're crushing it on linkedin right now yeah so this guy yeah this guy thomas angel give him a shout out he um he posted he goes it says quote i don't do business i manifest hashtag mfm and then he goes uh sprouts farmer's market was number one on our vision board when we launched our everything latte at altitude functional beverages i guess that's his company altitude functional beverages so he goes after 13 months we're now in 10 stores blah blah blah we're great we're great we're great and he goes thank you to the ogs hashtag manifest cowboys and then he tagged us and i totally forgot you had said that on the last spot and i was like wow that is incredible manifest cowboys is one of your top five uh little creations and like i just feel like we need to go all in on the only podcast featuring two trillionaires the manifest cowboys the men who never age haven't seen a wrinkle in my life same body fat as your milk two percent like that's how we need to go and then we say hey itunes play that back 15 go back 15 seconds play that again did you pick up that two percent nonsense that's beautiful again off the top i told you i'm good early in the morning we just we moved our podcast to an early morning recording and i just have like an extra 10 percent juice early in the morning where i'm a little crazy yeah i just roll out of bed and these are the thoughts in my head yeah dude you're like a rapper right now you keep rhyming i like this i saw this hilarious clip of um it's actually my favorite form of marketing is you take a clip from something else so you've seen this one where it's a bar and they're what the whole bar is watching something on a big screen and it's like the the original clip was like from the world cup and like the guy scores a goal but something on there yeah you just put whatever on there right like i'll put like the milk road the milk road like shows up in your inbox like you know the email pops up and then the crowd just goes crazy and so i saw a version of that somebody did it with joe rogan it's joe rogan talking to somebody and he's like have you seen this i thought the guy's like no he's like pull that up and then they just replace it with this tick tock of this young chubby white boy rapping and he's really horrible but it's hilarious and he's like dancing and rapping at the same time and joe's like god how do they do it and like they show the reaction but they've spliced it together and uh i saw one of those and so that just really you know made my morning i spent so many hours in the morning and at night just scrolling through instagram and tic toc and just laughing constantly at all these just young people are so funny now i don't think when i was younger and like that age doing stuff like this no one was this funny like the amount of funny people is it's it's way higher now me and my sister we said each other maybe she says me like 25 tick tocks a day i sent back maybe 10. and like the caption on each one isn't like it's not like oh you got to watch this oh this is really funny or uh that's so true it's every every like seven lines she's just like people are too good like how would how are they so talented like because tick tock is the greatest talent show ever created it's america's funniest home video every hour on the hour right it's like it is this giant talent show and when you watch it you're like i am nothing compared to these people the dirt on their shoe they scrape me off before they walk into their house like you feel so dumb um and i just like i can't i don't understand how they come up with these how they film them like where the where the inspiration comes from it's too good it's so good and the subreddit the fighter and the kid that you and i like just like the commenters are so funny it's like every every top comic it's like one of the best jokes done by a comedian that i like you know what i mean like it's like that's how high caliber it is i just and it's almost like the way that i describe it it's like it doesn't matter if you're into the outdoors or not when you see a big mountain you're like oh wow that's epic you know like you appreciate the epicness that's how i feel like when i watch tick-tock i'm like i don't even like this thing that they're talking about but how on earth did someone come up with this and it's just that over and over and over again and i'm in awe i mean all constantly yeah people talk about how uh these things are a waste of time uh i don't know what their tick tock feed is like my tate tuck feed is incredible it is the most entertainment per second i've ever experienced in my life it is funny it is like insightful i'll learn stuff all the time little life hacks how stuff works uh watching a tick tock about like you know how a farmer like you know farm squash i'm like oh i didn't know that right like i'm just learning stuff that i didn't even know i wanted to know because i would never click the youtube video but bro if i go on youtube now it's like you know you know when you go to a city and they're like uh you know there's like by the tourist destination they're like oh you want to get on this horse carriage you know big for a funny picture and like you know it's a romantic date and you gotta like do this old slow uncomfortable thing because i might as well you know i got to do something different life's too good now that's how i feel when i go on youtube like i'm getting back on the horse carriage after i've experienced like an f1 car and i don't know how youtube's gonna survive dude speaking of like this type of stuff speaking of like uh uh entertainment and like doing epic [ __ ] i'm reading this book about this woman named ellsbeth ellspeth beard that's an interesting name and in 1979 or 1980 i think she was 22 years old and she just like says [ __ ] it i'm gonna ride my motorcycle around the country or sorry around the world around the globe so like you like get on a ship and go to america right all across america get on a ship on the other side go to whichever continent is on the other side of your office yeah is this your pen name dude i did it across america which is soft that's soft like there's a mcdonald's every 50 miles you know she did it like in iran and [ __ ] you know what i mean like like there's levels to this game and she did it in 1979 and so like she was like we couldn't even get maps but anyway i was reading it and i was like i'm such a [ __ ] like why why don't we live more do we do we need to live more epic adventurous lives she did this thing at age 22 and now she's like 65 she's still giving talks on about it and making money because we are all so weak and we refuse to do like these interesting it's not that hard nowadays to ride a motorcycle across the world it's not that hard you take six months you buy a 20 000 b w it ain't gonna break you use your iphone it ain't hard but i just a thought it was interesting that she did this thing at age 22. it's kind of like whenever i like see people like um whenever i see like the rolling stones perform i'm like this motherfucker's 80 years old and he's playing a song that he wrote when he was 18. that's longevity that's good that and that's kind of what she's doing so i'm like amazed that you could do one thing at a young age and live off of it forever and b we're soft man we got to do more epic stuff like we're just sitting in our houses all the time doing this lame stuff all the time we gotta we gotta be more adventurous right what would you do i've always wanted to walk across america so i would do that i've already ridden my motorcycle across america i've driven across america a bunch of times i think i could drive my motorcycle across what was genuinely hard so not like um it sounds hard but what genuinely was hard i um with with riding a motorcycle across the country it wasn't just in general other stuff you've done anything you've done what's the actual thing that you've like that's been really hard doing an iron man that was like legitimately hard like i felt pain i think it'd be fun like ride a bicycle or something like that across america and i think that would be genuinely tough like physically and emotionally tough i did an iron man and that was like legitimately hard i felt like i was in pain for almost the entire time it sucked dude so uh ramon and suli there they texted me ramon was like guys we gotta do this iron man in hawaii an idiot i'm signing us up and like he caught me when i was in that when i had that trillionaire two percent body fat energy and i just two words all caps i'm in did you really say that he literally didn't even know how to ride a bike no he was typing his speech bubbles and i just i just responded i go i go ramon say no more and then he stopped typing in the imessage okay three hours he booked it he booked it didn't it three hours pass yeah he starts sending me like pdf ticket reservations he starts sending me stuff i'm like and i now realize what i have done and i realized your boy's not as hard as he thinks he's not as tough as he thinks he's not as in as he thought he was in and do you even know how to swim have you ever swam before i have a 15-foot pool and i can swim in it but i've never it's like a one-mile free like an ocean freestyle swim just to start the race and so i go and so i then i had to backtrack so i just came quick i go hey i've seen the first one but can't wait for the second one like a what iron man right that's what we're talking about the movie he goes no bro you're not getting out of this no i am and then he's that's i didn't have any reason and then he's so then every day he's been texting me like hey here's this cool link to how to train and i'm like i'm not opening that link because if i open that link there's no if i know what it's what it entails there's no way i'm gonna do that so i was guilty to do this by him and i trained for six months and i did pretty good i did all right and he got last and you're very very fit and you're saying it's hard if i trade it was the hardest for a year i would not be as fit as you were before you trained for your ironman i would be the before photo and so it doesn't make sense and so then i just told him i go if i don't talk to you anymore i don't have to do it and so i'm just not responding to it and we'll see if this just for the listener so they know how stupid like it was like the three stooges we went down there and i trained i i i was a division athlete i trained i did fine i was great but they and i hired a coach i did everything the right way these freaking idiots who we went with they bought they bought the bike the day before when they were down there and like then the night before you set your bike up at the place and they leave it there and silly and ramon were like hey so how do we use those pedals with that attached to your feet we bought them how do we use them they were like setting it up there and zuli this other guy who we went with he did the swim he did the entire thing in backstroke because he didn't know how to swim with his head underneath the water and they assigned a kayaker lifeguard to him because they were so afraid that he was going to drown i swear to god and but he finished oh he did it of all the 9 000 people there i'm not exaggerating they got literally last place last and so like 9 000. and they were miserable and the next day they're like this is sick bro you won't do it again it was the craziest [ __ ] on earth these guys are idiots they also asked me if i was if i wanted to go climb mount kilimanjaro with them and i was like no no i'm out no i do not want to do that yeah the problem is they're like i don't know seven to ten years older than us so they're like in a midlife crisis and we're getting dragged into their midlife fighting against father time uh you know thing and now we are doing these things as well yo so actually this is a topic i wanted to talk about which is how to set goals i think you had something on your thing about i wrote something about that yeah so let's talk about this so i don't know what you wanted to do but i had this idea of what is your approach to setting and hitting goals is that what you were going to say yeah well let me like go on a little rant here so i've been doing this thing called intro you know that intro thing like you just like talk to people and it's actually really fun that's why i do i do it from friday at 5 00 p.m to 7 p.m two hours so if they just turned off the money you'd do it because it's so fun no i am doing it because it's fun and i get paid uh 2 000 an hour obscene amounts of money yeah so both it is it is it's fun money envelope money um and i've been doing this and a question that i ask people constantly and they never rarely have answers to and they act like i'm like profound for asking this i'm like dude this is like table stakes which is what does success look like in five years like specifically like if this is a money thing like how much money do you want how much revenue how many users whatever and what i've learned and then i've been working with some family members and they're like want to get their finances in order and i'm like all right well how much do you spend every month how much do you want to spend every month and then let's work back for how much income you think you need and i think the vast majority of people they don't write [ __ ] down and so i did this one intro call with this guy and i was like hey so here's this app that i used for a long time it's called my weekly budget you just every time you spend a cent just write it down and just do it for uh four weeks and then just look back at how much you spend and like oh i never thought about that and he messaged me and he goes i've been writing this down for like two weeks i had no idea i was spending this and that and this i've been saving thousands of dollars now that i know and i do the same thing with weight loss i say i want to weigh this much weight therefore i have to burn i can only eat 2100 calories and i'm just gonna write down whatever i eat um just writing things down both goals as well as like the things that you're doing so you kind of like have an idea is the easiest way to get to where you want to go without really changing a significant amount of your behavior you have you ever noticed that i have noticed that yes and i do that i think i think a lot of people think they do that but let me go into a little more detail on some some stuff i do that i think is maybe a little bit different all right so i'm going to give you a couple bullet points here is how i set goals so that i can actually hit them and this is coming from some guy who is you know frankly pretty lazy and um you know i don't um i'm not like you like i'm not like oh i need to lose weight i must have a 500 calorie deficit therefore it is done i will now like you know track this thing that always felt like too much work to me but let me tell you what does work for me um by the way we're seeing the exact opposite it's less work to do it that way because then you don't think you just like do you just do what you're supposed to do classic thing that somebody who has discipline and willpower says like oh it's easier to just do it right the first time yeah we know bro if we and we know that that's true we just don't live life that way like it's okay you know i i speak from the procrastinators perspective all right so here are some things that i do that do work for me first is you tell me if you do this or not i set picture goals or movie scene goals not just written goals so for example uh sometimes it's hard for me to figure out like let's say it's a financial goal okay how much money do i want and when and then i kind of like i'll pick a number is that too high is that too low and i got to make it real in some way so sometimes what i'll do is if it's a number goal i'll do the math to add it up i'll be like okay here's how i want to live i want to spend this this this and this what does that actually come out to and i'll go bottoms up to create the goal or i'll just simplify it i'll be like i don't know numbers and logic is a little too hard to understand i'll go on zillow and i'll just find the picture of the house i want i'll be like this this is my goal and i can just look at that picture of that house and it has a whole feeling and a whole like set of assumptions that if i was living in that house like life is pretty good that is my motivating goal like i'm more motivated by a picture or a little movie scene in my head than i am by just this like kind of written text that it requires my brain to do a bunch of like work to try to like make life out of this text yeah i do it yeah i guess i just described a vision board okay cool so yeah that's the first thing pinterest yeah great idea yeah all right it's like an uber but yeah okay let's keep going second thing i do floor goals and ceiling goals so i don't set one goal i set a range the floor goal that i'll set for any project is like all right at a minimum this is like the minimum that it would take for it to feel like a win and so i just would write that down i'll be like all right this is the minimum goal and beca and what was happening was normally i was writing a goal then i'd be like kind of beating myself up like i'm not ambitious enough so i need to set up more audacious goals so i set a bigger or bigger bigger hole and then i would like you know inevitably like sort of under deliver on that and now i'd have to like basically i'd either be disappointed because i didn't reach my like super ambitious goal but still clearly a good thing happened or i would have my super ambitious goal and secretly in my head i'd have like my backup goal that like i wouldn't tell anybody because it wasn't so cool but like i knew logically that that was good so then i just started writing it down here's the floor here's the ceiling ceiling is the the f yeah like what would make me say yeah that really worked out um and so like uh i'll give you an example i'll give you an example after this but all right floor in a ceiling goal that's the next one do you do anything like that like a range no but that's a good idea i just no i just like put the maybe i kind of do i say here's what i think will happen but then i say in the best case scenario i think this might happen but i'm not expecting that right that's how i started this podcast i was like the floor goal is if i just invite a bunch of cool guests on well i'll probably like if i do one of these a week 52 guests let's say half of them are cool let's say half of those cool people become kind of like buddies or friends or you know we like each other cool so i'll make like maybe 12 15 new friends that are like kind of heavy hitters enough where i could invite them on a podcast i was like that's a win that alone is a win it's enough to like do this do this podcast for for you know once a week and so that was my floor goal my ceiling goal was well what if people actually listen to this wouldn't that be sweet if people would you know on their commutes and they would listen to this and and you know we'd have this big audience of people who like listen and trust us that would be amazing right i use that methodology for risk taking so i say should i quit my job and start this company well the worst case scenario is that it's going to take me six months to find a new job therefore i'll have six months of savings lined up and if i just so happen to build a successful company that's gravy that's awesome but this but i just basically i'm taking the risk that i'm gonna i just i'm assuming that i'm gonna find a new job and have six months of savings great that's my baseline i'm fine with that so floor and ceiling that's the second part um okay goals and anti-goals so i stole this from andrew wilkinson who stole it from somebody else probably but it's really easy to set a goal and not acknowledge some of the common trappings you could get even if you accomplish your goal simple example in college my buddy dated this girl her dad was like a partner at a big consulting firm and he was a partner he guy would make you know a million two million dollars a year probably he was he made it to the top of his like top of that ladder but also he was you know oh every single week he would fly out monday through thursday he would come back friday be there friday saturday sunday he would leave again sunday night and he was just gone for like half of her life growing up and so that's an example of achieving your goal but maybe hitting an anti-goal as well which was he probably didn't plan and set out to say i don't want to see my family you know my kid growing up for the first 18 years life i'm only gonna be there half the time but it just kind of came as a byproduct of trying to hit their goal so now i set out specific anti-goals like oh yeah i want to do this podcast but i don't want it to feel like a bunch of work every week right like i'm not trying to make this my job i want this to be a fun hobby right and so an anti-goal might be all of a sudden i'm drowning in work trying to edit this thing and upload the thumbnail and write the show notes and do all this stuff that would be an anti-goal if the after pod recording took five hours a week or uh you know ten hours a week to go to produce it and so by identifying the anti-gold up front you can make a game plan that that solves it do you do that i do it a little bit differently i don't call it an anti-gold no i say here's what here's the price i'm willing to pay to achieve the thing i want to achieve so for example when i was i said um when i'm gonna start this company the hustle i told my wife i go when we were dating i go just so you know the business is going to come first for the next handful of years because then when we get married and have kids i'll have more time for that but like right now business is first and i'm going to give up vacations i'm going to give up the price i'm willing to pay is we're just not going to have that much time together unless if the business gets in the way right baby tell me again uh who's number one on my priority list yes that's right say it again say it again again [Music] say it again yeah tell me it's valentine's day who's my date the hustle that's right that's right you got it you got it you understand to confirm you got a double opt into this [ __ ] so i always say here's the thing i'm willing to get i'm this this is the price i'm paying you know what i'm saying you want to look good the price you gotta yeah you want to look good in the nude the price you got to pay is you've got to eat this crap chicken and like not have fun there you know you got to pay a price right um i like that all right the next one in your face daily so now we're on number four we painted the picture that's kind of the mood board the movie scene the floor and ceiling method the goal and anti-gold method and now in your face daily this is one where i think a lot of people make a mistake they write down the goal at the moment they're motivated and inspired and they they read that book they watched that video you know they got their pen and paper out they write it down then they close the book and then they just go back onto autopilot for the next like 17 days and they can't even revisit their they don't revisit their goal so my big thing is i need to see it daily right the goal is like the barista you know if i'm going to get coffee before work every day i'm going to see this face i'm going to see my goals face every single day and so i will set this up in slack i will set up i'll just use the remind function i'll say remind me every day that my goal this week is for milk road to add this many subscribers or to go viral with one post on twitter or to you know to chase down that investment that i'm really bullish about and make sure we get in this round and i will set that reminder so that it pops up every single day and it's only me who sees that but now i do that with my team at the end of every you know either daily or weekly i will repost the goals that we had for the week and just be like you know here it is make sure you keep this top of mind or as my next my next method is the tip of your tongue test which is [Music] if you can't say what you want if it's not at the tip of your tongue what you're going for you're not clear enough about it and like you are not giving yourself the best chance to succeed because you can't articulate your goal at the tip of your tongue ben can i can i pick on you for a second ben are you there i know he's like at the beach so he may not have the best uh audio video i i got kicked out of my last spot i can i can try okay try ben with your podcast how to take over the world what is the goal the goal is to be a top 100 pod cast overall uh in in apple podcast ratings okay sounds good sam critique that real quick he's missing one critical element do you know what it is probably the input the input meaning what uh like you i think for a goal setting it's probably a little bit easier to be input oriented so like what you're willing like i'm gonna do x i'm gonna do x you know because you can't exactly control the output so like it'd be more input oriented i would also probably say if for podcasts i would put a download number on it but i don't know what do you think right oh or a time box right like by winning oh a time box do you have 10 years to do this or one year to do this that's a critical element to a goal is to be it it should be pass fail like it should be easy to figure out did this happen or not and if you don't have a time box you can't you can't ever judge it right sean do you have your do you have your computer open yeah go to my twitter handle and what's my bio say i have made this for the past uh month or two and it's been working wonderfully and it's exactly what you're talking about oh perfect you go i own the hustle sold it to hubspot i tweet about this i do the podcast and then he said losing another five pounds this month parenthesis august yes i always whatever the the goal is i put it up there in twitter so i see it every day and the thing that you didn't mention that i love doing is i love shaming myself i love shame i think shame and rage are the two best fuel to like get something done that people never talk about i i like i still do things to make aaron coyne my eighth grade girlfriend angry like i'm still in my head i'm like what's gonna prove her wrong you know what i mean like how am i gonna win and like prove that she was wrong for breaking up with me so i think rage is awesome but i think like shaming yourself or like guilting yourself or you put it publicly and you have to do it the other thing that i do constantly that works wonderfully is you have to like set appointments or put something on the table so for example i i have these a couple bad tattoos i want to get fixed and i've been wanting to do i've been so lazy you just you got to make the appointment you make the appointment it's like [ __ ] i can't bail i already put down money on this thing like i have to do this you know what i mean and i think that those things really really help yeah like my iron man competition coming up but um shame and rage that's a pretty good i mean my first million's a good name shaymin rage would have been a great name for this podcast dude shaymin rage is such a good fuel i don't know like people say like you don't be angry i'm like no [ __ ] that anger i love anger i love anger anger gives me so much goodness like i i'm still like what is the phrase chips on shoulders put chips in pockets i love anger anger is such a good a a good uh emotion to drive you i used to do that i used to i used to have a thing that i've taken off this list which was use your own psychology against you so it'd be like oh if i state publicly what i'm gonna do then i feel the pressure to go ahead and do it or like yeah if i use kind of insecurity or anger that could be like a fantastic fuel for accomplishing my goals uh but i don't i personally don't do that anymore because it makes the process of doing the thing kind of unpleasant uh it is effective for hitting the goal but well that's because you have this really big problem you've got a huge problem you know what your problem is i'm too very emotionally stable and happy yeah you've got that's a really big issue in your life is you're just too emotionally stable um so you know like i'm sorry that your parents were wonderful to you but that's just the price you have to pay you know what i mean yeah sam goes around to his house just like shaving half an inch off every table just trying to get it to have a little bit of instability in it he's like it's better i want the plates to slide baby yeah you know i had the advantage of you know having a problematic childhood you you you you were disadvantaged by having a perfect little life this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform where everything is fully integrated well i can see the clients whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago i totally missed hubspot grow better all right i'm gonna finish my goal thing real quick i got three more all right last three the most important three are uh i don't move unless i actually believe that it's gonna happen yeah so a lot of people will say and i would say ben i i i you don't have to come back go on but people will say things like ben just said and i would say at least half the time if they are honest with themselves i want to be a top 100 podcast in the world by you know by you know in 12 months if i said what do you what do you think are the odds that that's gonna happen they'll be like well it is you know hard and it is risky you know and they'll sort of like if it comes down to it their belief that it's actually going to happen is quite low and i don't let myself move unless i actually believe that it's gonna happen because there's this like there's a virtuous and vicious cycle belief drives action if i really believe that some shit's gonna work if i really believe that this person's gonna say yes and buy my product i will pick up the phone immediately and call them it's only when i don't believe they're gonna buy my product that i some like well i'll call them after i finish this powerpoint day i'm gonna actually you know friday is not a good day to call because of this and hold on let me just go clean my room real quick you know because that's you know i just want to get that done i'm going to be a better head space like it's your belief that drives the level of action you're going to take like massive belief equals massive action massive action equals a good result and a good result reinforces the belief this is also what happens to people who become have a lack of confidence they don't believe therefore they take timid action timid action creates shitty results and that just reinforces to them they're like see i knew it wasn't like i kind of knew it wasn't i knew it was gonna be too hard i knew any of this wasn't like the odds were against us and then it just happens again and again so i don't move until i i work myself into a spot where my belief is super high um last two baby goals or giggle steps so i've kind of learned that like if you have a big goal you got to set a baby goal or a giggle step a giggle step is a step is that a trademark giggle step and just a tip are your two i met this woman and she she created this uh phrase she was like hey you know that book uh atomic habits by james clear i was like yeah yeah she's like it's it's all right and i was like oh you mean like the best-selling book that's like yeah i sold like three million copies this year like one of the greatest self-help books you know in the last decade in terms of for sale she's like yeah it's okay but it's missing the most important thing i was like what is it she goes he's he got it kind of right that you need to set like a simple first step but it's even his is way too hard like if you want to set a habit to floss your teeth every day you actually want to start with something so simple it would make you giggle because it's so not a goal that it's achievable and you'll actually do it and she's like so all you would do if you wanted to floss your teeth every day is literally put one piece of floss next to your bathroom and like a next to your sink and just floss a single tooth and then put it down and walk away it's like oh what's that gonna do with a single tooth and it's like it'll literally make you laugh it takes away a lot of the fear and the built up like scariness of going down this endeavor who's this who's this lady uh i hate that i forgot her name now um but yeah i met her i think it betsy betsy something i gotta find her last name i don't remember last night that sounds made up so far and it also might not be your first name and i might be the worst person in the world but like giggle steps is good um see if you can google that pull up her pull up her full name i've only met her twice um okay last one is uh last one is you got to revise up or abort down so i think what a lot of people do is as things get hard they start to compromise the goal and they'll start revising it down down down down down to the point where it's not even motivating anymore it's like you sort of took the edge off the goal and yeah now you kind of don't fail but you also don't really succeed and so my rule is i either revise up meaning i oh shoot i think this could be even bigger right this podcast we've revised up it's now bigger than i thought it could be and so now i've revised up okay it can actually be you know x millions of listeners every month um hell we're already at you know one point something 1.3 1.5 something like that million per month why can't this be by the way last month last month we were at one point seven i think yeah exactly so that's bigger than i would have guessed right one if one was my original goal i'm revising up now or i'll just abort down i'll say you know what this isn't gonna that [ __ ] that that that's a weird word to use to describe this well you know eject maybe is the better way to say it i will i will just eject out of uh you know the plane if i feel like you know what now that we have given it every throw and everything we've got at this and we've learned new things we have new information that tells us that this is this isn't gonna work rather than compromising down and getting stuck on something we're not even really excited about if we're no longer excited about it i'll just i'll change the goal completely or i'll leave the goal aside i'll just go do something else because um the new information has kind of shown me something to it's just a check to say don't just continuously dial it down because that's very tempting to do and it's very easy to slip into mediocrity so kind of by forcing myself with something harsh which is all right would i just quit this it's like so harsh that it forces me to like no stick with the real goal and find a way to make it happen or change you know based on what your new understanding of reality change this completely don't just like take it down a notch and another notch and another not to another and now it's all of a sudden not even that special to be good so those are those are my how to hit goals those are those are things i do to hit goals i remember years ago you when we were just kind of trying to we were coming up trying to make it happen you said that you go i think six million dollars is the number i need to feel financially like secure or i don't remember what we're like stable or like that i need to never work again free did that goal change as you got older were you right or wrong about that goal um i think i was right but i was wrong in one key aspect and actually i said it on the podcast early on and our friend narendra dmb and he was like uh you're wrong six won't be like six is not enough for you and i was like well i don't know i like i do the math he's like it's not enough like you know first of all uh maybe your target return of what you think you're gonna make on that six you know as you're because the idea is if you have a certain amount of money invested what can you it is going to earn you know it's going to compound at some rate five percent seven percent a year whatever it is um could you live off of that compound interest rather than and the principle would never go down you would never have to withdraw lower than the principal so you would you'd be financially free you don't need new net income coming in because the money you have is working for your money now and you don't have to go work for your money and you thought that was six i thought it was six because i've done some conversations okay um now i think the number is like the real number is probably closer to 10 or 11 and um the aspirational number is like 25 and up because then it's like oh it's not even close at that point so the reason why i'm bringing that up is the interesting thing about goals is i used to think if i if i achieve this thing whether it's financial or body or whatever that like i'm going to be changed and i realized that pretty much across the board every goal that i achieve i'm like oh this was not as cool as i thought i'm going to create a harder one and at first i was bummed but now i'm like oh no that's not like because it's just the chase like i'm born to hunt you know what i mean like i have to chase a goal and i have to accept that when i hit my goal it's not going to change much it's just going to be a cool benchmark to go to the next one and so with goals setting lately over the last couple years i've been like oh but just know that this isn't going to change anything but it will be exciting to chase after it and so that's what that's an interesting thing that i've learned a little bit with as i've gotten older with goals yeah and typically with financial goals your lifestyle creeps up so like before when i did the let's say 6 million number i was like all right 6 million if i earn five percent if i'm getting five percent let's say they i think the s p like kind of average you know uh return is eight percent or something like that i was like okay let's say i can get five um what would be you know that's 300k a year cool at the time i think i was spending under 200k a year and my burn i was like ah that's good and i have like you know 30 buffer well now i spend i think more than that and so because lifestyle creeps up it's like you know i started to pay for more stuff i started to buy more things i started to travel a little bit differently started to do all the things that people do and now you didn't travel differently you don't you just don't travel but when i do i drive a little bit differently um the the point is the lifestyle creeps up and so um i think that's the thing you have to do if you're if you're not trying to be really disciplined in your lifestyle which i'm not i think life is to be enjoyed and i want to enjoy it to the fullest extent i know and so as i learn new things new ways to enjoy i want to do those things and not feel limited by money um i think you got to account for that you got to like over buffer are you looking to buy a house now i'm looking at either buying or renting a new house yeah dude renting's so awesome i've been loving renting man don't buy me too yeah it's it's it's sick the only downside with renting is just like sometimes you don't there's not enough inventory for like uh that is a big one when you're in the burbs but like if you're patient you could just you can find it um and right now uh the market seems to be at least where i'm at in california and bay area the market seems to be moving where everything's getting marked down so everything's down 20 30 percent um except for stubborn sellers who haven't realized yet that they need to mark down and then even those aren't getting offers and then they're pulling their thing off the market because they're like okay it's not selling now this just looks bad and they're like switching to okay we'll rent this or we'll just stay in it or whatever like the market is very quick quickly turning here um to like a buyer's market is what i'm kind of saying all right i have something interesting to to share with you have you heard of this company called woot w-o-o-t of course yeah was like um an internet staple og staple it was one of the cool websites where it was like you'd go and there was a daily deals like buy this tv for like 22 or something so ethan brooks at the hustle kind of told me about it but i had read about it for a bit because the founder interests me his he's this guy named matt rutledge and woot was like like you said one of the original like daily deal sites and it was acquired by amazon and the story is really interesting i remember reading this a couple years ago so matt rutledge is this guy from dallas and he flies up to uh seattle to meet with bezos like you know right when it closes and they get a sunday breakfast and they're like rutledge he wrote he's like bezos had like a weird energy this whole time but whatever i'm sitting in this meal and i finally just say so jeff why did you buy woot and jeff like um had just ordered breakfast and they have the meals in front of them and he looks down at the meal then he looks at matt and like 15 seconds passes and matt's like should i just like ask him if he wants to like move on and we just like skip this and jeff looks down at his meal again and then looks back up at rutledge and he goes you see um you're the octopus that i'm having for breakfast right now because jeff had just ordered like eggs and octopus for some reason like a weird ass breakfast and he goes when i look at the menu you're the thing that i just don't understand basically he had never ordered octopus for breakfast before and he's like this is weird i'm gonna order it i've never seen it before i don't get it i'm gonna order it you are the thing that i've never had and i must have for breakfast the octopus and that's why he said he bought this guy's company it is like dude you're [ __ ] insane like he didn't think about it like like my takeaway was rutledge was not like oh fake story that is a fake story you either just made that up or no i read it in an article those were quotes that is true those are direct questions hilarious to be that is too hilarious to be real the exact quotes incredible this is this is i'm going to read it verbatim from the article and this is matt in rutledge saying telling the reporter you're the octopus that i'm having for breakfast when i look at the menu you're the thing that i just don't understand the thing i've never had i must have breakfast octopus and he just any and that was like like a 20 seconds pause for him to say that like just like this [ __ ] weirdo like you know like star trek type of guy and uh as you'd expect as one would expect from what there have been many great stories on this podcast many great stories thousands of great stories i might say this was the greatest story i've ever heard on this podcast first of all you told it great i didn't know where you were going with this the breakfast the looking down the looking up the 15 seconds and then that line is all time weirdo that is so weird of a thing what do you expect what do you expect i was actually i did a podcast with someone and they asked me about my successful friends and like what do they all have in common i was like well they all like work hard they all like are smart but they're all [ __ ] weird they're all weird and like everyone i know who's successful is pretty [ __ ] weird so do you know that would say that line by the way that's not that online no one no one but that guy's like bezos is like the weirdest of the weird maybe more yeah like i've heard him say like yeah like your business is one google away from me destroying you like he says stuff like that but this guy says i must have the breakfast octopus but this company woo it's really interesting because it's basically just a daily deal site whatever and like matt is like he said amazon ruined it as you'd expect and like but they did all this funny stuff like they would sell a daily deal and the deals that they didn't sell they would create this feature called the bag of crap which is a a a thing that like users would just buy blindly and in the faq it says like well if you don't like it just list it on ebay but we don't take refunds and um anyway he leaves and he starts another thing and he calls it the me a mediocre corporation that's originally what it's called and the uh and the underlying premise is that we're building a store that you don't need to buy anything to have fun so like their copy is really really good and he basically said in an article he was like um i want everyone's expectations to be incredibly low with this business so that's why we called it a mediocre corporation and it's pretty hilarious and i was reading their copy so now a mediocre corporation they basically own like eight different websites so um and they're all like daily deal sites and all of them have like 350 to 2 million uh 2 million visits a month so i bet you there it's actually a pretty substantial business and if you read the copy it's beautiful it's wonderful it's a wonderful copy and i was thinking about this the basically as i've sold my company to a big company i've realized that basically for the longest time i thought basically the only thing that a startup has that's better than a big company and why a startup can win is like focus we could focus harder on stuff and we can move faster so we can move fast and have more focus and then i started reading about this guy and i started thinking about like the hustle like what made it interesting and the second and the third thing that i've added is that basically be because there's less bureaucracy you can have more soul you can do more funny interesting stuff and the reason you can is basically the founder comes up with something says like we're just going to do it whereas at a big company there's like middle management and they're like i don't want to lose my job so i'm not taking this risk i'm not going to pitch the bag of crap like feature even though that's hilarious and users love it i ain't pitching it i'm gonna i'm not gonna do it and i'll give you a good example so i love appsumo appsumo was started by my friend noah kagan and uh neville uh maduro is my good my best friend and he like uh helped run it and it was a daily deal site as well listen to this copy so they ran a deal one time where you could purchase like fonts i don't know how you buy fonts but that was the thing listen to the opening uh paragraph from the daily email that he sent out neville wrote this if the names lucanda sands unico unicode or cor curry or new don't mean anything to you go ahead and close this message you see my friend today we're reaching out to the community of people known as font [ __ ] you know who you are if your knees go weak when i whisper garamond you might be one you might be one of them and i read this i remember this years ago before i met neville and i was like this is this is beauty this is beautiful this turns off the people you want to be turned off and it gets you know the people who you want it and i was just like in my head i'm like dude you're writing about having sex with this font that is so funny that is awesome you are making the most boring topic really cool and you cannot do that at a big company it's incredibly hard and it's not hard because the company's bad or good it's just that's the rules of the game and it's just like you're playing you know the game on hard mode if you're trying to like make a big company cute and i was just thinking this is just this company woo it's just such a perfect example you should go to some of their websites they're they're uh they're the mediocre corporation they own casemates uh mediocrity that's one of their things they own the site called meh.com side deal morning save and it's just deals and i thought it was interesting and the copy is hilarious and this is and i've been thinking about businesses that you can build which you are building and i did where it's just like one or two people can kind of be the taste makers and that can scale and be leveraged really nicely kind of like a daily email you know what i mean but as you get bigger you can't be able to do it all it's going to get worse and worse and i think that's just what's going to happen yeah totally by the way their domain is mediocre.com which is an amazing domain to have uh this is such a cool story i love that and i love that that email by neville that's uh amazing copy the um i think it's so true personality personalities you said soul i would say personality because it's called personality interact with it is such a differentiator in life in all aspects of life but it it also works in business people go into business assuming you have to play some role you have to like put on this suit and tie and be some character and all you're doing is simply blending in with every other suit and tie that exists out there and so they'll like i see this all the time founders will try to play the same game as the companies they admire the big companies the successful companies they assume because they're successful that i need to act like them if i too want to be successful what they forget was that before they were successful early on the way they got successful was through having personality having a point of view having some edges to them and those edges they keep some people away because it's too rough for them it's not what they wanted and for other people they're like wow this is the handle i need to grab onto because i love this and so you know before apple was apple they were you know the home brew they were at the homebrew computer club right they were basically they had the two advantages you talked about you said focus i call it freakishly obsessive and i use that word specifically because they are obsessed with that some topic whatever it is it could be raspberry pies it could be blockchains it could be whatever they're usually obsessed with something that's not mainstream because it's not that fun to be obsessed with something that's already totally mainstream there's not much joy in that for this person and the second is that they're freakishly obsessed which is not only just an extreme form of obsession but they're they're willing to go to a length that other people wouldn't and they're willing to like the topic is usually niche and weird um so you know fonts is a good example of one of one um of things like that then the other part that you mentioned which is personality it just gets squashed out of a big company because imagine if the at the beginning when you're one or two people the personality of the company is basically the personality of the founder or founders and it's typically like a room of people and they're like one-upping each other it's like haha that's funny like all right but check this out what if we even went even harder like you know like you can have that like vibe because you're incentivized to do that you want to grow you want to do interesting stuff totally you're not incentivized once the company gets bigger imagine a room imagine a room of of one person okay it's just that per whatever that person thinks it's normal to them you get two people two co-founders maybe they're both a little bit weird and so they riff off each other it gets going now you add the third wheel even if that third wheel was totally vanilla they're a total normal person they're now outnumbered so they join the thing and they're like all right i guess that's how we get down here right you had a phrase you go you need to let your freak flag fly if you're gonna work here and so you whoever came in you indoctrinated them into your weird culture to do weird [ __ ] and do cool [ __ ] and that was normal there so the third person comes in even if they're vanilla all of a sudden they become flavored too the fourth person comes in same thing but at some point the next like i don't know where it is 15 20 30 40 50 people somewhere in that range i would say between 15 and 50 people the person who gets hired typically will spend most of their time and not with the founders anymore and so now they're now one vanilla person is spending time with a bunch of other vanilla people and they're hiring other people who have a greater and greater percentage of vanilla right it starts with they need to be 25 30 because hey we need to be serious and get stuff done around here then you start hiring 50 vanilla and by the time you get to 50 or 100 people you're hiring a hundred percent vanilla people and those people now when they someone says a weird idea it's crickets in the room it's risks come first there's reasons why not rather than why we would it's oh yeah that has this one extreme strength but it might have some other extreme weaknesses so don't take the risk that's gonna offend certain people or that's gonna like cannibalize this thing or that thing or yeah it's just like [ __ ] excuses right what will they say what will they think and so what will they say well really what it comes down to it comes down to i've got a good gig i don't want to [ __ ] it up uh let's not let's not rattle this you know i don't want to shake this up yeah exactly and i'm not comfortable shaking it up because i don't know that that's what we do here because a lot of time has passed i don't hang out with the people who that are like totally high conviction of being weird and um and yeah like i i have some i have more to lose than i have to gain by doing this because when i say this idea i don't get respect in the room i get sort of like strange glances and nervous laughter and then you know somebody tells me why my idea is a bad idea so i learn to just keep that [ __ ] piped down my freak flag is now you know buried at the bottom of my trunk and it you know it's folded up and it's in its case and so that's what happens at the at the end of these companies now some companies fight that off so for example this is why i think a lot of people like founder-led companies because they keep that soul they have one person in the company who has a gravitas so like i think i think this happened at uh tesla and it happened at elon's companies he is so publicly weird and big thinking and out there and willing to just go with it that he kind of sets the tone even if you don't on a day to day ever have meetings with elon or work with him or you don't get the culture from him inside the company you get it from seeing what he does on twitter so he kind of did you see his new butthole feature yeah exactly and so now if you're at tesla you're like okay the boss's boss's boss's boss likes that weird [ __ ] and it gets a bunch of play on twitter and we've seen five things pay off by going overboard like does the cyber truck window really need to be bulletproof no but elon would think that's [ __ ] cool so we're gonna do it and i know elon thinks it's gonna be cool because he lets the flag fly on twitter and so i see it even though i don't interact with them day-to-day so that's one way to scale that personality is to have a such a strong personality and do it on blast another version i remember when i was at dude but he's got to put up with so much [ __ ] for that and it's actually to be in his position i've been in this position and i've like weakened out a bunch of times where i'm like oh fine i'll let you guys get your way this time like you know like you're gonna quit if i don't give it to this fine i'll let you have it this time and in my head i'm like but this is the wrong decision but i'm only making i'm only agreeing to go with this even though i don't like it because like i don't want them to quit and like i just don't want this headache right now whereas he's the type of guy because he's like you know like on the spectrum he's like no i don't like pick up on this social cue like we are not doing it like we're this is fine i'm okay being uncomfortable here you know what i'm saying and that's that's how i'm inspired by him a little bit the belief in himself and also just the lack of self-awareness uh is is important there right you can't be like us you can't be a self-werewolf and just have too much self-awareness like you have to have a little bit of like you know you know you don't give a [ __ ] in your system in order to do this well at twitch one thing happened i remember that i was like super super proud to like be there working there at the time i was like because i gave it a lot of [ __ ] you know i just do the sort of like the stereotypical startup guy thing where you're like startup cool big company dumb big company's slow big company boring big company no risk big company no innovation right like it's the startup caveman who's just like you know like um you know small startup good even though small startup is like failing and has no money and like no users no no impact no nothing it's like still in our head there's like something to be really proud of there but sometimes at these companies some really cool [ __ ] happens and what i remember one was they released this campaign for prime day so twitch gets bought by amazon amazon wants all of the amazon companies to really push prime day it's like it's basically its own black friday that they created where it's like yo here's an excuse to go spend a bunch of money that you otherwise weren't gonna spend and prime day is huge for for amazon so they you know the memo comes down twitch you need to support prime day and everyone's at twitch is like [ __ ] what do we do and twitch has a user base that is so easily offended it's like anything twitch does any policy it creates it's like hey we're um increasing you know the safety and for women it's like why because women can't defend themselves it's like dude like we're just trying to help like we're not trying to offend anybody every step of the way but you could sort of do no right and um so so people were just like dude what are we going to do how are we going to promote this like amazon prime go buy [ __ ] stuff like people are going to think we're just total sellouts like this is not going to be cool so they're not going to be go over well so i don't know who the genius is in this company but somebody was like like imagine like a tv show where they're like god like everybody just think we're just sell out everything is just a sellout and if you cue the dream music like sell out sell out i got it twitch sells out and they made it yeah they like turned it on its head and they went self-aware you know like and it's always sunny it's like the gang you know the gang goes to a trump rally or whatever it's like the uh the event was come watch how hard twitch will sell out today and they basically leaned into it completely instead of trying to do it and then sort of like set themselves up to catch a bunch of arrows from fan from the users who were like god stop trying to promote prime day this is annoying this is why it was that's why i didn't want amazon to buy twitch like i knew it was gonna sell out to this corporation i call that the eight-mile strategy have you seen eight mile yes exactly like there's this one like the last scene eminem's like yeah i am white yeah i am poor yeah this dude this guy did have sex with my mom yeah this all happened and then it like he makes it entertaining and then the other guys are like [ __ ] i can't make fun of him yeah like i can't i can't mock that you you just took it away from me you know what i mean i'm powerless here it's the eight mile strategy and i love it that's exactly what it is and so yeah they went full slim shady they basically what they did was they created a qvc style set right like the cheesiest salesiest set and then they invited the big streamers and it was like they created this like this neon 80s logo that was like twitch sells out and then people would jog onto the stage like today i'm going to sell you this shitty blender and they like and people found it so entertaining and it was funny and it was self-aware and they they just like and it sold like crazy like it was so successful and i don't know who this was it was somebody in like the creative marketing department um i think i met them at one point but i was like hey you don't know this but like that was the number one thing i respected you know that we like of all the features we shipped of all the projects we tried that was my favorite it was my number one i thought that was so well done whoever came up with that you had guts you had creativity and you like turned a disadvantage into an advantage which is like for me that's the highest form of respect when i see somebody who can take a disadvantage and flip it to an advantage it's like that's you're my person you are you are everything that's right about business in my book i love that i'm going to look that up i want to see uh i want to say i like i want to see the content i bet it's hilarious it's good it was really well done we need to come up with a better way to end the show if we're going to come up the way to start it yeah just sort of hey you never talked about the basketball game oh yeah you got to talk about that do you want to talk about that uh yeah let's do it i got to be a little vague about it but yeah let's do it you guys saw so i sent you guys the guest list for this thing um i guess i should explain what it is so i went to that conference i went to a conference and it was fun it was a lot of fun um but i don't know about you but i have this like feeling before i go to a conference which is like there's like a 48 hour period before where i'm like what are one of the reasons i could not go to do this yeah one of the reasons i could get out of this i don't know why that urge comes over me i think like just the idea in my head of what a conference entails is like this stuffy ballroom like awkward handshake conversations with people who like you know nobody knows each other and it's just like it's like just like the worst first day of college all over again every day in my in my professional life now and so i was like yeah i just hate that feeling and i hate conferences but like there is some magic at conferences that happens or you know i do like meeting new people i do like learning new things um and i do like some of the like little side events that happen in a conference that are like not the speaker on the stage and not the like networking mixer where i have to like go bargain but what are you guys talking about oh you guys known each other for 10 years cool well uh i'm uh i'm shawn i have you guys like podcasts oh you don't recognize that okay yeah no i was just asking if you guys knew where the bathroom was i was just waiting this whole time to barge in and ask that i'm gonna go now see ya so dude by the way the best the best way to approach that i've learned is just saying hey i don't know anyone here can i join your conversation i've noticed that to be the best it's the upfront method um yeah exactly so so i dislike conferences for that reason and i was like all right um and at the same time i'm like dude i miss doing some stuff that was really fun that i just don't make a lot of time for nowadays i was like i miss just playing basketball just like dude i used to play three hours a day just pick up was it was so fun that was like the best time just me and my friends and just playing we used to meet a bunch of cool people doing that and so i was talking to ben and i was like not producer ben my business partner ben i was like i was like dude what if could we get like the magic of a conference to combine with the magic of like just going playing pickup like is there a way to do this and he's like yeah i got an idea and so we came up with this idea which was we have a friend who trains some of the biggest like nba stars and he's been training them for years and like these are like you know all-star hall of fame level level players and um he's their personal trainer like he'll go to their house and work with them every day in the summer and that same thing things like that and uh we've become friendly with him uh because he's a he's an entrepreneur and we got to know him that way and kind of helping each other out with our businesses and so we were like yo um his name's alex basil we're like alex you know you train kyrie irving you train trey young you train carmelo anthony you train these guys like dude what if i just got a bunch of business dorks together who all love basketball and like would you just train us like you trained them like a fantasy camp like can we just pretend for a weekend like we are we're those guys and he's like yeah i'm down like just you know pick a weekend as long as i'm free like we'll do it and i was like okay and then i was like once i had one side of it and i was like all right so let's what if we just got like 10 12 people who were you need your anchor though you need your whale and we needed our whale i was like how do i get people to come to this like first of all i don't even know who plays basketball who doesn't i was like who would i wanna who's like number one a great hang number two loves basketball and number three like successful enough in business where if i go invite the next person the pull is that these other people are coming right that's the key to any great event is these other people are going to be there the people are the event that way i don't have to be like great with the food and bev and like the environment like all these logistics i'm not good at like the people are the event as long as people are there to work and so uh um i won't say who but we landed one big whale famous person x and then the dominoes world famous world famous mainstream family type of person exactly so mainstream famous type person and then i was like okay cool and i started to get a couple of friends in and then i sent you the guest list because you're coming yeah and producer ben is coming and or like i told you guys to come i don't know if you guys are not coming but you should come it'll be fun when's the day did you say the date it's next month or it's in 20 days so it's 20 days from now um but you saw that guess dude it's coming together there's some pretty awesome people going now and now it's way bigger than like 10 people like we got 20 people this is like how many people do you want to be their dad owns this nba team and this person they just sold their company for all this money and then this person they're the ceo of this publicly traded company it's like i didn't even know that guy likes to play you know like there's a whole bunch of really interesting people i think this is going to be dope and i think this is a way better way i think this is a hack where i don't have to go attend conferences i get to host you should invite um lori uh jet.com i should invite him yeah i haven't invited him yet that's a good one if he plays he don't mean he owns a basketball team yeah he's awesome i will invite him um but yeah what do you think about this this is awesome it's gonna be the best i think it's gonna be really fun i think you should invite even bigger more famous people than just like internet dorks like mark would be cool or uh i don't know who else uh that's actually the hard part is to think about who to invite but yeah it's gonna be awesome i think it's gonna be really fun i think it's a great idea i think making yourself the center of these types of things is is badass it's a net win there's no downside are you out of pocket any money um i don't know i haven't even thought about cost yet but like yeah like it'll cost money to do this but it's not gonna be super crazy and i think everyone would pitch in everyone will pitch in just nobody's we're not trying to make a profit off this thing we're just trying to like you know cover all the costs and do make it dope no i think it's a great idea and it would be it's gonna look sick on social like it's work related let's uh let's tell uh daddy hubspot to pay for it hey fellas um quick break between between games here just wanna quickly talk to you guys about your crm needs they'll be into it i think they're trying to just gather around i have a quick powerpoint that i'd love to just run you through i think they yeah but no make them pay for it if we can record yeah oh that's the only only record we only need to record one or two things we should record each day we could probably record two or three like things we could even have like two people on at a time so it's not like dude and we should get couches and have people playing in the background yeah the game is just running in the background the audio sucks it's just so much like screaming from basketball the full scene guys did a uh the full send guys they had a wedding i think it was like post malone's manager or some some like fantasy person was doing a wedding and they set up a studio off to the side of the reception area and they were in there recording a podcast for an hour and like logan paul popped in for like 10 minutes and this other person popped in for like five minutes and it was really cool it was a great pod we should do something and they're like all right you guys want to go back like i think dessert's at our table and they went back it was pretty great yeah it was a really good it was like if if you explain it to me i was like oh this isn't cool but i saw them pull it off and i was like oh this is actually really neat we should totally do that and ask hubspot to uh front the bill all right great all right done done all right well good idea that's the pod that was a good one [Music] you

i think this is one of the multi-billion dollar trends that like you could be on right now and i don't say that for hyperbole like literally this is the window the tech is just now finally good enough it's not quite there but you need to start now and you can disrupt all of these marketplaces [Music] all right uh i went out with uh hassan last night for dinner can i tell you about it really quick do it it was awesome so he like admires you a lot do you know that i admire him a lot so uh you pronounce his name minhaj or minaj minhaj right i think i think his name is actually pronounced hassan minhaj and everybody calls him hassan minaj because it sounds awesome and it's like nicki minaj and so you know whatever i i don't know what the i don't know how strict he is on that well we so basically the story of this is sean interviewed him uh last year i thought i saw him on the street and i ran up and like went and said hey and it actually wasn't him and i looked like an idiot and i tweeted about it and he texts me i guess he got my number from you and he texts me and we went and hung out so this guy's like this you know pretty big deal comedian he is so smart he's so much smarter than i am and that's what i i learned that and number two i was so intimidated to be around him because i didn't know if like if i i was like can i make him laugh if i can make him laugh i'm like this is a weird and i i really didn't i didn't make him laugh i failed i i did not i could not make him laugh and he like showed me these books that he's reading and i wanted to google like i wanted to tweet this out but i was too embarrassed so maybe you could tell me but i like like googled like books on how to be funny because after i hung out after i hung out with him i was like dude this guy's got me in a trance he could tell me about anything he's so funny and good at storytelling like i'm so into it and i was like i wanna figure out how to be funny and i went on amazon and i googled like how to be funny or like how to be clever and do you remember years ago when i wrote that article about this guy who games the amazon kindle system to rank really high and it's like [ __ ] books but he like buys reviews dudes like six of the top ten on page one were all him it's all this guy i know the author i don't think i saved so it's all [ __ ] what is there are there good books that i can read you think on how to be funny or how to be clever like i felt like such a nerd like i was going to tweet this out but i'm going to look like the biggest virgin on earth just like how do i like be clever in a conversation yeah i don't know dude that i feel like this is a um it's like a tr it's like a skill that's only passed down like you know by hand and you can it's only like trial by fire like you have to like learn this when you're 12 and get good at like busting people's balls and like saying the funny thing in class um like theo vaughn has this like hilarious i know you like the o2 so here's this hilarious story he tells he goes dude i was in my like freshman i remember the first time i realized i was funny as a comedian he's like i was my freshman year at college and i was going to school in louisiana or whatever he's like and my professor said to our class he was like you know look to your left look to your right you know statistics will say that uh you know one one of the one of the three of you one out of every three people are going to end up being like a child uh whatever molester or something like that he goes and i stood up and i just go not it killed and then he's like he's like that was the moment and first of all this is a hilarious story and secondly uh i think there's some truth to like you have these little moments where you get rewarded for being funny early on in life and you're like oh more that more of that all right how do i get more that laughs i want more of that and then you just keep doing it talent's real but i think it's a i think just like anything like you know some people will never be able to dunk but you definitely can improve you can learn how to dribble better than before for sure like there's got to be a skill there's definitely a skill here uh you know i think like the best are definitely just born better but i can be good i can be good at it there's a youtube video that you should watch so i've gone down this rabbit hole probably also after i met uh and i was like [ __ ] he would tell me a story on the pod where he'd be talking and i'm so into the story i'm like you know he was eating out the palm of his hand and then he would ask me a question mid-story and i just i'm like nodding like i'm still listening like it's a tv show and then i didn't realize that he said something to me like he said he was telling some stories like everybody's got that kid growing up like you had that kid who who was it for you and i was so in like enthralled by the story that i was just like yes and i realized that i was like oh he asked me for a name and then i thought about who that would be because i said now it said yes that there is a kid and he's like who was it and i was like i can't remember any names growing up i'm so into you that i've like forgotten who i am and my entire past and so you know that was what was happening when he was telling stories but he i asked him afterwards and i think he gave me a youtube video that was fun that he that he's like this is kind of interesting um so it's called mark normand how to write a joke and i think it's like an hour-long podcast so it's the the thing is called writing a joke with mark norman and mark norman is a good joke writer he's a funny comedian yeah he's great and this one hour thing he like kind of breaks down some of the the like mechanics of what makes something funny and it's not like follow this these three easy steps and you too could be funny but it is like oh okay i can see how this like if i const if i consistently practice these mechanics i can take something that's like not so funny and make it funnier repeatedly and then like from there there's more the storytelling and the setups and there's like tagging jokes and there's other like things that you got to learn obviously if you want to do this well but i think that video is pretty good there's these guys who have this youtube channel called charisma on command and it's a beautiful name they've been doing it forever have you seen these guys yeah i remember for like maybe five seven years ago i was yeah watching those videos yeah and they're cool there it could be a little lame because it's a it's a little bit more on like nerdy guys how to meet women which is cool and fine whatever but like you know i was not trying to i was dating my wife at the time so i was like well i just want to learn how to be like more charismatic and i remember their name and they like taught a course on it and like they had all this stuff like that's a beautiful name charisma on command i'll watch that mark norman joke but anyway i hung out with this dude last night it was dope he paid for dinner so good first date uh it was awesome did you try to pay did you do the thing no for sure well not me but i you know what's funny is when i go to he like liked this we went to gramercy tavern and he likes that place which is i guess it's like a fancy or kind of fancy place and i was like dude you come here a lot he goes yeah i love it i go i'm not even going to look at a menu whatever you want to order for me just you just do it all and that's that's how i love i love going to restaurants like that i do that all the time i'm like i don't care i eat meat and vegetables get whatever so the best is then after they order then you complain uh you gotta do that that's the the true debug move by the way you know one thing people liked from the last pod or maybe a couple months ago i got a bunch of dms about this they were like dude i love the homie move that you said i was like i don't remember what he's talking about he's like he's like remember the homie move that's like one of the top 10 things you've shared on the pod which was you were like dude guess how many blah blah blah and like when you say that obviously it's something impressive but i kind of guessed low so that you can have your your punch line where you're like a hundred million and i'm like oh i only said ten because i kind of knew it's more than ten but let me give you this moment people love that uh that's hilarious yeah i saw the comments people did dig that on youtube uh right so i made a little vow to uh myself to bring more specific ideas and stories uh to the pod because i personally love the free flowing just like whatever wherever our conversation goes it goes but i want to make sure that you know we have the entree not just tapas it's not just the appetizers i want to have the entrees so let's jump into a couple ideas here i got a few too or i got one big one i'm gonna go one and then you go one all right so we've talked about this a little bit in the past dolly and like how much ai is advancing and i don't know if it's just like my tick tock feed keeps feeding me these but every day i see a new incredible thing that ai can do you have to explain it what's that you have to explain what dolly is oh dolly is a program it's a artificial intelligence program um dolly 2 i think is the current name of it that basically you just type in any word and it generates images on that so you could be like sampar you know um phishing and it will just generate images that like look like they're either hand drawn or like a stock photo that are sampar phishing even though no such image exists let's say it will create the image so it like flips the whole idea of like creating art or taking photos or or painting something and it kind of like flips it on sets like no computers and robots can now do that almost as good if not in some cases better than what would be you know the real thing or humans human stuff and so you see that you see deep fakes like there's videos where you'll see the mona lisa and then they're like watch this and they push a button and also the mona lisa starts turning her head and she starts rapping like you know notorious big and it looks like the mouth is like in sync with the lyrics and the thing looks real it's like yeah they just took they can take an image and they could turn it into a video using ai like ai can basically say oh if i have this image i know where the eyes and those lips are i have been trained on what talking looks like what singing looks like what looking around and acting natural looks like and i can turn any image into that and it's really good it's really good they could take barack obama and they can make him like this happen now with the ukraine thing they took the the russian president like the way that people can photoshop an image to make it look real um you could take barack obama and you can make it sound and look like he is saying something you know completely racist or whatever so yeah i think oh man i can't trust videos well i heard a podcast about that particular one i think someone made one of these things to show how amazing it is and then they also show but here's the downfall and they made obama i think he said the n word or something like crazy like not cool and they're like he said that and that amazing obviously he didn't but like it seems exactly like he said it this is where it's gonna get it's gonna get dangerous totally um and let me uh so so i'll just keep going with some random examples so there's another one where you you can draw like a very basic smiley face on uh on your ipad on this app called procreate um and then you can it's basically just like eyes nose mouth and you're just like pencil drawing it then you change the brush to the ai paintbrush and you just kind of like shade in like you know like in a kid we're like i saw the wind a shape and it like colors in as if you like painted this in fine detail with the shadows and the colors the and all you're doing is literally just moving your hand like a fool and it's like it knows already what like high quality art looks like and it just turns your crappy art into high quality art um it's amazing and so every day there's all these little amazing magic tricks and they're not like foolproof yet but the demo is getting ridiculously impressive and so i used to come up with a logo for a business i'm thinking about starting i use it to come up with a logo and it was awesome oh i do that all the time yeah if you just google ai logo generator or brand generator there's like four websites that you can use and you just say like uh i you know it's a legal legal startup uh the mood is serious but still sophisticated go and it'll spit out like an infinite number of logo variations that you could then and you could be like cool print this on business cards that's like how they make money is like print this on a business card or like give me the i did any photo you actually used like i used it i used it yeah normally what i do is i go to 99 designs and i have like you 99 designs is amazing because you can get like 30 graphic designers to like make up a landing page and you'd be like i like details from number one number eight number fourteen and then someone combines all of them and they give me the one that i want whereas when you work with just one designer you gotta like a kind of be nice to them and be like no this this is you know this is okay but can you kind of change it like this instead i could be like no this sucks do this but also b you can see all different combinations and with dolly i'm excited to use it in that way and so let me give you like um a couple ideas that i've had based off of what i've seen so here's what i i think these can be very big ideas now the problem with these i'll tell the problem also um is that i think it's so easy to do that you're gonna have a bunch of competition um so you know you have to find a way to be defensive but okay here we go four ideas that you can do with ai like right now okay so number one is um uh which one i want to start with okay so number one is going to be fake speech so i'm investing in this company called unreal speech uh i don't know if you've heard this but check this out this guy sends me fake uh deep fake audio of somebody of gary vee and jordan peterson reading the milk roads i'm gonna just play one of these i think you can hear it let me just is the milk road the newsletter that brings you so much entertainment news and laughs it should be illegal y'all know hypothetically speaking of course here's what's happening around crypto dude it sounds right so that's like jordan peterson it's just like jordan pearson here's garyvee the newsletter that brings you so much entertainment news and laughs it should be illegal yeah no hypothetically speaking of course you can see it messes up sometimes what's happening around crypto the new stable coin on the block so so you guys that's amazing that is so good this is that available very little there's very little training data um and literally just like takes my thing and you can see the the places where my my written stuff is like kind of like casual i'm like you know blah blah blah like it doesn't do that part very well but the other parts it does like pretty dang well for a very small amount of training unreal speech is it available to everyone yeah so well it's like it's like brand new so um and so he was like hey sean you want to never do an ad read again he's like you know you have hundreds of hours of audio of you and sam's voice that's on the podcast like all you need to do is just say the word and i can make it so that you'll never have to do an ad read again did he do it i can make you i can make it so that the milk road it'll auto add a companion audio like if somebody wants to listen to the news that are on the go like it'll do it in your voice um like i can just do that now and i was like wow this is incredible he's like yeah and the way we're doing it is cheaper faster and like more accurate than like the the kind of the other models that are out there on like amazon or whatever um so it's like you know dramatically cheaper to do because this is a little bit expensive whenever you do this because it's like machine learning but the cost just keeps falling every year and then there's techniques to make it even smaller and so think about this like uh language translation so for example there's a world where we do this podcast and unreal speech could translate this into another language in our voices with our tones right but just speak in another language and so now all of a sudden our podcast is in you know is being you know done in spanish and in french and all these other languages and so we could grow without having to actually do extra work ourselves damn dude that's crazy all ad reads stuff like that so i think that's a that's a great business there's also um yeah there's there's other kind of like use cases for it but i'll i'll leave it at that okay here's another one student essays so i told you about that guy who made a thing called writelikeshawn.com and it like i like mentioned it in my email and it like blew up it like caused him to have like a thousand dollar bill in his servers and he was like you know oh [ __ ] like you know the side project now is like a financial burden for me um but basically this guy trained ai to write like i do and it was pretty damn good and i shared an example last time but this is not like has nothing to do with me it's just you could take any corpus of text data in this case he just used my twitter feed as like the corpus of text it could train it to write like that well there's one of the big things that uh you know i don't remember growing up but like you get assigned you have to write an essay in school and you know some people would pay other people to do it for them some people would go find one online and try to plagiarize it well this is going to basically screw that whole thing up because i'm gonna be able to go on there and say hey write an essay about world war ii and germany's role in it um in the sophistication of a tenth grader and it's just going to spit out a full essay or like a thousand versions of an essay and i could just pick the one i like and i could just edit it in like maybe five minutes to like get rid of any like crappy computer mess-ups dude this is nice and uh you remember turn it into a little bit did you have turnitin.com like it would help you like if you submitted it when you have to submit an essay in high school it happened so i used to like uh i had this website that like would give you free essays and i would use them all the time uh you know and like most well i don't know most people do it but you know a lot of people do it some people out there will think this is okay a person uh and a person did it and it it was awesome and i you like rewrite it a little bit but then they came up with turnitin.com which ended up becoming like a huge company and sold for billions of dollars i believe where you would turn in your paper essay but then you also to submit a an electronic copy and it did a pretty good job of finding out if it was plagiarized frankly i have no idea how it did it and i don't actually think it's that sophisticated of technology but they just sold to schools and they like trusted that it was legitimate because like if you just google a phrase in quotations you could see like where you know i mean it's like not like that sophisticated of a thing but like it would alert teachers like okay like 98 of this is copied from somewhere else right but yeah the teacher doesn't want to like google the teacher doesn't want to google everybody's thing so yeah that makes that makes total sense and that's that's exactly the case i think you're going to have the creation of stuff of content on the ai auto-generated content and then you're going to have the fact checking side the detection businesses also both are going to boom you're going to have things that take a video and say is this a deep fake or is this a real video you're gonna have another one that's like is this a auto-generated content or does a human write this like it's like the opposite of captcha you know when you go to a website and it says prove that you're a human it's gonna basically be like prove this isn't a robot is basically what you're going to have to do in order to trust that this person actually like did the work that's required for this um so i think that that's going to be like on both sides there's going to be businesses i'll give you another area that's going to get totally disrupted um print and patterns so people talk about like using ai for stock photos using ai for like be like auto generated music that's all going to happen too but here's what i think is like more more low-key like when when patrick came on he was talking about quilt businesses so there's a huge market of just pattern making so this is for all like clothing you know uh blankets you know curtains whatever basically patterns and prints are everywhere uh you know in apparel and fashion and so if you want to go and actually like make clothing you will often use like websites that have large libraries of patterns and prints what happens is today somebody hand draws each one of those like oh this floral pattern or this uh you know repeating pattern of you know whatever it could be like fire trucks for like you know some kid thing or whatever and then that person gets paid when you go buy that buy that pattern you buy it for whatever 100 and now they get that as their like royalty stream well this is all going to go ai in my opinion somebody can compete with these because the sites that do this they're worth hundreds of millions of dollars these marketplaces that have the creators and they have the servers yeah we talked about one of them i forget what it was called i think i think it had gotten acquired by tv for like 400 million yeah flower something yeah it's not some flowers flower classic or something they um uh what that's going to turn into is i'm going to go on there i'm going to be like cool i'm making a um you know a galaxy i want a galaxy themed repeating pattern so i'm just going to write galaxy themed repeating pattern and it's going to generate galaxy themed patterns and then they will be able to charge one tenth of what the other sites do because there's no human involved and they'll just keep all of that revenue for themselves so they will become the supply side of the market so this is like you can build a billion dollar marketplace because you now don't have to worry about supply it's what uber's trying to do with self-driving cars right it's like hey we can make these rides way cheaper and we can like you know make this whole system more efficient we just got to get to self-driving and tesla's trying to do the same with the robo taxi it's like the big idea in in transportation is getting rid of the driver the same thing is going to be the case with artists it's like we're going to get rid of the artists we're going to not need somebody to do the photography the videography the music the pattern making um you know the voice over work that's what unreal speeches right it's voiceover work um the the the essay writing the 99 designs every single one of those they're either gonna have to release this and kill their own supply side or someone is going to come and do it and eat their lunch i think this is one of the multi-billion dollar trends that like you could be on right now and i don't say that for hyperbole like literally this is the window the tech is just now finally good enough it's not quite there but you need to start now and you can disrupt all of these marketplaces do you ever recognize stock image models on different websites yeah there's this guy who's in the bachelor who's a stock image uh and he's like in like a bunch of like funny like whatever random like kids halloween costumes it's like there's that guy and you see him again on this like uh hot sauce commercial like there's that guy and he's like this generic smiling black guy and uh it's like they just reuse him everywhere i saw like the lady that was on the google analytics page it was two ladies and i saw one of them in public and i went up and got a picture with her and uh and like i saw her and i recognized her and then there's this other lady that was on the google analytics page she's it's like it's always it's like a lot of times the same person uh it's like a racially ambiguous woman with like curly hair it's like you know it could be italian she could be black she could be jewish why who knows like it just represents everyone and i see this woman everywhere on all different websites i used her a couple times i love this lady and i get sick of using the same pictures though all the time so for some of my projects i've been using if you you can use dolly and you can use a couple other services and they'll give you fake people so i have a couple websites that have like testimonials and they're real testimonials but i don't want to use the people's uh face because i didn't exactly ask them for it was like a email that they like wrote me you know what i mean i didn't want to use like their face because they didn't give me permission but like it's who cares just a sentence i can use that and i'll use i google ai sample faces and you can get all types of faces and you can say like make this person this race make this person happy make them serious you can change it and you can make them all types of stuff and i've been using that for sample images because when we were running the hustle every once in a while we would like do it the right way where we would like use an image that was for commercial use but sometimes it would get categorized wrong and we would we'd get like what do they call it like a uh i forget what it is yeah that's right and they say like you know we're you have to in multiple times we've had to pay five grand you know you're just like oh [ __ ] these guys like they're gonna cause an issue we just gotta pay them five thousand dollars and they're gonna go away but this is we just we're gonna get uh you know we're getting screwed here but whatever we gotta do it so i've been using them for stock images so i don't have to uh worry about getting sued or get one of these cease and desist letters totally it's gonna be the case with um stock images you know like designers always use these libraries of like icons and illustrations and there's like websites like the noun project and other things like that what so what dolly did was basically they just read all of the text on the internet and then they used it to create new stuff and some people are like dude that's messed up like github is doing this too github basically read all of the code that was on github they had a crawler basically index all of that learned they fed all of that that user data and they you fed it into machine learning and now they have this thing called github copilot which is i think like i don't know how much it is like 100 a month or something like that but it basically is like you know if you're a programmer we will this github codepilot can basically help you write your code you're like typing your code and it'll just autofill like autocomplete the line of code so it's like oh dude that makes a you know this 250 000 a year software developer more efficient and more effective and less bugs and less mistakes and less thinking uh it lets a less talented person sort of create these functions and write code and it's like a no-brainer like github co-pilot is going to generate like hundreds of millions of dollars for github create this product flip to switch it's going to be a multi-billion dollar product line just because it's generating so much revenue wow and some people are mad about it because they're like dude you read my code you use my code as the training data and i get nothing from this like that's crazy you're gonna basically put me out of a job by using my own data as the training data for this and that's the same thing that's gonna happen what these like these websites by the way ben found spoonflower what's the name of the spoon flour so all you have to do if you're doing this is like you're going to go and you're going to scrape and crawl spoonflower you're going to ingest all of the patterns with all of the tags and then you're going to basically train it train a data set so that it says okay cool this is what a pattern with x y and z keyword looks like great now you give me that keyword again i can generate 500 new patterns from scratch and spoonflower is basically going to create its destroyer in that sense like it is gonna the data from these from stuff that's already on the internet is what's gonna destroy those those services and i say it kind of hype like you know in a violent way like destroy and all that stuff but it is true like these are gonna be very competitive very quickly and it's going to be like the same way that the chess programs like got really good really fast and all of a sudden it's like oh yeah a human cannot be gonna be like the gang of graphic design yeah exactly like this is going to enslave and pillage you know it's going to go to your village it's going to kill the men it's going to marry all the women and it's going to put the children to work like that's what's going to happen with this these ai marketplaces that's my my prediction so ben go to this website i sent you the chat can you share this uh sam i think you've used this before too but it's a cool one for people who don't know um it's this person does not exist yes that's what i used and so like look at this now it looks like you bed kind of it just looks like a basic white dude this guy this looks like a mug shot it takes a quick picture of you from your web camera to just make someone like you um this is a dude that this person does not exist that's an ai composite of a face so you can use this face anywhere on your website copyright free because nobody's going to be like hey dude that's me um this is like such a useful funny website and it shows you in the bottom right it'll tell you exactly how the image was created it's like it was imagined by a gan which is a type of machine learning thing or whatever um here's how it works you can use it yourself yeah blah blah and watch this you can use it for cats and horses and chemicals it's like this camp this cat does not exist and you can like click a cat and it'll like ai generate a cat yeah this is amazing i usually just take screenshot of those and i use those on like different websites and so uh so yeah those are three three ideas i think i said student essay generation uh unreal voices for voiceovers voice-overs and never you know never having to basically turning your voice into a programmable asset and then patterns and prints and that's just like that's not even saying some of the obvious ones that i met the other ones i mentioned like stocks this is great [Applause] [Music] a million dollars isn't cool you know what's cool a billion dollars [Music] all right i have something for you have you heard of john steinberg is he the guy who did cheddar yeah so listen to this story and and i'm gonna there's a reason why i'm telling you but let me tell you the story so basically john steinberg was the ceo of buzzfeed for a long time i think when he joined buzzfeed it was like 20 people so he wasn't quite the co-founder but he was he worked his way up to be ceo and he was like the ad sales guy he became ceo and he kind of was like pushing it hard and it was almost like a co-founder of buzzfeed and he's incredibly aggressive very aggressive and he started this thing years ago like eight years ago or maybe six years ago called cheddar and the whole shtick was that it was going to be a live tv station for facebook live and when he launched it we were just getting started and he like messaged me he goes have we met yet which was just an alpha like just such an alpha way to like hey i forgot your name yeah he was like hey dave i was like dude it's uh it says samurai we're on facebook you i know you're sorry about it you're bad with names and faces yeah what he goes have we met yet we should meet that's what he said and i go okay cool he goes i'm in san francisco what's your office i'll come tomorrow that's what he said and i was like all right yeah so i hang out with them nice nice guy incredibly aggressive basically told me that like buzzfeed was great but he wanted to sell or something or i don't know if he said this or i read about it but like he wanted an exit and it didn't happen so like he was like i'm just gonna build this thing and i'm gonna have an exit and he's told me he goes what's gonna happen is i'm gonna raise a little bit of money like 30 million dollars um it's going to do pretty good and then a big cable company is going to buy us because it's just going to be cheaper for them to buy us and to go make one of these cable uh like like a 24-hour news network on their own and they're going to buy us for like 200 or 300 million dollars and at the time and even at the time they got bought no one watched this thing you'd go into the facebook live and like there'd be like 20 people watching at any given point it was all on facebook and like no one watched it and i remember thinking like this guy's crazy this is not going to work no one wants this is this is nonsense this is a bad business this is a bad company and two years in he told me he goes in year two or three we're gonna get acquired for a couple hundred million bucks in year three i think he sold the business for 250 million dollars 100 percent called his shot if you google cheddar company to a cable company to like an australian cable company that i never heard of i think they're popular in new york i think they have like a thing in new york too and he sold it and he totally pulled it off and he completely disappeared he fell off the map before he was like speaking at all these conferences but he called this shot and he nailed it and i remember talking to other guys who worked in the media industry and they're like yeah he told me the exact same thing and he absolutely called this shot and this guy is so aggressive man he's a shark not in a bad way but like he just bulldozed through this it just puts so much intensity and energy and he pulled it off but the reason i'm bringing this up he did it and another woman who we're friends with rebecca did i asked her how she got popular on youtube she was like well i just quit my job and i like worked 50 hours a week and i had like i got up at nine and i like worked till seven and like i studied the data and i just treated it like a business and it like became popular now i make you know seven or eight figures whatever she makes a year and i'm rich and famous and whatever it worked because i was talented and i worked hard and i treated like a job what i think is going to happen and we this is a little circle jerky because both you and i like twitter i think that very few people take twitter seriously enough to do that you know like five or eight years ago we'd be like mr beast you're gonna like dedicate your life to youtube that's the stupidest thing ever that won't work like what are you doing this is just a hobby this is a joke now it's not it's not funny like we all know that like that's real you can become a youtuber and you know you could be like mr peace and make hundreds of millions of dollars a year you become a tick tocker and become like some of these other famous people and do all this crazy stuff no one takes that seriously about twitter where they think like well you know if you just like quit and like take this seriously and like build a following and like write interesting stuff and i think in the next two or three years we might see like a few empires be built on top of twitter and it sounds kind of silly now because like oh it's just these like stupid like you know twitter threads of guys talking about x y and z and summarizing wikipedia and they're kind of right but i think that there's going to be someone on twitter that treats it kind of like cheddar did it's kind of like mr beast and they take it really seriously and i think there's actually a huge opening and a huge gap in the market right now where very few people are taking it seriously and it's incredibly easy to capitalize on this second right now this is one of the more interesting things i feel like you said this is i actually i don't even think you normally think like this i feel like this is a like uh this is not your you say a lot of interesting stuff but it's you you usually fall into i found this really interesting diamond in the rough you're amazing at that another is i see what these people are doing and let me break it down in simple terms like all they're doing is x and sometimes you're like uh you know this is a trend or an industry i see this is different this is like this is something it's not the difference i like i like that you're bringing this up let's break this down so every degree with me at first when you i think you tweeted this out and i was like i don't really understand what he's talking i didn't really understand it uh then you just explained it and it's i'm starting to come around on it i'm like oh wait he's kind of right every big social media platform has like native stars so yes if you're uh you know whatever you're the president and you go on twitter you're gonna get a bunch of followers that's one thing but basically if you take every medium so podcasting you have joe rogan you have like then the people like joe rogan you have to call her daddy's and you have like other tim ferriss you have other people who like they become stars on that platform and they use that to build a pretty big empire you know tens of millions if not hundreds of millions that they can make of it youtube obviously there's youtubers tick tock has tick tock stars people who were not famous on youtube but got famous on tick tock instagram also right there's instagram models and instagram like influencers that they were nobody and they became big on instagram multi-billion dollar companies you know kardashians rihanna like these like huge things well i think they rihanna kardashians they were big off of instagram they were very big without it like instagram also and instagram add turbocharged to them but like there are other people that are you know um just instagram like instagram made them famous like dan bilzerian is a good example right like he's not famous without instagram then with instagram he becomes famous and then now he does multiple platforms right but by the end everybody does multiple platforms but you kind of you're really good at the medium so like for example dan buzarian takes photos of himself blowing up cars with hot girls making bikinis guess what instagram is a visual like you know put one killer image on there and they're amazing at it and so uh that worked really well there you're kind of right who is that on twitter who is who is a twitter native star i don't even know what that would be like is there somebody who's there i mean there's a there's a few like i would say like and i'm on twitter 10 times a day like how do i not know this like you and i are like very miniature versions but we haven't really like i'm talking like sahil's a bigger version so our friend sahil bloom trung who used to work for me he is kind of like that but you know we're still talking like 500 000 followers no one has really pushed it to where it's like how do i get 10 or 20 million you know how do i become like how do i build a proper empire as opposed to a niche now the difference is uh basically between everything you mentioned and twitter is twitter is copy-based text-based whereas the other ones are visual based so i think there's one of two routes that's going to happen you figure out how to add visuals to your thing and videos don't usually do that well on twitter but pictures do or you just get really good at writing and i was like well writing's at that port but i'm like wait no i'm an idiot like you know who danielle steele or james patterson is yeah yeah yeah these people have sold literally like i believe danielle steele has sold like a hundred million plus books i don't know if you know this but in san francisco she's got like the biggest mansion in the baddest house yeah billionaires row her house is like the big fortress yeah and then you got james patterson i bet you he's a billionaire too james patterson basically writes like 50 books a year i don't even know if he writes a lot of them if he just smacks his logo on it but like you know i was thinking like well here that sounds outrageous but okay uh i i forget but it's maybe one week it's like one a month it'll say like you know um what he does is like it'll be like uh written by james patterson and bill clinton and then it says like and also this other name and it's like a duo about them it's like a story written about like the white house or something like that and he like partners it's like this weird thing that he does he he writes a ton he's prolific and a lot of like like real quote authors like these like artists folks are like oh that's just garbage but he's like dude i don't care i'm pumping this [ __ ] out anyway authors like definitely crush it still and the power of the written word is very powerful enough to like you know get these people to buy all these books and i still think that's possible but i i do think that we're gonna see like an empire built on top of twitter arguably you and i have created we've easily created uh seven figures of personal income through twitter maybe you could say even i would have to add it up maybe eight figures but a lot uh i think though that there's gonna be literally billionaires created on twitter and it hasn't happened yet though wow uh yeah what's we can't call ours empires like what's what's a very very small like a lego like a convenience store yeah like we we've played like a quickie mart uh yeah we own like four burger kings you want to me and you're right that sahil and trung are good examples of like they actually try so like they like religiously write content they schedule it they research it they like publish they like try to amplify it they have called action at the bottom and it works and i've seen them crawl from zero to stop hills at like half a million maybe more i don't know uh a lot of people don't even know that trung so trunk worked at the hustle he wrote the daily email we found him when he was working at like a as a financial analyst not like it was all internal reports we like he signed up for twitter while he worked at my company and we all like shared each other in this like silly circle jerk circle and now he's got 600 000 followers and he's like a personality and like people know him like they talk about him and how he's funny and all this stuff and i think it's gonna happen and like when i tweeted out that event thing a thousand people signed up and i'm like oh my god like why aren't you actually see instagram like you'll see like the logan the jake pauls and logan paul they'll like say like i'm gonna be when they're starting on youtube they're like we're gonna be at this location come and they film all these crazy videos of all these people around us no one's doing that [ __ ] for twitter and i think that someone needs to just take the youtuber playbook and just deploy it here and take it full time and seriously and they could create tens or hundreds of millions of dollars of wealth and so what would you do because like i think well the guys we talked about they you know sahil basically does like kind of like mental model intellectual like stuff or it's like oh you know either like kind of what i'll call like the generic life advice generic business advice or like um you know hey let me tell you about this phenomenon in psychology about cognitive biases and here's 30 cognitive biases you you want to be aware of and like i don't know why these do so well they do incredibly well uh that's not my cup of tea but it's definitely other people's cup of tea for that here's what they need to do here's how you cross the chasm here's how you cross this threshold so basically these guys are popular on this twitter medium and twitter is a it feels like a one to one a little bit or maybe like a one to ten it's like me and my ten friends like consume this and we'll joke about it but i'm not talking to a guy on the train or i'm not like telling a family member like hey uh you know did you guys see x y and z like we're not talking about that so what they need to do is two things number one they need to meet up with like mainstream celebrity people or like mainstream people and take pictures with them and show it and it's like oh man this guy's like bigger than just my little audience look at this like these people like arnold schwarzenegger likes this person and took a photo with them that's amazing the second thing that they need to do is they need to get off of twitter and into real life so for example in the early 2010s when the caspers of the world were coming out uh subways in manhattan were underpriced for the billboards and a couple of these companies like subway oscar they go let's advertise on these billboards down in the subway and then we'll actually buy real billboards and people are like why would you do that like we could track all this on the internet and they're like well because if we get it out off the internet it's going to seem more than just an online thing and it's going to feel more like a real tangible thing you know you're going to see like this ad next to like uh you know a ford ad and next to this thing it's going to feel like this is actually a little bit more legitimate and so what they need to figure out is how to do that so you do that by having real life events you do that by like getting a book that you publish you get that by getting a cameo on a tv show and you like get everyone in on the joke it's like hey everyone check this out uh they asked me to be a background on friends like here look you can see my head in that hilarious like you do these things like that where it's like real life and like bigger than just this one to ten thing and then people start taking you seriously and realize that it creates fomo and it creates um social proof and you start becoming actually culturally relevant you know what i mean and that's how you should do it so you just like take pictures with you and celebrities and then try to uh get in more in-person stuff so you're off the internet and i think that would work yeah i think i think that's good advice like uh people will believe about you what you believe about yourself and um and also people will believe about you what they think others believe about you so if i see you hanging out you know if i see that's why youtube works right like people on youtube will have like you know or instagram they'll have like they're taking a picture but it's actually the background that's the picture it's like i'm just trying to show you that i'm sitting in this car or at this place or with these people and um there's like everything that's said is actually in the background the foreground is just kind of like your excuse to say it or when casey neistat's like walking through new york and he has kids coming up to him he goes hey what's up kid say hi to the you're on the vlog like you know what i mean it's like oh wow like in new york casey gets recognized everywhere he's more than just what i see on my screen and like celebrities do this they like when they like tip off you know the paparazzi to come like take pictures of them and they're like they like pretend like they're trying to not be seen but then like they actually it's like a deal like hey dude i'm going to be here come on come show up and take my photo and then we're going to use that photo for this or they'll like you know do stuff like that so so i think that's a thing like i had a buddy who created a he's got like an online e-commerce brand they open up their first store the store's not gonna do that many sales but just showing that hey we opened our first store in new york it's like kind of like you know wherever in new york some like small place and it's like just that makes it feel like this brand is more trustworthy it's more established it's more legit and then they had a bunch of friends like 15 friends show up and they were like doing a rubbing uh ribbon cutting ceremony and the friends are all like hey well yeah hey question for you like you know like trying to pretend like they're the media and um and and like if you zoomed out it's like 10 people standing in a small arrester but like from the right angle it looked like a mob was at the store and again it's like this perception creates some version of reality so i definitely think that helps i don't think that's enough to build the empire i think you got to do two things one be in it for like the next seven years like mr beast all these guys they didn't start with like you know as big as they are it takes like five to seven years to build something like really truly massive the second is i would stop trying to jump off twitter and go to other places and be like this is where the good [ __ ] is i'm going to master this medium and this medium totally i'm going to make it work here the third is i would do some of the stuff that just helps build fame in the first place so um i think having your lane or your niche helps because it'll attract people who are interested in that second controversy or collabing with others i think it's going to work you know and people don't do controversial stuff really on twitter right now but it should be like oh my god i called in to like this show and i got you know how people used to call into howard stern and like get him to like say this crazy [ __ ] like check this out got him you know what i mean well some people do it that uh and it works like there's a guy who's doing this with zach weinberg or something like that yeah he literally loved that guy built and sold like i don't know a two billion dollar company in like the biotech space or some [ __ ] like that but why does everybody know him because he's the guy who just will consistently [ __ ] on crypto he just is challenging people to fight about crypto and he's just trying to debate them in public and embarrass them that is this whole shtick and he's getting so much fame for dunking on people in crypto and um because there's a set of audience that likes to a watch a fight and b that likes to that is anti-crypt that has some anti-crypto feelings and they're like he is their champion you go debate people because i don't know if i would be able to and so that's that's exactly how shapiro got famous too by the way and on top of that then you have like keith or boy or whatever people who are just like a dick to other people like he'll just like respond to somebody like wrong and they're like well explain like you know i'd love to hear your perspective and he's like i don't share my perspective with [ __ ] losers like he's like he'll like he'll [ __ ] on you once and then he'll even if you try in good faith to come back he'll be like the data is out there go read a book and yeah one time he was like one time the best thing goes i've forgotten more about startups and you'll ever even know yeah exactly or he'll be like call me after your sixth unicorn because that's where i am or whatever you know like he he's like you know obnoxiously just like [ __ ] on people and it's hilarious and because of that like the controversy spread some people hate him some people love him and uh he kind of uses that to to to grow so anyways i think controversy is also another underrated thing there's a bunch of things that people need to do but i would say the main one is like find your your angle your hook your niche like for casey neistat it's the daily vlog for other people it's the explainer videos it's like whatever you gotta find that for you on twitter and then like do it for five to seven years and have faith that like just like it wasn't obvious that being a youtuber was just such a big deal back then i think it's not that obvious you know to your point that you could do this on twitter too yeah i uh so that's my that's my i'm that's my pitch i think it could be cool all right can i tell you about something that i kind of knew about but has recently blown my mind yeah it's the teal fellowship so you know that's amazing what the teal fellowship is ben i'm curious do you know what the teal fellowship has come come off from you for a bit cause i think sam already knows i want to talk somebody who's maybe more where the audience is which may you know aware but not familiar yeah so i know the teal fellowship is i'll tell you just my impression of someone who doesn't know a ton about it it's just that it's for essentially high schoolers who are super geniuses and peter thiel is going to give you a bunch of money in order to not go to college and do something cool instead uh kind of you're in it's actually i think it's actually for people in college to leave college for a year so 100k to basically leave college for a year and work on something interesting and uh ben if i asked you like hey is it like successful unsuccessful do you have any idea um no except for that i know um uh what's his name did it uh the guy who did ethereum vitalik yeah exactly metallic yeah yeah so by the way i still haven't told my vitalik story on air which is i was in amsterdam and i saw him and i couldn't think what to say and he's walking right past me and i just turned and went you're vitalik and he didn't like look or say anything he just kept walking but it was him did he have security with him no he was walking all alone on the streets of amsterdam at 8 am in the morning it's just us our software is the worst have you heard of hubspot see most crms are a cobble together mess but hubspot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous i think i love our new crm our software is the best hubspot grow better yeah we need to protect this man he never has security with him and he's just like wanders around to random cafes and goes to events and stuff like this i'm like dude yeah i really hope he's got such good security that he just can't see them i'll that's what i'll tell myself um so this teal fellowship thing is amazing the teal fellowship was exactly what you said uh peter thiel comes out peter thiel is the kind of uh original founder of paypal he was the first investor in facebook put 500k into facebook early on which became hundreds of millions of dollars not billions of dollars and um also a prolific investor and a bunch of other things including spacex and other businesses so peter thiel comes out and he basically says uh college education is a bubble he says um college education is sort of a joke he's like you know it hides under this this this like banner like it's teaching you something like you're getting information but really what you're getting is some version of like an insurance policy like i got this degree so i'm not going to fall through the cracks of society and you're getting like you know some status symbol like i got this stamp on my thing so it's like a luxury it's like a luxury product like wearing a nice bag your harvard degree is like your louis vuitton bag and uh and so he talks about college and he's like it's costs just keep going up and up and up but the value and the the salaries that you make don't go up um and so it's this like overpriced bubble just like the housing bubble he says and he says i'm going to offer um i'm going to offer something called the teal fellowship which is a hundred thousand dollars if you drop out of college and go work on something interesting and a bunch of people criticize them they say uh dude you know how dare you you're telling kids like the normal phrase is kids stay in school you're like we get it you're contrarian you're saying kids don't say and go stay in school and you're like trying to get people to drop out like what kind of like you're worse than a vape you know and so uh you know people didn't like what he was doing and other people were just like oh it's cool but like you know who knows if this is gonna work or not like all right you're gonna pay this kid 100 grand to you know do a summer project great so what this thing is amazing it is producing it worked out really well didn't it and nobody talks about it so let me tell you some of the things that have come out of this um you have like you said ethereum which is like a 170 billion dollar market cap thing that came from vitalik probably like this generation's version of facebook is like you know is ethereum so that comes out of this where vitalik does the teal fellowship and uh continues you know working on ethereum during that time and uh and he launches so that's one super super super successful thing also figma which is like a somewhere between five and ten billion dollars closer to company that takes on adobe in the design space and uh dylan who is you know the founder of figma was in the was in the teal fellowship uh another one oyo rooms so this is in india it's like a um you know kind of like a airbnb-ish sort of thing it's like a hospitality uh you know website oh your rooms multi-billion dollar company tens of billions luminar technologies um most people don't know this it's a like lidar company that basically uh the technology you need for self-driving cars and this thing i think went public in a spac this guy's like i don't know 21 22 years old 23 years old something like that and he's worth like a billion dollars he's like one of the world's youngest billionaires if not the youngest billionaire off of this thing um that is just alone is crazy also polka dot another crypto protocol valued at you know seven billion dollars um like i just told you basically 200 billion dollars worth of business value that has come from this program and it's but then there's way more there's actually like a uh dozens that are in like the hundred million dollar range i invested in a company that recently raised another round i think it was owner.com the guy adam he uh he was a teal fellow and i believe i mean that that that potentially could be a unicorn but it's hundreds of millions for sure uh and there's like dozens more like that the reason i got reminded of this was because i invest in italic and jeremy kai is the founder of italian and he was like oh yeah i was a teal fellow that's how i i was like how did we meet eventually he's like oh yeah i was a teal fellow we came to your office and you gave a talk and i thought it was awesome and so that's why we kept in touch and i was like dude was it vitalik in the room he's like i don't think he's like i don't think he was at that event but he's like dude he used to like crash on our couch like you know he was part of the program and he's like he's i was like what was he like he's like he's genuinely the weirdest person ever like the weirdest person i've ever met and like he's like yeah in a good way in a bad way nothing like he's just nothing like nothing like i've ever seen just a different different sort of cat and i was like this is this is too good i think i think you should uh keep using the word cat by the way you like how i did that i've been yeah i'm workshopping right now yeah it looks good on you yeah i take it out for a spin i take it out of the garage you know you know twice a week and i just see do people kind of like flinch when i say that you know um it was a good flinch tried it with lit and that was i had to put that one back in storage no you're not coming back out i put that one on ebay actually got rid of it yeah no you're yeah you're you're you're too much of a grey bush for that one but cat yeah cat was cool i would stick with cat but it is crazy man this the peter thiel i thought at first it was real uh it was kind of stupid i'm like dude this is weird like one of these like little 18 year old nerds like they're not gonna do anything interesting obviously i was wrong um yeah like when i when i was like rethinking my opinion on it i was like wow i guess just like high iq matters like these guys they're just they have more power than i do i i always say they're just they're high you're higher functioning than me you know that's just the only way i can describe it you have more horsepower your oven burns hotter and it actually it it it truly matters and it makes a difference your oven burns hotter it's so good oh god i love that you know what i mean they just got that they got that that heater furnace that's how i felt when i was at twitch i was like uh i was like okay let's see what are the like you know i had kind of had opinions from the outside like okay at these big tech companies what are the people like what are the exact like what are the average people like you know how hard do they work how smart are they like you know do they have like all these processes that are way better than the messy stuff i was doing at my startup and like you know for the most part i would say it's kind of like you know i walked out a little cockier than i came in and i came in pretty cocky and that's what i was you know just sort of like oh okay like you know they don't have some magic you know processes or the people aren't that much better except like two or three people at the company one of which is emmett who's the founder you know we would sit down and there would be like you know data science would be presenting some report on like you know some trends and i'm just sitting there trying to like it's a six page memo i'm trying to like stop yawning because it's like i'm just like why do i keep yawning i'm having this like you know reflex and i'm reading this thing i'm just trying to understand these charts and like you just hear this little click and it's like someone's pen is down and it's like you you know if you're taking a math that's like who's done with the test already and it would be emmet he'd be like pens down he'd be playing hearthstone on his phone and you're like no he like he must have already read this or like anybody he must just skim and then then they're like all right yeah we're ready to start the discussion and he would be like so on page three you know this chart actually i noticed that the axis is a little wrong because you know if this was true then well then this other chart on page seven would show this i'm like what the you know what is happening how is your brain processing this much information this quickly and somehow always getting to like like the harder the issue it's like we all spent our time and energy like trying to parse out what's important like he immediately got to what was important and had the conclusion and had like the follow-up question and also identified why this piper wasn't very good in the first place and once i saw the brain doing that i was like oh okay there's just some cars you know have more horsepower like or as you said the oven burns a little hotter and like his oven burns way hotter than mine and i was like oh that's good to know like because i have this thing i always say i like to see what level 12 looks like like what is oh that speaker system's a little too loud for me but like i want to know what volume on 12 even is i want to feel you know my own chest leader like vibrating with the bass and it's like okay i don't want to be somebody who never sees it i want to see it what was he like in like real life like outside of work because have you ever seen some of these people interact in like normal like life like they like i told you about one friend that's like intense and he literally only owns a two t-shirts one pair of underwear one pair of socks and his laptop that's like the only thing he owns so he's worth hundreds of millions of dollars and then like i know a bunch of these guys that are like this and like for hobbies they're just all in and like so if they're into like uh you know like [ __ ] their body or something they've got like every gadget you could ever imagine in their they they could tell you all about it and or if they're into dieting they've got like their pants like my friend jack he's in a uh supplements he and he's got literally thirty thousand dollars worth of supplements in a closet and they'd be like what's this dude what's this do what's this do you just like test everything what was he like in uh like like was he like if he's into cars could he like tell you every single thing about like a porsche and what year it was from and why it was special yeah yes but before i tell you about him uh i just read this thing that was like about sergey brin like the co-founder of google and it's like oh what is sir like you know cause he's in the news because of the his wife and elon all that stuff and some people like what is sergey doing nowadays because he's not i don't think he's at google anymore um and it said over the last year or two he's become very into personal fitness in fact he has been trying to master several olympic sports i was like what dude i don't know man i looked at this guy what like what olympic sport pig pong i don't know yeah curling um yeah the other one is they said he's currently writing a physics textbook and i was like of course he's writing a physics textbook like that's more like come on yeah um so anyways yeah these guys are wired like that where like when they go in they go in like very deep uh honestly i don't know him super well because i interacted mostly at work um and anytime it was outside of work it was it was really cool but it was like you know limited it wasn't like i hung out with them like a hundred times it would maybe be more like five times you know something like that over the couple years that i was there um what i would say is like a couple of little things that stood out one he's like us he's an idea machine in fact i need to get him on the podcast because you've been saying that for three years now i know i know and when i was there i didn't ask him because i was like uh you know already you know me doing this podcast is not you know yeah you're like if you want to bail at noon and go and record yeah it's not everyone's favorite thing i do um you know but but i think now i could do it um but he would like he told me this idea he's like i tell you about his gym idea no he's like he's like jim's he's like gyms need to be uh made like video games if i was gonna leave twitch i might start this uh a gym that's structured like a video game so he's like this is how it works you show up and you're like at the beginning character of a game like you show up and we give you kind of like your basic uniform and we have a little little wrist strap that like tracks your level of like fitness and intensity as you work out and you like basically level up and so like every time you come to the gym you're earning points and like as you earn points like we give you like better gear like we'll give you the like the the more fitted you know clothes that look cooler and so you can like visibly see people's different levels as they go to the gym you would be able to like go into certain sections of the gym that were previously locked to you you would be able to get like protein shakes and stuff for free and he's like uh he's like i think if you gamify a gym people would come more and like actually this is kind of played out with peloton peloton is very much organized like this with leaderboards and stuff like that gamification but i was like this is a crazy idea he's like yeah it'd be like the world of warcraft of gyms like people would grind like years of their life to level up their character to 60 and they would like work to do it he's like i think you could do that with with a gym i was like wow yeah i mean people do that with like karate and jiu jitsu you know black belt brown belt blue belt exactly and they stick with it and they keep showing up because they're 10 plus years and he's like but you know you don't want the increments to be like a year before you see some progress like every time you come you need to be earning a little bit more and getting a little bit more unlocked you know and see that the next milestone is just within reach um so i thought that was interesting the second one he was like uh he was like trying to plug in the computer to like screen share one time with me like uh like normally these meetings like set up by somebody else but like if it's just youtube like hey you gotta do it plug it in and he's like these [ __ ] cables he's like you know honestly i think i could create like the apple for like accessories for computer accessories he's like just like the best connecting cables the best cable management the best plugs he's like he's like nobody's like look at this it's like every office in the world has these and look at how bad they look how ugly they are how poorly they function how confusing they are he's like i think you could just build like a really nicely designed cables and connectors and accessories company for every office in the country and like you know people would uh people would pay for it and i was like like why do you think of these things like this is weird and so that's what people say about you he had a dozen ideas that were like this what was there all right that's one thing that i noticed we'll wrap this up real quick but i um there's this famous story so this guy named chris sacco was a popular investor and invested in uh instagram and a bunch of other stuff in uber and he's supposed to be one of the best angel investors of all time he told this story somewhere where he is in tahoe or truckee where he has a home and he's with his dad and travis kalanick right when he was about to start uber came over to just spend the weekend you know family vacation and travis um and and chris sack his dad mr saka they start playing uh wii tennis and travis is playing and the dad's playing and they just like are being casual and travis was like all right you want to step it up so he steps it up and he just crushes them and he just beats this guy like so bad and uh mr sack was like what the hell man and travis goes i've got a surprise to show you and he puts the wii from his left hand into his right hand he goes i was playing left-handed the whole time i'm actually right-handed let's really play and he goes travis goes all right but i do have to tell you something and they go to the ratings board and he's number two in the whole world at wii tennis and chris sacca was like right then and there i realized i never want to compete against this guy because his drive and his hobby is winning and he just proved that like in his free time of starting this company he's just going to be number one in the world at wii tennis just cuz just because he has to and he just hustled my dad thinking that he was left-handed and it worked perfectly this guy is a winner and that's why chris sakaka said he invested in his like i just see his intensity and just walking around dude 100 agree peter thiel same way he's like a master or grand master at chess and like the in the paypal mafia which is now like the most successful entrepreneur group ever uh i think several of them were like very very high level chess players um that that have gone through that you know that like we're in that thing there's like something to the the oven burns hotter that's like true for some of these people it's a combination of intensity and capability um that is that is definitely true like uh another kind of like observation that i was like huh that's weird that doesn't seem normal um so i guess two little ones one was i was like what do you do for fun like what do you when you hang out like what are you doing he's like oh like i love board games he's like you should come over like a board game night and i was like uh okay like what what are we playing like you know monopoly like twister what do we got going here and he's like because this is like that'd be like we only play like deep strategy games and it was like we only play katan on like hard mode or like even katan it's like the beginner one you like name two other games i don't even know about like you know are like this the like the board games that are like actually you know like multi-level multi-hour strategy games and basically it was him and the brothers from stripe and like the founder of reddit and they would just get together and play these games on the weekend that's what they did that's exactly how i want them to spend their time exactly so i thought that was kind of funny and then the the other one was like um we were in a meeting and he we were talking about like i don't know like some policy like oh these you know whatever yes some girl streaming on twitch and like her nipples showing like is that okay but it's like you know she lives in denmark you know what are the rules around this should we ban her or like what and and so there was always these policy questions coming up over and over and over again and it felt like you can't win because whatever twitch did it was like oh dude they're trying to control us censor us like they're inconsistent they should have also changed it over here like it was a no-win policy and then you know like he would he would have these like he would have these hobbies which is like reading like old books that nobody would read like no normal person is reading these books and then he'd be able to connect the dots on two like completely unrelated things it's sort of like ben's podcast stuff where it's like oh actually like you know the rothschilds similarly set this up in a you know set up their will in a weird way because of this maybe you should do this like dude how do you know all this like really specific stuff from history he would be like do you know how the potato farmers govern their like you know farms in the netherlands during the potato drought and then like the head of policy is like no just tell me what he's like actually they created this governing council that was blah blah blah and like the cool thing about this rule of law was well maybe we should you know you should read that like tell me what you think about it and they're like all right like where do i find this like out of print book that you read like randomly and you remember what the potato farmers did and so he would always bring these like really unrelated examples in um that was one thing and the other one was you he would debate you over semantics like to death so you would be like um you know like it'd be like an exec offside he'd be like and some people like you know i just feel like we don't want enough like trust on the team and everyone's like nodding like yeah you know like you know he's like collaboration is a problem or whatever and he'd be like well is it trust or collaboration because trust means this and collaboration means this like well you know just like the general like trust collaboration just working together better he's like but like again define for me what you mean when you say trust i just want to make sure i have it right and he's not trying to like it's not a gotcha he wants he's like a hyper literal person so he's like when you say it's failing i take that to mean it's failing is it failing or is it this other thing and people are like just getting lost in the sauce of this like semantical debate um but like he really wanted to be hyper literal about it and i've never seen anybody do this in a you know there were upside that became a bad example here but like i think you understand the general premise which is that he really cared about words what they mean and why we're using them and if we're using them correctly to describe what's going on and everybody else was kind of hand-wavy about stuff especially like the higher you go up an organization you sort of get paid for being sort of high hand wavy like a politician and he was the opposite of that so these were some of the things i noticed that now when i invest in founders i'm like like invested this guy who created something called ski-o and he's like yeah i'm just like i was like what'd you do before this he's like oh it's a professional call of duty player like before that i was you know i was like grinding in world of warcraft like uh it was a waste of time but like yeah i was you know top three in the world or whatever it's like what uh oh you were like a top three starcraft player like you know in this on the on the east coast server like okay you're a winner and you're obsessive and you are like you find the rules of the game and then you like optimize to win it and sure enough now like with his thing he's like a wrecking ball with like acquiring customers because he just find this is the new game and he's like finding rules and he's like maximizing his edge in everything that he can do to the point where he's kind of like a nut job uh dude but like you know it works at the end of episodes like this i'm exhausted i feel like i just exerted so much energy both listening and speaking do you have to take a nap at the end of this because you just spoke like with incredibly high energy for we've done this for we're an hour and 17 minutes in do you get exhausted i i take naps after no not at all i uh i leave these on a high um so do i but then i need to go to always you well yeah you never have water i usually drink three drinks while i'm i'm doing these but like i'm exhausted i get exhausted just listening well that's probably my fault so i'm sorry no no it's a good exhausted i'm like god i just learned so much and i need to get so much better at this this and this by hearing this story and i was just so intensely listening and enthralled by this conversation that i need a nap i've got to go lay down i gotta go rest balogie went on tim ferriss's podcast and did like a three-hour podcast and i listened to it last night and like literally while it was happening i could feel my brain fatiguing just trying to like digest what this man was saying he's so sp and by the way you also hear tim tim ferriss sound i loved him first tim ferriss sounds like an absolutely defeated man on these podcasts with biology because biology would be like um anarcho you know on one hand you have the world capitalist on the other hand you have the anarcho uh anarch the anarcho-capitalist do you know what i mean when i say that and tim's like no tell me and like that happens 40 times in the episode he's like um are you familiar with the concept of the you know the schrodinger window it tim's like um no but i assume you can tell me and he's like he just does that over and over and over dude one time when he was with us he was like he was like you know bitcoin is kind of like battle of the bulge and you remember how the germans were doing i'm like dude i don't i needed an analogy for your analogy like you don't please don't reference battle of the bulge would try to explain a complicated topic like right now i was like you know bitcoin's kind of like uh like neuroscience like you know how like the chemicals of like this this and this interact this way think about the big bitcoin is the amygdala of the crypto ecosystem dude i don't know yeah that's what was happening and uh i guess i did that to you in this case but no you're you're well you're way dumber i could totally keep up with that it just was a good story you just talked more no i thought it was good that was a compliment i get exhausted because i'm like so into it like i like i i i love hearing these stories so much we used to do these mastermind like dinners or hangouts where it'd be me sam and like three other guys and we'd meet up every two weeks or three weeks something like that and it would always be like you know each person gets 20 minutes and you sort of say what's going on in your business what's working what and what you want help what you want the other guys to like you know basically help you think through and then and those things last basically if you just do the math it's like six people 20 minutes each but everybody runs 10 minutes over and like you know we start 10 minutes late it's like this thing is three hours long and we would always start it after work so we'd started at like seven it would finish at 10 10 30. uh we skipped dinner nobody's like gone to the bathroom and basically there was two reactions some people were like [ __ ] exhausted by the end of this and they're like uh this is great but like man next time let's try to be a little shorter uh and like i get that logically my reaction and we used to do some of these at your office i remember at the hustle's office i don't know if you noticed i would leave your office at 10 10 30 and i would go straight to my office and i would just work for four or five straight hours because i can't do that i was so inspired i was like a combination of inspired by the like your guys's awesomeness um panicked that like oh my god i have so much i need to do that i now realize and like oh [ __ ] i need to do all of this and i'm just gonna try to do as much as i can tonight uh and like i was is a combination of like enthusiasm and like feeling overwhelmed by like the amount of potential and ideas and like stuff i could be doing to make our stuff grow more no i gotta go like drink gatorade and take a power nap yeah i need to fuel up i better go eat a cliff bar i get warm now i'm like my blood sugar's low i can feel it [Laughter] i guess that's the episode right then [Music] you

the hospital software guy here's what he said uh you'll like this his was simpler he's like he said yeah like agree with all that stuff uh here's how we thought about it um we need to have 500 sales people that can sell a million dollars worth of product a year um or 250 oh oh sorry 500 that could sell half a million a year or 250 that could sell a million dollar as their sales quota per year so we just work backwards from that all right what features products and like people do we need to like let a salesperson like get 500 sales people that can sell half a million dollars a year of like sales credit like first is that even possible can the can this market support that yes the market is very big hospitals spend a lot of money in health care and in our category they spend more than much more than that [Music] all right we're live so look um i you said sean that you didn't want to like do an event because you didn't want to travel i decided to host one anyway it's just like a meetup but do you see the you saw the link that i posted like the eventbrite thing it's no big deal but you see it yeah you posted like an event in new york with you uh and a bunch of other like kind of tech buddy friends no just saw him just me and sahil i was just like i wanted to just shoot out it i was like i want to get out of the house i want to do something you said no and dude a thousand people have rsvp'd and i have no idea where we're gonna host it i have no idea what we're gonna do i don't have a plan i know nothing i don't know it sounded like you had a plan you were like we're moving it to this other place and it sounded like something's in the world some guy dm'd me on twitter and said i'll help you find a vid a venue and i said great you're in charge i don't know his name but cool you're it don't take facts hope it works and then i got nick gray the uh the small party guy to come and i was like dude just come and organize this and you could sell books there but uh i don't know what i'm gonna do would it be lame for just stand around and just say hi yeah kind of lame well what the [ __ ] what am i supposed to do juggle i don't know should have thought of that before you posted it bro like we did the live pod thing uh in austin miami and honestly i don't think it was very good i don't think listening to a podcast live is that entertaining and they'll and unless it's like a planned like comedy skit unless like we like planned like we had a bit you know what i mean like stage play yeah well no just like that's what comedians do right you know it's like scripted but they also kind of flow a little bit but yeah or you're just so big that people like simply the idea of seeing you live is that entertaining like i don't think we're there yet like i went to tim ferriss did a live thing once it was just him sitting on a chair fireside chat uh i've seen the guys who do um whatever that political thing is like john favreau or whatever they have like a political podcast pod pod saves america or something like that they do live shows and people just like geek out about meeting them and seeing them i don't think we're there yet um and also just in general i'm a big energy guy and basically my idea of a good time is where the energy is like steady up and rising to the right and like you know my idea of any kind of bad time is a dip in energy like the same way people feel about awkward silences in a conversation i feel about energy dips like if i sense the energy what is that or hang out because that's what happens when you do hey we're two dudes from twitter or a podcast let's talk in front of you or let's say hi like it's just kind of lame isn't it well maybe to say say hi that's not helpful though i i don't know what to do i gotta i have these people coming i here's what i think is gonna happen i think that they're not actually coming to see me i'm just the excuse for all these twitter dorks to see one another so i got an idea that i think would be dope that you could use for this um or we could use for something else but uh basically i was like okay um like i'll tell you i went to this event in la just now uh that my buddy romine threw and it's like whatever there's a conference but the day before the conference there's like the dinner and now this was like a ball or dinner it was like at uh the home of an nba team owners like on his rooftop looking at the beach it was like beautiful right but like even if it wasn't that baller of a of a surroundings like the house wasn't that sick this still would have been awesome because it's basically the table was full of like basically there was two tables each table had like one really famous person and then like two kind of famous people and then the rest were interesting but not famous people and just simply like there was a copy which one which one of those were you i was the just interesting person got it okay i just try to understand like the level of fame we're talking about no no i'm talking about like real fame like professional athlete actor that's that level of fame which actors were there i can't say the names of anybody that was there it was actually it was a it was an athlete event not not so much actors but like a list of people uh of the athletes it was like former a-list it's like a former b-list let's say it's like uh i you know i you're not on the cover of the video game but like you know i remember your name i've seen you play i had written university cards you know that gamer's attributes yeah yeah exactly i can tell you exactly i have memories of you playing the game not like a bench warmer so anyways but the my point is these dinner tape like basically just like a table and whether that table is like you're playing poker or you're eating food or something like that just like a round table of like eight people where the expectation is that hey we're all here to get to know each other like we're all here to talk and then you kind of can rotate i think we could do one of those for the mfm community where we take the like 10 or 15 like most baller guests so it's like andrew wilkinson has his table and you have your table i have my table and then steph smith has her table and ben has his table and like we just do this with like kind of like well-known business people we take you know we get whoever you know our famous guests a rob deer deck or we get biology or whatever we get some of these people to show up and then we curate the rest of the guest list is you are interesting but you're not necessarily famous so maybe you got a really interesting business maybe you're really like knowledgeable about some science or domain or something like that you're just like a nerd in your own right um but they're all fans and we basically just set up these tables and it's like whatever this room of ten tables and whether it's food or poker or something there's some activity to do while you're there just casually while you're talking and uh and you get to hop so you get to rotate between i don't know three or four of these tables while you're there random draws and uh and like that's the event i think people have more fun with some something like that because they participate than sitting in them and watching other people talk that's my my personal guess so i would do that for an mfm event bro great that's cool but i have a thousand people coming on can we have 10 people in a hundred person tables that's a lot that's a lot of a lot you don't have to let all thousands that was a interest list that wasn't uh you're you're accepted in right i don't know i do i made this was a toilet event i made it on my phone i was on toilet and i tweeted it out and it worked here's what i think you should do i think you should uh whatever you do something the sam way you're like all right everybody we're all meeting in this junkyard we're gonna look for cool scraps and like that'll filter out people you wanna hang out with it'll be a no headache event and then separately i will host this cool event that's well planned and you just have to show up to that you don't have to do any work um whatever we'll see uh can i talk to you about one thing really quick and then i wanna hear about your event dude have you listened to the full send podcast uh like not regularly but i've definitely seen clips like when they had dana white or mark cuban i see a bunch of clips i don't exactly understand what full send is but i know they're incredibly popular like it's i don't know if it's like a boy band where it's like four guys doing something or if it's just the two main guys and the rest are co-hosts but it's basically a group of like yeah go ahead can i explain what it is roughly so i'm also not an expert but it's basically the group is the milk boys that's like the main name of the group full send is like their brand and one of their podcasts and stuff like that but these guys are basically the way i think about it is they are like what jackass was when we were growing up that's what the elk boys are now so the so jackass back in the day was basically guys doing you know stunts pranks you know punching each other's balls basically a group of guys who are kind of like they're willing to go all out for your entertainment and their own amusement they kind of um they they live a certain lifestyle and it's kind of like the like if you take a boys like fantasy you just like crank it up to 12 it's like that's what these guys do the elk boys are a little bit like that they make youtube videos they got big on youtube they also have a bunch of brands so they have one brand that's basically an equivalent of girls gone wild it's like a paid membership club that's like for photos or videos of something i don't know i didn't know about that that's called i don't know ben find the name of that one um so that's one of their businesses that i think is really smart probably prints money they have merch that they drop and they've done merge drops uh they like show the live stream and they're like doing it obviously there's a little bit of hype but like whatever they're basically like the shopify dropshipper bro on steroids they'll do like two or three million dollars worth of sales in like five minutes when they do a drop so the new york times well new york times said last year they did about 80 million in revenue which is pretty good but right 50 million in merchandise it says i think yeah and then it said they're on track to do eight or maybe 70 the next year and this article is a year old and then uh they have this new shtick going on and ft they got all types of crap but then if you go to that link that i sent you each guy has like a video page and one of these guys his name is steve and i think this is like a point where i realized i'm out of touch he's just like giving away a million dollars in every video [Laughter] literally like mr beast playbook but he's like giving too much he's like here i just gave this guy a hundred thousand dollar watch i just gave this family two million dollars and in all these videos he goes yeah i'm gonna go uh give this guy a car and then he was with dana and he goes i'm gonna uh dana i just got this 400 000 van made it's yours um on one of the videos they gave a guy 250 000 in cash for his birthday on another thing they're giving away 200 000 just to her family in need like so whatever find videos but he's doing these multiple times a month these guys are going to run out of money right i have no idea how they give this much away or if they have so much give it away it's so it's actually just like you know you know like a stage thing or if there's some like caveats or whatever i have they they should do an apartment they show the guy's apartment and he's got uh his watch collection and i know a little bit of watches it's literally three million dollars worth of rolexes and then it's like well four million i believe that they could have dope stuff but literally giving away a million dollars kind of crazy and if i look at his youtube channel he does do that sometimes but like he has other ones like here's my three million dollar man cave here's you know uh here's me you know whatever buying this car or racing this car so that's a little different than giving it away but um i know like so did you watch when mr beast was doing this when he would go and he would basically give away thirty thousand fifty thousand dollars or he'd go into a twitch stream that has like two viewers he would just drop 20 grand in a donation and the person would freak out and that that clip would go viral like yeah did you see those and do you know how he was doing those i i know uh i know they exist and i saw them i don't know like the anything but behind behind one of the things that he was doing i don't know if this is the full story ben maybe you know you're friends with mr b so maybe you know you know he seems to consider you one of his top three closest friends uh that's a plan um you may know better but i remember meeting one guy who worked at this site called quid quib something like that quid i think it was and basically quid was like these like i don't know little collectible stickers and cards or something like that um it was kind of like aimed at a teenage audience and what they did was they would go to mr beast and they would say hey we'll pay you 50 000 for sponsor video and the genius of mr beast was he was like cool but here's what we're gonna do that's not you paying me for a shout out midway through one of my videos let's make the video about using fifty thousand dollars an interesting way how about that and so he would do these videos where he would be like i'm gonna go to this coffee shop and i'm gonna tip the barista fifteen thousand dollars and let's see her reaction and he would go and he would tip her she would have this crazy reaction he'd be like thanks so much to our guys at cr quiv who made this possible um you know go check them out they do this thing right that video would get like five million or ten million views and so for the for quid or whatever they were like dude this is great like we're getting way more bang for our buck than any other influence or shout out we're doing so then they would up the ante they would do fifty thousand hundred thousand two hundred thousand because each video was getting like ten million views and it was this like perfectly like i forgot what it's called in biology where like the parasite actually helps you like sucks out the toxins so the parasites getting food but you're also getting healed it was basically like a symbiotic relationship like that where the the brand was basically putting up loads of cash and he was using that to create huge amounts of views and subscribers to make himself the biggest i don't think these guys have that's cool i don't think these guys have sponsors well they must have it somewhere right like the model must be that either it's the same thing the money comes in one one door then they reinvest it in stuff like this because they know that seems to be a pretty good formula i give away you know i'm gonna give this family in the hood a hundred thousand dollars uh you know let's see what happens and it's him standing with like three you know three bucks in front of home depot that's literally the the second most recent video and it's got 2.7 million views so clearly that works this video will monetize um no on top of that that's that's their whole shtick is they got banned they can't monetize their videos oh okay yeah i don't know how it's sustainable maybe it's not sustainable but by the way and it's also explicit i don't think you could put ads on an explicit channel but just like the economics behind what these guys are doing it's it's it's outrageous to me something is crazy i i i don't think i'm though i i think when i see this and i predict that they're going to go broke i don't think i'm the crazy one yeah baby i could see that i could also see these things being money printers so like in the same way that i think the jackass franchise ultimately was successful right you see like oh dude there's like a [ __ ] in a thong you know kicking this other guy in the balls you're like well this doesn't seem like good business but in actuality as long as they have a good man as long as they have their kris jenner in the background that's like yeah go act the full like this is this is what drives ratings then this will work and like the new york times headline about them is what won't the nelq boys do and this is like how like that's a brand right that's a really powerful valuable brand to own is the question isn't what do they do it's what they what won't they do it's like they do pranks parties crude humor they get in trouble but the backlash is the brand that's literally the the headline now would they go i don't know i don't know enough about them but you know i'm actually a fan of what they do i think they're pretty cool we should get them on the pod i want to hear hear their business i agree i think one of their manager asked to come on maybe we can talk to them i heard um a story about a friend a person i know who made 60 million dollars a handful of years ago living in living out of their car now i learned that this weekend so i know a person who made 60 million dollars like 10 years ago and now they are homeless yeah dude that's crazy that's not even crazy that's normal bro like uh jack dorsey is like you know starts two multi-billion dollar companies and then like actively tries to dress like you know a homeless guy like you know this that's the thing you do when you get rich you then go on some journey to like find the meaning of life in fact i was telling somebody this the other day we were reminiscing it's like dude at the event i was like dude i haven't seen you in so many years like oh when was the last time i saw you it was like remember we were advising that kid on his company and we were both afterwards like yeah but that's never going to work like you know you know a good kid but like you know he'll be maybe he'll be successful in like five years and then his company currently is like a multi-billion dollar company and i was like now that motherfucker's 25 years old running around like with a huge beard trying to like figure out like basically trying to figure out the meaning of life like oh [ __ ] you're on a spiritual journey already damn it you're like you are so far ahead of us now after we kind of were joking around about how you you know you you don't have this thing figured out that is the like the classic tech cliche is to like be like get i made all this money so that i'm gonna live like somebody who has no money that's like the stereotype i want to get to your event but really quick one more thing because this is the new cliche so i hate talking about these guys but elon um in the wall street journal came out yesterday that elon musk slept with sergey brin the guy started google his wife right and sergey aren't friends at all elon tweeted two things that were hilarious the one he goes this isn't true i haven't had sex in forever i haven't had sex with months yeah and then the next thing that he tweeted was here's me and sergey hanging out right now on a boat and it's them like drinking wine together like partying did he post a picture yes or yeah either he did or someone did it he replied to it said yeah that was us literally yesterday that's so funny yeah it's so funny here's what i here's how i was feeling about this i was like all right i saw the saw the news break or whatever it was like scoop on the wall street journal scoop exclusive scoop elon musk sleeping with whatever blah blah blah and uh and i was like okay that's kind of interesting i guess like all right i got some tmz [ __ ] and um i was like well pretty sad for like you know the wall street it was the wall street journal uh i feel pretty sad that that's like the wall street journal thing but of course i get it if i had that story i'd publish it too no doubt then he tweets out like the like the thing like not true and haven't had sex in months psy and i was like ah now another sad thing like first wall street journal disappointed me then elon musk disappointed me like dude i want my billionaires like being cool not like dude that was like my msn like away message you know just a cry for attention back in middle school or high school i was like oh man it wouldn't be nice to get like i wonder what a kiss feels like you know some [ __ ] like that that's like dude lame and then and i was like well so did the wall journal just make that up because that's even lamer so it was just like a lame sandwich that i was not into uh but i just thought it was hilarious how he he tweeted a picture of him and sergey just hanging out uh i enjoyed this drama i'm here for it i don't care about the cars i don't care about the solar stuff i just like this type of crap yeah somebody had this great tweet they were like uh elon musk is like you know he's on some pirate [ __ ] he's taking over companies like twitter he's trying to like conquer new lands like mars he's sleeping with his friend's girlfriends like he's he's on he's on that pirate [ __ ] and i was like oh yeah it's true that's cool if true but it sounds like you know maybe this one's not actually true all right what's this what's this event uh by the way we forgot to say on the milk boys they have like their beer which i think is also like a big thing their happy dad like seltzer or beer or whatever the heck that is um happy dad is like everywhere on instagram like it's like the main brand i've seen a lot of people drink it yeah i've seen it so i wanna tell you some things about this event and these are to be kind of rapid fire little nuggets you can choose to say the following you can either say that's stupid and i'll simply move on i won't defend it you'll say that's cool i have nothing to add and i'll simply move on or we could talk about any of these things all right so i go to this event in l.a uh my buddy romine who uh we run our fund together he hosts this event um and it's basically like athletes and big shot investors so at this event we're like three or four owners of like sports teams so these are basically like billionaires or billionaire families like legacy families how did you get these people they just wanted to come i guess i don't know he just called reach out that he's not paying anybody and it's a free event so there's nothing there's like no money to be made but this is just like in network then there's pro athletes mostly retired athletes but some active players like kind of like some guys from the lakers some guys from other other teams that are younger guys but then some older guys that are retired and they're like on to the next phase of their their business life and they maybe are doing content now they got like a media brand or they're doing real estate or whatever and so the idea was let's get together like 50 people from the world of sports and 50 people from the world of like tech and business and let's see what happens so i went last year i went this year again and i have a couple of like little stories so the first is um i'm going to tell you there was one talk that was good there was it was like a bunch of talks on the day of the conference um there was only one talk that i thought was good and by the way that's [ __ ] on myself too i i was i hosted a panel too i didn't think was very good um but the one was really good was basic lessons from billion dollar founders so onstage was the ceo of carta so uh carter they do cap table management they're a multi-billion dollar company um something called um oh shoot what was it it's like a therapy app the name will come to me it's basically like mental health it's like a better hope but it's not them it's like some other competitive space uh another one but basically they basically do like therapy and mental health um through telemedicine like online and uh and there's another one that was like some hospital software a theolos and then there was uh this most interesting one is something called relativity space and by the way you could basically tell you know i wouldn't say that the most interesting person at a conference is always the one who dresses differently but somebody who's dressed very differently is almost always very interesting at these conferences last year when i was there i told you i saw this kid who looked like a break dancer wearing this like tie-dye shirt with like a black stud earring it looked different than every other you know suit in the room and it was the founder of bolt who now has become a lot more famous because he like you know went on these twitter tirades and bolt is a multi-billion dollar company and all this stuff but i met him there and invested in his company because i was like this dude's just really interesting so that happened again this guy is the founder of relativity space he's competing with elon his two competitors are jeff bezos and elon musk uh like you know no big deal i'm competing with the world's richest man and like second rich man basically tim ellis tim ellis yeah and so i'm just going to share with you two things one is this dude's company is insane so relativity space what they do is they 3d print rockets and then they send them into space so basically there's a huge huge demand for rocketry so the ability to take satellites up to space to do you know some scientific missions whatever and right now spacex is like the number one blue origin which is jeff bezos company is number two and relativity space is number three uh but they kind of have a differentiator which is all those other companies like to build a rocket they need like whatever hundreds of parts like specialty parts and they might 3d print individual parts but like the whole thing is like a very expensive complex structure that where a million things can go wrong whereas these guys basically 3d print the entire rocket with only a couple extra parts and uh and so because of that they're like you know cheaper and whatever he said this line this throwaway line he's like so he's explaining he's like you know our mission is to make humanity like humanity multiplanetary uh through 3d printing rockets we're one of only two companies on earth that has a mission of making the human race like multi multiplanetary the other is spacex he goes the launch part market today is eight billion a year so eight billion gets spent launching things into space and is growing to 30 billion uh there's really only three companies that possibly can serve this right now um and he's like you know um we in the last three months we have we've sold over 1.2 billion in uh launch and launch sales i was like what and he started he started the company he was 25 he's 32 now so he used to work at jeff bezos company blue as an intern his wikipedia says as an intern and he was trying to do 3d printing there he was like hey i think this is like one of the ways we can dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of rockets and it was like yeah nice r d but like it wasn't the main way they were doing things so he left and he starts this thing he goes we have 850 employees 500 are x spacex and i thought that was literally the funniest [ __ ] anybody could say i was like what kind of absurd statement is that that's so amazing to me um and he's like you know we have a launch site now that was like the big progress last year we have a launch site so we're going to be doing our first big like uh like our i don't know if our first big our next big launch there uh there are only four launch sites in the country none have been built since 1960 and we now have exclusive rights to one for the next 25 years it's like you know he's basically because in this talk he's like what makes a company worth so much because people will see me okay i'm a young guy i'm a young guy company's not that old and it's worth how many billions of dollars like that's crazy and he's like well here's what we did he's like we hopped into an emerging wave so we basically like there's surging demand for um for going in for missions in space for satellites and more um there's not enough supply there's basically like not much competition everybody's sort of scared away so in actuality like just going into the space we're not competing with most companies um the next one is you know we um basically we're like defensibility we have a launch site there's only four of these none have been built in like you know 60 years and um and we have we have one of them and so like you know what we're going to do what's this have to do with the billionaire lessons well these are lessons what does it take to build a billion dollar company these are the core elements like defensibility that's you know that's one of their moats the next one is like this like this co extreme imbalance and supply and demand dude how lame must you feel if you're like a software guy like carter like following this guy you know what i mean they each had to say their thing so i'll tell you what each of them said so this is what this guy was saying all right the next guy the the telehealth guy or that's not telehealth sorry the uh hospital software guy here's what he said uh you'll like this his was simpler he's like he said yeah like agree with all that stuff uh here's how we thought about it um we need to have 500 sales people that can sell a million dollars worth of product a year um or 250 oh oh sorry 500 that could sell half a million a year or 250 that can sell a million dollar as their sales quota per year so we just work backwards from that all right what features products and like people do we need to like let a salesperson like get 500 sales people that can sell half a million dollars a year of like sales credit like first is that even possible can the can this market support that yes the market is very big hospitals spend a lot of money in health care and in our category they spend more than much more than that okay cool so it's possible then he's like all of our product team they know they work for sales and i thought that was very different than what most people say he's like silicon valley loves to preach that like product is king product is the god you just need a great product he was like we build great product if it's gonna help us sell better and like we build great customer support so that it helps us sell better everything is in service of sales so i really like that guy's kind of like one-liner approach the carter guy basically was like um you know we uh he's like here's how i think about it he's like you need uh you need to you basically you want to find a multi-billion dollar wave if you're gonna be a billion dollar company he's like so find an emerging wave so for example that the telehealth guy his is that his was that uh mental health coverage was now required so like a bunch of i don't know if it's like insurance companies or companies they were now requiring that like uh mental health is part of a health care package he's like that changed you know second thing that changed was mental health is getting de-stigmatized you're seeing all kinds of famous people talking about mental health it's not like this taboo subject like i call it years ago it's only inflections so there's like regulatory inflections which is like all right now you could do telemedicine that's a new thing there's uh cultural inflections which is wow it's not weird to talk in front of your camera anymore and like make a video there's technology technology technological inflections which is like oh wow our phones all have gps's so you want to like look for different inflections right exact that's exactly what he was saying and the last one he mentioned was like the pandemic was another inflection because it forced everybody if they needed a doctor visit to do a video on so it's like a everybody had to try it for this two year period and so video visits and telemedicine not now the hospitals know they need to have it uh doctors know they need to be willing to do this and patients have like tried it once uh all right the next thing he goes he goes team he goes billion dollar companies are almost never bootstrapped so you kind of have to know that going in like if you're gonna build a billion dollar company you almost certainly are gonna raise money because you're gonna hire a plus players they need to have an a plus mission and secondly you need to have a high velocity customer acquisition model and i just thought that phrase is very good high velocity customer acquisition model it's something you can just kind of ask yourself do i or don't i have a high velocity customer acquisition model every business wants one pretty much and you got to say like okay what's our current velocity so at what rate are we currently adding customers how high would it need to be for us to get there and like what are we going to do to make this this little wheel spin faster um all right but let me just thought that was good those four guys there's four people right four guys yeah yeah did were they a tired and exhausted looking and b do you think they are happy all right we'll give you the scale the mental health guy honestly looked not tired and happy um he was like fit he didn't have like crazy bags under his eyes he like spoke with energy and he was like sitting upright that makes sense dad checks out carter guy he looked calm like he didn't look like he was facing death but he looked like he like had been facing death for some extended period yeah he only has five hunched over yeah like you know i could tell he wasn't in bad shape at all but uh you know like it didn't look like you know he was springing around with energy necessarily right uh space guy that guy looked like he just walked in it looked like he just walked out of a room you know like those scenes in game of thrones were like oh shoot we're going to war and the guy like gets up and out of his bed scramble like four nude women and he's like ah okay yeah let me just go do my next thing that's how this guy looked he had the swagger of a guy in game of thrones who was just sleeping with four women four beautiful women he had the tyrion lannister energy um he and that's when he was like yeah billion dollars in sales in the last three months and like you know we have 500 ex spacex employees yeah they leave elon to come so he seemed like he was like that's the energy he was carrying he looked happy damn well [ __ ] you guys [Laughter] i i was sitting with him at lunch and he was asking questions to everybody else and like that was one of the most that was one of the coolest parts of this event i don't know how they did it but nobody had an ego like everybody who was there i don't know if they just filtered people out who had egos or they just like everybody got the vibe which is like everybody here is equally valuable be curious about others you're not just like the star and all these people are used to being the star it's like yeah you're you own that in that nba team you own that football team or like you're like this superstar like you know the guy on my panel with me i think he had like you know 90 million dollars he had a 90 he just signed like a 90 million contract he's like one of the highest paid nfl players and uh the guy was like dude i'm just here to learn man i would love to you know subscribe to your newsletter and blah blah blah i'm like wow this is incredible you are going to go so far in life because you are obviously skilled and successful but you're so humble it's crazy damn how many people were there about 100 120 maybe romaine organized this yeah so basically romaine and then tribe which is like a vc fund um uh tribe was one of the hosts and then tpg which is like one of the biggest private equity companies in the world like why is this this guy working with you 120 billion what why is this guy working with you bro i always have that tyrion dinosaur energy regardless of what my situation is holy crap this guy's amazing well that's badass i was in l.a i was in l.a i'm gonna give you a couple other things that i i took away from this ben so ben levy who's not producer ben my business partner ben he has a super power that we talk about now have i told you about his superpower his superpower to me is um people just tell him [ __ ] and he just smiles and laughs and then he uses it against them if if he needs to [ __ ] trust magnet yeah i don't know what he does everybody trusts him like me and you i've known you for i don't know how long i've been like eight years we've spent time together we've gone through ups and downs adversity we've seen each other whatever we know each other very well you may have met ben twice in your life but even you will be like if if there's something interesting or something going on you like text ben like dude my new business is doing awesome or something like that and he just has that pull with people everybody wants to talk to ben everyone's to tell him he's so enthusiastic i don't know what it is but i saw a super home blast so i'm gonna tell you a little story here and i don't even know how much we can take away from this i'm just gonna kind of explain that it happened just so that just because i think it was amazing and because i think that if there is a way to learn this skill everybody should learn it i'm trying to learn it myself so i'm going to talk out loud about it so we go to this event at the event i get a text from ben ben sitting across the room we we split up at the events we don't always just sit together and just only talk to each other because that's kind of defeats the purpose and he's like yo the dude next to you uh he's awesome and i go who he goes he goes that's chris johnson or that's this guy who he trains like some of the best nba players on the planet um and i was like oh really like i'm a big nba fan i was like i don't know this guy like he must follow him on instagram like ben's just like even deeper down the rabbit hole so i was like okay cool but i was like i don't know what to do with that information like i guess like if the opportunity kind of presents itself i'll i'll go introduce myself like you know i have nothing to yeah i don't know how to force my way any seems busy right now but okay ben does something where he i don't know i don't know what he did but he approached this guy ben approached this guy and he starts talking to him and i i think two things happen i think number one in a room full of the guys who are usually on screen um this guy who himself is obviously like a heavy hitter in his space a lot the average joe did not know who he was right like every tech nerd who was in there doesn't know who this guy is even people who like sports probably didn't know that this guy's like the you know the skills trainer for all these top guys and i'm talking about like this guy will train with dwyane wade and lebron james and like other guys like that like the top of the top and um ben goes up to him he's like dude i follow you man i love your videos it gives them a compliment they start chatting a little bit i don't know what ben said next but i think i'm going to skip to the end and we'll fill it in the middle the end is the event's over everybody's leaving people going to the airport this guy comes up to me and he sees i'm talking about we're figuring out we're gonna get our uber he goes i knew i was coming to this event for a reason but i didn't know why this man was the reason he pointed no way and i go what and i was like what do you mean like what did he do he's like i don't even know man he goes this i am so happy i met this guy ben i will always remember our conversation he goes he said something he goes like he goes he's like he's he's like bro brother anything you need anything you need i got you and i was like and he this is not the type of guy he's not schmoozing this is not this is a guy where when words come out of his mouth they mean something and i'm just like i'm just sitting there i'm not even laughing i'm not even asking questions i'm speechless i get this look on my face like what the [ __ ] did you do ben how did you do this again and and ben still he's just smiling you don't even say anything back to this guy he's just smiling and i go i go what i go what did he i go what happened why he goes i guess i don't even he goes i don't even know he doesn't even know the spell he's under he goes i don't even know but he goes you know i'm a trainer man i work with athletes when they need something they call me when they're in a slump they call me when they're trying to get better they come when they want their next contract they call me i help these guys get paid i'm always helping i drive to this guy's house i drive here i fly there i do this i do that i'm always pouring into other people he goes ben you filled me up you poured into me oh man and i was like what just happened i was so amazed and the guy goes the guy goes when are you flying out and ben's like tomorrow he goes come train with us tomorrow ben goes with him the next morning to his facility and does a session the guy spends two hours correcting ben's form there's other nba players there he's locked into bed ben sends me this video he's wearing like a [ __ ] weighted vest he's got a glove on his hand because this guy like invented a shooting glove he made an experience out of it for ben and i i really appreciate this guy didn't have to do that that was incredibly nice of this guy he was just very like i don't know he was very like you could see why this guy works with so many people because there's something magnetic about this guy's personality what's his name but two magnets met dude and i don't know how i don't know what ben's superpower is i don't know how he does this consistently these sorts of things happen where people are just very um attracted to him in this way i don't know what it is but he's amazing it's you know who else is really good at that me i'm [ __ ] good at that i'm good at that you are good at that i'm not that good but i'm good yeah this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform where everything is fully integrated well i can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago i totally missed hubspot grow better so yesterday we'll talk about a second but yesterday i did an interview with martin shkreli and um and i wanted it to go well i was like yeah okay you know i think people can be interested in this let me do a good job and i'm five minutes into the interview and i find myself doing the like [ __ ] socialize i'm like hahaha yeah i'm like smiling i'm laughing i'm like so that must have been hard for you to blah blah and what would you say i'm just like falling into some [ __ ] like script like i don't know what i like became some character this like generic podcast character and literally the thought of my head was sam would never do this sam like he's he he said something he was like he was talking about like yeah how he like he's like yeah dude i i got a contraband cell phone i was on the internet the whole time i was in prison and i was like and i was like uh i started and i was like dude if somebody oh no you know you know what i would ask that's great what what websites were you using like where were you where were you going you would have been like wait what how do you get in there do you like get it like you have to put it between your butt cheeks you would have said something like that to kind of disarm him to get him to share an interesting nugget and you would have just genuinely been like wait what the hell like hold on no and you would have just reacted like a normal person rather than like that's fascinating you know um i'm curious to hear your thoughts on blah blah blah it's like dude that's podcaster versus real person and so i was i like literally switched into sam mode and i started being like i was like what are you doing and then he shares this in hilarious things he goes yeah dude and you you you would have been like how much was it i was like how much you get the phone for he's like dude he's crazy he's like you have to buy these things for like thousands of dollars like i paid 15 000 for one phone and i thought [ __ ] this phone must be made out of gold because he's like but you have to do it because to get the phone in they got a grease you know one guy to get one guy to get another guy you gotta bribe five guys to get this in and so like you know you gotta pay that vig and he's like most guys i was like so what do you use it for exactly your question he goes he goes yeah most guys just use for porn he's like he's like but me i'm i'm on github and like khan academy and porn i did that too but like you know the only guys using this for like advanced math also you know under the covers listening to this and that little magic moment that came out yeah it was great it's like that doesn't happen that doesn't happen unless you kind of act the way that you act at banks where it's like yours is a little different yours is like you get to like real talk really fast ben just kind of like seems so curious and earnest i think that people really like they like how genuinely interested he is in their life and how he how helpful he tries to be without like seeking anything or talking about himself have you read the book how to win friends that influence people i read like the first chapter where it was like the the people's favorite word in the english their name yeah and i was like yeah this is great dude that book that book like changed my life and in one of the chapters he talks about how uh there was a story of a man like sitting with the with a young guy and the young guy like wanted something like a job or something from the from the older guy but the young guy you know used dale carnegie's practices and basically like he just listened to him the entire time and you know the older guy did all the talking and at the end of the uh the end of the conversation the other guy goes wow this was the best conversation i've ever had with anyone ever and the younger guy was like well i didn't say a word so but like that that's funny how that works and the older guy goes like you know you should we're friends now you should come and like apply at our company you know like things like that and that like changed my life when i learned when i learned that strategy and so when i want to get stuff from people i usually amp them up so i'll do one of two things one i'll either insult them a little bit like if i know that their business is doing above 100 million in revenue i'm like that's that's a nice little business what do you guys do like 50 million like and and then they're gonna like tell me the exact so i'll like make them a little or the thing that i do more often than not is i just encourage them like crazy like wow you did that you are so amazing you're my hero dude how did you do that you know and they'll like start like gushing and i'll just make them feel really good about themselves this sounds manipulative which i guess it is but i don't think it's a bad manipulative but yeah it works yeah the way i put it is like you go to these events to make connections with new people right that's the point or we wouldn't go to an event if it wasn't for that but it's kind of hard to do that i find myself like feeling uncomfortable in a lot of those situations you know like okay i need to introduce myself to this person how do i quickly you know like are they interested in me am i them there's very much like a like a dating component to that to this like a speed dating component to these events and you sort of see their eyes start to wander it's like oh they're clearly like looking for the next conversation or like you know the bathroom or some excuse to get out of this sort of thing or you're like or you find yourself tuning out because you're like oh shoot i'm just kind of judging them like really quickly like everybody's got something to offer i just wanna i should be in the mode of like finding out what that is rather than like looking at their badge and trying to figure out like are you you know valuable at this conference or not that's sort of a stupid way to do it but like i am fascinated with ben and this guy chris their their ability to connect was so strong like the way chris talked to me too i felt like a friend of his within two minutes and it's not because he was manipulating me no he's just like that's his energy he carries around so if i think about why has he been able to connect with these athletes who everybody wants to connect with them everybody wants to connect with lebron james everybody wants to connect with kevin durant everybody wants to connect with dwyane wade how does this guy do it well obviously he's got to be good at his job but that's not enough you also have to have the people's skills he told me a story i think i could share this on here by the way he wants to come on the pod i'll tell him to come on but he showed he told me the story so i don't know if you pay you probably don't pay attention to this but did any of the people who you met listen oh yeah there were some people who listened to the pod i just got them yeah not not a town i would say but like definitely a few um one of the franchise owners listens which is kind of really um and so or like he had listen i don't know if he's super regular but um uh so okay so he was so basically this guy was talking about the trainer he was talking about like uh uh fear and so he so he was like he somehow we got on the topic of fear he's like yeah man i was like i work with these guys in the gym they can hit like you know whatever 80 90 93 pointers in a row like 80 90 percent but in the game it's obviously lower and sure it's the speed is there the defense is a little tighter but like take free throws there's no defense there's no speed still the guys in the gym perform one way and in the game they form another it's because there's a huge mental component to this he's like so i train their mental just as much as they're physical and he's like you know um lebron recently went to play at this thing called the drew league i don't know if you've ever seen this but it's like it's in downtown l.a it's like in the hood basically the true league lebron i don't think has ever played and it's usually like kind of like former players or like fringe guys journeyman guys who want to make a league they're very good basketball but they're not like stars and um lebron was like i'm thinking about going and dropping in and just playing and and this trainer was like that would be awesome and that would like mean a lot like i think it would mean a lot to the people i think you would you would have fun it's a legacy thing like just it's like one time kevin durant went to rucker park and he played in rucker park he dropped like 50 points or something like that and the crowd like mobbed and they just like ended the game because the crowd just rushed him because he was being so awesome and he just hit a three from from half court basically like he just gets mobbed by people it was like this very memorable thing and so the guy was like you should do it but like lebron has a lot to lose at something like this right lebron's already one of the best players in the world already one of the richest most famous athletes in the world so he doesn't need the fame he's not going to get any money he's not going to get better like just by playing in this one game with people who are worse than him like um and there's plenty of things that could go wrong like he could get hurt he could get dunked on or embarrassed and way crossed over in some way like you know that sort of thing or he could just like miss shots and like uh man he went and it was like dude you couldn't even like you weren't you ain't all that like you know it wasn't like hype so he had something to lose and um but he decided to go and then the trainer was she like pulls up his cell phone it's like the nba all-star game is his imessage like just one star after another he's like he clicks the text message with me he's like he told he's like i told him your victory is in your vulnerability like this you felt you were vulnerable that's why this was a win for you because he went it was amazing everybody loved it he played super well dropped 40 points and like it was awesome uh and the clips go viral on instagram and people really respect him for it he goes you remember that your victory is in your vulnerability and he looked around the circle he was just like remember that and all of us are like nodding like yes sir i was like i will i what do i need to be i will take my clothes off right now and be more vulnerable if it helps me be like you know like but he was really inspiring telling these stories and so i love meeting people like this i love hearing stories like this and i love getting these golden nuggets these little things you can take away that like you can use in your own little your own life you know what my takeaway when i hear this [ __ ] is is damn these guys are cool i want to be [ __ ] cool like like i want to stick how the [ __ ] do you have to be cool i just google at amazon how to be cool where's this book i need one of these books i don't want i want men to want me like yeah how do you be cool dude where's that book on how to be cool i want that this guy read it i want to read it too that's crazy to read that book too yeah i'm so envious when i hear people like this i'm like damn they got a good stick let me tell you one other little nugget here do memorable things i wrote this down all right what does that mean i went to the conference last year i went this year in between i've like launched a business i've you know the podcast has grown blah blah blah guess what the number one thing people remembered me for at the conference this year like e-commerce stuff oh last year this year this year when they when they're like oh i remember you talked about x probably investing the michael jordan house thing that we talked about on the podcast wait really the idea of buying mj's house so two things happened that went kind of semi-viral in the sports and sports media and sports agent world um people shared that clip like remember the twitter clip has like hundred thousand plus views uh yeah people share that with like people i think like the tick tock thing was like millions maybe you got to share with a lot of people they were like oh i remember you were gonna buy michael jordan's house what happened with that and they were like it's like dude you remember that from over a year ago and like i'm doing a bunch of other things way more seriously that was just one brainstorm with sam about this idea like that's crazy so that was the first thing uh people were remembering me for that then then we um while we were there ben took a call to potentially invest in this company and uh and i'm like cool what's this guy's background and he the guy's done many things ben goes you remember the taco bell mexican pizza dish i was like uh kind of i guess like yeah i know it exists he goes they took it away off the menu and people like like were outraged on social media and this guy got like a million people to sign the petition to bring it back and they brought it back that's what he well that's what ben remembered like this guy's done a bunch of interesting things and he had like three this guy had three stories like that and once you have like three stories like that it's like all right i need to know this guy and i feel like you do that really well too where you have these little things where it's like ah the hot dog stand like calls you know sam's wiener's his biggest baby's arm or it's like you know the pawns pawn stars guy the pawn shop thing or like i feel you have these things that are like that these little nuggets are stories that are like they're memorable but not for the thing you actually spent years of your life building yeah but dude the problem is is that i'm like trading on old stories i need to do some cooler [ __ ] now i'm like you know we gotta like do some stuff i gotta do something well i i think that's the thing is like do more memorable [ __ ] because these punch above their weight you know they don't take that long they're not that hard to do but i was gonna do like a the other day i thought maybe i'll like spend three weeks riding around on a motorcycle and i was like that's lame i already did that i gotta i gotta think of some i gotta do something cool you know right i think uh maybe i'll have kids next year i gotta do something i gotta go out with a bang i don't think you understand what i'm talking about let's do something cool man we gotta do something cool let's do cool [ __ ] yeah i think there's a bunch of things that would be cool to do but they don't make any sense and what i'm learning is that those things do make sense just on a different time scale and uh you gotta like in a different weird way and having the having that little collateral of like cool [ __ ] that you could talk about is worth it i thought about walking across the country and i was like that would be that'd be pretty sick and then i kind of like thought about like playing it out and i'm like huh it's pretty far it might take like six months like i don't know like you just listen to audio books all day like i don't know like you know what i mean i gotta think of some something like kind of it's gotta be or authentic right like extreme for extreme sake doesn't work because again you don't know if these are going to pay off or when they're going to pay off so you got to do it with the the act of doing it or talking about it or like that has to be itself enough for you i was like maybe i'll just like use twitter and like see if i can hitchhike from like new york to california i don't know i gotta figure out something i'm gonna figure something out but this stupid podcast i gotta be here all twice a week to record it holds me back i thought about walking across the country but i gotta like gotta carry around this lame-ass mic for the stupid podcast but i gotta figure something out that's hilarious uh yeah let's do another topic um you remember how he tweeted out that thing about hassan how do you spell out pronounces i'll say minhaj a comedian yeah i tweeted out this thing that basically i like saw him walk by me and i went and grabbed him and goes what's up man and it wasn't him and it was really embarrassing uh you know i've never like really talked with him did you give him my number yeah oh he texted me he was like this is funny uh he's like give me sam's number uh and i'll text him and then i send him your number so i'm getting dinner with him um and uh it's gonna be the first time i didn't get to meet him when you do that podcast but i thought that was also a cool example of just like these cool things just happen when you when you take a lot of chances would you say that maybe your victory was in your vulnerability here by sharing this embarrassing story by sharing this embarrassing story where i look like a racist yeah yeah all right your victory was in your vulnerability baby and it was you hooked it up so i appreciate that yeah it was uh i'm gonna i'm gonna go hang out with him you guys are like homies right uh yeah i really like him we uh you better be funny dude i'm not it's okay isn't that like you got to go one way or the other if you're going to hang out with a comedian you've either got to be like funny or just be like blatantly unfunny is he funny when you're like just hanging out with him yeah he's a funny dude [ __ ] i'm not prepared at all i gotta go read a book this is why i need that cool book [ __ ] try to be hot instead no i can't do that either you're closer to hot than funny that's still a far i'm average at bo i'm i'm average at best like it's all right try to be rich instead dude i'm still a six out of ten on that too i'm just like a six panic of meeting the panic of meeting uh famous people is so funny to me uh like i just think it's like a hilarious thing that happens with people people people meet famous people their instinct is like to just like throw all good common sense out the window and start behaving like an idiot dude it just sucks being a seven at everything you know what i mean i'm just a seven at everything so almost the bridesmaid always the seven a jack of all trades a master of nine i'm just as [ __ ] seven i need to like it just doesn't work out um yeah but you're you're a hard seven though you know yeah i'm a hard seven all right that's the pot we'll talk to y'all later [Music] you

this is great i don't go on fat fire as much as you do um i do it from time to time but i don't like i don't know i need to like add it to my feed or whatever uh but yeah this is great 38 years old 15 million 15 million net worth not five uh 15.8 uh and then the six million annual income is actually the more stunning part like i'm not surprised that a lawyer at 40 can have 15 million in net worth it's the 6 million in annual income that's sort of like stunning which makes me want to understand this personal injury lawyer business better like he says like you know i do know marketing i basically just hand out business cards plus i get referrals for my existing clients um but that is a ton that is a ton of like take home from your like your legal practice i don't think that's common so i wonder what he's doing [Music] dude all right i have some i have something interesting that i saw sean i posted a link to the subreddit to this reddit post that i saw right before i logged into this uh to the podcast and i linked it to you so basically there's this subreddit called fat fire that i like i've sent it to you and every once in a while you get these amazing stories about people because they reveal like their income and things like that and i've been following this lawyer he's a 38 year old explain what fat fire is yeah so fast people don't know what fat fire fire stands for financially independent retired early traditionally it's like a movement of people who want to save like 500 000 to a million dollars and live off of like 30 30 30 or 40 thousand dollars a year that's not exactly what it means but that's like traditionally like with the stereotype fat fire means you want to retire in early and be financially independent but you want to be doing it fat so you want to like you know save like 20 million dollars or something like that so you want to start a company sell and retire and so it's people who want to retire while they're young and uh do it by still living living lavishly and it sounds douchey but it's actually quite interesting it's all like entrepreneurs bankers tech people who like work at a it's just like rich people and which is always fun to like be voyeuristic and so there's this guy he's a 38 year old personal injury lawyer and for the past four years he's given an update every couple of years and he explains everything that's going on in his business and so his background is basically that he was a normal he went to a good school and then worked at one of the big law firms which is like something that you like grind for 80 hours a week and hopefully climb your way up and eventually you make a million dollars a year after 10 or 15 years but it's kind of boring and you're like kind of like the your boss is for a long time and it just kind of sucks and so he goes you know what screw this a friend of his got hurt and he goes hey i'll represent you uh just pay me whatever's fair and then he did and he won and then a few other people started coming to him just word of mouth and so he was doing this in the evenings uh while he was still working his main job and after a year he quit to do his own thing that's when his uh income from his moonlighting became bigger than his normal thing so fast forward now i believe it's been about eight years since he's been doing this so 2014 to 2022 and he's listed out his income as well of his net worth breaking it down by assets for every single year so in year one it was three hundred thousand dollars two six hundred thousand eight hundred thousand one point two million three million five point six million six million six million and this year so far three point three and it's going to be eight million this year and that's personal income basically he he has these posts where he breaks down exactly how his businesses work what his current plan is what his growth challenges are what his marketing is and basically he's got like five attorneys that work for him and he's slowly built up to that he gets a little bit of cut of all that they have they have 300 cases that they do a year um he talks about growth challenges which is that they're struggling with the crm they don't have a crm everything's done manually manually and it's a lot of work and one of his golden goals is to automate a lot of stuff but it's incredibly fascinating for two reasons one this is a sick business right like it's like just a 37 year old smart person but he doesn't seem like that particularly extraordinary but he's like killing it now he says that his net worth is currently 5.8 million dollars and his kids have a trust fund of 1.7 million and then secondly why this is cool for a couple reasons one alex hermosie had this business alex rosie was a guest here he had this business called gym launch where he basically worked with gyms where he that you paid him 20 or 30 000 and he set up your whole crm and he set up all the automated emails for onboarding and just kind of set up the automation flow someone should do that for these personal injury attorneys this is awesome they have way more money than jim's and probably just as many of them i have no idea but probably um i don't know what do you think about this post this is pretty cool right this is great i don't go on fat fire as much as you do um i do it from time to time but i don't like i don't know i need to like add it to my feed or whatever uh but yeah this is great 38 years old 15 million 15 million net worth not five uh 15.8 uh and then the six million annual income is actually the more stunning part like i'm not surprised that a lawyer at 40 can have 15 million in net worth it's the six million in annual income that's sort of like stunning which makes me want to understand this personal injury lawyer business better like he says like you know i do know marketing i basically just hand out business cards plus i get referrals for my existing clients um but that is a ton that is a ton of like take home from your like your legal practice i don't think that's common so i wonder what he's doing that's uncommon like he talks about look these cases basically like you know it's not about more cases like 300 cases could end up being worth more than 3 000 cases because you you know you get paid based on the outcome you know the the profits of the of the cases but man that's kind of weird like isn't it no i don't think that so this guy's in southern california so maybe he's in san diego so it's a pretty big city but i think if you look at the top 20 cities in america if you look at the billboards it's always personal injury uh lawyers and there's this one guy in um in austin in austin's like a top 15 city maybe and he says that his earnings are i forget exactly what it says his earnings are but i looked him up on instagram and he's got a collection of like 15 ferraris he was in the newspaper because he had a birthday party for his daughter or for himself and he had like rod stewart or someone crazy he spent like three million on that and they talked about his home and he was donating checks for two or three million dollars and that was in austin uh his name was thomas i think something thomas and i think i know a personal injury attorney in st louis and he's got a mansion in miami he's got a place in st louis where we're from i mean i think some of these guys could could really roll in it and be netting 10 or 20 a year yeah this is it's wild and i like that idea of the the gym launch for x um i think you're right with lawyers [Music] you

[Music] i did some research how much do you think if you're obama and oprah i would put them in similar categories maybe obama a little bit above in terms of influence but not like terribly above how much do you think and i didn't ask them i just researched it and i like try to find contracts how much do you think obama charges i would guess something between i would have guessed 250 to 350k that's my guess for like a speaking engagement but honestly it could be more it could be like double that dude so i think it's i heard rumors it's in like the one two one point two million range and that makes way wow obama is not going to get out of bed for less than a million and i hear oprah is around the 1 million no small boy stuff for obama too no definitely not and so here's why so i've heard like rumors and i talked to people that have had them before and that's kind of how i came with that number but let me give you some insider numbers so i only had one paid speaker ever at hustlecon so at halsacon collectively we probably had 200 or 300 speakers over a couple years a handful of years casey neistat was the only speaker that we had who we paid and i was supposed to you're not supposed to talk about how much you pay him but like this was like years ago so i can do it this was i think at the height of his popularity i only paid him 25 000 plus a private flight from la to san francis san francisco for six thousand dollars or from san francisco to la i forget but one way it was only six grand plus 25 thousand dollars that's nothing right 25 brand cheap compared to what because he was at the peak of his powers at that time too right it's not like yeah yeah for sure he was like not like some c-list you know person who used to be famous it's like no guys he's not that was a big deal then he's a big deal now too so i tried to get gary vaynerchuk to come speak at an event once and he offered uh his asking price was a hundred thousand dollars or i think he said that you would have to buy a hundred thousand dollars worth of books and that somehow like pushes him up the charts or something like that and uh so gary vaynerchuk was 100 grand um and i got to speak i i spoke somewhat recently and i asked i got paid 25 to 20 20 to 25 thousand dollars or maybe it's 20 grand plus flights and then i think that we had uh ashton kutcher spoke at an event that i was at and the uh the organizers like kind of like implied like they paid them around 150 grand so just just insider stories this has always been the playbook like i met a guy once who was writing a book and i was like nice like you know what's your goals for the book and like he was kind of answering me but i got the sense like i feel like you know you ever hear a story and you're like i feel like you're leaving out the one important detail that makes all of this make sense like you're not saying the wrong thing but i feel like you're just not saying whatever the right thing is and sure enough like 20 minutes and he's like yeah basically you write books so that you can get paid speaking gigs like it doesn't matter who reads your book or how you just need to be a guy who writes a book and then you like do a thing you like pay a certain amount to get like up in the chart so you could say new york times best seller or like you know amazon best seller and um and then that just increases your paid speaking rate by like 15k and then that's like you know how you make your money back for this whole like book process and i was like oh okay that makes way more sense like now i understand and i was like so this paid speaking gig like how does this work and he kind of broke it down for me kind of step by step and i remember being intrigued but also you know the cost of like you know basically like the idea of like oh yeah what you do is you fly around like you basically have to go you're never home you're flying around all the time so he was at that point trying to figure out all right the next step after this you know and and i sort of started thinking about okay what is the move straight to the end version of this and i was like oh okay i think i know what i would do it's like i would do a this is how like i was thinking about the podcast at this time like i was thinking about creating one i was like i think i would do a podcast that i could just record right here whenever i want maybe in batches and as long as the conversation's fun i don't think i would care about making any money off that and i feel like if i could do that i could get like you know what if like a million people were fans of the podcast i feel like that would just jump me where all these guys are trying to go or they're like ultimately i think what a lot of people want is like they have a topic that they're really curious about that they like to research they like to do experiments in and they're just trying to figure out a way to get paid to be professionally curious about that thing i think that's like the generous version of like how to think about this there's like the skeptical version of which is just like oh dude you're just like some motivational speaker like sort of scammy guru guy who wants to go around and blah blah blah but i think the re the earnest people i think they just want to be professionally curious it's like how do i get to spend 90 of my time just like digging in on this topic i'm a nerd about and then like somehow translate the other 10 of my time into enough money to fund me to do that in a in a cool way um and so i think that you know that's how i think about this stuff what i've been doing for speaking is i actually haven't asked to be paid lately but i do tell them i need two first-class flights um and i want you to pay entirely for the hotel for a week and i will only say yes if it's so my wife and i basically so we can go to a cool place so i only say yes but let me tell you something interesting so robert de niro he uh so the wall street journal did this thing where meech our friend ramitz shared it so listen to robert so here's what robert de nil got paid so he did a movie called savage salvation in september 2020 he got paid 11 million dollars so he was going to be there for eight days he asked for a round trip private air transportation on a gulf stream five is that or six i don't know how roman numerals work but a golf stream jet he uh got to keep all of the costumes wigs and prosthetics all the stuff that he wore on this on the plane or all the stuff he wore in the movie he got to keep all of it he wanted an additional fee for his uh personal trainer he had to come and be flown there and he had to be put up at the ritz carlton in addition to the the ten days that he had or the eight days he had to be there for production he wanted a seven day va all expenses paid vacation to the ritz carlton followed by a vacation in puerto rico where you also had to pay for his jet and i had to take his whole family uh to and from uh and then finally he wanted one round trip jet fra one round-trip private flight jet between new york and ella day in la for a five-day stay anytime within 12 months those are all of his ass in his contract for all for eight days of work that's not bad [Music] you

[Music] hey guys it's ezra from grand rapids i was listening to the pod the other day and i remember you guys saying that getting rich quick is the best way to get rich so i'm just wondering what's the fastest way you've had your life changed by money or what's the fastest way you've seen someone else's life get changed by money thanks all right we were asked what's the this is a one question friday we are asked what's the fastest that either of us shawn and sam have jumped in wealth and how it felt and or the same question but for some of the people we know you want to go first uh no you go i think you you might have a good story here i'll talk about a friend first so i was with a friend that sold his company for close to a billion dollars and i was with him i was with him when um the money hit the bank we were at their apartment and immediately like he's like all right i think it i think it happened we went to the atm he previously had like uh 300 000 in his bank which is uh not a little amount so he wasn't like destitute at all but he was 28 and we went to the atm and there was 90 million dollars in the bank account and immediately afterwards we went to mcdonald's and we got a number one each we each got a big mac and we went back to his apartment and watched tv and like we're like that's pretty cool isn't it and uh it was really cool like it was pretty crazy the crazy part is not just the 90 million but if you do the math of 90 million conservatively if you look at historical average 90 million at let's just run up to 100 100 million at 30 becomes 240 which becomes 450 which becomes 860 which becomes 1.1 at 70. 1.1 billion so you can see this it's not just that they have 90 million dollars it's like well you're it's a sure fire away more likely than not that you're gonna be a billionaire at some point while you're alive that was crazy so uh that that's one story do you have one i got a couple so um we've told this one on the pod before people are sort of familiar but i'll do a fast version of it which is million dollar homepage so alex ii who is a friend and i think you're friends with him as well he um i think he was 21 years old and he was like just i want to be a millionaire i want a million dollars how do i like do this and he kind of asked himself this question which was like how do i make a million dollars in like the next like month or two you know which is um not the question most people ask nobody will teach you or recommend that you ask this question but he asked it and guess what the brain is a a question answering machine and so you ask that question the brain if you believe that everything is possible we'll start to come up with ideas and one of the ideas he came up with this is back in uh i don't know when million-dollar maybe like uh 2007 or 2006. yeah something like that so basically 2005. he creates a million-dollar homepage and he's basically like uh you know just like i don't know he's 19 20 21 years old something like that he's like okay i'm gonna make a website that's a thousand pixels by a thousand pixels each pixel is just like a little square and he's like cool every pixel is a dollar and he kind of made it like at the top it says be a part of it of internet history and the set website's still up you can go to million dollar homepage.com and you can kind of you can see all the pixels and so basically he was like if i sell each of these squares for one dollar i will make a million dollars and sure enough he did uh january 11th uh the final tally was 1 million 37 thousand and 100 by the end of it and so he literally made a million dollars and i asked him i was like you know how did you get like you know he basically he built something that was like designed to go viral so it was almost so stupid and so like uh either some people shared it because they thought it was fun funny and cool and other people thought it was dumb dumb and dumber and so like you know either way it evoked a reaction out of everybody and so you can go there right now you could see all the pictures that pixels that sold and basically companies would buy it because they thought oh if this is gonna get a bunch of traffic um then cool i might get a bunch of clicks if i put my billboard here a bunch of people have tried to replicate this since but he made a million dollars in i think two months uh time period and um and then he went on to do something and then he blew it over the course he blew all the money in the course of the next year just kind of having party bought it off bought a condo uh you know like he did what a 21 year old would do and he was like oh i for sure i'm just gonna dude i did it so easy the first time i'm just gonna keep making hits i don't have to worry about saving this i can just blow it and then i think it was 10 years of like not having another hit trying thing after thing after thing after thing until he built calm and then calm took several years before calm became a thing and now calm is a i don't know two billion dollar company or something like that um in the meditation space so kind of an amazing story on his part i um what i did starting at age 20 or i forget which age i was like two years before my exit i use personal capital or and as well which is like mint.com it's just like but different and you can manually add stuff and i manually added enough money that it said my net worth was 16 or 17 million dollars and so i had that on there and i just started like seeing that number because of course money you can buy stuff but in a lot of cases it's really just like this like number on a spreadsheet where like you know it's just like a digital thing like you could put three zeros behind it and like it kind of starts feeling real for a minute and that's what i did and so i put that my net worth was like 17 million dollars like uh two years or a year and a half before my exit and then when i got paid i remember thinking like this feels cool but then like 20 minutes later i was like it kind of i was i'm kind of used to this now already like i see that number already and so i would say i'm still getting used to uh you're you're a manifesto i am you what do what i think what do we say we're the manifest cowboys baby i manifest stuff that's what i do i'm not a business person i'm a manifesto you know that's pretty good on the spot yeah that's what i do no small boy stuff i love that yeah that's what i do i'm not a businessman i'm a i'm a guy who dreams and tries to achieve it it just so happens that it's in the form of business but that's what i did and it made a difference and i actually noticed it here but here's my i wrote this down so i felt a big difference when i had twenty thousand dollars the next big difference that i felt my life was when i hit a hundred thousand dollars this is all liquid net worth the next big difference was when i hit 500 000 and then the next one was 10 million and i think that maybe maybe like the 40 or 50 range will be the next one and then maybe like the 100 range will be the next one that's what i think but i remember feeling like between like uh 500 000 and like 10 million i kind of almost felt the same right right right yeah similarly first jump was 25k we won it in prize money for our startup like at a business plan competition and it was like oh sweet we can work on this for the whole year and just this will be here this is the money we need to live on and we need to so three of us lived on 25k for a year and a half or something like that it was amazing and uh that was a huge jump because it was freedom for a year and a half to not think about money to just try to build something cool i'll also share something that's similar so forget getting super rich quick which i think is a good exercise to do um like what would i do if i really wanted to like 5x 10x if i wanted to make a million dollars in three months what would i do and if i wanted to do that how would i do it uh worthwhile exercise the other one is like baby goals so i heard kevin hart on some podcast and they were like kevin man you you're now like the biggest movie star in the world like you know you're up there bro you have your huge comedy specials movies you got it all like did you think that you could do this he's like he's like well i never really thought about it to be honest like i just he's like i didn't think like this huge goal because that would almost like it just seemed too too uh different from where i was it wasn't really even yet useful if i thought about it i could say it but like it didn't matter because i was so far from it he's like so i just did baby goals like just here's a little baby girl let me get to this point and another baby goal another baby goal and i actually think that baby goals are a lot more useful and a lot less talked about than like having the big hairy audacious you know dream and goal you need both they're both useful at different times but i would say most people would should would probably be better off doubling down on a baby goal let me give you an example when i was 21 we were working on our business our startup and we had a business plan and we had a an llc and we had all the like important sounding things that we thought it takes business cards we had a logo we had business cards people logo we had a website we had a blog we had investor we had like everything we thought it takes to to do this and um so nine months go by and we're like this was the sushi restaurant chain nine months go by and we're like we've been doing our planning and then we've been doing our like getting the chef on board and then we're trying to find a location and then we're trying to figure out how much does it cost to build it out all the things you kind of gotta do to launch this thing and i remember one day just sitting there with my buddy trevor and we were just like god like i feel like we're just like acting business we're playing playing startup yeah you're playing house it's like you know oh come over let's play house let's play doctor it's like we're playing business because we got this like and literally it was it's embarrassing we had a binder of a business plan that was like 300 pages and we used to brag about how well thought through our business was like we've thought through every detail what are mine what the uniforms will be what yeah binders full full of plans in this case and we had like here's how here's how we're gonna do employee promotions because we think that the way that companies work is like all this [ __ ] that didn't matter and like again 21 years old too dumb to know that that wasn't what was important uh until we got we took it to a meeting and we got sort of laughed at where the guy was like oh like this is your business plan and we're like yeah it's a and we thunk this binder onto the desk and he's like i'm not reading this and we were like oh yeah that's okay but just we wanted to show you we've thought it through he goes that means you're thinking about the wrong things and we're like oh so kind of we're getting we get this feeling like maybe we're doing this wrong this is about nine months in maybe we're doing this wrong so we're just sitting there when they were like all right why don't we just like for the weekend let's just make a business and like let's just try to make a thousand dollars like can we make a thousand dollars in a weekend 48 hours as a challenge to ourselves can we get to a thousand dollars and i swear i learned more about like actually building a business in that 48 hour thousand dollar challenge that i did the entire year of like working on the business because we were like okay how would we do this what's a product that we think people want uh we don't you know we're instead of like being married to our current idea it's like well what's a simple product that like people want and my buddy was like oh we used to live in boulder and he was like trevor was like you know you ever seen like every time we walk around campus all the sorority girls and like frat guys they all have these wristbands on like the livestrong band but they have this like stack of wristbands and he's like there's this new one that's like a really thick one it's like triple the size and it's like i don't know that seems to be in he's like what if we made those like that seems like that's pretty simple like to to sell those and we're like oh yeah you could just like customize it you could put like you know the hustle on it or you could put like milk road on or you could put like your brand name or your your frat name or whatever on it that'd be cool i think we could sell like a bunch of those and so we're like okay uh what should we call it and like everything that we had been super thought through and thoughtful about we just like did in five seconds like what's a good name what's a good name for these like fat like wristband things oh let's call it the fat band and then we create the fatband.com bought it on godaddy for in five seconds uh logo here let me just use impact the like thick font okay impact that's the that's the logo boom done um product okay let's not try to have the best product like is there just something on ali we had heard of alibaba and i was like is there something on alibaba or aliexpress that we could just get these like made i didn't even know the word drop shipping but we figured out that same concept ourselves we're like oh dude you just buy these for you know 17 cents and then if you include shipping it's only this much if we sold each one for a dollar fifty like that would work we could do it we'd only need to sell whatever it was like we only need to sell 700 bands in order to make a thousand dollars and hey that's actually we could even be profitable if we did it it's like all right well how do we sell this thing we only have you know like 24 hours left and so we just started like posting on our own facebook pages and calling like anybody who we could think of to be like hey would you do you want this for your sorority do you want this for your your group and like we found one girl who he used to date who like basically she bought she was like oh my parents are having an anniversary party and there's like 200 people coming i'll take like 250 of them and we like made a sale and we're like yeah just like read out your credit card i don't even know how we took the payment like we didn't even have anything to take payment we just like took the payment somewhere that paypaled us or something and dude that feeling of getting to a thousand dollars like you could see the smile on my face i still feel that how good that felt that weekend and that was when i first was like oh this is what it feels like to do something real everything else we've been doing is fake and like i was so obvious to me and it changed the way we did our main business too and like that thing paid for like you know a little bit of side hustle money as we went this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform where everything is fully integrated well i can see the clients hold history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago i totally missed hubspot grow better so i've built maybe seven or eight different businesses whether that just be like a real estate thing or the hustle or a court or just whatever i think almost all of them i got to a hundred thousand in sales before i filed an llc and the reason i do that is momentum and like people are like ben's laughing and people are like oh it's illegal first i don't think that's illegal you can use your social security number and like get a lot of the stuff like you can like enter your social security number and second i have no idea it actually might be illegal but like i don't care because i'm willing to like sacrifice those things and get in trouble for the sake of momentum because momentum is like the lifeblood like when you're going because once you start getting sales it gets addicting and you like taste you taste it and it works out amazing listen to this so there's this um so i tweeted out that i want to dress better and this guy who's got like a fashion instagram thing uh what's it called like well-built style or something like that he d on me and he's like hey like look at my instagram like i think it fits what you want and i go yeah this actually is great he goes tell you what i'm gonna make you a presentation on all the things that you buy just send me a pinterest board of the people who you admire and like your personality and i'll study your instagram and study your twitter to understand your body and your personality things like that and i'm going to send you a p uh a powerpoint with like image like it looks for you and then just a link to buy like all these clothes i said all right great what's in it for you he goes if you like it pay me 300 and so he spent like a week doing this and he sent it to me i was like this is sick man i would have paid way more than 300 by the way and i just he goes he goes well that's awesome here's my email just paypal me 300 bucks and i did it and this is a beautiful perfect example of a person who just they just did it they did it the right way and it just worked and like then you do that maybe 10 more times and then eventually you quit you create a questionnaire on your website and then you like do a pay half up front and then you do this and then you do that and then you hire a couple more people like it turns into [ __ ] really fast we don't plan like well how many people would buy this you really just think like well how big do i want it to be and like would a million people buy this over the course of three years yeah maybe that sounds about right all right that's cool let's do it and that's typically how it works for me and uh i think that's how it should work for most people in most cases not all the time some guys are starting big companies like car companies and [ __ ] like that and that doesn't require planning but for most people most of the time this works the the question was about getting rich quick and i think my takeaways are there is a benefit to actually thinking through how would i do it if i wanted to like let me not just be like pretend to be morally opposed to the idea of getting my outcome faster right i think it's fine getting rescued gets a bad rap but like i think we all would love to get to our dream outcomes faster if possible might as well ask the question could i get there really fast and what does the brain come up with you're not obligated to do it second thing is instead of focusing on getting rich quick i would say get revenue quick especially if you're kind of like early in your entrepreneurial career because getting any revenue quick will like make the whole thing real you'll stop playing startup and you'll actually be in the game you'll feel what's real it'll force you to focus on the only the stuff that matters and you won't end up like me with a 300 page binder full of business plans like it's almost like a caricature how dumb that was but it's like i took it to the extreme end of like the wrong way to build a business is like to super over plan and never like go to market and actually try your thing um and you know the fat band thing that i did was by far the best thing i did early on in my my kind of entrepreneurial thing didn't get rich off of it but in a way i did because i actually learned about how to do a business for real which is what ended up helping me become wealthy but you know that skill ended up helping me become wealthy that experience did it was like enough money to get like a bloomin onion and maybe a steak dinner at outback steakhouse so i consider that a success right that's all you want now we were big on that fondue place has you ever been to a fondue place i feel like you're like lactose intolerant you're probably i could i could see that you're lactose intolerant yeah dude are you there you see i look like the embodiment of a glass of milk like it looks like i just eat potatoes milk and corn all day like when you're talking about that fashion guy he was like you know i i think you got potential you you're a tall tall drink of water and it's like a tall glass of milk i get it straight from the udder every morning yeah i mean look at me i'm like a melting bar of chocolate like a melting piece of fudge you're a tall drink of milk yeah yeah if corn were a human it would look like me uh yeah you ever thought about if a corn on the cob had legs yeah yeah all right that's the sign that we're done see ya [Music] you

the illusion that if you had a little more it would make your life a little easier but sometimes if you have a little more it's a burden because now you have to manage it what i mean is intellectually you have to work harder to make sense of it and in that sense it is a burden it's like a job it's just it's just in the nature of things that the grass always seems greener on the other side

so I got asked this question this guy was like hey he dm' me he goes Sean big fan um what the whatever the next sentence you type to me I'm going to do it or I'll die trying and I was like okay and then he's like he's like I'm going to get to $110,000 a month of passive uh passive income profits after you know and you know I'm thinking either a I start a newsletter B I do this other thing and it was like all like kind of like stuff we either stuff we do or like top we talk about e-commerce newsletter or this other thing which one do you think is going to get me there the fastest or the best like which one's the best path and I was like I don't know dude those all seem pretty hard to get to 10K a month like you know if I if I wanted if your goal is really 10K a month um you know I don't know a job will probably get you there but if let's take that off the table for a second let's assume you don't want a job or you don't have maybe the degree to get a six figure job I was like I would just do a productized service [Music] dude Sean so here's the deal we are officially more we're we're popular enough that you have to get your podcast set up right so what I'm going to do is I talked to Ben we're having someone come to your house and my house and they're going to put a two camera setup so they're going to like cut back and forth but you've got to make that room and they they'll help you but you're going to have to make that room look good and it's got It's going to be ready every time dude that's great um also related to that I found a new house that I might move into that's way nicer and I was like uh my main motivation was to make this podcast look better I was like you know I kind of look like a scrub on this podcast like you know like right now I don't have my hair cut don't have a beer trim don't have my my room nice I was like if a 100,000 plus people consume this every time like I would never go out in front of a stadium like this like right I wouldn't even let three friends come to my house and look at my office like this why do I let 100,000 people see the off see see the recording studio like this simply for convenience but uh there's that also I found on have you ever used peace it's like a Airbnb for rentals that are not houses like not necessarily houses to stay in it's like just for a a venue and there's a a place near me for 75 bucks an hour for recording podcast that's like a two camera setup with a sick couch and stuff like that it would be great for inperson stuff but if we're not in person you know just me sitting on a giant cat I'm going to do it I'll come out there and we'll finally do it Ben wanted me to come out there but I didn't want to fly but whatever I'll do it I was talking to HubSpot or someone and I was saying like hey yeah give us budget to make our studio nice cuz we're like the lowest maintenance people you have I was like for example two weeks ago Sean recorded a podcast with literally just one airpod because he didn't have a mic and the other airpod ran out of batteries so he just used his airpod and his laptop so like I think we're due we we're own one that's hilarious um also what I was going to say oh there's this guy I wish I could give him a shout out I don't know what his name is but I kind of want to steal his idea so this guy has this course it's an on demand course that is only about how to make your video camera go from like a before to an after and I was like oh this is the smartest course I've ever seen Ben knows his name I don't think Ben you know his name yeah his name is Kevin Shen Kevin Shen yeah actually I shouldn't shout bleep that out I'm gonna make a my own competitor course so bleep this guy out I'm I'm going to copy him no but I I your setup sucks it's like it's like a fat person given a course on how to lose weight yeah I'm the before story just waiting you see my ACT you're the way before story there's we all know there's the way before there's the before and then there's the after I'm currently hit a before you should the way before was the one airpod recording on no microphone with no light uh yeah and we're I'm going to do the after and then I'm just going to turn that into a it's a on hour thing and just says here's the thing to buy and then cuz here's the problem I've watched a bunch of these YouTube tutorials and they're like oh yeah go get the Sony A5 or you can get the A6 or you can get the d340 and it's like all right well do which one and then you buy it and they're like yeah just connect it to your computer and then okay see now it looks good I was like yeah but you like there was like seven things in between there that like everything went wrong and they're like okay you know you want to there's one guy who's like there some people show you how to put your lights up or whatever but dude this is the new um like your webcam is the new face like is basically yeah it's your suit it's like what people see um like this one time this guy told me he goes he goes yeah dude I I he's like I spent he's like I got to go get my haircut I was like how much you spend on your haircut cuz I was like I he has nice hair and I was like it kind of made it sound like a big deal like I can't do anything today I got to go get my haircut and I was like I just kind of like you know it's like in the middle of another task I'm getting my haircut like that's kind of how I yeah like if the Great Club just so happens to be in the mall that you're at yeah exactly like which Super Cuts do you go to and he was like he was like yeah know I go to this one place she's been cutting my hair for years I go I have a standing appointment and I was like damn dude you're like really into your hair he goes your hair is like half of your face and I was like oh [ __ ] it's so true yeah but you're not into the other half either so it's all good right like you don't moisturize or anything I was like damn he's right I'm just leaving 50% up to Super Cuts like that ain't right like good hair is like an extra two inches of height as far as like you know that goes so anyways dude speaking of being talk speaking of being really good-looking did you see the tweet that happened today so this woman uh this like good-look woman and her good-look husband D hey hey she's married dude they're both handsome um they're they're they're a beautiful couple and they uh she sent me this message basically and I shared the the screenshots on Twitter but basically a year ago you tweeted something I sent you the tweet I actually forget what do you remember what it was no I I didn't see the Tweet what was the original tweet should be is it interesting does it matter uh she said it was like really cringe that she even replied to it in the first place but here I'll pull it up so basically uh you said um I have zero interest in buying a fancy car you know what I want a personal in-house Chef I can't think of a better way to spend money than a chef how do I start want how do I start getting one next week and she replied like hey hire me I'm a chef but I've got about 32 other skills uh whatever and this guy dm'd her and she said that they were just talking about like I guess the chef business or something like that uh yeah I mean it was clear what was going on in the get-go but he like she said she's she sent me the first message and it just they were just like talking shooting the [ __ ] then like he's like hey whatever the thing you were talking about I'm super interested tell me more about whatever that was well if he's from Indi he's from Indiana and she's from Ireland and so she's in Europe he's in America and they start talking back and forth the DMS then they get on a call and she said they hit it off and after two weeks of just constant calls he booked a flight to Europe and for two weeks they they like had this great time and then now a year later so they uh she moved to America it's been a year about since that tweet they're getting married in a couple months and it was all because she said that she listened to MFM and read the hustle she started listening to this she started commenting on your stuff and my stuff he noticed that and then they like I think his Inn was like talking about like the Pod and like oh you like them too and uh it totally worked she sent me a picture of that they're they're both I mean they're both tens It's a good-looking couple so uh our new tagline is MFM getting you paid and laid Yeah there you go yeah and I I'm sure all of our listeners are as good-looking as them yeah I don't think so but they uh they did a good job but I was I was shown this to my mom and I'm like see not it's not just neck beards that listen to this like it's actually like you know like real people who like shower and stuff but it looks good I'm happy for these people so shout out to them maybe we should do a date night every u nine months and we should just bring together listeners and it's just speed dating and let's just see what happens it's going to be like like right like like you know Greg and Steve everyone's going to be named like Chris and Tucker like it's going to be all guys like so so only come if you're looking for a man yeah you exactly yeah exactly see we got the tagline too so it's perfect um that is a pretty cool moment though I'm glad that that happened that's kind of crazy that that happened and uh but Ben uh producer Ben young producer Ben we need your story did you do anything bold when you met your wife did you like this guy I pretty bold move right slide into the DMS yeah figure out some excuse to call each other every day then book a flight go over there and fall in love get married that's kind of amazing did either of you guys do any old moves

to this subreddit to to this Reddit post that I saw right before I logged into this uh to the podcast and I linked it to you so basically there's this sub called fat fire that I like I've sent it to you and every once in a while you get these amazing stories about people because they reveal like their income and things like that and I've been following this lawyer he's a 38y old explain what fat fire is yeah so fat don't know what fat fire fire stands for financially independent retired early traditionally it's like a movement of people who want to save like $500,000 to a million dollars and live off of like 30 or $40,000 a year that's not exactly what it means but that's like traditionally like with the stereotype fat means you want to retire and early and be financially independent but you want to be doing it fat so you want to like you know save like $20 million or something like that so you want to start a company sell it and retire and so it's people who want to retire while they're young and uh do it by still living living la lavishly and it sounds douchy but it's actually quite interesting it's all like entrepreneurs Bankers tech people who like work at a it's just like rich people [ __ ] and which is always fun to like be voyerism old personal injury lawyer and for the past four years he's given an update every couple of years and he explains everything that's going on in his business and so his background is basically that he was a normal he went to a good school and then worked at one of the big law firms which is like something that you like grind for 80 hours a week and hopefully climb your way up and eventually you make a million dollars a year after 10 or 15 years but it's kind of boring and you're like kind of like the your boss's [ __ ] for a long time and it just kind of sucks and so he goes you know what screw this a friend of his got hurt and he goes hey I'll represent you uh just pay me whatever's fair and then he did and he won and then a few other people started coming to him just word of mouth and so he was doing this in the evenings uh while he was still working his main job and after a year he quit to do his own thing that's when his uh income from his Moonlighting became bigger than his normal thing so fast forward now um I believe it's been about eight years since he's been doing this so 2014 to 2022 and He's listed out his income as well of his net worth breaking it down by assets for every single year so in year one it was $300,000 two 600,000 $800 ,000 1.2 million 3 million 5.6 million 6 million 6 million and this year so far 3.3 and it's going to be 8 million this year and that's personal income basically he he has these posts where he breaks down exactly how his businesses work what his current plan is what his growth challenges are what his marketing is and basically he's got like five attorneys that work for him and he's slowly built up to that he gets a little bit of cut of all that they have uh they have 300 cases that they do a year um he talks about grow challenges which is that they're struggling with the CR they don't have a CRM everything's done manually manually and it's a lot of work and one of his goal is goals is to automate a lot of stuff but it's incredibly fascinating for two reasons one this is a sick business right like it's like a just a 37y old smart person but he doesn't seem like that particularly extraordinary but he's like killing it now he says that his net worth is currently $5.8 million um in his kids have a trust front of 1.7 million and then secondly why this is cool for a couple reasons one Alex Heros had this business Alex Heros was a guest here he had this business called gym launch where he basically worked with gyms where he they you paid him 20 or $30,000 and he set up your whole CRM and he set up all the automated emails for onboarding and just kind of set up the automation flow some much you do that for these personal injury attorneys this is awesome they have way more money than Jims and there's probably just as many of them I I have no idea but probably um I don't know what do you think about this post it's pretty cool right I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better this is great I don't go on fatfire as much as you do um I do it from time to time but I don't like I don't know I need to like add it to my feed or whatever uh but yeah this is great 38 years old 15 million $15 million net worth not five uh so 15.8 uh and then the6 million annual income is actually the more stunning part like I'm not surprised that a lawyer at 40 can have 15 million in in net worth it's the 6 million in annual income that's sort of like stunning which makes me want to understand this personal injury lawyer business better like he says like you know I do no marketing I basically just hand out business cards plus I get referrals from my existing clients um but that is a ton that is a ton of like take-home from your like your legal practice I don't think that's common so I wonder what he's doing that's uncommon like he talks about look these cases basically like you know it's not about more cases like 300 cases could end up being worth more than 3,000 cases because you you know you get paid based on the outcome you know the the profits of the of the cases but is that kind of weird like isn't no I don't think so This Guy's in Southern California so maybe he's in San Diego so it's a pretty big city but I think if you look at the top 20 cities in America if you look at the Billboards it's always personal injury uh lawyers and there's this one guy in um in Austin in Austin's like a top 15 City maybe and he says that his earnings are I I forget exactly what it says his earnings are but I looked him up on Instagram and he's got a collection of like 15 Ferraris he was in the newspaper because he had a birthday party for his daughter or for himself and he had like Rod Stewart or someone crazy he spent like three million on that and they talked about his home and he was donating checks for2 or three million and that was in Austin uh his name was Thomas I think something Thomas and I think I know a personal injury attorney in St Louis and he's got a mansion in Miami he's got a place in St Louis where we're from I mean I think some of these guys could could really roll in it and re netting 10 or 20 a year yeah this this is it's wild and I like that idea of the the gym launch for X um I think you're right with lawyers like I see this right now my my father-in-law has senior living facilities and he's always like you know I'm like how's Biz and he's like oh it's good or it's bad but his thing is always just like you know we have a a 64 bed facility and every bed in the facility so like let's say so this is like a a senior living Care Center so basically what he does his model is like he'll buy one so say it has 32 beds but it's permitted for up to up to 80 and just the current owner like doesn't really have the motivation or the construction experience and so he'll he just looks for that first he's like all right you have a good business and I can expand I can just double the number of Beds which will double the net income of this roughly which will double the value of this property so if I'm buying it for four this will be worth to 10 by the time I'm done with it and I got to put in 2 million in construction just round numbers just for for argument sake then he has a management company that will actually like run the thing cuz I was like dude do you know how to run a senior living facility like isn't that hard and weird and he's like well like I don't go there like I I hir this I found one really good property management company and they run all my properties and I was like wow okay she's like yeah she's been doing this for 30 years that's what she does and like she you know she gets a cut um and then the other thing he was saying who's like you know it's all about occupancy right just like any Hospitality type of business you know every bed they pay us on average let's say $6 to $8,000 per month um so you know if we just get like four more bookings you know these are that that adds an extra whatever you know $30,000 a month or whatever to our um to our Revenue which is which is great and so he what he'll do is I'm like so every time I ask him how's business going he's just like uh it's good we lost two clients uh you know we're going to we're going to place another one today and I'm like I'm like how do you get clients and he's basically like oh you know we kind of like she networks with the hospitals they know her so they send her to people like do you advertise at all he's like no how do I do that and I was like oh [ __ ] I was like like if somebody Google searches like you know senior living near me and like you're your city name like do you come up he's like no and there's like these aggregators like these search engines that they like they SEO rank to the top um but I was like I feel like if you just did like dude I knew a guy who owned one of those search engines and he was making a couple million bucks a year and basically he would come up on top on Google and then sell the lead for $200 to your your guy and he would buy that lead and then hopefully close them to make 8,000 a month exactly and so I was like you should either be buying these leads you should set up some referral system you should take you know local newspaper ads local magazines like you know I don't know got to do something on the marketing side and he's just like I don't know that like basically he looks at marketing the way I would look at what he says which is well like just do a renovation and like take it from 32 beds to 64 beds and then get the permits for the memory care from the city and then do this and that it's like what like I got to read this manual and figure out like what color the elevator buttons need to be like I I'm out I just can't do this I fail and like that's what dude set up a Google AdWords account like feels like to him and so I think there's that Arbitrage which is basically how many people are there that are injury lawyers Senior Living centers pool construction companies that just simply don't know digital marketing and like can you build a either a lead gen business or go like consult and help them and like take a share of the increase in Revenue like gym launch it just seems like that is one of like um that is one of the easiest ways to do it so I got asked this question this guy was like hey he dm' me he goes Sean big fan um what the whatever the next sentence you type to me I'm going to do it or I'll die trying and I was like and then he's like he's like I'm going to get to $10,000 a month of passive uh passive income profits after you know and you know I'm thinking either a I start a newsletter B I do this other thing and it was like all like kind of like stuff we do either stuff we do or like topics we talk about e-commerce newsletter or this other thing which one do you think is going to get me there the fastest or the best like which one's the best path and I was like I don't know dude those all seem pretty hard to get to 10K a month like you know if I if I wanted if your goal is is really 10K a month um you know I don't know a job will'll probably get you there but if let's take that off the table for a second let's assume you don't want a job or you don't have maybe the degree to get a sixf figure job I was like I would just do a productized service he's like what does that mean I was like okay even just skip product tize just a service I was like you totally basically find one niche of a business and figure out how what you can do that helps them make more money so I was like maybe it's just email marketing services for e-commerce companies maybe it's lead gen for pool construction companies maybe it's um you know this it's like you know the the gym launch Playbook where it's like yeah I'll just do sales calls for you and like I'll help you close X you know new customers every month or you know I'll make your website convert 1% better you know through a series of experiments and you pay me a flat fee of four four grand a month and like that 1% for you is going to be worth at least 10x more than that you know these are the simplest things I was like and then what do you do how do you get clients like let's assume you don't have any money you create content that just talks about like for example if you're doing conversion rate optimization for an e-commerce store you just post check out what these guys do in their ad to cart you know in their cart shopping cart that inove improves conversion by 8% check out what these guys do with their email pop-up check out what these guys do with their checkout buttons and we did this change and this changed this percent or like here's a collection of the best you know whatever uh designs for landing pages and people will see that and they'll be like oh yeah smart and they'll one time you do it they'll be like H that's smart the second time they'll be like those are smart third time you do it they'll be like he's smart let me just hire this guy like I just want this problem solved and like you could do that and you can get to 10 20 30k a month of profit and that is a way better path than like I think what most people think about doing instead yeah and also I hate that question because I get that all the time too I'm like I don't [ __ ] know man what are you good at like I I you know I I don't know like go play in the NBA like I I I have to know like what your attributes are I hate that question I'm just like you know what I mean it's the stupidest question ever I cannot stand that because they just want me to like tell them what to do you like that one they just want me to tell tell them what to do but when you have zero context it's just useless bull crap advice yeah I I I could see that but also I don't know I kind of empathize like I empathize but I think it's stupid I can I can I can understand why you ask that and think it's stupid I understand why you're doing this stupid thing I totally get it yeah I I would have I asked that question too and now I know it's it's not the right question yeah but then you got to follow up with what is the right question well you just need more context you know um oh who's stupid now who's stupid now stupid I never said I wasn't either dude did you know that Elon do you know Elon Musk has a sister what what kind of amazing subject change is that uh no I didn't know that I only knew about Kimble musk okay well she elon's got a sister and she owns this thing called passionflix.com it's basically like uh audio erotica I believe like like like you know like uh uh it's the tagline is I'm familiar yeah the video guy myself but all right I guess you can always close the tab just listen the subject or the tagline is Passion flicks get your passion on romance on demand for $6 a month and uh it's basically romance novels which we had talked about uh in your ears I guess like audio books um but you know do we do we get credit for this like does el mus sister listen to the podc because we've been talking about this for a long time and you I think you should tell the story again cuz the pod's much bigger than the first time tell your story about the romance novel thing tell first the story about how you did it for the hustled as a marketing stunt and then what you did with uh with our buddy all right so for the hustle when we the very first article we ever launched we had to come out with a bang and I knew this guy who basically would plagiarize others PE other people's books on how to sleep with women and he would get a Filipino to rewrite it to it pass the Kindle plagiarism like filter and then he would game it by buying reviews and he was making 50 to $60,000 a month and like I would joke with him but I was like dude a this is super unethical and B you don't even sleep with women like you don't know anything about this topic I can't believe you're like living this lie but whatever he was making money and so we wrote an article about that when it first came out and to prove that it was legit because a lot of people didn't believe us we go fine watch we're going to copy this and do and do it and instead of doing in like the hot to sleep with women category uh we did it for romance Cate the romance category because if you look at the the the liquidity of the marketplace on Amazon romance novels has the most amount of buyers and also like the most amount of transactions like these women are always buying this stuff and so we like looked at like what the popular categories were and there was like women who want to have sex with like a werewolf there was like women who want to have sex with um like military people and so we made like a like a fantasies right yeah so we made military guy a rich billionaire guy right that's 50 Shades of Gray a vampire that's Twilight right that that's how fantasy vampire that's so we made like a military vampire werewolf guy we like combined all of them and then we found like like the t is that really what you did yeah well we found we did that for the title so we found a book that was good and we just like plagiarized it and then like made the title like in the description about like a vampire werewolf military guy billionaire I forget like it was like a joke we did all of them and then we gained the system so in a couple weeks or in a week we were the number one best-selling in a particular category and we like changed our LinkedIn to like bestselling author and uh CU because we were like how do we get like speaking gigs now and which I didn't know at the time but we actually plagiarized the largest romance publisher in the world Harley Quinn books and they called us I thought they were going to like sue us because they sent this angry email and and and then in the email or on the call they're like look we get it you're you're you're making you're not really making fun of romance novels you're making fun of this like Kindle thing which we agree is silly but you and you use us an example no big deal we get it but you got to take it down so we took it down so whatever and so I've always been curious about this industry and so about two years ago three maybe three years ago my friend Ramon and I we created this website called captivating oh no what was it called the first book was called captivating CLA uh what was this that was the book of the book that we launched captivating CLA what was the book was it a short boo romantic we launched a website called short boo romantic. wordpress.com and we basically we got someone on Fiverr we got someone on short but romantic. wordpress.com is the least short and least romantic doain you could possibly have chosen yeah it was horrible and and so we uh we created short but romantic and we and we got someone on Fiverr to write like a part one of like a like a sexy story thing like I frankly I didn't even read it and then we got another Fiverr guy to narrate it and then we put it on the website and we said part one of like captivating CLA or whatever it was and it was like read the story and then at the end it said do you want part two sign up here for $25 a month and we'll send one of you one of these every single day and we put ads on Facebook for it and I made like U I found like this girl that I went to college with and I was like hey can I use your face on this uh this website and act like you're the author and like you're the one behind it because it wouldn't look good if it was me and so we did and we got like $500 in Revenue in like 12 hours because the ad rate was crazy and if you went to the website people were commenting on this saying like this story is amazing I love this I want more of this you saw it right yeah I remember the I remember seeing the Prototype and I it was like dude Sam is a genius man like I love how you spin these things up I love the names that you pick I love the like the speed to Pro speed to launch um I love the way that you did the test which was most people would go and spend months trying to find an author and write a book and you were like you know you just were like okay where wolf military uh you know blonde girl named Claire Claire wants to feel uh captured no Claire wants to feel you know contemplated no captivated yes sorry captivating Claire um Claire wears a red dress and she bumps into this billionaire and his hand grazes her thigh and that's it we got it all right we're working now like I just see I saw the website and I just saw your fingerprints all over so I was like I remember being so impressed and I tried we invested in our buddy for this cuz I was like dude this is a great Market to be in and if you're kind of grow hacky you're going to do this and nobody else is doing this right it was like there's so little competition cuz most most serious people could never bring themselves to do this so it's just you're going to compete with the other not so serious people that are out there on Earth and like I would put our skills up there with any of them yeah absolutely and it was a good idea actually but the thing that was the the thing that was the thing was like I don't give a [ __ ] about this neither did he you know like this was exactly what we weren't exactly fueled by this uh passion to create these like sex novels and so we kind of like shut it down but a listener a podcast listener did something like this and he spun it up I think to 10,000 in Revenue a month like really fast right yeah that's what I think so and then also um there was a difference I think there's a difference between like literal audio porn and then like romance novels and this I think passion flicks the El what Elon musk's sister is doing is the uh the romance novels uh on demand $5.99 a month so I actually think this is a great idea um you know I I B I think there's a great idea if you're good at internet marketing and you're like you know got a good sort of sense of humor about yourself I think that this is a uh a business that will work if you apply enough pressure it's hard though to like stay excited about it for a long time unless you just love selling widgets in fact our buddy Ramone the first time I met him you introduce me to him we go out to a lunch he's telling me his life story and his life story is full of like substance it's like you know I was raised in the Netherlands and then like you know I had this I was kind of like out on my own at a young age and then like I have I'm a single father to my son and blah blah blah like whatever he know had a bunch of things that were like you know these Journeys throughout his life lifetime that were like you know these these meing you I train MMA like he seemed like a dude who like you know he really kind of like you know was self-made in many ways and then I was like so do you like I kind of expected him to be like you know so that's why I'm working on this thing that has like this deep meaning also and and I was like so what was your last business he's like oh um created a soap opera blog and I sold it for $10 million and I was like what I was like cuz you love soap opers he's like no never seen one in my life I was like what the hell and I was like how did this work he's like and there's a he's the second episode of this podcast so if you scroll all the way back to the second episode I think it's Ramone it's one of the best episodes ever that's been on the Pod fast feed but basically he's like yeah I just went on Facebook and there was an Arbitrage opportunity where like you could buy Facebook page likes Facebook wanted to promote pages so you could get you could advertise a page for like you could get a like for like a Cent and I just figured out oh cool once I get them to like my page I could post a link then I'll get them to my website and like okay that cost like seven cents to get them to my website and then Google AdSense can give me 9 cents or 12 cents or whatever like there's some like money Arbitrage there so he's like so then I just had to figure out what is the um you know what's the best categories like so I spun up like 22 Facebook pages about every Niche I could think of and yeah his Niche it was like it was like WWF wrestling and like soccer and like politics and just a bunch of crazy stuff yeah every interest you could think of and he's like okay which one's the best and he said the top three I think were wrestling uh no number one was like right-wing conservative politics which you know turned out to be like what Facebook you know really really like overran Facebook also and he was like I just don't want to do this it doesn't make anyone happy yeah yeah so that one he's like all right I'm going to scratch that out he goes then the next two are wrestling and soap operas and he's like all right let's do soap wrestling he never really told me that part but whatever so uh details so he he's like all right well what do people care about they care about like spoilers like what's going to happen on tomorrow's Days of Our Lives and it turns out you could just like buy or like you could just sign up to get the like the sneak peek of like the synopsis of what happens tomorrow and he would just like publish that as a long form thing and he'd have hired some people to write for it and so some women were writing for this stuff whatever so he was doing that and he ends up selling the thing for 10 million in cash basically it was making like 3 400,000 a month in profit it was very profitable yeah and so you you you met him he he reached out to you from the hustle he goes uh here's my story you know I want to tell it and you were like no way this sounds fake and he's like well here's my analytics and here's my bank account like go ahead look and you were like what and you guys met you you guys like best friends so you introduced me you're like hey you and the email you go Sean meet rone and and you're like uh Sean's a good buddy smart guy nice like you know normal intro stuff yeah like SE this is Ramone I trust Ramone with my life like wow incredible incred int how do you remember that and because it's it stuck out to me right it was like so I don't know this is one of those writing things I'm like wow that was amazing and then I met Ramon and I also now trust Ramone in my life he's just that kind of guy and so he told me at that meeting he goes I was like so you just you just you'll just work on whatever or like for your next thing you know you going do something like soap propers or whatever he goes you see this cup and there like a little like you know at a restaurant the water cups are the shitty plastic ones he goes um if I could just move this cup from here to here and it's like I make 10 I make a dollar doing that then I'm the I'm a cup salesman like he's basically I'll sell anything like and so what ended up happening was he was going to do this romance thing and you I spun up this test and it started to work and um but one of his other businesses that he had bought was like started to work even better and so he just kind of he tried to do both for a little while but he's like and that other one was equally as weird it was a dog ramp business for weener dogs so they can get on the couch yeah actually it's even worse than the plastic cup he's like do you have a Wier dog no oh well if you did you know that if they tried to jump on or off the they could get hurt I I guess so yeah we Mak we making sell ramps for weener dogs to get it on and off the bed I was like what and he was like yeah we'll do like you know 7 million this year I was like what the hell and so you know then that business grew like crazy or whatever um and so I was like wow this guy is like you know this guy he was just so different than everybody else in Silicon Valley I loved it I loved how different he was he lived here but it was like an alien living in Silicon Valley like he just did not have anything to do with software or venture capital or like Hightech stuff he was literally like a like a cup salesman W wandering around Sil Valley making millions of dollars selling like the most arbitrary like you know gadgets like you know fidget Spinners to to you know like elderly when I first met him um he was wearing like sweatpants and like a shirt with holes in it and like old Jordans and I was and he's like a huge like big white dude and I'm like and he has an accent you know and I talking to him like what who is this guy and we start walking back to his car um cuz I was going back to my office and I was walking to his car and I see he had a brand new Tesla at the time the nicest fanciest Tesla it was like $150,000 I was like oh sick car he go he was like thanks bro had a pay all cash for it cuz I don't have a credit score and I was like what I guess you're legit yeah and we we make him sound braggy but he is the opposite braggy like he'll just be like like he'll just show up with something or like like I don't know like he'll do something that you're like that makes no sense whatsoever and then when you dig in it's because he like always takes the hard weird path to do stuff in this hilarious way and it's what makes him incredible I love it yeah he's crazy um like he he got diagnosed with like a herniated disc and then like on the way home from the doctor like signed up for an Iron Man and it's like what are you doing why are you choosing this I did the Iron Man with why must you choose violence I did the Iron Man with him it was me him and suie and um meron literally got last he got last that they he he was so slow that he didn't train at all he just showed up and when he got and when he showed up he had this bike and he was like hey could someone show me how I use these shoes that clip into the pedals like he didn't know how to like he was like riding his bike for like the first time like taking the tag off of it and uh it's Iron Man it's really hard and he got dead last but he finished like it like there was there like the golf cart was rolling behind him and it was getting dark at night and they were going to try they were about to pull him off the course but he like pushed him off he goes I'm finishing oh that's incredible um all right Let's do let's do some other ones I got some uh okay I got I got an idea and then a really I got a bad idea that I have and then a really good idea for a company that I just heard about which one do you want the good one I would like the got a bad one and a better one do you want the better or the bad all right so the great one there's a company called ghost um that I just heard about so this story to me is kind of incredible so if you go to compor no it's a new one so GST G sorry GH St so it's ghost without the O um I think it's ghost .io is the name of it oh this is already too too new age for me I'm out no no no you're going to you're going to appreciate this you're going to you're out but I'm G bring you back in here's the so I heard about this because uh this guy who's like a VC somewhere he goes back in 2020 um our team started to notice a big shift that was going on with like stores like Walmart Target like any big store was that basically remember when Co happened and like the supply chain shut down and like the [ __ ] ship got stuck in the canal and like everything was just bad like shipping container prices went through the roof and so everybody had like a shortage right when demand went like through the roof because everybody was at home everybody was ordering tons of products and um we were all getting stimulus checks and stuff like that right so that's like demand went way up to shop because people couldn't go do experiences and Supply went way down and it was like this crazy situation and so what happened was retailers basically they ordered more to try to catch up cuz nobody knew how long the pandemic and stuff would go and also like the stuff that got delayed like finally showed up and what that created was like this huge glut of excess inventory over a trillion dollars of excess inventory was kind of like the uh the guess and so These Guys these these Adventure C sort of notice this trend and they posted this 26-page PDF called the inventory apocalypse is coming and they were just like look we are looking at this like a combination of people returning things the supply chain glut and then Brands over ordering to try to keep up with like this the EXP explosion in e-commerce right like um there's just too much inventory on hand and this is all playing out now like that was in 2020 2021 something like that now in 2022 if you go look there's these amazing charts of like all if you notice all the every brand is like discounting like crazy right now they're like oh 40% off summer sale semiannual sale like liquidation whatever and it's because everybody has way too much inventory to hold and so um and like Target and Walmart I think have come out and said some crazy public number Ben see if you could find it like how much excess inventory is on the Shelf it's some absurd number so anyways these guys put this out and at the same time this startup gets started by this guy Josh and d and um and and D is kind of well known in like the kind of like e-commerce World um and so they they go and they start this company basically what they do is they they're creating like a Marketplace or a clearing house so any it's called ghost because it's like any retailer rather than doing a huge discount which kind of like it kind of cheapens your brand it sort of just pulls forward Revenue that like your customers probably would have spent full price but like in order to move inventory you kind of like you you gave it away cheaper and you you know you sort of eroded your premium uh prices or whatever um it basically connects them to the Liquidators of the world so there's like uh TJ Maxx Ross Marshalls like those types of companies but there's also just like International versions of those companies there's like boutiques and and wholesalers that could carry your stuff uh there's basically like a way to like get rid of inventory that's on your shelf that you're directly selling and you could sell it wholesale for somebody else to kind of move you'll take a discount with them and that's better than giving a discount to your customers who like then they'll get trained to expect and wait for 30 40% discounts rather than paying the premium price I'm back in so this is awesome dude their I knew you come back in their site has five words on it and it's beautiful I look at their site and it's literally five words we make your inventory disappear and the but the way that it looks I love it and there's like a a a smoky cloud like a go like a like something evaporated right behind yeah and then basically what it seems like what they're doing is they're creating a private Marketplace so this is key right like it's got to be private can't be public and it's a Marketplace between your retailer who has excess inventory and these wholesalers and Liquidators who will take this sort of like excess inventory they'll pay you know they'll get it at a huge discount and then they'll flip it on their own that's their business so it's kind connecting these two through um through this B2B Marketplace and I think the thing is growing like crazy so I think they said um let's see in the first year I believe they got to um multi-million dollar net revenue so not gmv uh profitably and they're like not even launched yet like you got to like sign up to do a demo and [ __ ] like that with them but just knowing what I know about like what's going on in e-commerce I could tell you this thing is going to be big like I need to chase these guys down to go invest in this because this is a real problem and marketplaces are the best type of internet business but like you it sort of feels like all the it's like all the good ones are T all the good guys are taken it's like oh all the good marketplaces are taken like someone did it for you know Amazon did it for this eBay did it for that you know Etsy does it for crafts it sort of feels like there's no marketplaces left I think this could be one of those multi-billion dollar marketplaces that comes out well it's not a Marketplace it's just software isn't it no it's a Marketplace they're connecting buyers and sellers they're connecting the all the retailers but so the the fee they don't charge a fee to the people for using their software it's it's just they'll set it up for free which is probably it's a huge integration process they set it up for free and then they make the transaction they make a a transaction fee that's my guess so I think it's probably similar I think one of the closest analogies is a company called Fair which also does something similar so fair is like I have an e-commerce brand I want other retailers like you know Suzy's uh you know gift shop to carry my product well it'd be consum time consuming to go find all the sus Corner shops contact them sell them my services create purchase orders and like manage that whole thing so fair created a Marketplace to do that and it's a like 10 billion dollar company or something like that it's like one of the one of the faster growing startups that exists um this is doing that but more on the like larger Liquidator types like more like the TJ Maxx Ross like uh types versus um you know just like kind of so and so's Boutique shop that wants to carry your stuff dude this is sick yeah you're right I'm in this is actually amazing um I'm eager to see how this plays out there's nothing on on the internet about him though so like when I research it I can't find a thing yeah I think they literally just came out of stealth yesterday basically so um that's that's how we saw it um let me tell you okay now can I tell you my bad idea it's also in the e-commerce space so how do I want to put this let me sell you let me sell you on this let me turn on the charm a little bit Sam you're a goodlooking dude um in fact I would say whatever you wear tends to look good I feel like if I almost wore that same shirt it wouldn't look as good right because you got the body you don't need you don't need to go pay you know crazy amounts of money at you know whatever Scotch and Soda our favorite brand here at my first million you don't got to go pay for the fancy stuff because honestly if you dress in basic blacks and whites neutral colors um you'll look good and in fact there are a lot of people that are out there that may not be as fit as you but they do subscribe the same philosophy which is they kind of just want to opt out of the fashion game like I went to Lululemon to go I just wanted something that's high quality that fits well and I went and I found a pair of shorts and a and a T-shirt and um the shorts were $85 and the T-shirt was like you know whatever $77 for one right and so if I just wanted to have really awesome Basics like high quality Basics that are um premium premium like material and fit but uh I don't care about the brand name I'm not looking for the status uh where would I go today to get that do you have a a place in mind where I might go for something like that for plain t-shirts clean fresh teas those are my fave $10 t-shirts that fit pretty good and that's mostly it for for for basic [ __ ] and so there's there's that there's like let's say italic I think italic does this with uh I think I don't know if you're also an investor in tallic I am but like they do it with cool stuff like handbags and scar and like a lot of designery type of stuff it's like a wider selection but I think that somebody can go create the Costco for clothes and what do I mean by this I think you could create a business model that flips it on its head instead of paying the 4X 5x 6X 7x markup that you pay today when you go buy a shirt and you buy a shirt for $25 that shirt probably cost $5 to make is that true and so yeah so you're gonna you're I think on average you're gonna be paying some between something between 3 and 4x is like a normal markup and then if you once you get into like Lululemon and luxury you're going to be paying more like probably 6 or 7x is my guess here um they're public so you could go find their their actual like margins but like let's assume that's what about like a Louis Vuitton thing what about like a $500 Gucci shirt th those are different you're buying those literally for the status um so let's let's put them as a separate category I'm focusing on more of like you go buy something from Nike or from Lululemon or Alo yoga or like whatever these brands that are like you're just trying to have a high quality version of a of a fairly basic uh thing but there's like some status component what I'm saying is let's strip away the status so I'm saying basic girl stuff yeah you create a company called neutral and neutral basically just it opts out of the fashion game it says first of all I don't need your status I don't need your brand name second of all I don't need your fancy designs third I don't need to pay 5x markups because what a waste like what if I just want to pay for the actual cost of the goods so what it is it's a membership like Costco where Costco's model is you pay whatever 100 something is bucks a year for the membership and then they give you all the groceries at Cost Plus 10% and the 10% is just their like the labor and the stocking and the the stuff it takes to actually like move the goods around um and so because of that you get incredible value out of Costco moms love shopping at Costco for that reason uh they're not sacrificing on quality they just are sacrificing on the fluff the the packaging The Branding the shelves the store experience and they say screw that I don't need to have a fancy display in the store I don't need to have fancy packaging like just give me the stuff raw um I'll pay the the actual Goods Cost Plus 10% and I'll pay you the membership fee because hey for me I make back the membership fee within you know my first month or two of shopping with you I think somebody could do that with all basics for clothing and just say we're going to go get the same quality as like whatever the highest quality you know fit and and materials are for like you know these fancy little lemon type Brands and just provide it at the actual cost so You' be buying like that same shirt for for $ eight or $9 and it's a step up from like hannes and H&M or whatever but you're getting it at and you and the marketing is that hey you're paying nothing for the brand name in fact there's no brand on this it's like brand list right um all you got to do is pay the membership fee and make this happen now the counterargument is there was a company that tried to do this called brand lless they tried to do it like home and [ __ ] like that they went business I think that was harder I think I think it I think it's amazing I think the problem there's basically like I asked myself like two or three questions when I'm like looking at which projects to start the the it's basically like do people want this and can I pull it off this one falls into the second category do people want this yeah obviously it's not going to be hard to get people to buy this [ __ ] can I possibly pull that off that sounds so challenging like your experience seems challenging uh pulling it off like what like getting the products like just the logistics of the having tons and tons of SKS um like that seems really hard uh trying to get members to sign up profitably seems a bit of a challenge is uh italic able to get uh to do they have any profit or no uh I mean I can't really say if they have profit or not but like you know they're doing well and they're growing so they are getting members to sign up uh people are are buying into the value proposition they're retaining the question is like you know there's some payback period and is that you know if that payback period is like you know one month wow this is one of the best businesses ever if it's 12 months okay you know it's going to be it's going to be more cash intensive type business you have an e-com company do you think would you ever work on this I wouldn't work on it just because knowing what I know now about e-commerce I'm like oh there's easier ways to win but if I was going to work in e-commerce I think an idea like this is a better idea than 99% of e-commerce ideas because I think you'll end up with subscription Revenue I think you're differentiated and I think you appeal to the lowest common denominator so you're like you're not uh like everybody needs shirts so like there's some Brands like cuts and fresh clean teas these brands have scaled to like a 100 million plus in Revenue in I don't know three or four years and you look at it you're like dude really it's just a t-shirt brand and they're doing just the t-shirts like you know well like this they're not offering at the factory cost and they're not offering it on subscription right so that's the key difference here but the fact that they've been able to scale that much without it to me is like extremely impressive and it just sort of speaks to the fact that like everybody needs shirts and it's like an everybody problem whereas like like my e-commerce or like we talked about Ramon's dog ramp thing like that only works if you have not only a dog but a small dog not even really a small dog like a small dog that might get hurt and can't get up and downstairs or a bed very easily and you want that dog in that applies to me that applies to me like I have three of alpa's ramps in my house because like my dog is like this tiny little baby dog you have like this massive self-sufficient dog that like you know has like a college degree so like you your dog doesn't need like a hand me down to like like a ramp to like you know get help him up uh you know onto a couch sorry dude my dog dog doesn't even drink water from a bowl I have to like carry her to the sink and I my hand is a small bowl my hand is a small bowl and she drinks only freshh water from my hand dude just give it outside for a week it'll toughen up like that's crazy that you do this [ __ ] man how are you so soft dude you uh you just interviewed this guy Rich Roll who like does all these interviews and [ __ ] and you're like you're like the least like you don't even leave your house yeah he like he was like yeah I did this competition it was uh you know fantastic challenge 300 mile run across three nights and like I was like what like I was like I went to Target last week yeah like no I didn't I inst guarded from Target last week but like I had to step foot outside to bring the groceries into my home and it was like My toe got a little cold that's fing hilarious how are your dogs that bad uh you know what you know like dogs start to look like their owner like you know my dog is like a spoiled little brat and I'm a spoil a little brat about life too I don't know it's good we we we suit Each Other Well when my dog was young uh like every once in a while like I would just be like I'm just not going to feed you until you behave like and it worked dude my dog doesn't eat dog food nor does she eat like chicken or like anything that normal my dog only eats Clover 4% cottage cheese that's freshly scooped into her bowl mixed with a little bit of dog food with an appetizer bone before it she won't eat if you if you don't do that she's like cool I'll die like I'll just die if you're fine blood's on your hands if you just want me to die like she'll go five days without eating unless she gets her cottage cheese oh my God that's your fault that this is crazy I can't believe you for sure it's my fault how old is a dog when's it when will it die oh whoa bro come on I mean like how long like how long when will it die how long will you own this animal for forever a 100 years that's how long I'm going to own my dog dude my dog is getting close to dying and I'm going to be hilarious but I'm getting his I'm getting his face tattooed on me and I'm just I'm GNA have a tattoo of a massive Pitbull face on my body and I think it's going to be like the greatest thing ever they're GNA like people are going I'm just gonna be like this this like walking walking like what the [ __ ] are you like this like yepy bougie Tech guy with pull tattoos on them I'm going to be like driving people are going to be like they're not going to know what to think it's going to be wonderful yeah that's going to be not even in your bottom three worst [Laughter] tattoos we're acted like 12y olds we should leave we should leave yeah B you got to just stop the recording when we cross whatever that line is you got to just be like like we won't even real that it stopped recording just don't worry for your own good I catch you guys off like I the elementary school teacher like Sam we took a gold gold star off your chart after that comment yeah by the way you weren't here the other day Ben and we were like talking about something and we were like [ __ ] this sucks without Ben like our moral compass we don't know if this is right or wrong keeping you guys on the straight and narrow all right well what do we think I think that was pretty good [Music]

most people who sell their first business have no idea that it feels like having the rug pulled out from underneath you you see a big dollar amount and you're so focused on the sale that it's the everything else that's kind of the shock most important one is the momentum or the platform that you don't even realize how valuable it is before you sell you really have to think about not just the pros but the cons particularly in an environment like today this year in a low interest rate environment

i started a pe firm alone to buy a business but it wasn't your typical pe firm my office my quote unquote office was just a library at school there was no fund uh like no money i had a lot of help i had over 50 unpaid interns come from craigslist and i had them sift through over 400 000 private companies for a year and a half before i found eggcartons.com [Music] so a while back maybe a month ago i came on here and i was like um dude there's this business have you heard of this business called eggcartons.com and you're like no what is that well that's exactly what it sounds like you go to eggcartons.com and it's a place where you could buy the packaging the carton for eggs um and like but also packaging for a bunch of different varieties of eggs like huge shipments small ones eco-friendly not eco-friendly but also just like in general like other packaging materials as well so i was like yeah fascinating business right like you go there it's an old school looking website you know it's like dial 1 800 eggs dot com you know whatever like to call us to place an order and i was like this is fascinating so i dug in i was like who's behind this and i basically found that it used to be owned by this guy he ran it for 24 years i was like okay this sounds about right you know his linkedin picture was him like with a you know like a phone with a cord in it and he's like got it up to his neck and he's like sitting at a messy desk and i was like ah this looks like the guy who started edcard.com 25 years ago but now as i notice oh it says like he ended his ownership one year ago so who who's behind this and i saw that there was this woman named sarah moore who was like not what you would expect to be like it's like oh this person should be like the ceo of lululemon or something like that why is she getting into egg cartons of all like beautiful harvard graduates yeah like you he looks like a celebrity a little bit um and so i tried to reach out to her i couldn't get a hold of her and but i couldn't resist so i came on the pod and i told the story it's like yeah so basically it looks like she purchased this business uh she did like one tiny interview about it and but i had done one thing that i didn't tell you about i don't think that day which is i've been experimenting with a format that i wish people use more on me like when people reach out to me they're like oh i'd love to talk to you sometime like if you have a question just send me the question in fact if you have a bunch of questions like just send me a google doc i'm going to look at it and if i want to answer i'll answer if i don't i don't and so that's what i did to her i go i sent her an email i said egg cartons like with five exclamation points i go that's hilarious like what a hilarious niche i go we got this podcast i'd love to feature you on it um i have five questions for you on this google doc if you answer them with bullet points i'll tell your story on the podcast we get 20 million dollars a year it'll be great for your business i go this is me on twitter by the way whatever i sent it no reply for 20 days um then she go she emails me out of the blue she goes i couldn't have paid someone to make me sound as cool as you and sam did on the podcast last week thank you so much i filled out your google doc i think they'll answer your questions i would have responded earlier if i didn't think this was spam um blah blah send me send me your address i'll send you some world-class egg cards right so i want to read you what she what what what did you heard what she replied but did you want any are you gonna are you gonna accept those cartons very nice really yeah very sorry very nice of you sarah but thank you but no thank you no dude everything in the house could turn into like a toy storage container you they have toys for all shapes and sizes all right so all right what did you say so i basically said here's my question i go you go you bought eggcards.com did you buy it alone as part of a pe firm she goes alone-ish i started a pe firm alone to buy a business but it wasn't your typical pe firm my office my quote-unquote office was just a library at school there was no fund like no money i had a lot of help i had over 50 unpaid interns come from craigslist and i had them sift through over 400 000 private companies for a year and a half before i found eggcartons.com what yeah i know then i go i so that was my first question second question i go how the heck did you buy it uh oh no why the heck did you buy it what about the business made you want to buy it was it the name the customer retention what drove you to it she goes my goal was to buy a business with all debt so i could have 100 ownership i had no collateral though except for my 2012 rav4 so i was trying to find something that was already stable enough that i could pitch a bank that the business itself was the collateral instead of my rav4 um that so i needed historical cash flows this business fit because it had been profitable since it started in 2001 had a high barrier to entry given the domain name and 100 plus other similar domain names that they own like egg cartons like misspelled and carton.com uh blah blah blah then she says the founder has usually purchased all these domains over the years to protect their like their demote it was simple enough it was also a simple enough business that somebody with zero operational experience me uh and average intelligence me could operate if they tried hard enough i was like wow this is incredible then i said i said i live in silicon valley people here are obsessed with crypto ai blah blah blah they would underestimate edcards.com can you give us a sense of the scale of the business that's a really good way to find that 10 million that's a beautiful way to frame that question because you nagged her a little bit like you said something a little rude you're like yeah you know it's probably not that big but maybe it is you know like impress me right i would think this is small but you know i'd love to be surprised would you say that this is more than this and less than this and so she anyway she came back with i'm in the middle of something that prevents me from sharing the numbers publicly uh all i can say is that our revenue is less than 50 million and i was like oh okay okay but that you not less than 20 if it was less than 20 i feel like you would've said less than 20. i feel like that that would be the case um i said how did you negotiate the deal she's like ah there's a bunch of contacts here she goes in summary i harass the owner until he replied then we hit it off we came up with the valuation together then i contacted over 100 banks most of which told me to f off one of them threw me a bone and agreed to an under uncollateralized loan the final deal was 75 bank debt and 25 the seller's note she bought this with no money down like the bank financing and the seller financed it she said before buying the business i had i i overpaid an accountant to check my work and do an audit of the business because frankly i had no idea what i was doing his fees got rolled into the deal itself so uh she used an account to cover her ass but also paid him out of the deal itself this one is amazing any other fun tidbits or anecdotes i i could share here's what she says this is where it gets great she goes uh while searching for the business i participated in several research studies just to make money uh like to while i was doing my search i went from i went legally blind from a deodorant study for a bit so i had to take a break from working from working until i could read again she goes my response rate was awful i started doing borderline insane things to get a reply at one point i took a photo of myself wearing a sweatshirt that said i want to buy your business with a massive grin and i faxed it out to thousands of businesses a day to this day i run into owners who recognize me from those faxes one of those owners is actually my neighbor then she says the library we worked out of required a school id to enter most of my interns didn't go to the school so we had to get fake id's for all the interns to get into the library every time we hired someone there was a lag because we would need to get more ids during before covet i used to fly to china i needed to examine the egg cartons on my first trip to india i got held by indian customs and interrogation for hours because they didn't believe that i was coming to india alone they did not believe that i was coming to investigate egg cartons uh related to india i almost got killed there i rejected a shipment from an indian vendor the his whole family lived there he was furious started chasing after me the hotel put me into incognito mode for my safety my driver luckily was at the door that i ran out of otherwise i'd probably still be there buried underground um she goes when i bought the business i considered an egg company but now i think of it as specialty packaging forty percent of our business comes from things entirely unrelated to eggs you'd be very surprised by our customer base you know think big brands like boeing spacex disney madison square garden crayola et cetera anything that requires protection and separation is fair game um anyways there's one one more i should say but dude what's the other one is sarah moore not my hero is she my hero is she not my hero this woman's wonderful why is she why didn't she talk about this publicly more often this is like it i feel like there was tons and tons of stories there dude you know people there's some people who are so in the game that they're like they're like oh yeah what am i going to stop and chat about the game like i'm in the [ __ ] game right like that's the feeling i get from her i've met some people that are like this that they're sort of like it's a combination of they kind of don't realize how story worthy their story is until like quite a bit later and the second thing they're sort of like you know either they just prefer privacy or they're like yeah i don't really know why i need to do that so why would i do that it's going to be kind of braggy and kind of weird and what's the benefit and maybe i'd just rather be personal um so i think that like i know a handful of people that i'm like dude i wish i could tell their story on the podcast because they're epic but they just don't see value in this and they're also not consumers of it that's the other thing i've noticed most of those people don't listen to a bunch of podcasts or take inspiration from it so it's kind of a foreign idea to them they're like they're like people will care it's like yeah of course people will care about this this is awesome so anyways i was totally inspired by the story and she is uh kind of amazing she is one of us she no small boy stuff for sarah moore so i think she's only when you if you google her you basically can't find anything i mean there's next to nothing on her there's like one or two pictures there's very little i found one article where it says that she's 28 and she uh it says she answered the question what inspired you to start buying companies she says freedom what is your mantra don't take counsel from your fears like that's pretty much all she and like she answered nothing this woman's amazing why can't we find anything about her there's a lot there's a lot going on with her we need to uh convince her to come on there's a 30 chance she's a fat guy named craig so like you know we could be getting catfished here i wouldn't put it past her uh but i'm gonna go with the with what i see i think she's amazing [Music] you

how much do you think obama charges i would have guessed 250 to 350k that's my guess for like a speaking engagement but honestly it could be more it could be like double that dude so i think it's i heard rumors it's in like the one two 1.2 million range and that makes way wow obama is not gonna get out of bed for less than a million [Music] all right what's going on i have been bursting at the seams to tell you a story you sent me the teaser you go i got the best story i was like all right let's hear it you're like on the podcast not here i was like okay well give me like a clue can't say anything on the podcast so i'm here now two days of a tease later let's hear it all right so there was this guy who you had in the podcast the comedian hassan what's his last name minaj minhash yeah

like surely you get that a lot right he goes yeah like sometimes but like it sounds tall i'm short and i was like well i it was for a podcast and i only saw his like upper torso and like why am i even explaining this like this doesn't even make sense so i turn around and i walk away and he and he goes hey man um and he and then he chases me down and he goes what uh what podcast did you say i was like i told him originally mfm i go it's my first million and he goes are you sam parr i go yeah what's going on and he goes check this out and he holds up his phone and he had my first million up on his spotify and he was like you know previously listed again he totally knew what was up and his girlfriend started laughing and it went for being like the most embarrassing thing i'd done all year to it kind of worked out after a while it was horrendous like i'm getting chills just discussing can't i was so embarrassed i'm so thankful he didn't say like what do you think all indian guys look alike uh but it was quite bad that's hilarious he um so the whole time when you were first talking to him he didn't like be like oh by the way like he waited to realize like this podcast he was listening to that you were him yeah he was like wait are you and then he it was just like the whole interaction was incredibly uncomfortable yeah it was it was a very weird interaction but uh like it went from being like i was i was like like i made this face like i made it a cringe face to him i'm like oh my god i can't believe this is gonna go on the internet like this is going to be known as like this guy thinks we all look alike and it it worked out okay dude i have like um i don't have real nightmares like scary stuff happening to me my nightmares are situations like this like uh i'll have like a nightmare where it's like i'm at a dinner and i'm just i'm like trying to like butter up like this person i'm trying to like you know be friends with this person and talk to them and make jokes with them and the whole time i'm calling the guy ross and like at the end somebody's like why are you calling him broths his name's rick and i'm like [ __ ] i've been calling on ross for one hour or like micro cringe moments or like when someone nice uh or someone who you want to impress like i remember i had this guy uh i was trying to work at their company and i was interviewing and he's like what's going on and you reply with good it's the worst you too yes oh right now you work here never mind i'm sorry that i said that it's one of those things uh all right let me let me ask you a question actual horrible crit can i tell you the actual horrible this is not even funny uh this is more like a confessional for me you're like you know forgive me father i have sin type of thing i was at a holiday party once and some some woman came up to to like our table she like knew the person i was talking to i didn't really know her but i think i had met her once before it was so vague in my head and i was like oh like when's the little one do or wins a little one coming and she had just had the baby and i was like oh my and i'm i was a 24 year old dude and in that moment i was like like it took me a second to even understand what i had done and how bad it was and i was just sitting there with a stupid look on my face and i didn't know what to say like too much time past even like like two beats had passed now i couldn't even apologize she had tried to like move on to like spare me the cringe and i knew she's feeling bad and i'm feeling equally bad and i literally this is 10 years ago and like i still feel it the same way i did in that moment because i've never recovered like it's been the same feeling for 10 years straight yeah that's embarrassing it makes me feel horrible yeah just don't say anything dude don't talk to anyone that's like the only motto is do a podcast with your friend and speak to nobody else that's the only way i uh i mean that mistake you made like that's i think that's a mistake that many people make one time and one time only then you just never asked about pregnancy you just never the most awkward thing is sometimes if they ask you if you want to touch their belly i don't ever do that who asks you nobody asked that dude i remember my belly well like you like well like you know there's like kids like when you're younger it's like hey do you want to feel the baby kick when you're like four i remember like someone asked me that right when i cross that threshold of what is like no i don't want to touch a grown woman's stomach and like i i distinctly remember that around like 14 years old or 12 years old i was like i think i'm i think i'm past that point this week we went to the point where like i don't want my parents to see me naked anymore like whenever that whenever that age is that [Laughter] you know what i mean when i was 15 and i stopped showering with my dog it's just like there's like a distinct it's like it's hard to say what it is but you know it's before and after yeah life is actually like people said what's the meaning of life in life the meaning of life is to just avoid those exact moments that we're talking about that's really the only purpose of life is to try to just avoid these horrendous seconds that can that will come up dude can we brag about being the number one podcast and that be like a thing all right uh yeah so this weekend we were number one in the business category we were number one in entrepreneurship we were number 40 i think in all of america uh what are we right now did it stay the same uh yeah i don't know i didn't check but just that screenshot was incredible i mean like you see tim ferriss's podcast like dude i remember like i've been listening to that i've been a fan of him for a long time and even though i know these charts are they're not like that doesn't mean we're bigger than their podcast it just means like the velocity like the just that we grew fast and so it moved us up higher that week or whatever um there's some like secret formula but even still that secret formula the fact that whatever the secret formula is if we can be in that conversation on any secret formula that's kind of a that's kind of a cool moment and uh i don't know if it's because we had some pretty dope episodes with darmesh and then peter levels and maybe some of the growth stuff that jonathan's doing i don't know exactly what i think it's all the above kind of amazing i think it's all the above i know that they're like spending money to grow and they're doing some promotions i don't exactly know what and then darmesh uh was popular and whenever darmesh comes on afterwards i always see him doing stuff like emailing it out to his email list and doing things like that so he's always promoting it and then peter promoted his episode a ton so i think that's why it happened but yeah we were like you know we like we're beating like legitimately famous people like uh like if you scroll through the top 50 podcasts in america you're like oh that person like if i saw them i'd ask for a picture and we're like ahead of a lot of these people that's the type of person who i'd be very embarrassed if i said good when they asked what's up my uh my favorite there's a tweet from this guy bengali underscore 87. this is the tweet he goes best business slash entrepreneurship podcast out there big money that is no small boy stuff i'm gonna sample that john vp i was like dude if that's not the new motto of the podcast no small boy stuff big money big money stuff no big money that is no small bus stop i had um it's just incredible when i was walking around new york this weekend i had a couple people throughout the day come up to me and say they're they're listeners and a few of them said uh i'm your dog you know because that guy uh we had an episode where they got what would he what did he say he's like hey i want to work for you i'm going to be your dog the dog dylan i'm dylan the dog i'm you're not a dog [Laughter] um all right let me ask you something that's good [ __ ] yeah uh you get paid to speak sometimes right uh sometimes i say no most of the time because yeah so most of the time but i've done it a couple times it's kind of crazy to like it's kind of crazy when you say the number you're like all right yeah okay i'll come talk but it's going to be 10 grand and they're like okay great and you're just like wow 10 grand just to talk like you know so i think that's unfortunate like you know i like not that i would do this for free but it just seems like something you shouldn't have like it seems like something that's so weird to pay for and i know i get it i get the logic it's like you have an event you kind of need like someone to give an appearance if that person matters to your community that's cool if you think they're going to add some value great but it is just wild like isn't there a part of you that just like still remembers being like totally broke and you're just like what the hell is happening you could just i can do this one zoom call for 12 grand that's insane well i've never done a zoom call like that but so hubspot they have their conference coming are you gonna speak at the conference we're supposed to speak are you gonna fly out or no tbd only if they pay me 50 grand yeah you'll have to take that up with them but obama is gonna talk obama's talking and then like a couple years ago they had oprah oprah talking and i did some research how much do you think if you're obama and oprah i would put them in similar categories maybe obama a little bit above in terms of influence but not like terribly above how much do you think and i didn't ask them i just researched it and i like try to find contracts how much do you think obama charges i would guess something between i would have guessed 250 to 350k that's my guess for like a speaking engagement but honestly it could be more it could be like double that dude so i think it's i heard rumors it's in like the one two one point two million range and that makes sense wow obama is not gonna get out of bed for less than a million and i hear oprah is around the 1 million no small boy stuff for obama too no definitely not and so here's why so i've heard like rumors and i talked to people that have had them before and that's kind of how it came with that number but let me give you some insider numbers so i only had one paid speaker ever at hustlecon so at halsacon collectively we probably had 200 or 300 speakers over a couple years a handful of years casey neistat was the only speaker that we had who we paid and i was supposed to you're not supposed to talk about how much you pay him but like this was like years ago so i can do it this was i think at the height of his popularity i only paid him 25 000 plus a private flight from la to san francis san francisco for six thousand dollars orders from san francisco to l.a i forget but one way it was only six grand plus twenty-five thousand dollars that's nothing right twenty-five percent of cheap compared to what cause he was at the peak of his powers at that time too right it's not like yeah yeah for sure not like some c-list you know person who used to be famous it's like no guys he's not that was a big deal then he's a big deal now too so i tried to get gary vaynerchuk to come speak at an event once and he offered uh his asking price was a hundred thousand dollars or i think he said that you would have to buy a hundred thousand dollars worth of books and that somehow like pushes them up the charts or something like that and uh so gary vaynerchuk was a hundred grand um and i got speak i i spoke somewhat recently and i asked i got paid 25 to 20 20 to 25 thousand dollars or maybe it was 20 grand plus flights and then i think that we had uh ashton kutcher spoke at an event that i was at and the uh the organizers like kind of like implied like they paid them around 150 grand our software is the worst have you heard of hubspot see most crms are a cobble together mess but hubspot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous i think i love our new crm our software is the best hubspot grow better this has always been the playbook like i met a guy once who was writing a book and i was like nice like you know what's your goals for the book and like he was kind of answering me but i got the sense like i feel like you know you ever hear a story and you're like i feel like you're leaving out the one important detail that makes all of this make sense like you're not saying the wrong thing but i feel like you're just not saying whatever the right thing is and sure enough like 20 minutes and he's like yeah basically you write books so that you can get paid speaking gigs like it doesn't matter who reads your book or how you just need to be a guy who writes a book and then you like do a thing you like pay a certain amount to get like up in the chart so you could say new york times best seller or like you know amazon best seller and and then that just increases your paid speaking rate by like 15k and then that's like you know how you make your money back for this whole like book process and i was like oh okay that makes way more sense like now i understand and i was like so this paid speaking gig like how does this work and he kind of broke it down for me kind of step by step and i remember being intrigued but also you know the cost of like you know basically like the idea of like oh yeah what you do is you fly around like you basically have to go you're never home you're flying around all the time so he was at that point trying to figure out all right the next step after this you know and i sort of started thinking about okay what is the move straight to the end version of this and i was like oh okay i think i know what i would do it's like i would do a this is how like i was thinking about the podcast at this time like i was thinking about creating one i was like i think i would do a podcast that i could just record right here whenever i want maybe in batches and as long as the conversation's fun i don't think i would care about making any money off that and i feel like if i could do that i could get like you know what if like a million people were fans of the podcast i feel like that would just jump me where all these guys are trying to go or they're like ultimately i think what a lot of people want is like they have a topic that they're really curious about that they like to research they like to do experiments in and they're just trying to figure out a way to get paid to be professionally curious about that thing i think that's like the generous version of like how to think about this there's like the skeptical version of which is just like oh dude you're just like some motivational speaker like sort of scammy guru guy who wants to go around and blah blah blah but i think the re the earnest people i think they just want to be professionally curious it's like how do i get to spend 90 of my time just like digging in on this topic i'm a nerd about and then like somehow translate the other 10 of my time into enough money to fund me to do that in a in a cool way um and so i think that that you know that's how i think about this stuff what i've been doing for speaking is i actually haven't asked to be paid lately but i do tell them i need two first class flights um and i want you to pay entirely for the hotel for a week and i will only say yes if it's so my wife and i basically so we can go to a cool place so i'll only say yes but let me tell you something interesting so robert de niro he uh so the wall street journal did this thing where meech our friend ramitz shared it so listen to robert so here's what robert denial got paid so he did a movie called savage salvation in september 2020 he got paid 11 million dollars so he was going to be there for eight days he asked for a round-trip private air transportation on a gulf stream five is that or six i don't know how roman numerals work but a gulf stream jet he uh got to keep all of the costumes wigs and prosthetics all the stuff that he wore on this on the plane or all the stuff he wore in the movie he got to keep all of it he wanted an additional fee for his uh personal trainer he had to come and be flown there and he had to be put up at the ritz carlton in addition to the the 10 days that he had or the eight days he had to be there for production he wanted a seven day va all expenses paid vacation to the ritz carlton followed by a vacation in puerto rico where you also had to pay for his jet and i had to take his whole family uh to and from uh and then finally he wanted one round-trip jet fra one round-trip private flight jet between new york and ella day in la for a five-day stay anytime within 12 months those are all of his ass in his contract for all for eight days of work that's not bad this is cool it's like a hostage negotiation it's like i need a briefcase with the cash and i need a jet that's fueled with the engine on and i'm gonna get on it dude check out this website i just sent you wsb.com so i had once heard that like um you know like coach k who who's the co the basketball coach at duke um i remember back in the day he kind of had like a salary of like uh i want to call it like not back in the day but like he's the number one college basketball coach most winningest coach of all time whatever you're curious how much does he make shishevsky is his last name it's like spelled with a k and then a bunch of yeah yeah yeah okay so um so he's now like 75. he's like at the top of his game he just retired so he was making 12 and a half million a year to coach college basketball at the time um and i think that like but i remember when i was in school because i went to duke i remember reading at that time his salary was like maybe half that it was closer to like four or five million and he had gotten offered a contract with the lakers that was going to pay him over 10 million and he turned it down and i remember just thinking wow this guy like 10 million a year i was like the guy turned down like basically an extra 50 million dollars to go do this deal like that's pretty impressive like why um you know why did he do that and i started looking into like how he makes his money and basically he makes more money i believe uh or at the time he was making more money through his endorsements speaking fees books tours things like that than he was his like actual day job and so if you go to the site wsb.com he's listed on there and it says you can see a bunch of speakers and you can see how much they charge so bob iger the chairman to disney it's like says like you know you got a contact for fees for coach k his says like 70 000 plus is his speaking fee and so you want to go get this guy it's 70 000 plus and so there's these businesses that are basically these booking agencies for well-known speakers and i feel like this is like a really interesting little niche business to be these like middleman agencies that just aggregate demand for this like you know roster of speakers that they can book out so you know how basically like maybe eight years ago we kind of laughed at youtubers and it's like there's they're not real celebrities they're just internet celebrities or they're not they can't they're not gonna be real business people but now you know like there's a world where some of them are going to be billionaires and uh then yeah it had a vibe that was like oh you make videos that's cute yeah it says yes like a a condescending type of vibe and now that there's uh we had the guy i forget his name but he was on the pod and he uh he's the uh founder of the management company that manages mr beast what was his name you know i'm talking about read read yes read and night media and like there it's like this is like potentially gonna be a pretty large business do you think that these type of speaker bureaus and these some of these agencies what are the twitter boys gonna get them love huh you think like is like uh is there gonna be like a like you know we didn't boys is there going to be a is there going to be a twitter agency for sahil bloom and and sean perry anytime soon well there should be right you said you're getting paid to speak silent gets paid to speak i get paid to speak so obviously there is demand we already are doing the behavior we just haven't gotten rolled up like these guys you know we're we don't have enough you know sort of gray hair on our chest to go get on to one of these like rolodexes of like you know whatever washington speaker bureau um but why not right like i i do think so and i think cameo kind of shows the demand for this sort of thing because people are willing to pay you know 100 bucks a pop for these like 15 to 30 second videos from like uh you know tier two two or three two or four celebrity uh you know just saying happy birthday or whatever uh and i think cami was trying to go upstream where they're like yeah you could do meet and greets you could do corporate appearances you're trying i think cameos trying to move into that space but yeah i think definitely somebody could create a little bit of a um you know one of these like speaker speaker businesses that like basically books out podcasters youtubers twitter boys like you know tick-tock stars to go and talk at you know corporate events and and marketing events stuff like that guess how much revenue this company washington speaker bureaus does oh god okay my guess 30 million a year so they were acquired in the year 2000. the year they required they're doing 15 million they're bought by uh this company that i forget it's one of the ad agencies that sounds like the covid name is it omnicrom i forget what it was like one of the like there's one there's like there's basically like five ad agencies that owns like everything i forget which one it is and uh when they require they are doing 15 million but that was in 1999 in 2000 and seventeen they did 150 million in revenue [ __ ] crazy right yes by the way wild right you want to know a homie move homie move whenever somebody asks you to guess something always guess low no bigger [ __ ] on you feeling than you guess they're trying to impress you with some fun fact about how cool this thing is and you guessed too high and they're like well no i mean it's not it's not that good and then it sort of just takes all the wind out of it so the the homie move is always whatever you think it is cut it in half so that they can have the win of being like no it's even more you're like what that's crazy right like that's how you do it that's good what do you want to do now oh there are more i'm just scrolling this thing dude terry bradshaw 40k we can go get terry bradshaw this guy's got four super bowl rings good old terry you can get him for 40k too i don't care about him that much but uh i i yeah we should get some more people i heard a rumor another rumor that we could have gotten arnold schwarzenegger on our podcast for 100k um i don't know if that was like a one-off thing but there was like some consideration i'd heard about it and i i i mean arnold's pretty cool i don't think i would spend a hundred thousand i don't think he could give us a hund i don't think he would give the podcast a hundred a hundred thousand dollars worth of promotion right people have asked me this before what do you think is the what would be your dream guest if we just had one if there's just a hundred thousand dollar budget that was gonna go to somebody guarantee that they come on the pod who would be your your person that you would put on there i mean it's got to be like someone really famous so definitely like an elon or uh like an obama or a trump like a president uh like who would be the most famous person that you could ask them questions is that because you're thinking what drives the most like clicks or is it more like that's the person i would want to have a pot yeah no i don't think i don't know if i would enjoy a conversation with elon like i think that would be an uncomfortable situation i think i don't think that would be particularly enjoyable do you i i 100 agree with you i think it would be honestly sort of uncomfortable in a giant like it's almost an automatic letdown it's like you're going to have such high hopes and expectations i want it to go so well it's gonna be kind of a difficult conversation it's gonna like fly by really quickly there's gonna be 15 minutes we're like [ __ ] we've been talking about this for 15 minutes like oh no i need to like switch course here um he's not gonna know the vibe he's not gonna like he's not gonna come like ready to do what we do well which is like you know shoot the [ __ ] and kind of brainstorm and tell stories so i'm not sure that that would be i would i would go for somebody if i was gonna pull one one like that i would just be like who is the best person that would actually love the type of conversation that we have and be great at it i think that's a little bit hard i think that you know i think you'd have to take this archetype of like who is the kind of like an idea machine but also has like name and reputation has done stuff and um i think peter should even give a [ __ ] i think peter thiel might be interesting but he's not that famous so i don't know how much traffic he would drive oh i think he i think he drives a good amount especially like in our niche i think i think people because he doesn't do a lot of content right like you can go get like on the site you can go get damon john from shark tank and it's like but for 40k but he's everywhere dude like first of all come on i mean fubu was cool but like yeah i mean it's what we want and secondly like you know um i i don't think he and he does appearances everywhere so you need somebody who people are sort of starved for content from maybe it's like a naval or peter thiel somebody somebody who intentionally limits their number of experiences so that you know you're high search demand and not a lot of like hits coming up yeah i don't know i i wouldn't want it to be him i would want i don't i don't care about that guy i can't think of any other examples though uh i don't [ __ ] know i would be uncomfortable with anyone anyone who's like intimidatingly good i'd be uncomfortable being around like if i made a joke to elon he wouldn't laugh i don't think he would laugh i think obama would definitely laugh at everything even if he would it's one of those type of guys where you would say something and he would giggle and it's like wait what did i say he's like i don't know i just i the the tone of your voice i thought i was supposed to laugh so i did um right i'm so trained on socializing that i don't actually need to be here for this i could just autopilot mimic all of the things i need to do socially for this to be a positive experience for you right uh i don't know who i'd want for a hundred grand okay all right so we have someone here but before we get to that person tell me uh about sarah moore can i do this yeah can i do the ceremony update okay this is kind of incredible in fact this should probably move to the beginning of the episode it's probably the most interesting bit so a while back maybe a month ago i came on here and i was like um dude there's this business have you heard of this business called eggcartons.com and you're like no what is that well that's exactly what it sounds like you go to eggcartons.com and it's a place where you can buy the packaging the carton for eggs um and like but also packaging for a bunch of different varieties of eggs like huge shipments small ones eco-friendly not eco-friendly but also just like in general like other packaging materials as well so i was like yeah fascinating business right like you go there it's an old school looking website you know it's like dial 1 800 eggs dot com whatever like to call us to place an order and i was like this is fascinating so i dug in i was like who's behind this and i basically found that it used to be owned by this guy he ran it for 24 years i was like okay this sounds about right you know his linkedin picture was him like with a you know like a phone with a cord in it and he's like got it up to his neck and he's like sitting at a messy desk and i was like ah this looks like the guy who started edcard.com 25 years ago but now as i noticed oh it says like he ended his ownership one year ago so who who's behind this and i saw that there was this woman named sarah moore who was like not what you would expect to be like it's like oh this person should be like the ceo of lululemon or something like that why is she getting into egg cartons of alcohol beautiful harvard graduate yeah like you're he looks like a celebrity a little bit um and so i tried to reach out to her i couldn't get a hold of her and but i couldn't resist so i came on the pod and i told the story it's like yeah so basically it looks like she purchased this business uh she did like one tiny interview about it and but i had done one thing that i didn't tell you about i don't think that day which is i've been experimenting with a format that i wish people use more on me like when people reach out to me they're like oh i'd love to talk to you sometime like if you have a question just send me the question in fact if you have a bunch of questions like just send me a google doc i'm going to look at it and if i want to answer i'll answer if i don't i don't and so that's what i did to her i go i sent her an email i said egg cartons like with five exclamation points i go that's hilarious like what a hilarious niche okay we got this podcast i'd love to feature you on it um i have five questions for you on this google doc if you answer them with bullet points i'll tell your story on the podcast we get 20 million dollars a year it'll be great for your business i go this is me on twitter by the way whatever i sent it no reply for 20 days um then she go she emails me out of the blue she goes i couldn't have paid someone to make me sound as cool as you and sam did on the podcast last week thank you so much i filled out your google doc i think they'll answer your questions i would have responded earlier if i didn't think this was spam um blah blah send me send me your address i'll send you some world-class egg cards right so i want to read you what she what what what what she replied but did you want any are you gonna are you gonna accept those cartons very nice really very nice very nice of you sarah but thank you but no thank you thank you no dude everything in the house could turn into like a toy storage container i have toys forever all shapes and sizes all right so all right what did you say so i basically said here's my question i go you go you bought eggcards.com did you buy it alone as part of a pe firm she goes alone-ish i started a pe firm alone to buy a business but it wasn't your typical pe firm my office my quote-unquote office was just a library at school there was no fund like no money i had a lot of help i had over 50 unpaid interns come from craigslist and i had them sift through over 400 000 private companies for a year and a half before i found eggcartons.com what yeah i know then i go i so that was my first question the second question i go how the heck did you buy it uh oh no why the heck did you buy it what about the business made you want to buy it was it the name the customer retention what drove you to it she goes my goal was to buy a business with all debt so i could have 100 ownership i had no collateral though except for my 2012 rav4 so i was trying to find something that was already stable enough that i could pitch a bank that the business itself was the collateral instead of my rav4 um that so i needed historical cash flows this business fit because it had been profitable since it started in 2001 had a high barrier to entry given the domain name and 100 plus other similar domain names that they own like egg cartons like misspelled eggcarton.com then she says the founder has usually purchased all these domains over the years to protect their like their demote it was simple enough it was also a simple enough business that somebody with zero operational experience me and average intelligence me could operate if they tried hard enough i was like wow this is incredible then i said i said i live in silicon valley people here are obsessed with crypto ai blah blah blah they would underestimate edcards.com can you give us a sense of the scale of the business that's a really good way to frame that that's a that's a beautiful way to frame that question because you nagged her a little bit like you said something a little rude you're like yeah you know it's probably not that big but maybe it is you know like impress me right i would think this is small but you know i'd love to be surprised would you say that this is more than this and less than this and so she anyway she came back with i'm in the middle of something that prevents me from sharing the numbers publicly uh all i can say is that our revenue is less than 50 million and i was like oh okay okay but that you not less than 20 if it was less than 20 i feel like you would have said less than 20. i feel like that that would be the case um i said how did you negotiate the deal she's like ah there's a bunch of contacts here she goes in summary i harassed the owner until he replied then we hit it off we came up with the valuation together then i contacted over 100 banks most of which told me to f off one of them threw me a bone and agreed to an under uncollateralized loan the final deal was 75 bank debt and 25 the seller's note so she bought this with no money down like the bank financing and the seller financed it she said before buying the business i had i i overpaid an accountant to check my work and do an audit of the business because frankly i had no idea what i was doing his fees got rolled into the deal itself so uh she used an accountant to cover her ass but also paid him out of the deal itself this is amazing any other fun tidbits or anecdotes i i could share she here's what she says this is where it gets great she goes while searching for the business i participated in several research studies just to make money uh like to while i was doing my search i went from i went legally blind from a deodorant study for a bit so i had to take a break from working from work until i could read again she goes my response rate was awful i started doing borderline insane things to get a reply at one point i took a photo of myself wearing a sweatshirt that said i want to buy your business with a massive grin and i faxed it out to thousands of businesses a day to this day i run into owners who recognize me from those faxes one of those owners is actually my neighbor then she says the library we worked out of required a school id to enter most of my interns didn't go to the school so we had to get fake ids for all the interns to get into the library every time we hired someone there was a lag because we would need to get more ids during co before covert i used to fly to china i needed to examine the egg cartons on my first trip to india i got held by indian customs and interrogation for hours because they didn't believe that i was coming to india alone they did not believe that i was coming to investigate egg cartons uh related to india i almost got killed there i rejected a shipment from an indian vendor the his whole family lived there he was furious started chasing after me the hotel put me into incredible mode for my safety my driver luckily was at the door that i ran out of otherwise i'd probably still be there buried underground um she goes when i bought the business i considered it an egg company but now i think of it as specialty packaging 40 of our business comes from things entirely unrelated to eggs you'd be very surprised by our customer base you know think big brands like boeing spacex disney madison square garden crayola et cetera anything that requires protection and separation is fair game um anyways there's one one more i should say but dude what's the other one is sarah moore not my hero is she my hero is she not my hero this woman's wonderful why is she why didn't she talk about this publicly more often this is like it i feel like there was tons and tons of stories there dude you know people who there's some people who are so in the game that they're like they're like oh yeah what am i going to stop and chat about the game like i'm in the [ __ ] game right like that's the feeling i get from her i've met some people that i like this that they sort of like it's a combination of they kind of don't realize how story-worthy their story is until like quite a bit later and the second thing they're sort of like you know either they just prefer privacy or they're like yeah i don't really know why i need to do that so why would i do that it's going to be kind of braggy and kind of weird and what's the benefit and maybe i'd just rather be personal so i think that like i know a handful of people that i'm like dude i wish i could tell their story on the podcast because they're epic but they just don't see value in this and they're also not consumers of it that's the other thing i've noticed most of those people don't listen to a bunch of podcasts or take inspiration from it so it's kind of a foreign idea to them they're like they're like people will care it's like yeah of course people will care about this this is awesome um so anyways i was totally inspired by this story and she is uh kind of amazing she is one of us she no small boy stuff for sarah moore so i think she's only when you if you google her you basically can't find anything i mean there's next to nothing on her there's like one or two pictures there's very little i found one article where it says that she's 28 and she uh it says she answered a question what inspired you to start buying companies she says freedom what is your mantra don't take counsel from your fears like that's pretty much all she and like she answered nothing this woman's amazing why can't we find anything about her there's a lot there's a lot going on with her we need to uh we convince her to come on there's a 30 chance she's a fat guy named craig so like you know we could be getting catfished here i wouldn't put it past her uh but i'm gonna go with the with what i see i think i think she's amazing [Music] you

[Music] okay hi it's uh producer ben this is one question friday this is where we take one question from a listener and we answer it on air today i'm answering it because sam and sean took a long weekend they left a little early on friday and a few of you asked questions to me because i was on the show a little more than usual this week so i figured i would answer one of those questions so let's play it and before we go into the question as always if you want to leave a question for sam and sean to answer usually sam and john go to mfmpod.com and click on the microphone in the lower right hand corner and you can leave a question and if we select your question your voice will be on air be on my first million uh okay let's get to the question hi this is jeremy my question is for producer ben what did you do to get your podcast found by famous people like sam and mr beast and do you have any advice for how to develop a good idea for a podcast okay so to answer the first question what did i do to get my podcast found by sam mr beast so the first answer that i have to give honestly is nothing i'm extremely lucky that's how i feel and uh but i yeah i don't know like the first time i heard sam mention how to take over the world on my first million uh you may have heard me use analogy before but i felt like i was watching tv and then all of a sudden the newscaster like looks out of the screen and is like you i'm talking to you it was very bizarre very weird um i had no expectations no knowledge that he was gonna mention it and it just totally caught me by surprise because i was already a fan of my first million um so i don't have like a deliberate strategy or anything like that for getting famous people to find and like my podcast i feel like all the strategy is essentially just the content um which leads into the second question do i have any advice for how to develop good ideas for podcasts and yes i do because i get pitched a lot of podcast ideas a lot of people come to me and most of them are good but bad uh what do i mean by that good but bad the worst thing that your idea can be as a podcast is fine and that's my reaction to most people's ideas for podcasts i go yeah that sounds fine and there's a problem with fine and this is the problem i uh so before i worked in media before i did podcasting i did management consulting and i was on this one project where we worked for a security sales company they guys go to door to door and sell security systems and they had a problem which was they had all these fraudulent sales and all these fraudulent sales as we looked into it would happen at the same time of the year it happened at the end of the summer and so as we dug into it what we found out was that the salesman for the security system were incentivized such a way where they had these really steep steps where it was like if you sell nine security systems you will make five thousand dollars but on your tenth security system it jumps up to twenty thousand dollars which is totally crazy right so what you would get is you have all these summer salesmen who are just selling for the summer and they have to hit these certain steps they have to hit a certain number of sales and if they do they're gonna get this huge lump sum so towards the end of the summer they're really trying to hit uh these numbers and they get panicked and they start just selling accounts like crazy even if that means fudging the numbers a little bit selling systems fraudulently stuff like that so it's a big problem so we go tell them hey this is a big problem uh you should do a more gradual incentive structure and the executives at the security system company told us you know we've actually tried that and it didn't work sales went way way down when we did that not just the fraudulent bad sales at the end of the summer yes we got rid of those but overall sales went way way down this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform where everything is fully integrated well i can see the clients hold history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago i totally missed hubspot grow better and uh so we thought that was interesting so why do you think that is and what they said was panic is an exponentially greater motivator than mere desire so you might want something and you'll work a little harder to get something that you want but if you're panicked then you'll work ten times harder okay exponentially greater and um and i think that's true and i think that's true of podcasting of content as well too many people think oh well i'll just produce something that's okay that's good that's fine that's inoffensive i'm gonna try and capture as big of an audience as i possibly can what you really need to be optimizing for instead is not panic obviously but obsession it's better to have a smaller audience with a very few people who are totally obsessed with your podcast and so every decision i made with my podcast which a history podcast called how to take over the world was with that in mind so for example when i first started telling my friends and family i'm making this history podcast called how to take over the world uh everyone told me the same thing which is that name is like too aggressive you need to chill a little bit uh can you call it something like a little milder how about you know life lessons from history and um i just thought no i think i really really want to make a podcast called how to take over the world and i think i would be obsessed with a podcast called how to take over the world i was just like how cool is that everyone wants to know how to take over the world or not everyone but i do i don't know how to take over the world but sounds incredibly interesting similarly if you go listen to the podcast it's intro music is uh is now iconic a lot of people love it but a lot of people when they first heard it said oh that beat is like really aggressive if you listen to it it's a very aggressive intro song and so a lot of people tried to talk me out of it they said it's good but can you back off a little bit can you make it like just a little less bro and a little less out there and if i had done that it would be more agreeable to more people but there would not be as many people who are obsessed people are obsessed with that intro song people love it and so to me that is the key to good content these really really strong emotions so um you need to get people obsessed uh you need people to feel um panicked right if it's if it's a podcast about like a a social issue you need people to feel terrified feel horrified uh mortified that this thing is happening that you're trying to to illuminate and too many people go well this is a good idea right like this is interesting and that doesn't cut it and so i think the fact that i made a podcast that honestly does not appeal to some people and i i think a lot of people don't realize that but like some people are very turned off by a podcast called how to take over the world this aggressive intro music and but that's okay because it's more than made up for by the fact that a few people are obsessed with it and they will then tell other people about it they evangelize the podcast and that is ultimately how people like sam mr beast heard about it was through the grapevine and so yeah uh thanks for the question jeremy that's my advice make stuff that people are obsessed with okay uh next week one question friday we'll be back to sam and sean thank you for tuning in [Music] you

i think you could reinvent toastmasters um like i feel like this is a business i could start if i wanted to which is like toastmasters i think can be modernized like you don't have to have the oversized suit you don't need the like in-person meetups like i wrote discord toastmasters like i think you could do this whole thing and zoom or discord like i think you just have people get into little chapters practice this stuff make you know they kind of meet people they kind of learn some techniques and they kind of get over their stage fight around public speaking and the local ones ladder up into like the state ones they ladder up into like the national ones and some people compete at it um and you get your certificate after going through the program and it's like kind of a course it's kind of a church and it's kind of like a self-help seminar um that i think could be recreated in a modern way using discord that's my idea react to that [Music] all right what up it's my first million to podcast that will change your goddamn life if you like your life unsubscribe right now because it ain't staying the same by the end of this listen to that again that's a good tagline all right um by the way i think of all these amazing intros when we're not here uh on the pod and then i totally forget to do them like last night i was like i was doing this little train sound to my daughter and i'm i was like dude i'm freakishly good at making this train sound i am like the best at doing this fake trade i was like i gotta show sam i'm just gonna start the podcast feel like sam you wanna hear a train sound and then i'm gonna do it ready [Laughter] [Laughter] this is the stupidest [ __ ] ever listen to this a great cold open uh all right dude talk to me about this dude who emailed us this guy who's this guy all right so so jonathan was like hey you guys got to announce the winners for the clip contest and i don't know who they are but he's going to help us do it is it jonathan is it this guy dylan or can i tell a separate story about this guy i i don't know who dylan is okay all right so this guy is a winner in my heart he may not have won the contest but i'm going to find a way to like employ this person because he's amazing so this guy reaches out um i'm just gonna read you the cold email because it was too good he goes sounds like a random letter yeah i felt a little unsafe it goes i've clipped every mfm youtube pod that has been released just all business straight to the end there he goes hey sam and sean then again in all bold i've clipped every mfm podcast episode you've ever released i'm 22 unemployed i'm moving to israel next month and i have nothing to lose just kidding he didn't have that nothing to lose part but that [ __ ] would have been a little dangerous um he says i have nothing but 7k in savings to avoid getting a job in israel i figured i'd clip a clip all of your podcasts and either a you'll you'll buy my clips channel or b you'll hire me to do this for you full time you keep saying that you want to grow your youtube channel but you're not you're simply not putting on enough content let me explain youtube shorts short viewers are addicted to crack cocaine youtube wants to give viewers as much crack cocaine as possible to keep them addicted to youtube your content is the crack cocaine and crack cocaine addicts don't care about quality they care about quantity the amount of crack and he goes uh here's what you can do you're gonna use youtube shorts to drive people to your main channel your main content is quality your shorts are gonna be quality hire a dog parentheses me which is just just an incredible way to start a sentence hire a dog parenthesis me to pump out 100 shorts a day get an average of 600 000 new monthly viewers that will come from the youtube discovery feed what's and then he goes this is the ransom letter party guys what's 600 000 new monthly viewers worth to you question mark your dog dylan that's right dylan you are my dog man this is amazing this is an amazing email spoke straight to my heart i emailed him i did you i replied separately did you no i just forwarded it to everybody i afford it to my whole team i was like this guy's a dog and then we and then he put a clip in there he goes here's an unlisted video from the account to prove it to me and then you watch it and he's talking and he sounds normal and he's cool and he's interesting and i was like i freaking love this guy i know i emailed him i was like hey um i i'm going to send your stuff to hubspot and they could decide what they want to do with this but like can i hire you to do stuff because you told me you hired this content person i was like i probably need i've kind of been sucking on my personal [ __ ] maybe i should hire this guy and i emailed him so i'm definitely going to talk to him uh he this was a really good email i ignored just about every single email but this one i replied and i was like so dylan i haven't replied yet but you're gonna get something from both of us or one of us i don't know um jonathan you had some more logistical things to say about who actually won the contest who who won the contest so we do not win by the way wait and well let's say so we do a contest where we give 5 000 so basically we have like these full episodes on youtube people go there they clap clip them up and they post them on tik tok and instagram whatever they use our hashtag and we just are going to select people and we give them five grand but go ahead jonathan yeah so you select we select one person who has the most views period and then the other one is just the person of our choosing so dylan you are the lucky winner it sounds like uh but the actual winner was just some dude who created a tick tock with neil patel and it said like this billionaire spends 100k which is not even true because he's not a billionaire uh so that is the other winner that person's channel is called how many views did that get that yeah my first my first milk clip how do these like there's so many kids that are doing this they put on tick tock how do they get so many views well this guy guy's a genius because he took he took the right clip right so he took a clip of some guy saying how much he spends which is gonna go viral because people get mad about it um people get mad when they hear somebody spending so much money and talking about it so casually because he also says in the clip you know i'm not rich but blah blah blah and then people are like yeah you're not rich bro you spend 180k a month and they like go off and so that little thing is like a trigger and it's like oh watch this i'll trigger everybody right now with this one little clip so i think that's what worked also in the comments he was smart because somebody would comment be like who is this guy or the and he he replied founder of google question mark like the the guy so he's intensely replying the wrong thing and everyone's like dude that's not the founder of google so all of a sudden the algorithm's like yes comments comments and so he would just reply like um like nonsense [ __ ] to people's comments and then people would be like you're wrong dude you're so wrong he's like yes but i'm about to win this five grand off this two million view clip so you know congrats but also guys i feel like we should right now they're all making their own handles like mfm clip you know million clip boys and like they all have their own little handle like shouldn't we get these people it's only like i don't know 10 people who are really good at this like could we get them behind like our actual clips channel and be like whoever within this channel gets the most views gets the bounty for the month how do you do that you just you're going to give the password and login to 10 different people and just say like fight yeah it's like you just like we're it's like we're just going to throw like one yeah a [ __ ] fighting uh event i'm down can we is that able to be pulled off like can you how do you know whose is whose but they put them in a slack and give them all the login and then when they post it's like they have to say i posted x and then you're like all right cool jump up put it in the spreadsheet which one you posted and then we'll keep track can we do that that actually that's great let's just do that it'll also make it easier for all of them because then that account will have more content so then all of them will benefit from the additional juice the followers that builds up will all be aggregated and we will own the channel in the end which is helpful to us and so i feel like that's a better way to go sounds like dylan's the dog so we just put dylan to work and he should be able to dylan you know like in any good uh you know like cockfight uh you know two chickens or roosters or whatever fighting each other it's like there's the one who's got like one eye he's been through like a hundred fights and he's still here so that's dylan the dog and every new challenger kind of comes in and he kind of wrangles them and you know keeps them all together that's how i'm viewing this i'm i'm about it anyone that calls himself a dog i think is pretty cool uh so i'm a simple man with simple taste yeah like well i only know like dog the bounty hunter but he's cool to me so this guy dillon the dog is the we're two for two for cool dogs [Laughter] your name's got an alliteration sweet i mean let's see no more where do we go from here all right um well let's talk about this content remixer thing so i posted this on twitter i think this is kind of what you were talking about i was like hey man i produce a bunch of content but like i'm kind of lazy with the follow up so you know i'll produce the content of this podcast but as soon as we like literally the podcast ends with usually you say all right we're done that's the episode and then literally it's usually like one second later i'm like i realize how hungry i am i'm like i'm gonna go eat bye and then we like don't talk again until the next you know dude i don't even know i just i had to like you and i recorded today's wednesday recorded on monday i like messaged ben on tuesday i'm like why aren't the episodes out and he goes like uh because we release it like next week i'm like we do since when it's like always last february yeah like i don't know how this podcast goes on the internet so yeah we were even when i almost never or like the other day i like clicked it in the in the app and i was like oh man like this description is horribly out of date and this title and this intro and i like sent ben all these notes and he's probably like dude we've been doing it this way for like if you had a problem with this why did you say anything for the last nine months and it's like i don't know i never listen i never click it like i'm here for the live show i don't i don't go to it after the fact uh it takes up a lot of space on my phone in fact i delete all the episodes so you know i'm not really the the right listener but anyways long story short i put out this tweet i said hey i want to hire a content remixer basically i put out content on a podcast or our newsletter from milkroad but that's content that could live that could be turned into tweets turned into linkedin posts and like it seems like that's what smart people do they like cross-post their [ __ ] at other places like we're we're doing contests so that somebody else will take our clips and put it on tiktok um so this is this idea of content remixing and i got a bunch of people interested which was great i hired one guy this guy brandon and he started with me this week and he's already putting out like already this week i'm gonna put out more content than i did like the last six months because he's like all he's doing is taking the best stuff we've already done and just like packaging it into smaller nuggets that can go on all these different places so like for example i'm adding a newsletter send once a week that's just gonna take the three best ideas or topics we talked about on the pod i'm just gonna compile them into that because i know those people like people who are on my newsletter they would like this content summarized and maybe even fleshed out right because the podcast is very off the cuff so sometimes you could kind of trim the fat and do a little extra research add a little data um and make it even better and so just take the three best things we talked about so he's doing that for milk road he's putting we put it on linkedin we put on twitter it's like okay cool so there's this idea of content remixing and as i was doing it i saw a bunch of other people were like hey if you find anyone good i would happily pay for this i'm you know i'm i'm already like you know up to my ears and like how much content i'm willing to create and like i would love it if somebody just took my stuff and repurposed it for other platforms who's an example of someone who reaches out so um oh god who's their names so i'll show you uh actually the guy who used to work for you alex garcia i think is this yeah yeah yeah um so he had tweeted out something very similar he's like you gotta recycle your content um and a bunch of people had replied into that as well uh so that's that's where i had seen oh wow there's like i'm not just getting emails about it but like people publicly were also like i would uh i would pay for this if you had this uh here we go so uh this guy i don't know how you say his name kai kai hai i don't know he's got this famous blog radreads.com yeah yeah yeah can you say this guy's name i don't know it's one of those words that i have only read on paper and i'm too embarrassed to say it out loud so he's probably got like you know i don't know tens of thousands of 100 000 subscribers he goes he goes man how would i find train and manage this person like let me know if you find it another guy kp says dude this is so true i need one for my newsletter another person comes in and they're like um who was like somebody who's in the like kind of buying businesses space and they were like yeah i would kill for one of these and so i started thinking like actually i've been noticing there's these like niche agencies that people create that are like this like productized service so it's a service that they turn into like hey you need an exec assistant like just come to us we have vetted trained exec assistants that we will assign to you and we'll kind of manage that relationship and make sure that you you learn how to use them and they provide great service to you and you're not like you don't have to find them you don't have to train them you don't have to worry about quality control and so like i think athena is one of those that's like big and they're like tech circles uh our buddy jack i think uses one of theirs we talked about the and we have like right away our friend uh marshall does shepherd is it called separate shepherd support yeah and they like scale pretty quickly um it's just a service-based business it's very straightforward my buddy jesse puji he did one called growth assistant it's pretty dope basically it's like hey there's people like in the philippines that are really good at like managing your facebook ads reporting data in excel like every day um you know like going and updating your seo tags and [ __ ] like that like all these like little things that help your business grow so he took the idea of like a va or a an executive assistant he just rebranded it as a growth assistant and specifically they know how to do tasks that are related to growth um like oh i'll go get a transcript made and then i'll format it i'll post it on your blog or i'll i'll do i'll look up your analytics and post it to you in slack every morning you and i have a friend and they make a million dollars a year 80 000 a month ghost writing tweets for other for like popular people not popular people but like business people uh writing other people's tweets and using his uh handle to click like on the tweets that they write so it's traction and amazing he was this person was telling me about this and i was like hey that's awesome and b like if you wanted to and actually scale this into something that could potentially make like four five six million dollars a year i think you could do i mean just it's just a boring agency it's not like that cool but i think you could just do like a twitter ghostwriting service i don't actually know how you would do it because um this person who i mentioned they do have some help overseas and i don't actually know how would you do it how do you teach how do you teach someone in the philippines to do this i think you could teach it but the hard part is like if you're gross writing for somebody else like again you need the source content from somewhere right like the thought has to be somewhere so anybody could write the tweet once you have the thought like for example you did this with that what's his name the hockey player you helped like go super viral like five times uh chris so chris pronger he had but dude that was like the easiest thing because i'm like well you're like you've made over a hundred million dollars in the nhl like this is the easiest thing ever it's like you still like that this is an interesting story yeah well it's like a hot chick asking like for dating advice it's like oh i mean it's like like this is the easiest game on earth right you know you got instagram tips for me yeah like move the camera down three inches yeah it's just like the easiest you know what i mean like they he he had the goods you know like yeah it was easy that's an easy game i don't know how you would do that though for someone who's just a computer nerd well i think people do it for companies right i think that's where he that's where that that friend is doing it they basically take companies i think that they invest in and then they upsell them this service for their company content i think that's for them for the uh like the ceos yeah yeah exactly and so they they kind of whatever i don't know but i'm interested in these like productized service agencies i think they can do well i bet you i i'm i don't want to do this so like you know feel free to steal my idea of like content remixers um there's all this already exists for like you know we cut clips of your youtube videos i'm not saying this doesn't exist i'm just saying dude a lot of pretty sure this would be successful a lot of people are doing this right now for clips so you and i know a couple people like that guy michael who uh you met with the other day and then uh what was the guys names who we hired like two years ago to do dylan and henry yeah yes uh and that's like fine i think tax is way easier like way easier like because the market is better because podcasters are not a good market to sell to they don't have this type of stuff they're not making any money off this right um so you need to go for somebody who already has money and just has a shortage of time um and for them words that bring them attention becomes uh you know becomes more money right how much that's the trick how much did you pay this guy uh you probably don't want to say i don't want to say i already said his name but you know whatever it's a reasonable amount so uh but but i would say if you want to see kind of how these work that guy jesse uh jesse puji on twitter he tweets out the numbers behind his agency every like month or two and so like they're now up to 500 i think 500 000 a month in monthly recurring revenue um 400 or 500 000. there's a woman named adrian who actually runs the company so he had the idea he had a friend or somebody he'd worked with in the past named adrian she start actually like is the ceo of that company and it's called assistant and growth assistant basically just means like they fill out they just they fill out like spreadsheets it's kind of like all the little junior growth hacky assistant stuff so like i'll tell you how we use it for ecom right uh or like we don't use them but like here's what i would do i i kind of like this is this is for somebody who's not as experienced maybe because like i already had people like this set up so i didn't need to pay the additional like fee that you you know you have to pay this management company right but uh basically i'm like hey every day you go put you go take all the uh these five kpis from our facebook ads google ads and shopify you put them in this spreadsheet you color code it then you take a screenshot you put that in slack because i want to wake up in the morning and i want to see our numbers color coded and i want to be able to comment on it and take action i don't want to spend the hour right like digging through and updating this dashboard and then secondly it's like oh okay cool every week i want you to go take the top sellers i want you to reorganize the store based on these rules and it's like i'm sure there's some software app that can kind of do this but like for for every business there's all these little nuanced you know like sort of like duct tape together things that you do that just make it work a little better but anything that's repetitive and anything you don't enjoy you want to delegate and so you delegate that to a growth assistant you teach them how to do this like we do it with influencer outreach too like go on go to this tool find influencers who who match this criteria reach out with this pitch here's the follow-up sequence i help craft with you and then like every time they they post something put it in this google drive photo so that my ads team can use it right like it's like super it's like a pipeline you know of of organization can you tell me about this ddc soda stream competitor thing yeah i think it's a great idea so i got a soda stream you probably already have one or have seen dude so listen listen listen what i have i have a soda stream okay and then as a gift i was gifted this thing so a soda stream is basically uh a canis it's this thing whatever but you buy like the you have to buy like a 30 canister at the rate i was going like every uh two or three weeks because i use it at a time that's like all i drink it's like 30 bucks so what i did was i went to a scuba store and i bought a huge a scuba tank and it's you if you go to my tick tock you can see it i bought this huge scuba tank and that cost uh like 30 uh and i filled it up with uh co2 or whatever it is and that's what i've been using to to drink uh for my soda stream and it's the greatest thing ever you like i just bought this like this like this like attachment so i could uh uh use it it's pretty amazing that's hilarious dude yeah so i just got one um and i used to laugh and be like oh nice home brew you're doing for your water like jeez you know like like could you pick a more boring hobby than like bubbling your own like water at home dude check the link that i sent you in the slack or in the um in the in the riverside chat okay let's see is this your okay it's a tick tock of your uh oh my god this is hilarious it's a giant scuba tank on the ground hooked up wired to your soda stream is this not going to be like too high powered it makes it it's very high powered i like i like what i say at home is i want my bubbles to be aggressive i want i want i want i really thought your quote there was going to be cooler yeah i say at home i i always tell people i like my water bubbly yeah but i do like aggressive bubbles like you know toppo chico i want it like how it burns so good that's what i want and uh yeah there you go and and that's what i want so anyway i did that i bought like a piece for it for like ten dollars like it converts a scuba tank into a canister for toe uh for these soda streams this soda stream business do you know that it's like a multi-billion dollar product yeah that's what i was gonna bring up so i when i bought this i was like i was like this is a great idea you know i'm buying tons of lacroix and stuff like that it's kind of annoying go like these heavy can things i was like actually this does make sense to do at home and the product is slick you don't plug it like i thought oh i'm gonna have to like connect this to my water line or something like that it's like no it's like just sits on your counter no attachments it's like [ __ ] hands-free wireless bluetooth got it's like an airpod basically and you put the bottle in you pump it three times you feel like you feel like you did it so you get this like sense of accomplishment and then you get the fresh sparkling water and it's awesome and it's not even flavored but it's fine and my daughter loves making it with me it's like a whole activity i can like if she's crying i'm like you want to go make some spicy water and she's like yes and so then we go and do it and so i'm like all right this is an amazing thing i go look it up i'm like you know i think this soda stream could be big and then like of course i'm the idiot i go google it's like it sold for three billion dollars like i don't know five years ago or something like that like it's owned by pepsi i think they probably do a billion in revenue i'm pretty sure right before they sold they were at 900 something million in annual revenue and then they sold in like you haven't heard numbers since and like i'm sure it's over a billion dollars now yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm pretty sure so there's two businesses in this space that i was shocked at how big they are and one was sodastream i think it's an israeli company correct like i'm just this is off member i don't remember it yes i believe so it's an israeli company that has been around for a bit and they killed it them and you know what else is just a behemoth is courage curd coffee uh i think curry coffee makes uh like five or ten or something crazy billion dollars a year in revenue and it's been parlayed into a holding company uh that they buy all types of other stuff right oh wow um yeah the other one that's like this i thought you were going to say is what's the name of the one that was in offices and i think this is it i think it's bevvy yeah bbv wire i'm not sure exactly which one um that was a multi-hundred million maybe a billion dollar company also and basically it was like hey fancy water fountain for your office like you can bring your water bottle to this you can uh just take a cup it can do bubbling it could do flat it could do warm and it's like all right that's cool that's better than like and i think they give you the machine for free and then you've got to like just pay for the canisters over time right it's the same like razor blade model i'm like a big soda guy like to the point of sometimes i go when i lived in san francisco i used to go to this movie theater nearby because they had a freestyle coke machine that you could use without buying a ticket to the movie so i always i would always walk there just to get a cherry vanilla coke zero out of the soda machine the freestyle machine you know those machines of course of course they're the best so i try to buy one and you can't you can't buy a you can't buy one of those machines you have to lease it in their terms it's like a lifetime lease so you have to spend like i think like 200 a month and you have to be willing to sign like this crazy agreement and then they have to come every month to refill the thing it was a pain in the ass i was like dude i just want like a like i want like a coke fountain like this seems like pretty easy just let me give you money and have it and you you couldn't you couldn't do it so these bevvy machines i'm all about i think they're amazing and the soda the soda stream i think is also amazing i have one and i use it all the time too but i i hate going to bed bath and beyond buying those stupid-ass containers right and so i think that there there are but i think that they're you i'm sure some of these are successful but basically i saw it i was like this would make for a really interesting dc product because i think you could this has the makings of what would make a really good ddc product and then i found one that was like really well designed i can't find the name of it right now it's like cell neck or some cell deck or something i don't know what it was something like that but basically sodastream competitor but you just say all right these guys are selling through target and whatever how can i do the normal d2c playbook right get the logo lowercase pastel fonts send it to some influencers create a juicy offer that's like you know you can get the machine for like just pay for shipping and i'll send you the machine and then like now you're on the hook for the subscription of like cartridges uh someone's like someone's been reading book make it small make it big do something to like to make it add a twist to it but damn this thing could uh this thing could work this thing could pop off so i don't know ddc sodastream competitor i think that's like a 100 million dollar plus idea yeah that's an easy one what else do you want to do um all right let me give you another thing that i think is kind of cool so i started teaching my course this week and um how'd it go is it bigger you know i make it i make it look easy bro i make it look easy i heard people showed up shirtless yeah there's multiple people who just come to the class without the shirt on and i'm like bold bold choice um make yourself at home and uh you know they're all like ripped so like you know it's not like like we do have a line and the line is if you're not ripped [Laughter] if you're not adding to the visual appeal you're taking it away from the visual appeal and that's where the rule with michael my class are my rules we're the sales where the sales uh how do they compare to the is digital revenue dropping off highest sales ever really for me i thought it would be slower because like the economy's going down i don't know why maybe uh maybe i sold it better maybe people just were like oh you know what like yeah life is changing you got pandemic you got layoffs you got all kinds of stuff like what if you know basically can i use a skill set here to like to like win in this like what do i need to change given that the world is like not the same as it was i think there's an element of that like it's sort of a new year's resolution effect where when the world changes a bunch people like assess like what's what matters and they realize like oh wow if i invested a little bit of money here could i unlock more potential than this new path because my current path is being shaken up and you did it on maven what's the reason no maven they've been like they went overboard for me it's been awesome so they're like they're like managing my course for me and like doing a bunch of awesome help helpful stuff the first session i was like oh [ __ ] okay i gotta like dust off the cobwebs i gotta go perform and right before i was like okay i'm gonna go on and i always work myself into a state a state of mind and i'm like i'm gonna i don't i don't show up to these like cold or i don't rely on the slide deck or the material like i gotta perform so i'm like but but i'm like it's ten minutes before and i'm like oh i'm not in state right now i gotta get and say so i'm like okay what do i do and i'm like i gotta like you know like in nascar or whatever you pull over and like they do like the pit stop and like like take off all four wheels put new wheels on they're like paint again slap the driver in the face like go like that's basically what i did to myself i like jumped in a cold shower and i like i like immediately uh turned on this thing i was like i like this like youtube video and i was like what do i need i was like i was like i think if i come out hot with a story like i think in that first two minutes if i just come in strong people are going to be like oh [ __ ] this is going to be an up like this is going to be different like oh this is going to be good because you know like that first impression is going to really matter so i googled this like um i was like amazing i don't know what i wrote but i was like amazing uh start of a speech i put that in youtube or something and it pops out this video from a guy who won like the toastmasters challenge and the guy does this he goes this is good for the youtube viewers uh maybe podcast you're not gonna know what the hell is going on so the guy walks out on stage not a not a great looking guy some you know looks like my indian cousin from somewhere so he he walks out and he's like doesn't say a word stands in front of the stage he's digging into his pocket you don't know what he's reaching for pulls out a cigarette puts it in his teeth gets a lighter kind of like the cigarette and and you could just hear the crowd like murmuring like some people are laughing nervously some people are like no like you're indoors like don't do this and like other people are just like they don't know what to make of it so already [ __ ] has to said a word and he's commanding the room just by doing a pattern interrupt right so he comes out here and he's like and he looks at the crowd because they're all reacting at this point and he was like in his own world and he didn't come out there say hi i'm sean i'm here to talk about but no no he didn't go out there and grovel to the audience he's he's trying to like to say right then he looks like oh you're there and he he looks and he goes what this no and i was like what i was like what is he doing this is incredible this is mind blowing he's so he's like in just his facial expression he was like oh what what am i doing this no he goes you think this is gonna kill me let me tell you something you know how many people die from cigarettes every year and i was like and nobody does the answer he's like whatever four million people die from cigarettes every year he's like you know how many people die from like a obesity from sugar if i had brought out a cupcake and he's like you know nobody would have bought an eye but i like this one little cigarettes statistically shows that you know like actually the biggest variable in me getting lung cancer is my genetics and not the fact that i smoke a lot he goes and also i made all those facts up and then he said that he's like but then he's got him like in the palm of his hand they're laughing they're like they're intrigued everybody's paying attention then he goes into his talk and whenever he like starts his thing and i was like this is the fire i need i turn off the video i run out the shower i put on a shirt i start my my course and i'm like i don't do that i do like a completely different thing but that just sort of like set the mood for what did you do so what did i do oh i go um i sorry i first told the story i go i go you know i'm here but i normally don't do this and they're like what are you like you're you're teaching this course i just paid you money what do you mean you don't so i'm like i don't want to do this you know i um i once i wanted to watch what amazing what does the best public speaker do so i watched a video of tony robbins talking at the dream force conference who here is from san francisco you know if you're you know the dream force conference if you're from san francisco because it shuts the whole [ __ ] city down and you're like why why can't i drive because salesforce is having a conference like they shut down the roads and people like yeah yeah in the chat and then i'm like all right and mark benioff ceo of salesforce goes all right guys we got a special treat the final speaker of the event this guy's one of the best but here's the deal he doesn't come out to a cold room this guy will not come out if this room is cold he won't and not temperature wise he's like you need to have some energy you need to be i know it's the end of the day but this guy won't walk out to a cold room so get let's get the clap going and people start clapping and he comes out and like it's basically like he got a standing ovation before he even entered the stage and i was like i was like i saw that and i was like hmm new thing for me i don't come out to a cold room and so i like demanded that they give me a little energy and i was like i was like how about we start with a story who's down for a story and they're like hey all right well give me a story i go and i told a story i've told it on the podcast before the dmv story and basically my my message to them was like look let's all be honest uh 98 of courses end in what and everybody in the chat's like waste of money waste of time blah blah blah i'm like so good decision you dropped a thousand dollars on this course and you know that the stats say 98 of you are gonna end up with a waste of money no results no progress waste of time and i was like okay but we don't we don't you know we're not part of we don't want to be a statistic so like what's the right way to do this and i told this story about like how my trainer how he goes to the dmv and normally the dmv is like this horrible experience and he's like i want a five-star experience so he decided to show up he's like if i want them to be a five-star hospitality experience like the ritz carlton of dmvs i'm gonna show up as a five-star customer so i'm gonna walk in with a different energy into that and then like he and then a bunch of good things happen he got to skip the lines lady gave him the thing he didn't have to take the test blah blah blah i tell her i told the full story of that that version and i was basically telling them like you're gonna get out what you put in if you show up to this like yeah half of you are right now in the zoom slouched over low energy half checking your phone uh you know not sure if this is gonna be good or bad like you know not convinced you know you're coming in with a two-star attitude and a two-star effort you're gonna get a two-star result and so i'm gonna show you in this first session literally how to attend a course it has nothing to do with writing but i'm going to teach you how to show up to a course we don't learn this in school i'm going to show you how to actually do this right and then i like go through a couple of like methods that's actually it's amazing so you let's talk about this course thing for a second because it seems like you are getting a lot of energy from doing it right right in the moment yes i enjoy teaching it i hate selling it fair okay great i mean i don't think anyone really enjoys telling it but i i think you you you enjoy the the act of teaching which is good this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform where everything is fully integrated well i can see the clients hold history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago i totally missed hubspot grow better so listen to this what i did today is i uh so i've been doing this thing i i i'm also gonna be a little vague i'm starting on this new thing that i'm working on and i found a company in the space that recently sold for 2.5 ish million dollars to a pe firm and um i found the the partner at the pe firm who bought it and today i just called them i just picked the phone and called them and i go hi uh what's going on uh my name's sam um sorry this is weird but do you have like two minutes to talk do you listen to podcasts by chance well he goes he was like well you're sampar right from my first million i was like [ __ ] a what's up uh you know who i am but the reason i'm calling is basically i'm starting a business that's a competitor to the one that you just bought last week and i wanted to know why you bought that company and what made it great and uh what what like what sucked about it uh he's like whoa you're really like coming forward you're you know you're being pretty forward i was like yeah well like here's the deal like um this is gonna play out a few ways i'm gonna start this thing it's gonna fail so you know you don't have to worry about that uh the second thing is i'm gonna start something and i'm just gonna like crush you guys um and the third way i start something and you eventually buy us um but like you know either way like i'm happy to share what i'm doing and and hopefully you can share what you're doing and maybe somehow we can figure out a way to help us and i was like i know that sounds cocky i'm sorry but i this is out of respect i think you guys are actually amazing and uh it was so productive it it i like like i'm sorry but um me and dylan we're both dogs and so a dog like me coming to a dog like you but this guy he was like uh he said um he's like yeah you know like i gotta go tell the team that like uh you know uh someone who's launched businesses in the before who has some capital is going into our space and i was in my head i was like i i don't want to do this but i was like dude i bet you i could sell this company to this guy right now now yeah yeah it's like i think just brother you ever heard of addition by subtraction i can tell you a little something about how to get rid of competition right now if you could do some addition on that calculator of yours take that bad boy out let's come up with a number yeah i was like i was thinking about it i'm like am i can i just threaten you and maybe no i would never do that but it might i was like this might be an option and so but but this tactic of calling these people it's been very helpful so i'll give another i'm going to say two things one on the thing we're talking about earlier all right so this is my uh why it's okay to be douchey disclaimer when when me and sam are like oh we're doing this thing it's actually been easier like we did this and it just worked and i did five things that worked and sam's like yeah maybe you could do something easier i'm like i make it look easy i say that for three reasons number one it's honest if something is easy i'll tell you it's easy if something's hard i'll tell you it's hard i'm not going to like say what it's not just because it sounds better or worse and also it's the first time when we say easy it can mean simple like it's not actually easy but it's like straightforward intellectually i know how to do it i just have to put the effort in it's also like um for my personal trainer if he sits down on a bench and there's like i don't know whatever 200 pounds and he could he could bench it it's easy for him because he's put in 15 years of hard work so that that is now easy for him and similarly i got my ass kicked for like nine straight years from the age of like 20 to 29 with a startup failing over and over and over again nothing could have felt harder during that period of time and so that now things are relative like i don't relatively feel much easier because i'm better now than i was three four five years ago uh when i kind of sucked um so that's a that's the first part the second reason uh that we say it's easy is because this is a podcast and we're trying to be entertaining the third reason that we say it or at least that i say it is i am tired of everybody telling everybody that like [ __ ] is so hard and like if you go anywhere on the internet right like we joke about the the multi-trillionaire mindset like all of the like entrepreneurship content is like how hard it is you know uh elon musk says starting a company is like chewing glass and looking into the abyss some companies maybe yeah maybe for you bro but like you know i i do a power writing course it's fine it's like chewing bubble gum and looking at the pool like you know it's not the same thing so so it's not if if you always hear how hard it is you kind of have to question the source why do they say that hey it makes them look more heroic b it keeps other people from doing it c it kind of justifies why i got like why i get to be successful enrich because i'm paying this huge cost and like i actually subscribe to a different version of entrepreneurship which is the way that me and a lot of our friends do things which is like we do it because it's fun it's just like it's genuinely fun to do so it's not like this painful slog um that doesn't mean it's like no effort no it's pretty high effort just like playing a game or playing like pick up basketball you're gonna end up really sweaty and tired by the end but nobody confuses pick up basketball with like digging in a sand mine to like you know provide for your kids so it's like you know there's a difference between like uh enjoyable effort and painful effort and i would say that for us what we do is enjoyable effort and so i think it's important for people to hear that not everything has to be hard and slow and painful like there is a version of doing a business that is fun and faster and um and you know enjoyable and i just want to present both like that both exist so that you don't like pretend you don't create this fictional story in your mind that like everything has to be hard okay that's my disclaimer did we uh cross the douche line hard for sure whatever i'm a habitual uh line stepper [Laughter] the thing i forgot to say by the way the reason the whole reason i went on that tangent about i make it look easy with the with the talking public speaking thing was the video i watched was from toastmasters which i find to be a very fascinating business um and so i don't know if you know much about toastmasters i only know a tiny bit like i don't even entirely know what it is it's like a it's an entity it's like a group of meetups what is it ben jonathan have you guys ever gone to toastmasters do you have any experience with this do you know anything about toastmasters i i know what it is but no i've never been i have no experience with it how would you explain in your words if sam doesn't really fully know uh i think of it as a public speaking group where people who maybe don't feel comfortable public speaking go and they give little speeches to each other so they can get comfortable with it and learn more about public speaking and jonathan did you have something yeah i would say it's like people who wear oversized suits who've been doing it for years or people like me who probably went when i was like you know 15 and was just like trying to like get better at talking to girls or whatever the oversight suit thing is so spot-on you can't watch a video of this and be like ah 36 long you sure that was not sure that was the right member i'm excited you know what that means i mean you don't even own a suit i don't but i just like you know i watch tv or something so um so toastmasters is this old school thing it gets around like the one of the biggest fears people have which is public speaking one of the biggest desires is to be able to be a good public speaker or be comfortable speaking to strangers and so toastmasters these like look it's like alcoholics anonymous in a way it's like these local franchises local meetups run by local chairs and you go to the actual place i think there's at least how this is the picture i have in my mind my mind of it you go to the place and they kind of like teach you things but then you also get practice in this kind of safe space with a bunch of other people who are trying to get good at this it's very very useful it's been around for like 20 years and there's like there's like a whole like ecosystem of people who really care about toastmasters i think you could reinvent toastmasters um like i feel like this is a business i could start if i wanted to which is like toastmasters i think can be modernized like you don't have to have the oversized suit you don't need the like in-person meetups like i wrote discord toastmasters like i think you could do this whole thing and zoom or discord like i think you just have people get into little chapters practice this stuff make you know they kind of meet people that kind of learn some techniques and they kind of get over their stage fright around public speaking and the local ones ladder up into like the state ones they ladder up into like the national ones and some people compete at it um and you get your certificate after going through the program and it's like kind of a course it's kind of a church and it's kind of like a self-help seminar um that i think could be recreated in a modern way using discord that's my idea react to that you want to know something interesting so toastmasters is a non-profit so all their revenue is public guess how much revenue they do um i'm going to say 20 million a year wow not far 36 it looks like 36 million dollars a year in revenue um and it's from membership dues and fees so it's like a subscription revenue wow what do they charge and they've got 63 million dollars in the bank it looks like wow let me manage that for you um i could uh would you like to walk away with half that but with a great story to tell because i do have some crypto investments for you i agree with you i think that i think it could work um how many members do you think they have i bet it's a huge number that pay a tiny amount i feel like they have like lifetime like 30 000 or 50 000 members of toastmasters is that real or is that overkill i can't find it on their thing but uh i can't find it on their my favorite type of pop quiz [Laughter] i don't know i don't know how many members they have but i i'm on board i think this is really interesting it's dude google have you seen their logo if you think if you think of a villain from batman that's what their logo looks like it's like a really old school yeah like a corporate international yeah what the game should be headquarters inc in uh it like it's a clip art globe with like a blue clip clipart globe with like you know the the corporate name wrapped around the globe wow this is this is an in this is interesting i hadn't looked at this in a minute um yeah i mean i'm aboard i when i've gone i've gone to these before they are pretty life-changing i think learning how to public speak i always tell people this is the only class i took in college that had an impact on my life was uh like debate or speech class or something whatever it was called but that's like the only class i think that actually matters that i took in college so i think it's i think these things are life-changing yeah if somebody's working on this reach out to me uh i just want to know about it uh specifically do not reach out to me if you're like i'd love to talk to you about potentially i might work on this don't do that if you do it tell me and just show me a link to your thing and then let's not do a call but i'll check it out and then let's talk more that's my uh that's how i'd like to do this going forward because i get a bunch of inbound every time i say that it's like not the right type i'll give you the right type i talked about oh it'd be fun to create a company like pixar like maybe that's what i'll do i feel like i could that would be amazing and it would be so much fun darmesh liked that yeah i like what you're about to say you got all hot and bothered is that where you're going to did you see uh someone goes uh damn darmesh came on the pod i talked about like how he's not worried about losing 500 million dollars that's some real big dick energy and he replied i forget what he said he goes that's very nice of you to say that i've got bde but i i really think it's more like uh i've got i i i try not to have that energy but i try to have sev small ego what was it vibes small ego vibes and i replied uh that's such a big dick energy thing to say and he loved it and sarah was like uh sarah was like man darmesh is such a great guy but does he know that he's like he needs to tell you to shut the [ __ ] up because uh he needs to like put you down right now because he's so nice that he just like puts up with all this [ __ ] no it's great in fact your um hubspot experience is i feel like the opposite of my twitch experience like you got acquired and i feel like they're like go on cowboy do your thing out there and like you know they love it and they're like oh sam you know vaguely you know offended you know one tenth of the population today ah what a guy that's all good just you know he's doing his thing like and they like engaged they like the podcast all the stuff where i was like i feel like when i was doing this stuff at twitch they were like um does this guy work here like why is he just on twitter and like he just leaves in the middle of day and goes and records at a studio and like what does it have to do with anything that we do here and i feel like my twitter personality was like a constant source of annoyance for like seventy percent of like the management team there and thirty percent i think liked it or appreciated it like the sakura people they were just like oh it's cool yeah do your thing man it's cool i like it uh or like the thing you said was stupid here's why it was stupid and we get into a debate about it it was all good but i feel like 70 percent of people were just like silently like f this guy this guy is no good well what would you have done with you it depends you know um that's a great question that's a really great question because my honest answer is i would have been like look man i get it uh i like what you do i'm like basically i like what you're doing but i also feel like it's just kind of selfish like you know you're doing your thing it doesn't really have to do with this so there's kind of like two ways that this can go number one if you're one foot out the door let's maybe go two feet out the door like maybe it'll save us both some pain like if that's actually what you want to do let's do it and like then i won't feel like you know i don't want to ever feel like you're not like kicking ass for us um while that was the agreement let's change the agreement if the agreement needs to be changed the second would be the second way i'd approach it is look i get it and this is what emmitt did tell me he goes i get it you're not gonna be here forever i win i wish that you stayed forever but i i know your future is not gonna be here um so let's be honest about that that's fine uh he goes he said to me he goes when you do start your next thing i would love to invest in it like because i know you're not gonna be here forever but i like i really like seeing how you work i would invest you that that made me feel awesome it made me really respect the guy it made me like put down my guard in terms of that like okay i could just be honest with this person which i think is just a great way to like manage somebody and then the last part i think that i would have kind of tweaked is just like um let's agree that while you're here you're gonna kick ass in these ways and here's my deal to you you kick ass in these ways um you do all these things but as soon as you stop kicking ass then let's have a conversation about why that happened because i know that if you tried you would do well that means if you're not doing well that means you've stopped trying and i'm not cool with stopping trying like i'm cool if you're gonna spend x percent of your energy doing this other stuff and kind of paving your future but i need to know that at least you're gonna kick ass when you're when you are here i need you to be fully plugged in when you are here i mean part of the reason was also that your like company had nothing to do with necessarily the stuff that intrigued you and interested you uh my company in my job after the sale was to create content and that's what i'm doing and for the most part i do it consistently like we're incredibly consistent and mostly rarely offend people and also darmash is cool as [ __ ] so of course i'm gonna give him a hard time like like i guess i'm gonna mess around with them but everything we say is like flattering for for him i at least i think it is it's supposed to be but uh yeah that's the big difference your job is to build this podcast my job was to do something else i was building the podcast as a side thing like basically i would what i would do is we record these at noon because that's when everybody else at twitch goes to the cafeteria to eat lunch that's when the cafeteria opens and i would just walk outside your office was right across the street and we built the studio there and i would just walk across the street and instead of eating lunch i would go do the podcast and then when i got back i would grab a bite and like take it to my desk and like so that's how i kind of like did it on the side whereas your job is to do this thing which is quite different ben um are is the audience gonna get any type of value from this total meandering um 12 year old discussion don't do that you're just fishing for him to say we sucked right ben or maybe we do maybe it's okay no ben give us the full honest take don't don't don't compliment sam because he put himself down so i'll i'll give you i'll give you a backhanded compliment here's the backhand i love those this was a good episode but they're the only fans for this really i'm um this was a good episode it was a good episode because the show was about business ideas and the show was like very fun and great but sometimes like get away from that too much and this had numerous good business ideas so like the toastmasters uh of the future the whatever discord meets toastmasters like there's like an actually good business idea that someone could run with or like ddc soda stream like again it's like a good business idea so um agency that's another one remixer agency um kind of uh tweets uh as a service is not like a business idea for someone else but like kind of could spark some thoughts so it had a ton as packed with business ideas so i think it's a good episode ben you also said it was backhanded but then you just gave us a normal for front-handed compliments because i was saying like sometimes on recent episodes we don't talk a lot about business ideas okay that's why this one was good yeah okay look we're getting back to it if you got three interesting business ideas out of this podcast i will put that up against any other podcast you listen to how many podcasts are giving you one good business idea per hour i'm dropping three with at least four to five jokes solid chuckles that will make you know the person next to you on the bus be like what are you listening to what is that so i mean this podcast was phenomenal as far as i'm concerned hey before we go we did like a whole deep dive on my dm history with uh mr beast sean are we gonna talk about uh yours at all yeah you know i was gonna start the pod with this but i didn't want to you know like i don't know what the etiquette is on is there a dialogue going on outing sam parr as the only person on this podcast that is not friends [Laughter] and like you know i know that for some people it's like it's your choice it's your body your choice you want to disclose that sam now that we're here after we recorded the pod about ben getting a call from a dm and call from mr beast that episode's not even out yet i checked my dm's yesterday look who's here mr beast and he's talking about something else and i just thought to myself i was pretty happy that it was mr beast but i was only more happy that i thought oh my god this means sam is the only one of us that didn't get one and i got i was over the moon so um is there is there a dialogue going on there's the dialogue bro this i'm saying words he's saying words i'm sending memes he's sending beams actually it's just me sending the memes but i'm trying to get a laugh and uh yeah it's happening we are full-fledged hot and heavy conversation i hate you mr beast good i don't want to talk to you and ben don't tell me if you told him to dm me like just don't tell me that i need to feel like i did this but i'm gonna put earmuffs on and you say if you told him well bent i i told him listen there's these cool guys that i mentor who i i help out every now and then and uh you should i think they would really like it it would like make their lives if you could reach out and like maybe tell them happy birthday or something like that i think that's why he reached out like a make-a-wish foundation yeah i do with these two guys they're a little off but they're like you mean the world to you to them if you would just accidentally you know send him a word do you uh can we get him on here you think i brought it up he didn't bite the first time i brought it up but now that shawn's dming with him i bet i bet it does happen at some point well ben you got a little kid you know when you feed a kid they don't always bite but if they don't spit it out either we say okay tomorrow the airplane's coming in again with the mac and cheese and we'll try again tomorrow i don't know where we go all right i guess that's it [Music] you

it was really rough for quite quite an extended period of time we couldn't pay our mortgage we had cars repossessed i've told this story before but it was so bad at one point that you know we didn't have enough money to pay for our our garbage collection so they took away our bins we had to put our our garbage bags in the back of this beat up minivan that we had and look for you know kind of uh bins like behind the grocery stores and stuff to like throw our garbage i mean it was pretty humiliating and quite frankly pretty emasculating as somebody who's supposed to be you know head of household and taking care of [ __ ] like i was unable to make sure that my house was in order and so we went through a really rough period of time and it was not clear that we were going to be able to kind of persevere [Music] okay so let's give you a little intro here so we got uh rich roll which is um an amazing name first of all i'm sure you get that a bunch i feel like the rick roll kind of stepped down your corner a little bit do you get is that a problem for you a little bit man not a day goes by where you know i'm not on the receiving end of some kind of bs about that yeah exactly um and but that is your real name rich roll that is like not like a stage name god-given name okay wow my parents are are uh you know behind here so uh and you have a very very interesting story so i'm gonna give the like very laymen version of the story um and then we what i wanna do is two things i want to dive in and actually hear from you a little bit more about the interesting bits of that story as well as you know it's we are kind of like a we're a business podcast and so what we'd like to talk about in general is um business opportunities sure sounds good all right cool um so your story is as far as i know is as follows you um you're coming up all you were coming up on 40 years old um you were not in great shape you're i think 50 pounds overweight is what you what you say and you were you know decided to sort of make a change in your life and now you are very very well known as a endurance athlete who has a plant-powered or vegan diet and you have done some kind of amazing things in the endurance uh you know competitive endurance field i think you were named one of the 25 fittest men on the planet by men's fitness which is a pretty dope honor um and so that is your kind of that's your claim to fame did i did i get that right yeah i think that's that's fairly accurate that's probably how i'm best known although i haven't raced in a number of years and i've sort of graduated or i'm attempting to kind of graduate from the limiting parameters of being known as like a vegan endurance athlete and the podcast is a big piece of that which we can get into but i would say that's a fair assessment of how kind of most people think of me and and my association and what would be the shift so if you were known as like this guy who went from i guess the full story is entertainment lawyer uh you know struggle with sort of drugs alcohol get sober then you're but then you're overcompensating by eating not so great and then you have this kind of moment you're you know you're sort of uh your you know come to jesus moment or whatever where you're like okay i'm gonna make a change you make this lifestyle change you become this well-known uh endurance athlete who's doing it in a way that's atypical so i think you're the first vegan to complete a ultra endurance event which is like some crazy 300 mile uh 300 mile type of event uh where you're running you're biking you're swimming you're doing all that good stuff and now you have businesses that are around this right so you have a meal planning business you have um there's kind of like a whole lifestyle uh and brand and business around this stuff and so from going from i'm known for competing in this what do you think you're what do you want to be known for now what do you think is that transition yeah it's a great question i mean i think that uh you know just kind of fill in the gaps on the story i do have a history of you know alcoholism that's a big part of my story alcoholism and recovery that predated the kind of next chapter which was uh sort of middle age malaise and reaching another kind of rubicon with how i was living my life and making a secondary transition into a healthy lifestyle and that led me into the ultra endurance world and i was able to distinguish myself in that world as a middle-aged athlete but also as somebody who was doing it plant-based and that garnered a fair amount of media attention and put me in a position to do something with it and the first thing that i did was write a book uh it came out it came out almost exactly ten years ago it was called finding ultra and it's essentially a memoir but it also has aspects of being a bit of a lifestyle guide and that kind of put me on the map in a public way and in the wake of that book coming out it became about like okay that was great i got you know an okay advance for that but i've got four kids how am i gonna make a living um sort of propagating these ideas or continuing the conversation that that book began because up to that point i was still a practicing attorney and so the transition out of the legal world into doing what i do today i would say has been a very inelegant and protracted process i'm not a naturally uh inclined entrepreneur i was reared in a in a in a much more kind of traditional conservative environment education first get the good job get into the good grad school the whole bit and hence you know became a lawyer which is you know very much a safety seeking type of career so my mindset and my thinking has never been oriented around entrepreneurship whatsoever but i suddenly found myself in the position where being a lawyer felt uh untenable given all these experiences that i had and i was given this gift this opportunity to do something different and it really challenged me to uh upend uh all of my kind of built-in proclivities around safety seeking and kind of doing uh kind of following this um you know path that society smiles upon like even though i went to stanford and was surrounded by entrepreneurship and the explosion of silicon valley for some reason that never rubbed off on me and i and and and now i was in a position of like okay i need to kind of shed the limitations of how i'd lived my life to date and really start to think about how to do this differently and because it's not my natural state i sought out mentors and i found one mentor in particular who's been absolutely instrumental in helping me forge this new path his name is greg anzalone and he's ceo of a company out here near where i live called sideshow and sideshow is a pop culture collectibles company they create uh figurines like limited edition uh very uh finely crafted um figures from pop culture so from the marvel movies and star wars etc everything from life-sized uh c-3 c c-3pos to darth vader's and thor and the like and he grew that company from a couple artisans in a garage to now a very large enterprise that employs hundreds and hundreds of people and if you're to go to comic-con they have the second biggest booth at comic-con second only to marvel and there's a whole subculture of people who are fanatic collectors of what sideshow produces my point being that greg is a natural entrepreneur he's been very successful in a number of businesses and he began to mentor me and retrain the way that i was thinking about my life and really helped me create structures around what i was doing and strategies in order to build a foundation upon which we could create a sustainable business that would provide for my family the book was the first piece in that in the wake of the book coming out and in an effort to continue the conversation that that book began i launched the podcast almost 10 years ago so i wasn't a first mover in the podcast space but i definitely was an early adopter and it was a medium that i had fallen in love with as an athlete i'd spent so many hours so much time alone on the bike and running listening to podcasts when it was very difficult to even acquire an episode it was pre iphone so you had to go to your desktop or your laptop and download a series of mp3s and then bounce those mp3s to your ipod and create playlists and i was doing this before anyone else i knew was listening to podcasts and was discovering as we're all discovering now how much value there is in this medium and so with that love and i think a lot of not practice but i was very acclimated to what a good podcast could be because as a listener i'd consume so much of this media that when i started mine i felt like i was in a situation where i had something to say i knew some interesting people in my life and importantly there wasn't any competition at the time like people were not clamoring to start podcasting in 2012. i think you know aside from uh adam carolla and kevin smith and and maybe joe rogan nobody was even monetizing these things so it was less about it being a business proposition uh and more about uh an opportunity to continue to build a platform with the trust that at some point something could come out of this that could sustain my family financially and so i started the podcast i immediately was able to rise to the top of the itunes rankings because as i mentioned earlier there was no competition at the time and in the health and fitness and wellness space there really wasn't very much good content at the time so from that i was able to build an audience slowly and gradually over time and did the podcast for a number of years before monetization was even anything to to consider um and now of course it's it's you know it's doing incredibly well but again that wasn't really the plan but because the podcast has become and continues to this day to be the tip of the spear uh in terms of all the things that i do it's been the most profitable not just financially but also in terms of engaging the most number of people around the ideas that that i care about and this has been a very long-winded way of getting to the point of answering your question which is how do you want to be seen today very early on i i made a decision from actually from the outset of the podcast that i didn't want it to be a podcast about specifically just being plant-based or being an athlete i didn't want it to be a triathlon podcast i wanted to cast a wide net which is why i named the podcast after my name because i wasn't sure if i was going to continue to do it where my interests might find me but i knew that i probably wasn't going to change my name so i just did the easy thing and named it after myself and it's allowed me the flexibility to move in whatever direction inspires me and so although i would say that the core kind of themes of the podcast are around personal transformation healthy lifestyle eating and of course fitness running you know the sports that that i care about it's also allowed me to host conversations with just a wide diversity of people who i can continue to grow from um in other ways beyond like how i've been traditionally known because for me this is my growth accelerator and i think we're all here on the planet to grow in our various ways and overcome our challenges and so it's given me the opportunity to sit down with people who can help me grow and work through my you know kind of limiters in in all areas of life and so as a result it's allowed the audience um to be very diverse although there are plenty of kind of you know vegans and runners and stuff like that it's really brought in all walks of life and i think has been um a big reason why the podcast has continued to grow and flourish because it's not limited to one specific theme topic or kind of uh heading and how big is it today so i see on youtube maybe like 700 000 subscribers there uh podcast i'm not sure what that would be is that i don't know if it's bigger or smaller than the youtube stuff and then the top videos like you know david goggins hubermann those who get like five to ten million views on youtube which are great kind of like the you know the perfect storm of like overlap of interest the right guest who already has their own audience people search for their name in youtube that sort of thing so how big is the give us a sense of how big the the kind of the the content side has gotten to now yeah so youtube has been something that that we're relatively new to i think we started uh filming the podcast in earnest maybe two and a half three years ago at this point um and like you said we have outlier videos like the hubermann initial huberman podcast i did i think has like 11 million views some of the goggins interviews have a lot of views but a lot of them don't have that many views so it's very hit or miss and as you know uh youtube is all about the algorithm and what's great about youtube is that it's amazing at discovery so it allows people who are not subscribers or people who are not familiar with what you're doing to kind of ha by happenstance stumble onto your content and and it allows you to then bring them into your universe but youtube is still a very small piece in our content engine the vast majority of our audience is audio only so through apple podcasts spotify is a very small very tiny slice of our audience so the vast majority are people who are listening on apple devices or on platforms that are outside of spotify and youtube but i believe in youtube because even if somebody doesn't watch our video that thumbnail might come across their screen and it almost works as a billboard to enhance visibility um of of what we're doing and so we continue to invest and double down in youtube although the core of what we're doing really is um audio first at least now i'd probably i'd say it's probably anywhere from 90 to 95 of our audience oh wow okay so this podcast is probably very huge then so like you know probably getting i don't know half a million you know listeners per per thing then something like that yeah it's it's in that range i mean as you know like on in audio it's fairly predictable uh how large the audience is going to be and how many people are going to listen um you know there's going to be some variation there but it falls within a tight range whereas in youtube it's just all over the map because the algorithm gods can smile on you as they did with hubermann and it goes wild that doesn't happen in audio uh so yeah i mean you're correct it's about in that range on average and so um so i have this theory with content which is that uh people will ask me a lot like okay you know how do i do better how do i do a good podcast how do i grow my content how do i grow my audience and i say well there's some like you know they're kind of looking for the what do i write in my title or thumbnail or like you know something there and there's definitely things that are better or worse but i would say you're an example of the core fundamental of what works so let me say three i'm just gonna point out three things of what you gave a kind of good story i'm gonna point out three highlights that that of why this worked number one you were early to a platform that ended up being big um if you're late to a big platform it's tough if you're early to a platform that never gets big also no bueno you gotta have early to a platform that's big that is one of the best things you could do to increase your odds of success you were basically listening to podcasts just when it was rss you know only or whatever maybe even you know there's no players or whatever um okay so the second thing is you um you have a you had a niche where you built authority um so like let's say initially it might have been vegan lifestyle or endurance training as a vegan something like that right like the overlap between two hyper passionate niches which is like you know plant-based lifestyle and you know performance uh you know athletic performance and so that overlap was like a niche that you could kind of dominate and become the authority there because there just weren't that many people who are doing it you know in general forget even about podcasting now on topic in addition to the kind of addiction recovery piece is also a cool aspect of that as well and so that's that's what's gonna go next which is i think you have an innate understanding that story is what gets people hooked uh like for example when you came on i was kind of describing you with just like some labels like there's some descriptors you've accomplished this you're known for this and you were like uh you brought it back to story what's a story a story is some transformation or change uh you know the protagonist the hero goes through something uh and they started one way and they change into another way they started thinking one thing and then they realized another you know they started single they ended up happy in love right that's the basis of all stories some change some transformation and i think as i heard you talk about like whether it was from risk-averse lawyer to reluctant entrepreneur who learned to shed that limitation that's change uh you know meat eater to plant eater change uh overweight to you know endurance athlete change and so i think you're really good at framing change because the fundamental thing people want more than learning how to you know whatever swim 100 miles is like everybody a broader thing is everybody wants to remove some of their limitations and hit that transformation that they crave whatever that is and they could take inspiration and and knowledge from your story so i think that's another one the last little element i like that you said is i think you have what i call the red pill which is uh you have uh opinions or beliefs that might be might run counter to like the consensus opinion right uh i think in general uh vegans have a belief about diet and lifestyle that is counter to the mainstream behavior and so when you have that like you know that point of view that is a different thing uh it grabs people's attention and it gets them hooked and the people who for whom that resonates uh it kind of like you know they become attracted to that so i don't know i'm not saying you intentionally architected these things but just out of your story about how you built this pretty remarkable kind of content franchise i just wanted to point out some of those elements that i've seen be common elements for people what do you think of some of those yeah i mean i think that's fairly accurate in astute the only the only one that i would bristle out a little bit is the red bull red pill thing i think it is of course like to be vegan and to be an athlete there is something contrarian about that um the only kind of nuance that i would add to that is that i i'm not somebody who's out there seeking to kind of game the system by being controversial i'm not yeah i'm not inviting controversy or trying to get into debates with people i share my experience and i'm always very careful and this is something that i've learned in recovery to not be overtly telling people what to do or how to live their lives it's always back to story as you point out because i think that people learn through stories you could tell people here are the five things you need to do or you can have a guest on who says here's the roadmap to achieving xyz and i've just learned for myself and in terms of you know how i've conducted this podcast over the years that although we can intellectualize those answers or those principles we're very remiss in putting them into action unless we can emotionally attach with them and that's where story comes in and i think as content creators we're all storytellers and it is our job to refine our ability to tell a story well and if we can do that and do it in a way that allows us to be relatable and also make the guest relatable such that an emotional attachment not just to the outcome of the story but to the individuals who are participating in that story that creates a level of engagement that actually does um that does result in powerful and sustainable change because the mission of the show really is to help activate transformation in the audience members so whether it's going from addiction to recovery or changing your diet or lifestyle habits to go from unfit to fit or to accomplish a hard task all of these are just metaphors analogies or examples of transformation i think everybody's looking for some kind of transformation in their life so it's not about like how do you go out and and do an ultra endurance race that's just one vehicle for transformation it's my personal story and i'm happy to tell it but i'm really about getting to the core tenets of why some people change and others don't and trying to find a means by which i can communicate a path for people to rethink the ceilings on their own limitations and invite a little bit of challenge discipline and uh and you know kind of goal setting into their own lives so that they can experience some version of the transformation that i've been lucky enough to experience in in my own life and then the final thing um that i would point out you kind of uh launched into this question with uh a little treatise about you know titles and how you you know kind of position your content on the internet to try to game it for success and of course you know there are kind of tenets and rules around like here's if you want you know a lot of people to click you say it this way or you have this crazy thumbnail and i'm not saying we're immune from experimenting with that but i think the core principle that i would like to communicate to you and your audience is that you know in my opinion over the kind of long arc of of time quality is what wins and so i try to uh opt out of a lot of these trends of the moment and just focus on creating the most powerful the best content with the best guests that i can find and and and kind of put it out there and trust that um that it will find the audience that it needs to find now that's perhaps a little bit of a luddite you know kind of approach to this and it certainly isn't going to um you know create viral moments but as somebody has been doing this for a very long time and has kind of seen and weathered all the changes in media that that seemed to take place with even greater a greater increase in in rapidity like what are the things that you can control and the really you know you can play around with titles and all of that but honestly it's like how good are you at what you're doing and i think when you place your focus on just creating the best content possible that's the long-term strategy that you know i've i've sort of adhered to and believe in and as a result it's taken me a long time i i didn't come out of the gate swinging i didn't have a new york times bestseller you know it's been kind of a very plotting path of just slowly brick by brick like building something that is sustainable over time and and meaningful you said you talked about storytelling and i get this question a lot because we tell a lot of stories and i think now we're pretty good at it but i definitely was not a storyteller growing up i was the quiet kid and my group of friends in my house my sister was the if something happened to me and we wanted at a party we wanted to tell the story it'd be like let your sister like basically sister tell it it'll be it'll be that's when it'll be good and so i was definitely not a storyteller kind of like naturally um but have tried to get better at it because i think it's a really powerful tool you talked about the same thing like you know um if you'd like to convey information if you'd like to inspire people if you'd like to educate people like you're going to want this tool in your tool belt called storytelling and you know work on that craft because it will help you um can you teach me a little bit about storytelling so tell me some things that you've learned either how you learned it what you learned help us be a better storyteller in a couple minutes here what what are some things that uh that come to mind yeah that's a great that's a great question i mean i i think storytelling is a skill like i'm a naturally uh you know quiet person myself i didn't grow up telling crazy stories around the campfire you know and regaling my friends or anything like that i really learned i i think my kind of um education around storytelling began as somebody who who has attended thousands if not tens of thousands of aaa meetings and being somebody who who had the privilege to bear witness to people get up in front of groups large and small and really bear their soul and and tell their personal story warts and all of you know the hardships that they've endured and how they got better and kind of arrived at the life that that they enjoy today and that requires courage and it requires most importantly vulnerability like if you've been to nea meetings and you see people up and they get up and they tell the most horrific stories about the things that they have done things that would provoke a shame response in any normal human being and they laugh it off and you realize like how powerful that is to be so um confident in yourself that you can share this tale of something that you did and it holds no power over you i think that is a powerful kernel of transformation for other people when they hear that but to the vulnerability piece what it taught me was the courage to be vulnerable myself so that i could get up in front of groups and tell my story with that level of of honesty and vulnerability and also to notice that when you do that you create trust and connectivity in the person that you're speaking to like if you're willing to get up and tell them this crazy thing that you did uh as an opener it gives the other person permission to do the same and that exchange then becomes uh one that is much more intimate than the typical conversation that we're going to have so that's a key piece like i always try to lead with vulnerability and the second thing being that that um you know everybody has their version of joseph campbell's uh hero's journey like we're all on our own hero's journey of some sort and to really kind of study and understand the principles of what makes a great story helps you extract it out of the person that you're speaking with and also helps you learn how to figure out what that is in your own story and that just comes with practice so listen if i'm sitting across from you know a doctor and they want to talk to me about the microbiome maybe that's not a hero's journey story but maybe how they got interested in that is you know i'm always trying to find some version mini or macro that i can tell that will you know create engagement and for myself and and also for the person that's listening but i've also had the privilege of and these are some of my favorite episodes where i'm sitting down with somebody who you know was really broken in a certain way and then rebuilt their life and became something else entirely and that's a great kind of template for doing a full-blown joseph campbell you know arc of the hero and i think those stories are powerful because when somebody can see that type of transformation and somebody who had it way worse than they have it it raises the you know their their own belief in in themselves and i think you know to really specifically answer your question it's just a practice like i've been doing this for 10 years like i i would be horrified to go back and listen to some of my first episodes so you know i've learned in real time in a public sphere but just like anything else like you have to practice it and figure out also what works for you it's not oh i'm going to follow this person did it and they were successful so i'm going to do it that way it's like what speaks to you what is natural and authentic to who you are and i think the more that you can bring your own intuition and sensibility and honesty into whatever it is that you're trying to share with the world that's going to be the the demarcation that will distinguish you from others i can't find this client info have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases hubspot grow better who do you think are great storytellers like uh are there any people or books that you learn from where you you look at it and you sort of have picked up things from from them sure i mean i think malcolm gladwell is a master storyteller uh we we we had the privilege of just having him in here a couple weeks ago and i mean nobody can tell a story like that guy i mean he can take people off the street and in five minutes you know figure out something absolutely fascinating about them that will become an episode of revisionist history you know and it's a i mean i think he has a talent uh that you know we can all aspire to that probably we can't reach but i think he's fantastic at it i think um adam grant is a phenomenal storyteller i mean some of the authors that are you know working in social psychology right now are are pretty good great at storytelling but those would be the two that that come to mind and you i'm gonna read a quote from your story um and i want you to basically uh take me there and then uh where you came so here's the quote we had four kids we were so broke at one point not long after my book came out we had nothing to go on we ended up going to kauai and living in yurts thinking we may never come back to la and we were going to lose our house so what was that and then how did you get from there to here yeah man that was uh that was rough so it was very disorienting because i had the opportunity to write this book and i got like i mentioned earlier like a decent advance for a first-time author but for kids and the way that publishing advances work they dole it out in increments over you know a good deal of time and then taxes and agent cuts and all of that it turns out to not be that much so the book comes out we're you know shoestringing to be able to pay our bills and a big theme in the book is this idea that when you know and it's my story of transformation that when your heart is true the universe will conspire to support you it's something i i believe it's it's a it's a principle i've seen um uh you know come to play in many people that i know and it's something that i believed was happening in my own life and would continue to happen and when the book came out i decided i'm not renewing my bar membership i'm going to step into this new thing and i don't know what it's going to what kind of opportunities are going to come but i need to be 100 available for them and i was trusting i was like my heart is true something is going to happen we're going to figure this out um but you know i was running a household with a relatively high overhead at the time four kids a mortgage and you know the the problem with that equation is there's no timeline on it and you know my edict has has has borne out to be true over time ten years later but uh it was really rough for quite quite an extended period of time we couldn't pay our mortgage we had cars repossessed i've told this story before but it was so bad at one point um that you know we didn't have enough money to pay for our our garbage collection so they took away our bins we had to put our our garbage bags in the back of this beat up minivan that we had and look for you know kind of uh bins like behind the grocery stores and stuff to like throw our garbage i mean it was pretty humiliating and quite frankly pretty emasculating as somebody who's supposed to be you know head of household and taking care of [ __ ] like i was unable to make sure that my house was in order and so we went through a really rough period of time and it was not clear that we were going to be able to kind of persevere we did get an opportunity a friend of mine who's a high net worth individual had a property on the north shore of kauai he was trying to figure out how to turn it into some kind of community space and he had read my book and had been inspired he said why don't you come out and help me figure out like what i can do to transform this property into something more meaningful than where i live and i don't know why he thought that i would be somebody well suited for that job it's not like i have any kind of experience in that but essentially you know in retrospect looking back like he threw my family a lifeline and so yes we moved to the north shore of kauai it was a operating uh mango farm at the at the at the time and the the kind of um woofers who were working the farm were living in these yurts behind the main um sort of dwelling at the on the property and we moved into these yurts with these young kids who were working the land and spent a couple months where i was trying to help this individual figure out what to do with his property but mainly he was paying me such that we could pay her bills and when we went to kauai we thought there's no way we're going to save our house we haven't been able to pay our mortgage in so long like it's just not possible we may just be here and this is where we're going to live and after a couple of months uh you know of living out there i started to get a creative itch like i had written this book and i was trying to get some energy going around like these ideas that were important to me and i was feeling a little bit of ivan island fever and disconnected and stuff so that's when the impetus to start the podcast happen like i needed to do something creative for myself and and you know i'll always look back on that experience quite romantically because it was it created the perfect storm of events to create this thing that has now you know been successful beyond my wildest imagination and so let's break down the business side of things so you have the content which is like you said the tip of the spear the top of the funnel where people they sort of they discover you they start to like you they start to trust you love you and say oh wow this is content that can really help me but then you have these like really interesting businesses right so you have um you know you have the meal planning business so like i don't know meals.ritual.com or something like that and so you have you have a meal planning business you charge you know i don't know 100 bucks a year or something like that you help people um you know go sort of plant-based in a way that's gonna that's gonna work for them uh you have this thing called the epic five challenge which is uh five i don't know what it is five iron man triathlons or something like that in in five like in five days what is it what is the exact thing for epic five yeah so just to be clear i don't have any financial involvement in in that race but yes so one of the things i did as an athlete was this thing called epic five where jason lester and i did five uh iron distance triathlons on five hawaiian islands the idea was to do it in five days it took us a little bit longer but in the wake of that experience um it's become an annual event that i'm not affiliated with professionally but okay all right so basically it's like mostly the media company um and then it's the meal planning business um talk to us about like how you kind of like you mentioned your mentor friend who helped you kind of structure this and set this up and figure out how to actually build a like a like a full like you know thriving lifestyle going from living in the yurt on the mango farm to like you know you know actualizing this idea um what is that business what's the business brain part of you you know how would you explain that to the next person who maybe they don't have that mentor maybe they they see what you do but can you explain it here and maybe there's out of our audience some people out there who can take that blueprint or that idea and say okay i'm in a totally different vertical or i'm you know i have some differences but i can learn from how he's architected this business sure so first of all that mentor then became my business partner and that's a key piece in all of this because without him i probably would have never gotten out of the gate and he's been my business partner ever since and it's an amazing relationship and what he brought to the equation was not only a sense of possibility but like i said earlier like structure and that structure has always been grounded in real business fundamentals and being patient and and and and growing only incrementally and not getting too excited about new stuff and taking on too much so it's been a slow growth curve but in retrospect we've we i think we've made really good decisions about how we've invested our time and our energy and yes it's now a very diversified business that is fundamentally media oriented but we have a lot of different verticals so yes the podcast is the tip of the spear as i mentioned earlier it's the thing that that drives everything else and it's also the thing that generates the most uh the most income the meal planner does very well for us i love that it's a low-cost entry to something i think can be really transformational in terms of people changing their habits around food so that's a a you know an integral piece in all of this and then there's the books i mentioned finding ultra but we also have um three cookbooks the plant power way the plant power away italia and then my wife wrote a book called this cheese is nuts which is about how to make plant-based cheese so we have the publishing end and uh and she's gone off a good i feel like i've heard that cookbooks could be a bit like books may not books in general may not be but cookbooks specifically might actually be a good business what teach us about that because you know you don't run into too many people you've done this cookbooks are a very good business uh it's it's hit or miss but if you hit they can be massive um they're difficult to put together because beyond just the written words on the page there's photography and there's recipe testing and all of that so there's a lot that goes into creating a great cookbook but they're great businesses and a big reason for that is that if you do hit it they're perennial sellers so they'll sell year after year after year and how does that work so a hit means what you get picked up with like a good brick and mortar distribution or is it mostly direct to consumer like what is a hit what does it look like when you get a hit i think it depends on what your goals and motivations are so our cookbooks we've done with a major publisher avery which is part of random house and we got really nice advances for those books and those books continue to sell and and do well for us um they weren't they're not they weren't neither of them were were new york times bestsellers or anything like that but the real mark of success i think in publishing is whether or not you create something that is perennial so finding ultra for example we just hit the decade mark on that and it continues to sell more and more every single year so even though it wasn't huge out of the gate it continues to find audiences and then it becomes um you know just a revenue stream for you for you quarter after quarter so those are those books but now we have we have two other books that we've self-published called voicing change which are uh coffee table versions of the podcast with excerpts from our favorite guests with amazing photography and essays contributed by myself and some of the guests that really act like keepsakes or marketing tools for the podcast like it's a it's a it's a collectible item these books uh our motivation or our definition of success for these books is very different from the other books because they're not intended to go out and sell to make the new york times best seller list they have a very specific audience in mind and the fact that we created them in-house means that it's a different revenue model as well so we don't need to sell as many of them to do well and i'm really proud of those books we're going to do another one this year and create a box set and also when we work with brands which is a big piece of of our business as well it's great to be able to send them the book and show them that we're executing on a quality level that i think no one else is doing in the podcast space which helps distinguish us from you know the zillions of other podcasts that are out there because it's very crowded right now and sends the message that you know we're we're trying to elevate a certain you know we're all of our content is very elevated and that you know we're operating from a very professional perspective in everything that we're doing so that's the books and then we have sorry go ahead on the books one second so uh i'm fascinated by the books thing i think it's uh really cool i think it's a really cool art my wife is vegan also she has we have maybe i don't know 10 15 really hi and she you know she loves the it's like a coffee table book and a cookbook at the same time like it's gotta have the like premium sort of finish and uh photography it's very aspirational and has a guy who barely you know knows how to use a frying pan and like you know i don't know i eat like i eat like a college kid sometimes it's like i see this it was so different for me so i started getting curious about this cookbook she was buying and this who are these people behind this now are those perennials just because you have a growing audience and so like your audience grows every year and it's like one percent of your audience buys your stuff and you are that's you are the sales as well as the and so that's why they keep climbing or is it kind of like independent in a way like obviously that contributes but like is there a separate engine that lets those continue to grow or is it just your main engine of like my podcast grows therefore one percent of people will go buy the cookbook every year yeah i think it's a little bit of both i mean with finding ultra which is a memoir i think the continued sales of that book are are are really uh due to the growing platform that we've created here the cookbooks are a little bit different um it's of course you know in part because of the platform and we use the platform to you know sort of occasionally uh you know promote the books but i think in tandem with that we've seen um a real mainstreaming of plant-based lifestyle in a way that didn't exist back in 2012 2014 more and more people are interested in this lifestyle and diet which means that those those cookbooks retain relevancy and have you um like have you done have you launched any businesses or products like this that have just flopped like you know the version of the the cookbook that like you were excited about you even maybe liked the product it just didn't work or have you been pretty uh high hit rate with with what you guys have launched outside like you know like in additional products yeah i mean i think you know early on in this process we launched uh uh a couple supplements like a protein powder and i thought maybe like nutraceuticals might be something that i would be interested in doing and i quickly lost interest in that um it was modestly successful but i realized that it was a very crowded marketplace and there were people who were doing really good work in that area and i was more interested in the media and if i was not at the um at the plants like at the manufacturing location overseeing all of this and really being detail oriented around it uh there was too much risk of shenanigans because i was not in control of the manufacturing process and there's a lot of weird stuff that goes on in that world when you're licensing these labs to create something for you and it felt like my risk exposure was too high and i just realized i didn't want to unless i was going to go all in on that it didn't make sense and so we abandoned that we have other you know we sell some swag and some t-shirts and things like that on the website they don't do fantastic but it's nice to have them there so you know not everything is a huge smash success but sometimes some of these smaller verticals still make sense nonetheless right and you're if you were doing a pie chart is it like these the meal planning and the cookbooks and all that stuff that's cool but like in reality if we drew the pie chart is it like podcasts or you know the media side is with the sponsors is ninety percent of it anyways or is it fairly like uh diversity beyond that um i would say the podcast is maybe i don't know i should do a pie chart so i know this better but it's probably you know around uh 80 to 85 percent of it but the other the other revenue generators are public speaking which is growing a lot so we do quite well there and and you know the the the podcast model is an advertising model so that money comes from sponsors but i also have relationships with a handful of sponsors outside of the podcast context where i'm represented as as an athlete for example like with solomon um so that's another kind of way that we um you know grow the business that isn't necessarily directly related to the podcast itself and then we have retreats so we do these covid really sidelined this part of our business but we're getting back to it next spring where my wife and i take groups of people uh to a location in italy and have a week-long experience with food and meditation and running and the su and such stuff like that when we have guests on the pod i find that they typically fall into two buckets and both i um admire there's what i'll call the kind of like expected bucket like on a business oriented podcast which is a person comes on they have a product or a story so far that's like exciting and momentum and you know what's admirable about them is their you know ambition they basically they never stop dreaming bigger and um they see you know no limit and they are chasing that that sort of limitless uh vision where you you walk away from the podcast and you feel like oh man i've been thinking small right and that's a great feeling it's not a negative feeling it's oh wow the the the pie is even bigger than i could have imagined the possibilities are different than what i had been kind of come to accept an example would be a buddies with the founder of uh calm and i remember even very early on when that app it's a meditation app and now it's very very big it's probably a you know one to three billion dollar company but they early on when they could they could barely get an investor to give them a check uh it was like just a couple guys in their apartment there was there really wasn't much to going for it even back then i remember um michael talking about like we're gonna have an island someday like a calm island like you know like coachella like festivals right but instead of craziness like instead of rowdy we're gonna be selling calm as a festival and we're gonna do it on our own island and it's gonna be like disney world for com and like we're gonna build a nike level brand and he was talking about that back then and you know when he said it back then he seemed a little nuts and now you know he says it now and he's a visionary but he's been saying the same thing for like 10 years and so that's an example of the high ambition path uh that i admire and the other one is the person who's uh you know like high contentedness and they're like well um i really love what we're doing i don't know if we'll do more haven't really thought about it um maybe we will but you know here are my principles and you know they're they're admirable and how grounded they are and that they have found you know some version of enough for them and they are not like you know trying to take over the world which part of that spectrum do you lean more towards when it comes to business yeah that's a great question i i i lean more towards the latter um but maybe not all the way on that side i mean i'm certainly not the guy who's dreaming about islands and private jets and things like that people ask me all the time like what's the vision like what you know where do you see yourself in five years and i always feel weird or guilty because i don't have a good answer for that and i and i realized like oh it's just because i don't i don't really think that way like i'm focused on how i can be better today than i was yesterday i'm focused on how to enhance the quality of what i'm sharing with the world and i'm focused on trying to be grateful and content with what i have and not be jealous or envious of what other people who have more than me have because that's just a dangerous place for me as a recovering alcoholic and just as a human being so i am competitive like i'm not averse to looking at the rankings on apple podcast and getting you know frustrated because somebody's ahead of me who i don't think is deserving of it like you know i can be incredibly petty that way but but honestly like for the most part like i'm i'm just so grateful to be in the position that i'm in and i'm not doing this to get to another place like if this is all that it is like it's been a pretty [ __ ] good ride and i'm stoked to be able to wake up every day and come in and talk to amazing people and if i can continue to do this and that's again like all that it is like that's a damn good run right now there are you know creative things that i want to express and they're not about chasing money they're more like uh you know just inspirations that i have like oh it would be cool to do this or can i carve out enough bandwidth so i can explore this other thing that that is interesting to me right now so it's much more of kind of an artist path of of of following my gut and what gets me excited rather than here's a new business because i i think we could ease we could have easily complicated what we're doing right now and created a network and you know started you know having other people create podcasts and and you know building an entity that we could sell to spotify or something like that but that's not really where my heart is or or where my head is so um i don't know if that answers your question but yeah think about it you know um one thing that i always like to talk to different guests that come on about is like you know you live in a different world than me therefore you see different things and you see different problems and opportunities and trends that uh me over here i'm not seeing because i'm just focused on other things and so um i'm curious either you can take it in either direction you can either take it in a trend so like let's say maybe 2012 uh maybe you might have said you know what there's a really passionate community of plant-based uh you know around this plant-based lifestyle and i think this is gonna get bigger i think people are gonna more people are gonna i think this might catch on and more people are going to you know uh wander this way um so it's either a trend you notice that like oh there's a group of people who really care about this or there's a movement happening that i find very interesting but ultra marathons whatever it is um the second option the second thing uh direction is just here's a gap i see so whereas our audience is heavily entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs people who they live to solve problems and you know i like to bring their attention to problems worth solving or you know things that are missing from different parts of the world rather than uh maybe you know the 10 000 to do to-do list app or whatever you could you could go build and so taking it either direction what comes to mind when i either say what trends and movements have you been noticing uh or what gaps um or opportunities do you see in your in your world yeah i mean i think i to answer that question um my head naturally goes to um two polarities young people and people that are getting older so i'm a little bit older than you so my interest is going to be around areas of of longevity and meaning in a way that maybe you know you you're not in a position to really have to entertain in a meaningful way yet um and then with young people it's equally about meaning so what i see happening right now on a macro level is a whole generation of young people who are coming up um into a world and thinking about their professional trajectory in the context of meaning in a way that was not really part of the thought process of my generation being gen x they don't want to just find the best job that's going to pay them the most they want to plug in to the thing that uh feels like it's making a difference in the world in a positive way and i think that's really cool it's easy to make fun of gen z and uh you know a lot of the kind of tropes around you know where young people are at right now but i'm very inspired by that sensibility because it was lacking in you know kind of my my um you know the the on you of the gen x which was to not what was cool was to not care about anything and to be cynical and so you know i'm very refreshed by that um focus that i see in so many young people and i and i think on the other extreme with people that are you know more in my age bracket who have kind of been in the professional world done whatever they're gonna do and are are realizing to some degree or or not like how happy am i how much meaning has this path that i chose for myself given me and whether or not i stay in this path or find something new how can i bring more meaning into my lived experience both professionally and and and socially for the decades to follow and i see shared dna between that young cohort and that older cohort and what i make of that is this um groundswell of interest in happiness contentment and the um the pillars of what it means to pursue a life that will um not just sustain you but really allow you to feel authentically expressed in in who you are i like that uh and if you were um kind of like not if not the so it's not the sort of question like if you were 21 again today what would you go do but sort of like um how would you act on that so you observed this behavioral mindset shift in both let's say the older generation and the younger generation um what do you do with that how would you what is the rich role approach to acting on that insight as a young person yeah if you just as a person with time on there yeah it doesn't matter how old you are just as a person who yeah if you didn't have like a thousand things to do and you weren't already committed to xyz job or project you so you had some freedom and you were interested in that you saw that at that observation what would you do to act on it how would you approach it yeah i mean i think with with young people one thing i always tell young people is to invest in experience and and opt out of the pressures of the rat race to plug right into some kind of career trajectory because there's an undue expectation with young people that they're supposed to know who they are and what they want to do with their lives at an age when their brains are are barely formed and you know i think it's important for young people to go out and have as many experiences as possible before they make a certain particular choice about how they want to live their life because how can you make that choice until you've been exposed to a lot of different things until you've traveled and spent time with all different kinds of people for the older people i think it's about reprogramming you like if you've been on a certain path and trajectory for a very long time we become very calcified around who we think we are and we have to free ourselves from that narrative or that story and begin to build the muscle of connecting with our intuition and starting to bring expression to the things that um that i think innately bring us joy that perhaps we've we've kind of repressed or or put in the rear view mirror because we haven't had the time or the energy or the money or whatever to indulge them and on the subject of indulgence to disabuse people of the idea that it is an indulgence or that it is selfish so you know the the the the path i think for that person is to really start paying attention um to themselves to what gets them excited to things that you know they just find themselves naturally inclined towards and to start to you know water that garden or feed that energy because i think in doing that it kind of leads you on a path towards some form of expression that will ultimately you know bring meaning and and greater fulfillment into your life well i think that's a good place to to close it rich thanks for coming on man i i really appreciate it um give people a shout out where they should find you or subscribe to the podcast where

[Music] all right um let's do this i've got a few things to talk about but first sean let's talk to ben ben had a big night why are we even talking we are now the sideshow we're the openers actually for the main event ben ben made event wilson what's up dude how are you feeling well let's let's let's not even tell them why so here here's the here's the setup sean and i were chilling last night and we get a text from ben and he says hey look who just followed me and it was mr beast and i think it's so for context everyone ben is our producer here ben has a podcast called how to take over the world it's uh it's fairly popular but growing quickly so uh your twitter only has like a thousand or two thousand followers right four thousand four still yeah four thousand so we get this message and you said hey look who uh look who just started following me and it was mr beast and sean and i made fun of you saying like uh you know that's nothing no big deal then you sent a text message to us saying uh been on the phone with them for the past hour and a half and we were like wait what and we don't really know we don't know anything else so yeah of course there's gonna be some stuff here that you can't talk about but what happened yeah so uh i got back from utah with my in-laws on saturday so i was like feeling a little jet lagged i was about to go to bed early getting into bed with my wife and uh i looked down on my phone and i've got a notification says mr beast followed you and my first thought is like oh yeah mr beast followed me like mr underscore beast hey give me my social security number and i'll venmo you five thousand dollars so i literally i saw it and i just put down my phone and uh like keep just like chatting with my wife or whatever and then i pick it up five minutes later and i look at it and i go i actually don't see an underscore i don't i don't see anything wrong with this and i click on it and it's verified and it's mr beast and he just followed me and i was like oh that's weird like you said i only have 4 000 followers like it's not it's not a normal thing for like i just you know pick up mr beast and then i get a dm like two minutes later and uh he's like hey um i listened to your podcast i think it's cool i would love to chat sometime i don't want anything from you i just like want to learn and i was like so i respond i say cool yeah let's uh talk anytime i'm free like anytime you want to talk next week you sound like you're playing it cool but inside what's going on yeah so inside i was like actually even outside i was like my wife is katie like katie katie katie once it starts happening and uh she was like what and i was like mr beast's following me she's like what's a mr beast and i was like no i gotta call someone else that's what i texted you guys because like she doesn't get it i need to talk to someone who gets it katie leave the room like go get me a 12 year old stat who could have a discussion about this katie get your nephew on the line yeah uh she's getting mad at me if i talk about her though once i explained who he was she was very very excited she was very very excited um so uh i uh i messaged him yeah and i'm like trying to play cool like uh oh yeah cool i could i could make time no problem um and uh should i run or crawl to you and then he hits me with the sean and he's like uh how about right now and i'm like sitting there like in my boxers in my bed and i'm like yep i am 100 ready to talk right now uh calm call me and uh so he called me and apparently he does this uh at night he goes for walks and he just calls people who he thinks are interesting and he tries to like download their brains and learn anything that he can uh so uh we talked for like almost two and a half hours uh at the end and he's a very cool dude and i learned a lot of cool stuff well what like well and yeah i mean what did you guys talk about uh we talked about a lot like it was you know it was just like a personal conversation so i'm not gonna share everything that we talked about but um oh i mean what for me the the coolest thing he did was yeah i've i've known for a long time that i need to take my podcast to youtube and i got to ask him like okay so how should i do this and he basically walked me through how he would do it um and how would he do it general game plan uh basically i was saying you know should i do segments should i do uh clips should i um animate it should i do me on the screen and what he said is do the full episodes uh you probably want to edit the scripts a little bit so that it's not quite so casual uh because podcast like you listen to as you're washing the dishes like it doesn't matter that it's not gripping every second of the of the audio but for youtube like it does need to be gripping every second like really needs to pull people second by second so he said you need to edit your script a little bit for video do animations do it highly produced and do the full episodes like 45 minutes to an hour long that was the basic strategy and then he gave me some comps some channels that i should make it similar to and some homework up on what did he want to ask you right because he called you so um you know was he looking for something was he just saying hey tell me about you know i'm walking around i want to hear i've listened to your podcast and i decided i'd like you to say it out loud to me live go like what was he what was he interested in he was laying in bed and he said ben tell me about my heroes yeah and uh uh no he yeah he the funny thing was he didn't really know so we were just like talking about random stuff and he's like i just want to learn from you so i don't know what's up man like that's kind of how we went into it and i was like i don't know what's up with you um and uh so then we just kind of started chatting about random topics i asked him a lot of stuff i he told me a lot of cool stuff that is not public information and and then at the end he was asking me sort of about um like guru is honestly very similar i told you about that finance guy yeah yeah and like wants me to be his guru the background is very similar the background of that is like this person worth hundreds of millions of dollars hollered at ben and said just tell me what mistakes i'm going to make before i make them based off of like historical people so ben's podcast is he basically reads three books on titans of industry and he breaks them down into like a two or three hour podcast so so by in theory ben's an expert a three book expert on a lot of different people and and if you're gonna listen to one go listen to edison i think it's amazing sam what's your favorite one edison to me is by far my favorite uh what's the uh richest uh roth child i like the rothschild one but i do think the edison one is the is the most impactful because it like we all know the outcome of edison the disney one people liked um i didn't like that as much because disney like is not as interesting to me but uh that one's probably the most popular so interestingly i for disney i almost did a follow-up at the end of it because i listened to mr b's interview on joe rogan and the stuff mr beast was saying i was like oh this person is so similar to walt disney that it's almost kind of spooky and maybe i should make uh a podcast just pointing out like a a quick 10 minute one pointing out the similarities between walt disney and mr beast and when he got on the phone he was like i loved the walt disney one that really resonated with me and i was like oh that doesn't matter dude this is why like you you're you're you're pretty under monetized but i think it's gonna catch up soon because i think what's gonna happen and we said this six months ago you make these comments like oh you remind me of walt disney and so if i'm the person who like if i'm mr beast and you said it to me i go really what um what mistake like what am i doing wrong um or like uh i'm thinking about doing x y and z did walt do this and like did it work and did it not work like you're this weird fortune teller type of person and that did he say something like that to you yeah a little bit um a little bit he got into the like well what mistakes should i look out for like what do you think that um like what do you think i need to be wary of there's and like there's a charlie munger quote that's like um tell me where i'm gonna die so i know i never go there right like i'll just make sure never to go there it's kind of that but i'm sure there's also the upside right like it's not just what mistakes but like how did they make their greatness happen i think that's actually more of what people care about how do they make their greatness happen and then kind of draw parallels to my own life of like yeah i am just like edison and the rothschilds and disney after all you know uh it's so similar right i think you know like for mr beast i think the parallels are super easy with walt disney the thing the only time that walt disney slowed down in his career was for like a decade and it was because walt loved to be working on a new thing but a certain point everyone convinced him like oh actually you have this enormous multi-million dollar animation studio now you just need to be working on pumping out more full-length animations and like when he did that the whole thing kind of went downhill and then he goes crazy and he starts obsessing over little toy trains and like really going off the rails but those those model trains then get bigger and bigger and becomes disneyland and that is when he comes out of his funk and starts innovating again and so for mr beast it's just like the don't let anyone convince you that you need to be working on the reasonable thing like you need to follow your unreasonable passions because some somehow great things are going to come out so that's kind of the parallel for context walt disney i can't imagine he was more successful than mr beast was at mr b stage but how big was his business when it when you say things were going were being becoming unsuccessful and he started focusing and what does focusing mean like was he was he the ceo of this company um walt was essentially the ceo of walt disney studios yeah uh and this is basically in the 40s and early 50s um and it was um not huge huge but it was like hundreds to maybe just over a thousand employees is how big wow well disney studios was damn dude well ben i think this was cool as hell i'm so happy for you that that happened these are cool moments along the way and sit kind of like signals that like you're on the right track uh you know sam discovered you i don't know when uh he came on a year ago it was a year ago and you did this awesome there's somebody put a twitter clip up you did some interview and you were like you're like i'm listening to my first million and i hear sam say uh man i found this podcast i love it's called how to take over the world and i thought to myself huh there's another podcast called how to take over the world how cool is that and then you're like oh [ __ ] he's talking about me ben wilson he just said my name and then you know and then we basically then i went down the rabbit hole after sam said it i was like that sounds like really interesting i don't like to read biographies but i think i'd like to listen to two hours and like that's just you know like one commute and i could like know the story of edison i listened to the edison one i got hooked i called you basically right after that i think i dm'd you and called you and i was like hey let's partner like i think your thing is going to blow up come work for us on our podcast and then we will help cross promote your broadcast and like let's take this to the next level and these are the little happenings that happen along the way and now you know mr beast following you know sam and my lead of recognizing your talents for what they are and um and so you know honestly like i think you have a great thing going i'm really happy for you that you know this happened i think it's such a cool thing that happened i think what would be cool and i think this might happen ben here's what i'm going to predict that's going to happen in the next month you're going to record an episode with jimmy mr beast you're going to record an episode with mr beast and i think you if you you should ask him you should text him be like hey next time you want to do a sunday talk can i just record it and we're going to talk about history and i'm going to make it an episode do care and every it's going to be really cool because it's going to be like when elon musk went on um or wouldn't like i forget it was like elon musk went on a couple like like uh he went on wait but why history hardcore history and it's like dude well hardcore history is like bigger than you ben but the even to the mainstream person they were like why is elon musk appearing on this nerdy niche thing and it blows it up and that's what's gonna happen it's gonna be all the young people are gonna be like why is mr beast on this history thing what is going on who is this and i think that's what's going to happen and your life is going to change i predict that's that's this is this is how that story is going to play out you should definitely reach out with some idea you just need to what's what is the idea of how he could join you on the thing and like just get that one thing right and it'll be like an inflection point for for you and what you do well it should be it should be why mr beast is the new walt disney and you're going to be like hey i'm going to tell you i'm going to jimmy uh his name's jimmy right i'm going to tell you why how you are just like walt disney but i'm going to do it in front of everyone and you can ask me questions and i'll explain to you why uh that's that's why i think you are just like him i think that'll be really cool i think what i would want to do is if he would let me like go down to north carolina and like interview his parents interview his friends and like actually kind of make like a semi-documentary audio documentary out of it the making of mr beast that would be sick and also you could it could be like this is the part one of may of hopefully many parts to come and i'm gonna do this you know i can i can kind of document your whole whole thing how this turns out but you're only 20 what is he 25 26 years old something like that it's like you know this is this is part one you know what's funny part one i was talking to him and uh i was talking about like just look at the smile on your face bro this is like you know wow i have never seen this sort of deep happiness inside you this is amazing so i i was talking about like yeah these guys call me up and think i'm their guru and so like i'm i might do like a consulting business off of it um like coaching type of thing because peop there seems to be a market for that and he was like oh yeah i could see that that seems like something i would have gone for when i was younger and i was like when you were younger you're 24 years old like how much time is there of when you were younger he's like i used to feel just like that yesterday he's like yeah when i was younger you're like i have a child seven years older than you and i have a child all right i'll be uh that's funny he just big dogged you in a very nice way yeah he did did you a favor he he kind of like [ __ ] on you in the most gentle way possible in a way that's helpful to you yes exactly well congratulations that's cool all right i'm excited to see what's going to happen um all right sean i have what else we got i've got a few interesting things for you let me tell you the first interesting thing that i'm doing in my life and kind of an interesting business so i'm on this app called intro are you using intro i don't use it no but uh let's explain what it is it's basically like you call an expert for an hour and you pay for the time and you could do like a 15 or 30 minute call with them yeah that's all it is it's that and that's not the point of the story but that's like that's all it is it's just you pay money to talk to people it's consulting and my buddy started it so he asked me to do it so i said yeah fine i'll sign up whatever so when you and i were in miami this man and woman this husband and wife came up to me and like started talking to me about hypnotherapy because they knew that i was uh afraid to fly i i've got like i have a pretty hardcore claustrophobic thing i don't take subways i don't fly and i also have an addictive personality and i love sugar and so they like knew that and they were trying to pitch me and they on like using their services and they kept emailing me and i just i ignore everyone i don't reply to email really and eventually they book a intro call with me and i charge like i put it at like two grand an hour and they're like hey you never answer our emails and and to be honest when i met them i did you know like you we do the nice thing when meet people oh yeah you know this sounds great like you know maybe i'll do it sometime like you're just trying to be polite and i just find a time yeah let's find a time and let's run away from potentially talking to each other yeah and they booked a call with me and they go you said you're gonna do it we can't get you down so we're just gonna pay you money right now and we're going to sit down and do a hypno a hip uh what's it called hip what do you call it hypnosis i guess a hypnosis session and i'm like okay i don't know what that what that's about but i i do it and it kind of has changed my like the game for me and so what yes and i'll explain to you what but uh i keep getting the words screwed up hypnotherapy what is it called hypnosis uh they uh this woman so she has an app her name is grace i think getgrace.com is like her app and then i don't know i think like grace.tv if you go to getgrace.com i'm sure you'll see all about her her name is grace and she told me she's like look here's the deal a handful of executives pay me a million dollars a year to do to be their personal hypnotist i'm not gonna pay you that or i'm not gonna charge you that but if you like it you have to tell people about it i said whatever fine but i'm not paying you a million dollars she's like that's fine but you just get let me give you five sessions and if it changes you let me know if you want to talk about it and so i do this do this thing it's totally worked so basically what it is is you know how you do uh breath work and meditation you just like kind of like sit down and get quiet and like you hear like a voice in your head like it's maybe your headphones it's andy from headspace and he says like all right imagine like the sun is pouring on your mind or on your brain and it's leaking down to your body and causing you to like relax and you're filling with like relaxation whatever you basically do that but then she talks to you while you're in that state you know that meditative state and she says things like you know imagine yourself on a beach in your safe space and imagine like there's four-year-old you and you're explaining to him how you're trying to overcome like you know the sugar addiction or whatever the thing you're trying to overcome and so uh and tell me what you say to that person so you're basically just like talk you're getting spoken to and you're sometimes speaking back in a meditative state not like that interesting when i did it i was like oh i thought i was gonna be in a trance but for some reason this has been wildly effective i think it could be placebo i think it could not be but i don't care i haven't had sugar in like three weeks since i started this and i like am i kind of an addict with that stuff and it's like to the point where i get sick if i think about it it's been crazy fascinating and she gets these she gets all these people to pay her a million dollars a year is that is that real though who's who's paying her does she does she name names who's paying her a million dollars a year that sounds a little far-fetched it does sound a bit far-fet fetched on her website is the founder of clearco uh clearco what are they called their they're called like clear banker or something yeah they were uh that guy is uh one of her testimonials and then she told me other people who uh i actually don't know if i'm allowed to say who those other people are oh yeah so that's great her website yeah well her website is great grace gracesmithtv.com and on there you could see testimonials from people so could it she be like kind of pulling my leg yeah i mean i didn't like look at her financials yes 100 but i don't know who i mean would someone lie about that like it looks way different for some reason i imagine her to be like 70 but she's not she's very young so grace smith is the world's leading hypnotherapist it is a seven figure investment to work with grace uh wow that's amazing you can work with her team for less or download the grace app for free okay grace app for free that sounds promising all right so the uh the founder of clearbank wow she's been on uh you know whatever something's tv show jimmy kimmel but it's not it's called the noit contenilo gentilly it's the brazilian version it's the brazilian version of jimmy kimmel yeah so okay so yours was around sugar or was around for your sugar and we're gonna we're gonna address the the flying thing later but i was gonna try and do sugar and uh it's actually been effective i'm i'm shocked to say it's been effective that's kind of crazy um i like it and it makes me want to do it which i think is probably you know pretty common she told me to tell you that you can do it for free too if you want oh okay great how do i get over my what do i even have i don't have as much yeah the problem is is that you're like emotionally healthy so i like i don't know if you have issues um get over this happiness thing i got every day yeah so i don't know if like it's gonna impact you i don't know like if you have any diet yeah it could be food it could be food related like you know do i really want that cheese pizza maybe i'll just never eat a cheese pizza again after i talk to grace that could be kind of nice it's it's just kind of interesting but it could be a thing where it's like man i gotta meet with this woman every week and like if i tell her that i ate sugar i'm to feel like an idiot so i mean that could be it i i don't know what it is but it's kind of interesting i started using that my body tutor after you had mentioned it on the podcast so did you really they definitely had a bump i signed up i paid for it so i was like all right let's try this out it's legit right now for multiple weeks it's super legit i mean it's like there's no like hocus pocus it's like just straight up here's a kind of like a coach who's a nutritionist who's like gonna really help you so i have this woman haley helping me i don't know if she's the most same one you have i have heather okay so um i don't know about heather but haley's amazing and so uh and a lot of it's just like the basic psychology of accountability right like i tell her i'm gonna do something and i take a photo of every meal and i have to think to myself am i gonna either a be a big fat liar and just not take a picture of this like you know bag of cheez-its that i'm about to eat or am i gonna take a picture of it and be like yeah i know i told you i was going to eat good and then i just ate bad even though clearly i could have just not you know not eaten bad and so it's helped so much to clear up like you know just like i don't know let's call it 30 or 40 of just random [ __ ] mistakes that i would have been making plus then there's the strategy like okay she gave me this i'll share an exam specific example so like she told me this thing she goes all right uh i i snapped a picture of a meal i ate she goes like whoa big meal and i'm like yeah yeah you know whatever she's got you know her job is to kind of judge my meals right okay fair and she's like do me a favor before you eat i want you to just on a scale of one to five just take take note just like at the beginning here i'm not gonna change anything in your diet but just observe how hungry were you when you started the meal like if one is absolutely starving and five is absolutely stuffed like were you starving when you when you decided to eat or were you like a two or three on the hunger scale and then when you were done were you like um so stuffed i need a nap or are you like you know okay i'm full i'm done and she's like don't change anything just like give yourself a number before and after after every meal so i started doing it and she's like i was like so what do i want like you know start at a two and end at a four she's like no you kind of want to start at a three and end at a three like you know you basically want to be like okay it's been about three hours i think i'll like i'll eat now i think i could eat i don't have to eat but i could i could definitely eat right now because you're creating like patterns and being consistent and when i'm done eating it's like i don't stop eating when i can't physically eat anymore i stop eating because like cool like i've had enough of my meal and i can move on i know that there's gonna be more food in a couple hours i don't need to like you know stuff myself to the brim here and so literally these like very small like nuances so i'd notice oh man i really do tend to eat bad when i get to a one because then i'm just like i'm redlining i gotta i just like my decision making is very poor there so i'm like normally if i like eat at a two and i finish at a three i'm like very proud of like those all those meals so little things like that or you know certain like like hey give me i was like yo give me a grocery list i'm going to whole foods just give me a grocery list and i'm just going to buy only that [ __ ] so i only have that to eat at home like you know let's make this simple and so she gave me like an exact grocery list i went and bought all that stuff i was like oh this is great so it's an amazing service yeah my my coach was like anytime you want a snack because i would like snack a lot she was like get a baked potato put it a paper towel over it and rinse the bake get it wet and just put it in the microwave for five minutes and just eat that and i started eating that i'm like oh this is delicious this tastes wonderful and it's only 150 calories so like i was like what the [ __ ] is a sweet potato i didn't know what a sweet potato was you know what i mean it's like that's what you call your girlfriend when you're in high school it's like dave chappelle when they do switching spouses when the black guy goes with the white family and he goes what the [ __ ] is a parsnip like he doesn't know what a parsnip is it's like i don't know what a [ __ ] sweet potato is [Laughter] who's renee zell wisher that's what he says yeah so anyway it's been a good service i like my body tour it's good me too me too this is not an ad we're not paid to do it i genuinely like the product and it's helping me also it's like 700 a month and i don't want to spend that anymore but i said the only way i'm quitting is when i'm here it's like 200 250. i do the thing where they call you every single day okay so they call me they call me every morning and i can't cheat because my wife and fa and like family knows that i'm doing it and they're like oh you're going to tell heather that you just ate that i'm like well that was the biggest thing i had to make a decision am i is this 100 honesty or is this 90 honesty or 60 honesty like you know there are levels to this whole honesty thing and so i was like all right i decided if i'm gonna spend this money i gotta do 100 honesty i don't know this person i've never met this person like she's gonna be my little confidant of every single thing i eat in the exact thing like yeah i i did just put ranch on my potato like yeah that that happened you know like i can't explain it i just did it and so i'm like i gotta take the actual photo of the actual thing every single time no matter what and i think that also the commitment to actually doing it right is what actually makes you get a good result from things um do you want me to keep going you want to do another one let me do another one yeah let's go all right have you heard of aviator nation no all right so this is this week's billy of the week so basically um have you heard of um tom shoes remember tom shoes like give one of course buy one give one type of thing you know like the hipster shoes well anyway the guy who started it his name was blake by the way you go to africa are we is everybody just running around to tell them shoes they better be at this point yeah at this point yeah 20 years time yeah that's for sure time shoes better be like the official shoe of like south africa they gotta everyone should have a pair of time shoes um so her name is uh paige how do you say their last name mikowski uh blake and so anyway um so her this woman paige and her brother is blake the guy started tom's they got kind of popular and they got seed money because they were on like this thing called uh you probably knew all about this the amazing raise um and so they like did that and got a little bit of seed money whatever so he starts toms the same day she starts a different company called aviator nation now you are not in the target demographic of aviator nation it's mostly women particularly like young like high school and i think middle school girls like it's like a status symbol a little bit but basically she uh uh taught herself how to sew just like on youtube and she started going to like fairs like venice beach uh flea markets and things like that and she would sew like these interesting stripes on like old vintage sweatshirts like you know nothing like breathtaking but kind of cool and like she would be making like five or 10k a day every once in a while when she would go and it was kind of working and she bootstrapped this business to the point of 16 years later um she owns 100 of the company in 2020 it did 70 million in revenue 2021 110 million in revenue 2022 it's going to double again so it's going to be north of 200 in revenue and last year she paid herself a 50 million dollar dividend check and she's buying a lot of she's yeah she's buying a lot of real estate with it and in this uh article i read forbes was like we estimated that she's worth around 350 million dollars but she said the number is at least double that and she recently acquired her ninth property a 15 million dollar lakeside house in austin and she has other homes in malibu venice beach marina del rey and ask in a aspen ski chalet and uh she says that if if she didn't subscribe to my first million none of this would have happened that is [ __ ] crazy dude yeah she said she reads the milk road every day yeah she subscribes and shares with friends like unbelievable yeah what a sweetheart and uh have you have you ever heard of this business i've never heard about this until forbes did an article on it no and this i'm i don't know why but i'm almost mad i don't even know what i'm mad at but i'm just like this because you go to the website you go to the website and this literally could be like someone's school project this could be like an aliexpress demo site this could be and i don't i don't mean that to to kind of [ __ ] on it but i'm like what am i looking at this is basically like a shirt with four stripes on it it's like uh you know like a sweater with a lightning bolt it's like a dude wearing black shorts with a yellow stripe on the side and the short oh wow the shorts are 168 dollars yeah so and i forgot to add that that's like the shtick which is it's uh like sweatpants are 160 so like the items of clothing are luxury brand yeah a little bit short of luxury but like basically my friend joe told me that his uh kids wear it or they always like are wanting it because they'll see girls in school wearing it and it's like 150 dollars for a pair of sweatpants and so this is a mystery box for me like how do you do this how do you make something just like arbitrarily cool and in demand when it seems like there are a trillion you know like alternatives to this and like i kind of get it when it's like established brands it's like oh yeah well you know louis vuitton or whatever they have this like history of like being seen as valuable so therefore people will continue saying it valuable this is just like some woman at her dining table was like no you know what three stripes on the hoodie eight hundred dollars this plan will work and like somehow it did i don't under explain this so like makes my head hurt listen in that book what's peter thiel's book zero to one he talks about like he's like there's like basically like these i don't remember the words he used but he said like there's like a moat or like the truth uh like you have to know something that no one else knows and basically you have to like figure out some a secret some type of like technology that others haven't figured out but he goes and peter thiel is like this kind of like autistic-y like genius and he's like the fifth one is branding which i don't know anything about that i don't know about cool but i know that that's like important that's kind of like what he says in the book he's like branding is like a moat but like you know i don't know anything about moats i i just do technology and i think that i've been chatting with a remember how we had sophia omarosa on the on the on the pod she's the woman who started nasty gal she's got all these other new projects going on and like a woman like her just everything she does to me is just like cool it just looks well when i met when we when we met her i was like oh yeah like whatever you are selling i'm buying like uh dig your vibe you seem awesome like you're wearing like six rings right now i don't even own one i feel like i should own six now like i don't know what's happening but like i am drawn to your lifestyle your charisma or whatever and i think that's like the you know whatever like you know that works for nasty gal i think it works for like goop and [ __ ] like that where it's like there's just something about certain taste makers and trendsetters where you're like exactly all right i just want to like i just want to drink whatever you're drinking well if you google this woman paige um she kind of has that vibe she's like the jessica simpson version of nasty gal like maybe a little bit like maybe like a little bit less like edgy but like still cool uh right you know like uh like just a little bit more like uh she always looks like she just got back from coachella yeah oh you just got back yeah like she's not gonna do coke with you but like she'll have like really good peach iced tea but it's still like cool and like you always like you're like oh what the hell what the [ __ ] is this hibiscus stuff like that type of the vibe and uh anyway i like her i love this woman paige i have been reading all about her this company is really really cool and you're in the you're in the ecomm space a bunch of our friends are in the ecom space and it's really hard right now and i've read about this woman and i was like oh well she sure makes it look kind of easy it's kind of interesting exactly i think that's why i have such a big reaction to it because i'm an ecommerce i'm just like how how the oh how do you do this you know you ramped up to 200 million in sales with like the most competitive common category like shirts oh no yeah okay what makes your shirts good they're just cool you know i'm like yeah yeah but that doesn't count for 100 million and it's like actually it can if you really are cool enough and you build that grassroots thing what i want to learn and i don't know if there's a way to even like figure out this backstory without doing a bunch of work but like the there is something to like the foundation of cool right so like um how do you build a frame a foundation or like a ladder that will that will like you know started it sounds like she went to festivals and she's in the for the first store was in haiti ashbury and in san francisco and it's like with the right group of people you start getting going and then it kind of like spreads from there and i've never understood that when it comes to fashion i never understood but her brother has that too so if you google blake myoski and you see like his house like he's got like a vintage uh like a vintage like toyota land cruiser truck with like a golden retriever and like a cool like pennington pendleton whatever it's called blanket like laying over the hood and like skis on top of the truck in front of their malibu like even though it's like you know they're just wealthy so it's maybe it's easy like have all that cool [ __ ] there is like a sense of style uh that he's just always had i i think part of the cool thing is you just you're just good looking to be honest i think that's definitely like get to the root of it right i mean like brad pitt could wear anything and then i could wear the same clothing it's just like he just looks better he's just better looking i mean of course like he's cooler but there is a few other things i think that that are a little bit more uh learnable and and replicable when it comes to that but these people definitely have it it reminds me uh so yesterday i was talking to my mom and my mom's in town or my mom was like visiting my house and uh i started doing this thing i did a podcast with my mom where i was like i really want to hear my mom's story like uh because we all talk to our moms but we don't like really talk it's like surface level stuff or it's all about the kid and you know moms are great because they're like you know they're all about you but like how often do you really sit down and ask them questions about like them and they're how they grew up and what made them them so i recorded this podcast with my mom because you know parents are getting older and i just always wanted to have it it was amazing and one of the things she had told me i don't know if i shared the story on the podcast before but she had told me like her trip to america like how she got here and like um and it wasn't hardship like um it wasn't hardship like oh my god we we were smuggled in and boats and like we had to like you know walk through the rio grande with just our nose above the water like it wasn't hard like that it was hard in the way that's like very relatable in that just unknown you just don't know what you don't know and then you're in a situation and there's nobody to help you and so she talked about like she got on the plane and like uh she saw the seat belt they're like fashion seatbelt ma'am and she's like you know like a plane seat belt is not like any other seat belt you've ever seen and i don't know how she was like and she's just like clacking it together over and over again and she just like goes in and like she was so happy like oh my god like thing number one done like i could do this and then she was like all right i'm flying to america like i don't want to miss my stop because she'd only ever been on a train so she's like wide awake for like 16 hours of a flight being like when are they gonna announce like the america stop and i need to get off this this plane and like she didn't know that a plane just like goes to one place and that's it and there was like so many things like when she got to the place that she got to jfk or something like that she needed to transfer to pittsburgh she just didn't know she was like i think i'm in america like i didn't really know beyond that like i have to get to pittsburgh what is a pittsburgh and she's like um she was like 20 at the time and she put like her 20 is like today's like seven-year-old like because she had never been to a restaurant she couldn't speak english she um like she told me once she's like yeah right before i went to america she told me that yesterday she goes i went as like our school thing we went to a restaurant and i'd never eaten outside of my house and so i was like oh okay and she's like there was like a fork and knife on the table and i didn't know like i knew what they were but i didn't know how you hold them and she's like i'm looking around and everybody's doing it so fast and i'm like okay what what are they doing with their like how do they pick this up like this and she's like i basically didn't eat i paid for the most expensive meal of my life and i didn't know how to get the food into my mouth i was so embarrassed to use my hands i just didn't do it and so i was hearing these stories and i was like we all have these moments where like the world seems too mysterious for us like this is like i don't know what this this black box is like completely foreign to me and i don't know how to operate it and like her trip to america had like five of these like she was talking about like when she finally got off the plane and the uh american guy had met her and it was like okay you clearly look like completely panicked he was like do you know like where you're going like do you have a family to come pick you up and she's like no like why did you have somebody's phone number would she go to college or something uh she was even younger she was actually she was 17 she was she started high school three days later in america when she came and so she she came because if you come right before your 18th birthday you're not an adult yet so you have to do way less paperwork so her dad like put her on a plane at 17 was like go you're like you're about to turn 18 in three days like you need to get over there and so her brother was here but uh you know like she didn't know how to get to his house she didn't know like all the steps it takes to get there so this guy was like do you have her phone number his phone number and she was like yeah yeah look i have a phone number and he's like okay let's go to this pay phone and he's like and she was like i don't know what this is like i don't know what this device is and i don't have money and i don't know how to do this so he pay he puts quarters in and he calls and then she's like she talks to her brother and brother's like whoa you're here like i didn't even know you're coming like okay stay exactly where you are don't move i will go to the airport and i'll find you at the at the phone booth do not move like one step and she's like okay and she's like the guy who had helped me like set up the phone call he had to go catch his next flight or he was she speak english she could like read english but she couldn't speak it she'd never practice speaking so she like you know was here and she's like oh [ __ ] and so she was like she was like i'll never forget she's like i was trying to like i was done with the phone call but i didn't understand how to hang up the phone i couldn't like i couldn't figure out how to get the pay phone back like what was the original starting point i didn't remember and she's like i remember i just like left it hanging like the cord hanging the phone was swinging i like walked away and i was so scared like the police are gonna get me for what i just did and she's like everything was so new like you know on the way home we stopped at a 7-11 and i was like this is a palace like look at how much stuff is here look how bright these lights are i've never seen lights so bright in my life and like you know all every little thing was so amazing and so i say this for two reasons one is if you haven't done like the kind of like podcast with your mom go do it it's amazing even if you don't have a podcast you don't need to publish it well just like few people are gonna have as good of a story as that i don't know like i feel like everybody's got a story when you start to dig in and then for my mom it was almost like she didn't think about this stuff like it was only like halfway through when i got to like the interesting bit because it was all like just so buried in her head you know she what does she remember from 40 years ago but then she did remember once i got like on the right trail uh but the other thing is like when i hear the story about this woman who you know just put stripes on a t-shirt and like grows it like crazy and i'm saying that kind of like to me it looks so simple but obviously there's more to it i just don't know what the more to it is and i'm sure there's people who listen to this podcast and they hear these things i hear us talk about many things and they're like i feel like you guys say it like it's so obvious but it's like completely not obvious to me it's like where do how do i hang up the pay phone like how do i connect the the seat belt um like i don't know that's okay like there is that everybody's got that black box and then like later you look back and you laugh and you're like yeah so can't believe it you you and i you're i i don't you're not an immigrant but but you and most all of my friends and i think you as well all of our friends are either immigrants or kids of immigrants um i i feel like i'm like the only like not not one of those that that i'm i'm close with my my wife is that my family's that you're that and um what you what you notice talking to these people and a lot of you and i are friends with a lot of immigrant entrepreneurs or children of immigrants and their entrepreneurs and you you like i often wonder i'm like how are these people succeeding when there's it's they're coming from a place where things are much harder you know like i i i didn't learn how to i didn't have to learn how to you know use a pay phone i just knew and you hear the story about your mom and you're like well that's why they succeed so well because well she had to learn how to use a fork like that's like i imagine like pretty humiliating and you're frightened you're frightened you get on a plane to like you know it sounds like to her it'd be as as if you sent me to uh the moon you know what i mean you're like what the hell like i don't know i don't know anything and it's like well okay i like landed it i found my brother somehow like what's the worst that can happen they're going to send me back to this play i mean like you know it can't be that bad uh failing failing at least and so when you talk about people who are like well i don't know what to do it's like yeah but like it's kind of straightforward you just can't really be afraid to do it because like the worst that's going to happen is not that bad like you know what i mean if this woman from india can come knowing nothing and she ends with like this big family and she's your parents are pretty successful like it can work out if you just kind of take a little bit of risk it's pretty inspiring our software is the worst have you heard of hubspot see most crms are a cobble together mess but hubspot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous i think i love our new crm our software is the best hubspot grow better yeah i think that's where two common immigrant traits come from number one like a willingness to grind it out in a way that's like nothing is beneath me you know like okay like she was like you know two weeks later i had a job as a waitress like the person who had never been to a restaurant now was hired as a waitress in america and couldn't speak english and she's like my brother was like how the hell did you get a job and she's like i don't know you said we needed a job and so i just kept going to different places every like hour i just went to a different place to interview and this one liked me and they just gave me the job and like okay i have to go at like four in the morning before school and like i'm gonna you know help clean the stuff and then i'm gonna go at night and like that's what i'll do and so that you get this like grit side but then you also get the like kind of like why are immigrants so cheap it's because like they've operated with no safety net before and so now when they have some resources they're like don't squander them we remember what it was like to have no resources with no back no net to catch you if you fall and so like yeah don't like spend too much even once like a lot of immigrant parents end up in america like they end up getting rich but they still live very cheaply and i think it's because like if you've lived it's like you know somebody who's like i don't know they like grew up in the woods and it's like oh why do you sleep on the floor still it's like i just do okay like don't ask me too many questions it's like i know i have a bed now but like i don't need i don't need the bed i don't i don't want to use that right now because i feel like you know anything could happen right now and so well a lot of my same fear and a lot of my friends so my mother-in-law's from haiti and i would talk to her so she did i tell you how she started this pillow business i don't know how big it is exactly but i imagine mid six figures and um she took she asked me to to take drive me two hours to the airport and i was like why she's like i want to ask you how shopify works i think i want to create an online store where i sell these pillows and i'm like all right whatever i'll explain to you how to do it but i like people ask me this all the time they never follow up and they never do anything and so she calls me six weeks later she's like alright i got my first sale now what it's like oh my god and i was talking to her and the way that they would describe it you know my in-law my in-laws as well as my other other immigrant friends it's kind of like what's interesting is when you take like these immigrants and you put them in america where there's like a pretty strict rules and laws like and like mostly the government can't take things from you and like your stuff is mostly protected it's like well this is easy this is not easy mode like like we all know we all know the rules and we know that people are mostly all gonna follow the rules like this is easy this is just a board game like you just gotta play it and uh and so i'm always inspired hanging out with those types of people yeah for sure me too uh you said something just now which is like i think is an important uh little thing which was i tell people the stuff all the time and like very few take action like most people just don't do anything with this i've been kind of i've been admiring there's been a bunch of people who have built cool [ __ ] for us that like i just want to call out is kind of awesome and i don't know where it leads and i like that they did it knowing not where it leads but something good is going to happen i'll give you give you a couple examples somebody created this thing i don't know if you saw it they put it on product hunt it's like the mfm ideas system i i wish i knew the link off top of my head but if you go to production you search my first million um basically he went and indexed like i don't know 30 or 40 percent of all of the different ideas we've said on this podcast where we're like oh mailchimp but for inside your company because you need to write internal newsletters blah blah blah and so they'll take that idea he time stamped it and so you can go to the website and it will be you'll just be like give me an idea and it'll give you an idea and then it says listen to it and you click it and it opens up in spotify or whatever some player like exactly where we talked about that idea and i was like wow this is so awesome for us but also for anybody who's a fan of the podcast um and immediately i was like drawn to this person and and it's such a it's such a hack to stand out just by like doing a useful thing and there's so much energy that gets spent like reading books listening to podcasts like ask asking people for advice you know and it's like dude you know instead spend actually like a one-third of the time and actually like build something or make something that's like kind of interesting uh that will get you so much further there's another guy who built this thing called writelikeshawn.com have you seen this that was really good it was great this guy created this thing he trained gpt3 like like the ai model or whatever to on a bunch of my twitter threads and he goes oh yeah i trained this ai to write like you so watch you can just type in any topic and it'll spit out a twitter thread and i was like okay yeah i did it it was awesome it was great it's actually awesome this guy someone put it in there um let me let me find it he put in i'm gonna pull this up pretty amazing how the uh the the language like it is it is like you i i put something in there and like the cadence sounded exactly like you so uh okay so this person uh where's the one somebody wrote how to pick up girls or whatever or somebody wrote how to be happy and then it goes you don't find happiness you create it most people go through life searching for happiness they think that when they find the right job right relationship right house they'll finally be happy but the truth is happiness comes from within here's how you create it yourself number one do something that makes you happy every day it doesn't have to be big it can be small like this is a [ __ ] computer that's writing a very realistic you know looking thing uh here's another one um why we don't do public math right somebody's a fan of the podcast he goes we don't do public math think about it when's the last time you did math in public i mean really did math addition subtraction multiplication not mental math but using your fingers a calculator or a piece of paper when's the last time you saw someone do math in public it's almost like we're ashamed of it we don't want people to see a struggle at math we think they'll think we're stupid but the truth is math is hard and it's normal to struggle with it so let's start doing public math like it like changes our whole perspective by the end let's try practice public math period together how does how did how did how can i make one of those because i would like to do that for my stuff and just still write emails for me so what do you do you just like tell gpthree to read all of your tweets and it gets to you yeah we should just get this guy so this guy uh adil pickle is his name is his like twitter handle i told him because i i put it in my newsletter i was like check this out this is awesome and it like crashed his site and he ran up a thousand dollar bill before it crashed the site he's like ah i know my side project i was like dude i'll like i'll pay your bill just let me own the thing and i'll pay your bill like it's my it's right like sean i'll buy it off you and then you don't have to worry about this stuff um and so because i i think it'd be cool to like like i love uh john steinbeck um i've been reading it you know you you don't even know who that is dude famous american author whatever a classic american author like you know like the he's like from the crew that wrote like uh catcher in the ride that type of crap i would love to like write my marketing emails like those guys and i think it'd be cool if i could if i could figure out how to like teach gpd3 what um you want to go to a different cry into the background i don't know if you could hear it that's all right what topics you want to go to um well there is a couple others on this like gpt3 thing yeah like um so basically like this the ai has gotten really really good at really specific things like i don't know have you played with dolly that's that yeah that is the craziest [ __ ] on earth that is way crazier than gbt three it's the picture version of this you just type in any concept it's like um sampar surfing while smoking a cigarette and it'll generate like 12 pictures like ai illustrates sampar on a surfboard smoking a cigarette it'll give you a bunch of variations dude i told it to do wild [ __ ] i said do real-life grown-up cartman and bart simpson and it made a real life like a it looked like a photo a photograph of what a grown-up cartman from south park a cartoon looked like it was crazy it is so impressive this is like the demo version it's not even the real version i'm going to start doing a thing um there's this company i want to invest in that does this with voices and so uh basically he sent me a clip of um of gary vee reading the milk road so it was like you know it goes good morning you know is like the garyvee voice it read the thing and it sounds exactly like garyvee and then he's like here's jordan peterson doing it here's joe rogan doing it here's garyvee doing it and he's like if you give me like 16 hours of like your podcast audio data like i'll just i can make your voice like a synthetic voice so then you could like you could just type something and um it'll do it'll record the audio for you the way you talk and i was like what in the world is going on so this stuff is so amazing to me it's really captured by fascination and it's just the beginning like this is gonna get so much better and has all kinds of crazy implications like hey you're not gonna know what's real and what's fake like cause fake and real are gonna be like indistinguishable like like a deep fake video or like a photoshopped photo but for everything for voices for videos for drawings for whatever uh twitter threads like it's not unreasonable that like most of the content you read on the internet is just gonna be written by computers dude like you're gonna go on twitter it's just gonna be auto-generated content from brands and and and people that are you know just plugging it into the ai and ai's spitting out good content for us all to consume like we may not have hollywood at some point it'll just be like computers making movies and the rest of us just like you know wally what's that movie where they're like fat people sitting in wheelchairs and just like sucking down slurpees and watching stuff it'll just be that because it's like oh we don't need to do the work to make stuff anymore so the computers make awesome movies we just watch them dude let me let me tell you a quick story as we kind of wrap up real quick about you know how like you know it's not for a little while it's been not cool to live in a city lately and it's been cool to live in like uh less popular places like in portland austin that type of thing last night i went to a wedding i went it was my wife's buddy's wedding so they weren't like you know my friend they weren't like what i thought were like you know our startup eating early friends and i sat at this table and listened to my table i didn't know who any people were they were we just started chit chatting the the person next to me started a business that had raised uh 30 million dollars at a star and these all these people are about 28 years old had raised like 30 million dollars the person next to them had a company that in two years hired 300 people the person next to them had a startup that they sold for 140 million dollars the person next to them had a vc fund that had a billion dollars raised and they this person graduated college in 09 so however old you are 33 with that and then the person next to them was um a partner at one of the biggest management consulting firms and so it's like mostly like and then there's some poor like english teacher in the middle who's just like what am i what is this come on come on do it here why i'm the one doing real work out here so no one was douchey at all so the reason why i even knew that was because they like had seen sarah post about me and they're like oh you do the podcast about startups i was like oh yeah okay so you must be in startups too yeah i work at this company oh what do you do there oh i actually started it so like they're trying to they're being cool about it so um it it it was pretty inspiring to be around these people i'm used to like you know sometimes being like a big shot sometimes amongst my my like non-entrepreneurial friend group and i go around these people and i'm like oh my god like this is like incredibly motivating i actually think that there's a world where it's a little unhealthy because uh you're like you know like this money [ __ ] doesn't actually matter that much but it's so it's kind of [ __ ] that i'm like comparing myself to others but it's incredibly incredibly motivating and that's something that i miss about san francisco uh and we had that for a little while yeah that is that was the best part about san francisco by far like people like how san francisco it's like oh well the city is basically gotham city uh you know it's cold it's not actually like warm california weather uh you know it's super expensive it's you know all these things um but the upside is like you know if you want to hang out with some of the most ambitious interesting people who like look at the world a little differently and are kind of crazy enough to go pursue it you're just going to keep bumping into them like everywhere you go regardless what you're doing and sure enough your brain will start to change to be more like them dude what's funny is i feel like our friends weren't even ambitious like you know like jack smith is not an ambitious person he just like works on interesting things and just so happens that they become huge money making operations or like we have a few friends that are ambitious but we have a bunch of friends it's just like i don't think jack i think is more of an outlier jackie is more like just like curious and mischievous more than he is ambitious but i don't think most people are like jack i think jack's a bit of an outlier i don't consider myself to be ambitious do you consider yourself to be ambitious you you are ambitious yes you are i don't consider a lot of our friends i'm just like we just like doing interesting things and it just so happens that the output is yeah but yours is like jax is like i like doing interesting things as in like he'll build a ergonomic chair in his garage to like see what that's like your version is like i like just doing interesting things that are highly profitable and like there's a caveat there's like an important caveat to your like you're not like just reading novels from like you know uh 18th century you're like okay how do i you know spin up this thing that's gonna get to six figures in revenue very quickly right like that's that's your version of what's interesting what's interesting to you is kind of the the hook right so like what's interesting to people like okay ferkan i would say is very ambitious he's not very money-minded right ambition is not money it's like but he's like super interested in new tech and so you know our office would have like oh he you know here's why why doesn't the tv remote work oh sorry i changed the t i like took the chip out of the tv i put a raspberry pi in it's like why can't i use this beer tap oh because i put a [ __ ] like drone that floats above it and like you know like what is this where's my computer it's like oh i needed a place to put my 3d printer and like eight out of ten of those turned out to be just like you know money sucks like there's there was no commercial value in the raspberry pi or the mini drones or the 3d printing or any of that stuff it was just like the fifth one where he's like yeah i'm playing around with this like crypto thing you know this thing how ethereum just came out and it's like just happened to be that that one was like one that turned out to be extremely profitable and like you know changed the world in a bigger way but you know the interest was in let's say for him tech or like our buddy xavier is just like dude how do i provide electricity to people in africa who don't have it right that's ambition in a different way right and that was inspiring right like i was like holy [ __ ] you're the biggest solar provider in africa but i guess what i mean is like in in new york i noticed that the ambition is like uh let me crawl up this ladder and climb to the top of the ladder because i want to be number one and i'm gonna kick other people off the ladder and make sure like stomp on their face as i'm going up so they can't get as high as as i am right whereas it seems that maybe i'm just being like uh just i just think our [ __ ] don't stink which is it's more like let's create new ladders you know it's like here's the test of new york it's like do you know which finger can take the least amount of pressure before it gives up its grip it's like yeah step on the ring finger they're done it's like whereas in san francisco it's a little bit different right san francisco the virtue signaling is different like what you get rewarded for is different you get rewarded for uh i'm solving some big problem at scale billion users billion dollar prize that's what you're going for and it's okay like your high status if you're broke but going for a big big prize whereas in new york you don't get high status for broke like it's like san francisco it's like the guy with the biggest ratio of wealth to poor looking is like the winner you know like you you have to be like the most raggedy looking dude with the most amount of money yeah yeah make the most money and then give up all your possessions and live on the street like that is the like peak right that's like jack go look at jack dorsey it's like okay you build two multi-billion dollar companies but then you grow a homeless man beard and you like pretend you don't care about it you give all your money away and you wear a tie-dye t-shirt and like you know you carry around a notebook and like that's you know while you walk barefoot it's like that that's the highest status like person you can be in silicon valley what did you think of the peter lovells podcast i thought it was dope like i think he's great uh i like him like you know um i always liked his content but i like him i didn't know him um and i like the way he thinks i like the way he acts i thought he was i thought he was pretty honest like he didn't come on here and try to perform um and he got the vibe he got the the you know i think he's a hit he's a hit i like him there's a handful of people who we were friends with and who we've talked to publicly who i think i would put in the category of like oh they've kind of figured it out and of course that they're flawed and they make mistakes and they're not always happy and whatever that just like normal humans but like in general they've kind of got it figured out i would say darmesh is in that category where it's like oh man you've like you have a lot of the boxes checked up like you seem happy you seem like you got a good family your career is good jack smith our good buddy is another one of those people uh he started a company that he sold for 800 million dollars but like he's not that like he doesn't really care about that and he'll never tell you about it unless you ask about it but he's happy and healthy and then this guy levels peter levels i would put him in the same category where it's like you kind of like seem like you know what you want and you stick with it and you have principles and you're you're achieving exactly your ideal life right and that's by the way you know the you know the tell that i figured out like the what's the quickest way for me to pick up on is that person like those people like our some of our favorite people are like that i put suli in that category i put ferkan in that category i put a bunch of ramones in that category it's what percent of your like kind of when you talk about yourself or what you're doing what percent there's two tests one is what percent of a conversation do you talk about yourself versus your asked questions you're interested or curious about other things other people other things then the second is when you talk about yourself what percent is talking about the past stuff you've done versus stuff you're interested in doing or the future and it sounds very simple but i'll like if you go to their bios very few of them even have their last company in their bio whereas if you go to my bio it's like sold bebo right like number one the first thing i write in there is like sold the thing you know like i've done something cool please ask me about it i love to tell you about my wins and you're fairly you're you're fairly close to being in that category of like i feel like you know what you want and even if you don't get what you want you're still mostly happy yeah and the the thing that's helped me is like uh i'm getting away from doing that i'm getting away from basically trying to like seek validation in some way and then the second like that that's that's why we talk about our past right to like kind of like give ourselves some status or to get some validation from others is like you know here's my background here's what i've done therefore please give me some respect and and whatever else and once i picked up that these other guys do that very differently i started to shed that it's like somebody will bring something up in a conversation i i think of an anecdote where i can tell them a really cool story of how i've done that and i'm just like well that doesn't actually add to the conversation they're already convinced why do i need to do that i don't need to i don't need to perform here it's fine and so i like let that go and that thought never used to be let go it always used to be something i would immediately jump in at any opportunity to kind of like you know hey can you validate my parking here here's my ticket stub can you please punch a hole in it and like that's how i felt like i was doing stuff and then i noticed these guys don't do that and i talked i remember asking silly i go i feel like you never i kind of have to brag for you when we meet people because like dude they don't even know who you are they don't know you're a hit like how much of a hitter you are and you want to look and sean wants to look cooler that he's associated with julian why did i bring this guy to this meeting yeah because this guy's [ __ ] awesome and like hold on you didn't do it you didn't brag let me brag yeah and um and i was like i was like why do you do that i was like as i also feel like you don't even talk about or think about like all the stuff you've done in the past and like he was like he's like yeah i mean i don't i don't know i don't really do i don't really feel the need to he's like you know i heard kobe bryant give a talk once and he's like it was after kobe retired and he was talking about like the new [ __ ] he was into he's like cause i don't know if you know kobe started like making little mini movies and like he like got really into storytelling and movies and like that was like what he wanted to do right great stories movies and stuff yeah and so he was like creating he created like a production company and kobe had said something that was like i need my next 20 years to make my last 20 years like a footnote like the next 20 years need to be the best thing i've ever done and this is coming from one of the greatest hall of fame basketball players whereas if you see what most players do when they retire they go put on a suit they put on 30 pounds and then they go sit at an espn desk and they talk about how the players these days don't get it back in my day we used to be so great and like they and they never like move on to the next great adventure and they don't they think it's it's implicit that the best work of their life was behind them and that's why they gained the weight that's why they aren't as happy that's why they're nostalgic for the good old days whereas somebody who looks at it like oh this next chapter is my best chapter and that's a different that person's gonna like go through life a little differently and so he told me he's like when i heard that i thought the same thing like oh yeah great my next company it needs to make my last company be this like little afterthought like we'll put it in the appendix of like stuff i'm done and if i think about it that way then i won't put so much emphasis on it i won't use it as my crutch as like a way to get kind of respect or attention or anything like that i'm gonna only make my new thing the way i do it and um and i really respected that i was like that's great have you heard the song uh damn it feels good to be a gangster of course basically uh in one of the lines he says real gangsters don't flex nuts because they know they got him and that's that's what we're talking about here you don't flex nuts because you know you got them yeah exactly exactly i think that's the episode [Music] you

[Music] you built a thing called wordplay is it wordplay.com it's wordplay.com right by the way you buy domain name so you bought the hustle.com for us you bought me copythat.com thank you for that um i forgot to say thank you in person but uh uh so you buy like a lot of amazing domains but you have wordplay.com and did you tweet that it was getting seven million users a week or three what was the number what so the i just went and checked the numbers okay so just to kind of place the timeline in frame so november and december of last year 2021 is when wordle took off in january is when it really kind of hit it's i think close to its peak um and that's roughly when the new york times acquired wordle and a couple things kind of i mean it was fine i think it was um a great outcome for josh wordle but there were things that were kind of bothering me that were limitations in the game and i was an avid player of the game um and now it's like okay well the new york times has bought it there is no way anything's going to happen for like years if ever so that was kind of thing number one thing number two like it was uh it had been a while since i had launched like some simple free thing publicly uh hadn't gone through the process and there were other things i wanted to learn it's like oh i want to learn more about versailles and xjs and typescript and things like that so it's like okay well this is a excuse and then that intersected with the third thing which was like the dominant variable in the equation is my son was taking a python programming class he's 11 right he's going through this process and for him um it's still very abstract he's learning programs he enjoys everything involving technology and screens but it was abstract so on a saturday night i said okay well let me build something python happens to be my language um build something so he can see because he plays world he knows the game um and so i started on saturday night with a deadline for sunday that i'm going to launch something with him tomorrow we're going to have google analytics on it so we're going to launch it i'm going to launch it by tweeting it and so he knows what social media is right he's um you know so i'm like oh we've got this thing that didn't exist yesterday i wrote the code over the course of last night in python the language that you're learning and we're going to launch it and now you can see users coming in right you can see and so now what i want him to have in his head is that when he has through the course of his life as he encounters problems that are solvable with software which is a lot like it's actually tactile for him it's like oh i don't know i don't have the skills right now to do what you know dad just did but i know it's possible i know it's possible because he did it in the span of 24 hours right so if i want to go off and build a video game i want to go off and build some tool for my school i want to build some social network for my whatever it is it feels like now it's it's more approachable for him he's got years to go before he'll get to that level but um anyway so those three things sort of came together and so we launched it on that sunday this is i think in february or so give or take um and since then it's had like 45 million games have been played uh nine and a half million people have come through it um any given moment in time right now for a look at the google analytics should be two three thousand people playing like right now um which how did it get so much traffic where did the traffic come from well it helps that i have a social media following right i've got a million followers on linkedin i've got 300 000 on twitter so there's that uh there are some things that that's that's a lot but that's not i wouldn't have thought that yeah yeah it's not enough for that is it how many users you think got from that um in the early days was it big was it big right off the bat like the first week was it big i know the first day probably a bunch of people checked it out but like i'm sure you posted it and that was the big surge so what was like the first week roughly do you remember the first week was probably maybe 50 to 100 000 so it was it wasn't a lot but it was something uh but then once you kind of get into it this is the you know kind of power of iteration is that oh well one of the things that i found missing in the original wordle was that it was a single player game like you played and you played once a day and that was it uh so two big changes that we made in wordplay one was it was unlimited play you didn't you didn't have to play just once a day and two it it allowed you to challenge your friends so you could say oh i just played this word i solved it in four turns here's my score and send literally a simple link to anyone or a group on and this happens tens of thousands of times right like someone will take a link that they just play they're really proud of their score and then their family they can post it through whatsapp group they can post it their you know wherever they want and say i invite you to like beat my score kind of thing um and so that's the viral element and so then as more people play you can track that as you might as a google analytics event and say how many people how many times are people clicking that share button and issuing challenges to other people and so that once you can kind of get into something where there's a compounding effect on the user base so as a user base grows um and so now the thing i'm fighting though right is that so that's happening that's going well but then the interest in wordle uh in related games is waiting because everything has its kind of peak in its uh and its ebb um and so but it's been an interesting exercise so on the kind of learning path one of the things i hadn't done in a while is like okay well what's traffic actually worth let's say i had to make a living on this thing or make the company quote-unquote or project profitable so i put google adsense on it which is the easiest thing to do and discovered that like if i weren't bothered by the fact that there would be two ads on the main game board page if i were solving for monetization it was like ninety thousand dollars a month uh in google analytics oh traffic yeah wow i thought you were gonna say way less yeah i thought he's gonna say like five grand a month but 90 grand a month and you're you only have your only costs are hosting right yeah and and my time right and first of all sean go to wordplay.com and then go to like the about page his about page is incredibly well written it's wonderful copywriting it's wonderful uh you've got a wonderful voice it says uh i'll just read the first sentence but it says why would you do this or the better yet why would i do this that's a really good question my wife asked me the same question and then you like go on to explain why it just you you're you're quite a good writer for also being like this amazing engineer typically those power writing course that sean put on you know that right let's like i'm not right around here with my alumni [Laughter] i like to say i taught darmesh everything he knows even before he met me i somehow caught him all that good stuff before he built hubspot what uh what do you so this is making 90 grand a month maybe or about what do you is it it could it's not right there's no advertising i turn the ads off because that's a point and people are asking me is like darmash why do you have ads on this thing and like to learn like it's like i've learned what i needed to learn so i can was was tweeting and linkedin posting this on linkedin the only way you got users what do you think this could sell for right now and is the is this the biggest side project you've ever created our buddy tried to buy it silly tried to buy it off you did he really he he tweeted out he's like i'd like to buy this off you i've you know i've built mobile games before you know he was like semi serious at least i don't know i don't know if you talk to him or not but i did not what do you think you could say what do you think like if you cared what do you think you could sell it for two or three million dollars maybe right now that um let's say the ad revenue would go down to like 50 000 or something like that because i haven't turned google adsense in a while that's 600 000 a year apply a 5x multiple um so somewhere between two and 10 million dollars would be my guess if i like if that's what we're solving for so and um is this the was was posting it on linkedin and twitter the only way that you got users or did you do some other weird hacks i had my blog uh had my it's like i'm a big believer in like you know what folks call like the flywheel there's all these little things that are attached to the flywheel right it's like oh well linkedin helps a little bit puts a little energy twitter does a little bit and i have my blog and the email goes out and there's like things that i sort of do um yeah so it it helps but it's like the hardest part is that cold start problems like how do you get your first hundred thousand people a hundred to a thousand people um and then it's a matter of like tracking the retention rate on those users they come back the other thing that's been interesting about wordplay as far as the lesson learned um is that you know when it started the average time a user spent according to google was roughly four minutes um on the game okay um in the early weeks and now that number is at 14 minutes is the average time a user spends um you know across however many a thousand users come in a given day so right what uh and is this the biggest side project you've ever created uh depends on how you measure it um so technically no not in terms of just like raw traffic um i've built graders and things like that before that uh have done better but what have you built that what side project have you built outside of hubspot that gets more traffic than two or three people really did side projects this was my first one um that was like clearly because it was a game had it been anything other than a game i would have rationalized some way to bring it into the spot umbrella because i like to have like all my eggs in that basket uh but just given the circumstances here didn't really make sense um and even now like i'm thinking about uh doing a uh kind of a marketing and sales related edition of wordplay right it's like oh the entire list of words or uh do it based on martech companies like okay do you know the the players in the space kind of thing and then you can get sponsorships or whatever anyway but um yeah website greater was the this kind of a project where it was like a free i'm i really like low friction things that people can come to the website and this is why my son and i were chatting yesterday is where i'm looking at flutter this new development environment and language um well darts the language but flutter is the uh the app framework for building mobile apps across ios and android and things like it's the what the cool new kids are learning and he's like no why would i ever want to build a mobile app that's like something people have to download i have to get approval from you know apple to kind of post my like i i want to like just do it like immediately he's got uh and he's right it's like okay anyway so that's the word play story it's been it's been a lot of fun i've um it's hard to know with these things like like where the road leads like wordplay itself may or may not kind of connect back to other things whatever but the things i've learned through it i think will it's like okay well here's what it takes to build this kind of thing it's like okay well then i'm using it to play around with community it's like okay can i take the word play user base what are things they care about and build a community around wordplay using all the existing kind of community platforms um and and see if that's a thing right it's like okay if you could aggregate people with like interests um that in itself has value and i wanted to send you something that kind of self runs but we'll see [Music]

when you own a business it's kind of like being on a dog track you have a fence to your left and a fence to your right somebody shoots a gun behind you and you can only go forward you have one direction you want to be the master of whatever your business is and that's really hard most people think the hard part is making the money but from an intellectual challenge point of view many of our members find the challenge of managing the wealth that they've created is actually intellectually more challenging than the business because the business might have come naturally to them

H guess on what's the Wi-Fi I can't no I can't get in oh it's AR connect your teams easier than connecting your Wi-Fi HubSpot grow better all hands on deck what's up it's Sean and it is one question Friday so we are taking one listener question and answering it on the spot hopefully five minutes maybe 10 minutes let's see how this goes I'm going to play this audio recording that Ben sent to me I haven't heard it yet let's hear it together so I was having a cola the other day and I was thinking about this question what do you do differently that allowed you to succeed that you think other people who had similar circumstances to you did not where did you succeed where they did not okay uh good question very broad question right so we could take this a bunch of different ways here's how I want to take it what are the common answers that you think people would give to a question like this so oh what do you do differently that helps you succeed well some people will say let's break it into groups there's the um overly humble the overly humble will say you know I've just all credit to God uh I've been blessed I was really lucky and you know I just kind of kept putting one foot in front of the other and worked hard and and I uh you know I'm just fortunate to be born in this great place with all my my limbs and my brain and all this right okay there's that path all true things but not that useful to somebody listening so let's let's kick that out also that applies to many other people who didn't have the same result as you so that certainly couldn't be it okay second thing hard work right hard work is the next thing that people love to say I think because hard work feels like you earned it and it feels like you're not saying you're better than everybody else it feels like you made better choices than others that were available to them too and um who can argue with hard work but the reality is I really don't work very hard um or at least I don't feel that way the thing I would say is I actually do work a lot but I only work on stuff I like and so I think hard workers you know like a janitor works hard a line cook works hard you know um a single mother works hard you know and so I I don't really put what I do has you know pretty much no physical strain no emotional St small em strain I guess and um you know honestly it's fun like I do it because I enjoy it I'm not doing it because I kind of feel like I have to do this in order to get what I want that is not at all how I think about things and there are many areas where I'm like oh man if I worked harder I'd get a better result and I can't bring myself to do it I'm lazy in that way uh the reason I work a bunch is because I really uh like it feels like play to me it's like watching somebody play a video game you you don't have to tell them hey sit down and focus on this for 3 hours it's like what are you talking about this Call of Duty of course I'll play this as long as I can and so um it's not hard work so what is it then well you said something in your question which was what's different about you than like uh what what did you do differently than like others like you in similar situations to you okay that's a good way of asking the question let's take my college right here I'm wearing this shirt I went to Duke and there's a bunch of super smart people who went to Duke in fact that Duke I was a very mediocre student um middle of the pack maybe slightly below average and um you know whatever it's a good school a lot of smart people a lot of hard workers okay I do think that I've had probably more success you know by kind of a traditional definition but also just more fun than 99% of the other people who graduated in my class um I could be wrong no way to really know but uh I believe that to be true from from what I've seen so what is different what I would say is that most of my friends from college most of the people I went to school with played it quote unquote safe and is it really safe uh that's the question and because to me safe is good if you can get the outcome you want with the least risk possible safe is awesome right like I don't want to you know go to war because the outcome I want is to be alive and like I can just stay at home and that is way less risk than um going to war but I also don't just stay at home and not drive places because I want to go see the I want to go to a movie or I want to go to the grocery store whatever I have an outcome I want but I'll take the least risk risk possible I'm not going to you know drive a motorcycle I'll drive a car you get the idea so to me safety is when you get the outcome you want with the least risk uh taken what I saw was most of my friends from college took what was what you would call a safe path if you wanted that outcome the reality is that I definitely did not want the outcome that those jobs led to so the jobs the most popular tracks were doctor um kind of like lawyer consultant or Banker those are like the kind of like high achiever paths that I would say most of the smart smartest people in um at my school did and I guess the other one would just be like corporate manager of some kind Okay cool so the problem with that is when I look at what success looks like for a doctor for a lawyer for a consultant for a banker or for a corporate manager none of those by default would get me the outcome I wanted right I was like dude I want to make tons of money I want to have fun every day I want to have action creativity I don't want to just be doing the same thing over and over right like I shadowed a doctor because I was pre-med I took the mcats I was planning to go to med school until I shadowed a doctor and I went to Shadow him to figure out uh can I do this but by the end of it the answer I walked away with was I don't want to do this because it was extreme extremely repetitive what was happening every day and um you're helping people which is awesome but I could not stand the repetitive nature of seeing patients and having the same you know as orthopedic guy oh yep you have torn meniscus you have a torn ligament you have joint pain and there's nothing we could do for you that that's what it was over and over and over again and so um I didn't want the winning path of that um so financially some some paths I was like oh man you work how hard and you make how much and like is there a path here where I could have like I don't know $50 million like what if I want $50 million right you don't have to want it but let's say I do want it because I do right and I'm not afraid to say it I'm not ashamed of the things I wanted I was like that sounds awesome if I could choose between less money and more money I'm choosing more money right that was very obvious to me at the time and when I looked at how much you could make in a certain amount of time the first let's say 10 years of your career I was like Wow uh okay Finance I might be able to get there but not really these other paths okay maybe I can do it in finance or Consulting but what do I have to do to get there oh man I got to grind 80 90 hours a week kind of as the low man on the totem pole and I'm just like an Excel monkey and I'm like you know I'm not building I'm not creating anything new and I'm not building my own business I'm like just this kind of like middleman uh that's what it felt like or corporate management that's cool but like I got to go to an office every day 9 to5 wear a certain thing and talk a certain way and spend a bunch of my days doing um you know like you know certain meetings that I didn't want to do like you know Talent calibration and like you know employee onboarding and all this [ __ ] right so I didn't find that fun and I even saw people that who are playing that game at a high level so for example when we got acquired by twitch I saw well what is the CEO of a multi-billion dollar company do every day and what does you know the VP product do and what does the CTO do what what do these people do every day if I look at their day and I don't want it then why am I in this track so I would say the fir the most important thing I did differently was get clear on what I actually wanted how I wanted my life to go and then I looked at the quote unquote safe tracks and I realized pretty quickly that those don't get me to that thing I want so in that sense they're not safe at all they're extremely dangerous to my goals right are you following that like if you if you look at what you want if you have a clear picture of what you want and then you look at the safe path and you say does the safe path get me to what I want and the answer is no then it is not safe it is extremely risky because it's putting my dream at risk and knowing what you want also takes a little bit of work so take some time take some imagining take some sampling I would go and meet a bunch of people and be like so what's your life like you know uh okay you have this much money what how does that work you have this uh work schedule how does that work oh you never see your kids okay that that doesn't sound like a win right like uh my buddy dated a girl in college my roommate was dating a girl in college and her dad was a high you know whatever partner at whatever deoe Boston Consulting whatever whatever it was and and you know she was just like yeah growing up like he was home Thursday through Sunday and then he would fly out Thursday through Saturday he'd fly out Sunday and he'd be at a client site from you know Sunday through Thursday every week and then he fly back and he was super tired and that was the first 18 years of my life so I I immediately could cross that safe path of Consulting off because if that's how the the top of the top do it in that field then I don't want to do it and of course there are outliers in every in every industry every track there are some outliers but then have to be really clear that hey am I betting on being an outlier in that path if so then I got to be willing to make that choice so for example I chose entrepreneurship what I knew was that the day-to-day of an entrepreneur sounded really fun I get to build a a product a create a product from scratch maybe invent a new product um I get to sell it that sounds interesting marketing as I always found fun and um you know I get to go on this ride where I'm sometimes I'm pitching to investors sometimes customers sometimes I'm putting out a fire over here that sounded really fun to me and I tried it out and I actually really enjoyed it and I knew that okay most entrepreneurs don't make it but I thought well if I really enjoy this then I'm I'm probably going to be willing to do it for 10 15 years and what I saw was that most people would quote these statistics that 90% of businesses fail or that this individual idea has a very low chance of have very low chance of success and that is true most individual ideas and businesses do fail and the way uh the quote I heard was that yeah startups fail but entrepreneurs don't what that means is that if you look at any great entrepreneur any entrepreneur who sticks with it who's really tries hard and actually has some skill over a 10 to 15 year period they all win right they tend to they tend to win the odds are in their favor that in a 10 to 15E period they do have a win and when they win they win in an order of magnitude of millions and millions of dollars okay great so even the one idea that I'm doing this year might not have the highest odds of success if I just keep keep at this for 10 15 years my odds of success go from individually very low to collectively over 10 15 years very high so I loved that I loved the size of the prize I loved the likelihood of success and I loved the data day to get there which told me I'll probably stick with it long enough to hit a win and so that's how I chose what I wanted to do so in summary what I think I did differently was get clear on what I wanted and then I what I recognized was that the quote unquote safe paths weren't really so safe after all because they had a very low chance of getting me to that outcome that I wanted and so in that sense they were the riskiest Paths of all whereas most people I think gravitated towards something that sounded good in theory or sounded good to their parents or sounded good to their aunts and uncles and their peers and their teachers and whoever and they said Yep this this sounds good and they got onto a track that actually won't lead them to a lifestyle that they want whereas I figured out the lifestyle I wanted first and then I figured out and then I looked at what tracks can get me there and I chose the safest amongst those all right that's all hope that was helpful come on I know that was helpful it had to be helpful right I put my I put my heart into that one so I hope that it was helpful I hope I might have took an idea that you already had and maybe put it a little differently or brought it to the front of your mind and maybe it was buried in the back of your mind that's that's a win for me out of these so one question Friday in the books [Music]

[Music] are you intimidated why are you he said he took a run before this because he was nervous now no because i've been on a lot of podcasts but like they're usually kind of small you know it's like i see you guys as like joe rogan for business so it's like there's one step but wow above is like joe rogan and then there's you guys and then below it's like yeah i don't want to dis all the podcasts i've been on they're amazing but you know like this is like a level so uh but it's good you know i mean computer levels so and you also don't know what sam might ask you because sam might just come out of left field and be like but that's the thing i was thinking like sam is like he's not a regular uh interviewer you know he adds some crazy [ __ ] so wait me first of all i i don't know if that's true i don't know if we first of all it's not just me it's you too sean that asks weird stuff but also i don't think we asked that weird questions i think we asked the questions that everyone's thinking no that's true but i mean you're not just man like you know there's yes man podcast where like they just it's kind of like a fan thing obviously that's not you guys you have real [ __ ] real questions and that's i think it's more interesting as well can we sam can we share the thing you were just telling us in slack can i share that on here on the pod yeah which one the sampar strategy for networking this is um you know you can go to harvard you can go to stanford you're not gonna learn this one like you know it's a very small little tweak but it's just so sam that it just is awesome so if you're if sam wants to hang out with you he'll text you just like a normal person would but and he doesn't need to even know you he's just like interested in you maybe maybe it's a cold dm maybe it's a text message maybe he got your number from somebody else like hey it's sam uh you know i'm in san francisco but instead of saying wanna hang sam will just go i'm in san francisco let's do this he sent me some [ __ ] that i won't say out loud but yeah but i think it worked yeah so sam what what is this and why does it work so well it's like a phrase like you know like people will be like uh you know i [ __ ] with that guy like i [ __ ] with drake i like drake it extends from that and i just say it and people uh they reply i don't know i just yeah this particular one i it was a ceo of a multi-billion dollar company who i'm friendly with i just said what's up i'm in your hood let's andy goes down when like it worked out it's amazing and now so normally we try to play cool but we've actually been chasing you peter we've been we've been talking about your projects we've been being like hey we got to get this guy in the pod sam is a fan of you for sure i would say i am less of a fan than sam but i am a that doesn't mean i like you it's just i'm more in the closet about it whereas sam is very open sam's like this guy's amazing this guy's like an artist thanks man this guy's got great hair and you do have great hair so it's all true and now we finally got you here and it was hard i think right because you like don't do you don't schedule or something like that like i mean it it like it looks like being an ass right on instagram if you do that but i like like you guys i would get so many dms and they're all like i mean generally they're very low quality dms right like i want to collaborate but i don't want to invest i don't want to like people want something from you i think it's like being a hot girl in the club like people want something for you but they don't want to invest the time to actually get to know you or you know you feel like an object and i don't like to feel like that and i want to um spend more time with you know like with my friends in real life with uh my girlfriend or something i want to spend time on in the gym you know on my health and cooking food and and that kind of stuff go for walks and uh i think because i because i've been doing this for 10 years like startups like eight years and now i get the money is going well so i don't really need to do any calls anymore any dms so i'm just trying to create a more chill life and i'm not an [ __ ] it just means like i don't have time to met to reply to everybody so i close my dms and and then people get really angry on tweets they're like why don't you why you close your dms are you arrogant and stuff so i wrote a blog post like kind of explaining my day and my routine and what i do in the day and that i don't really have time if i do all the things i do now to also dm everybody reply everybody and do calls and stuff um and that's pretty much the argument or even let's give the context so let's explain who the heck you are so uh your name is peter lovells you're known on um twitter as levels io right yeah that's the uh that's the right way to say it i saw you a while back i'm just gonna say some interesting things about you i believe that you can correct me if i have any of these wrong i believe you publish how much you make every year and in fact it's in your twitter bio in your location there's like a meter that's like your road to three million a year yeah and it says 2.7 million so your meter is almost all the way filled up um you build a bunch of random small projects usually around some things you like or believe or your lifestyle which is kind of a nomadic lifestyle so i believe i think you you you hop around or you don't have like a home base so you live you know you could be like in bali and then you could be in the netherlands you could be a different place all the time and you make these small websites or apps and it says in your bio that you have 13 million monthly active users um and i've i remember seeing you because you did a community like a like a nomad community a slack community really early on like slack had just come out and i was like this guy's like charging 10 bucks i think it was 10 bucks a month or something to get into this thing i was like he's got like a thousand people here wow this is actually this guy's making good money doing this um like just by making a slack group and you just do a bunch of small experiments like that um that's what i know sam what did i do i'll give pe peter let me give like the outsider's perspective that's a little more holistic so basically there's two things that are interesting to you the first one is your businesses which actually are the least the lesser of the two interesting things so you have roughly five or s yeah you have seven different businesses uh ranging from nomad list which makes uh 2.1 million dollars in the last 12 months that's a that's a a job board you have another job board called remote okay that's making 115 dollars a month you have read mate read make which looks like it's like an ebook something like that yeah it's like an ebook yeah yeah 60k a month then you have got like a bunch of really you're seeing these numbers because he publishes them where do you publish these he publishes all of them on like the the url uh go to his twitter profile and we'll let you talk sorry peter in a second but go to his profile go to his twitter profile and then like click off and it's like uh open revenue at the very bottom but i'm reading off of our notes so and then you have like a qr menu creator then you have like an inflation chart which doesn't seem like it makes money but tracks uh inflation and then you have rebase which is a platform to help people become a citizen of uh portugal help them re relocate the portugal so what's the first part is those businesses like i said you have those that are interesting i would narrow it down to say you have a series of job boards for nomadic or remote work that are pretty profitable but the second thing that's even more interesting is the way that you do these things so you do a few things that are interesting the first thing is i think you're the only full-time employee right and you use a team of contractors and second of all you have this weird personality that's very embedded in everything you do so that's kind of like my big intro of what you do i could see a website and i could know you built it without you having an about page which is kind of clunky right it looks a little no it's like no but it doesn't have a nice way i guess yeah it's another designer yeah no i think it's accurate description um it's like like i'm not very nomadic anymore like i'm slowly settling down right but i started very nomadically i was like moving around every month um i started like in 2014 i started nomading and i uh went to all these places and i started building these apps these little websites little products to validate and i remember i mean i told the story so many times but i was following patrick mckenzie patio 11 on hacker news famous hacker news a guy and now he works for stripe and he would do he would share his revenue on his blog about all his little products he made and it was like appointment reminder for barbershop so you got to sms just before your appointment so you don't forget it that kind of stuff and i was really inspired like okay this is not like some big vc funded guy he's just like an indie guy was just on his laptop kind of building stuff and i kind of mixed that with the nomad thing where like building from your laptop from your backpack moving around i think also getting inspired from different places because if you move around you i mean i know sam moves around a little bit as well uh you your life becomes very unique because you meet different kinds of people you you're in different kinds of places you see different kinds of products like in shops like if you're in asia you see some futuristic [ __ ] you don't see in europe and america and all that stuff kind of it helps for inspiration for creating products in some indirect ways as well um so that's pretty much what i've been doing and i think it's i've been trying to be like radically honest like i know this this american guy who pushes the radical honesty movement um so i'm trying to do that in my personal life i'm trying to do it on the internet i'm not perfect but i'm trying to be as honest and open as possible uh because i don't like this fake corporate stuff and it's because i started business administration and i have a master's degree in it so i know all the management consultancy [ __ ] you know i've been there i've done that i know that's where my friends work i know investment bankers and i hate that that a lot of that world where it's like fake and not real and i uh want to be very open and honest and i think it's also a little bit of a european thing not to slack off americans i love america but like um in europe people are very uh a little bit more direct and a little bit more uh straightforward and uh i think that comes across in my in the stuff i do a little bit so what's the total size of all your of all your projects in terms of top line and bottom line revenue and isn't it true that you're the only full-time person and how many contractors are you using yeah so i have one customer support contractor part-time uh isabelle and she works for all my projects um and i have a moderator for the slack group because dude slack groups they there's some drama in there like i've had some crazy drama in these sledge groups in communities so you need to have a moderator you need to have rules and you need to have a you cannot just automate this moderation away like i tried that but you need a real person there to you know check on messages and stuff um and then i have a devops guy he's my best friend daniel and he uh works kind of like a sls sla like a service level agreement where if the server goes down he gets a message you know if i'm sleeping with something he brings it back up but the problem is never was down anymore like it doesn't we haven't really had that for years so um he does security updates and stuff you know like because i have a vps i don't use amazon i use a vps on digitalocean and linode um and he kind of keeps that stuff safe you know so that's good and how big is the business top playing i'm sorry how big is the business um so remote case the job board it's the biggest business makes the most money normally this is starting to grow though it's like it's past i think 100k this month 100k a month um so almost like a million dollar business um remote case 1.6 million a year i think um and rebase is a new business it's an immigration agency so i want to help remote workers immigrate to countries that want to attract remote workers with like you know beneficial tax stuff uh portugal is one of the first ones to do that um so those are the three businesses really make money and the rest doesn't really make money a lot like the book makes like i think like 4k a month so but everything you do is part of one flywheel so i've looked at your kind of like system and i've looked at a bunch of people because i got into a little pickle where i was like god i'm doing so many things and i want to do all these things i'm interested in all these things but [ __ ] you know am i going to be able to juggle five different things i got a podcast i have a vc fund i have my e-commerce business i have a newsletter business i have um you know i don't even know what else course business i got i got another [ __ ] right so it's like uh am i going to be able to do this and what i saw that you did i like i have this kind of like mental model of a solopreneur and a solopreneur nobody's actually solo everybody's got like a little support team around them that's like helpful some some in a big way some in a small way but basically it's like somebody who builds a personal brand and then builds a bit builds a successful business and lifestyle around that and what i noticed was that you had this formula which is i don't know if it's intentional or unintentional but i'll say it out loud because here's my my read of your business it's basically you ha he starts with the red pill so a red pill is like you know that scene in the matrix where morpheus is holding out a blue pill a red bull he's like you know do you want do you want the truth or do you want to you take the blue pill you could just go back to your normal life just as everything was you could forget this ever happened and neil's like no i need to know the truth what's the truth he takes the red pill and basically it's like every great solopreneur i think starts with one truth so like uh tim ferriss's truth was basically that like the nine to five work in a cubicle for 40 years model is like effing broken and you don't need to do it that way like you could work four hours a week and live like a millionaire and so that was like tim ferriss's red pill and yours was basically like this idea of being a nomad a digital nomad um which was like hey yeah you don't have to you know prescribe to the subscribe to the normal way of living you pick a a place that's where you are from that's where you live and you pay you know you just kind of stay where you grew up and like and you go to an office every day and like you have to wear shoes and whatever you're like no i wear flip-flops i walk around on beaches i just kind of go wherever i feel like whenever i feel like and i carry a little like backpack and that's my life um yeah so you start with the red pill then you be then you create content around that red pill says you talking about that lifestyle and sharing everything from like hey people always ask what i keep in my backpack for the day here's what it is it's like yeah there's every bit of content you can come up with that's like poppy that's like fits that red pill so then you be that big gives you authority on that subject so you become like a authority and so you know pomp became an authority around bitcoin and tim ferriss became an authority around life hacking and you've become an authority around nomadism and then you take that and then you basically spin off one of many businesses that can come up with it but every one of those business either it's a big money maker or it's just another funnel and more content more new audience that's gonna like get sucked into that same red pill lifestyle that you are like talking about and so it even though you're doing six things they're all actually part of one flywheel and every one that you do is gonna feed it either because it's gonna give you a bunch of cash that lets you fund this lifestyle in a bigger and better way or it's gonna give you new content new stories new things to be known about um that fit that lifestyle as well that's how i see it i'm curious is that a good is that traffic is really accurate and my thing started when i was i was blogging just like you said i was blogging about like nomading um but i was blogging for my mom because back then you had like travel bloggers like 2013 and i was going to travel kinda and nomad and i wanted to you know every place i went i wrote a little i was this city to live in and stuff and what happened all the crazy [ __ ] that happened to me and my mom was reading that um but i wrote it in english because my mom was obviously dutch but i was like okay she can read english so it's maybe easier to get more traffic and stuff more audience but it wasn't like super like a big idea it just kind of happened and then those blogs started showing up on hacker news and i started writing more about like bootstrapping startups as a nomad in in thailand or something or in asia and those started going on hacking is really high and i think that was the time it was like 2013 2014 there was a time when i noticed that um the developers in san francisco worked for all the startups they also were realizing okay maybe i can start doing this remotely because remote work was not cool back then and nobody was not cool back then because you had the tim ferriss wave in 2008 it's like the first nomad wave but there was i love tim ferriss but there was something about the the followers there and the the business that were created they were kind of like like shady there was a lot of shady [ __ ] i met i came across in asia in thailand like americans and europeans it was like a lot of brain supplements and [ __ ] like do it yes yes dudes yeah drug dealers online directories and like spam daxing and like they're still shady [ __ ] but less and i was like i really hate this shady [ __ ] i don't feel like part of the scene uh i think it would be cool to make it more like uh you know mainstream like reputable businesses reputable jobs that do it um so i kept blogging about it and it kept taking off in hacker news and uh and you're right i think and then i went on twitter and i think i kind of organically people started following me and then a lot of people went nomad a lot of my friends went nomad because i was blogging and they became my friends now um and yeah and then i started all those businesses and but i think it's it's not like some it sounds very like a constructive it's not a master plan no it's not a master plan it's very organic like uh i kind of try i'm like user zero i try to build stuff for myself and i always have like i have like new ideas like there's just like you said red build there's like something that's a discongruence in society and what i'm thinking and most people then think like okay there must be wrong something there must be something wrong with me but i think like arrogance i think there must be something wrong with society maybe this is like a new thing so i'll try and make a little website about it like inflation like three years ago or two years ago i was tweeting about inflation like this shit's gonna go crazy with all the fat printing money and everyone's like nah inflation is fine stop stop whining about it i'm like no i'll just prove you that the real inflation numbers are higher so i made this inflationchart.com website that shows the inflation numbers are really high turned out to be true kind of now so yeah that's all great what what uh technology are you using to build those sites because they all do look alike and you seem like you can spin them up like really quickly well that's really funny because i get a lot of criticism for the technology i use i use php because that's the language i knew because i was making a blog like right like wordpress so i knew php a little bit so i was like okay i just need to write with the language i know because i don't know under other languages and i did that and then i use javascript and i use jquery so everybody starts laughing now because jquery is like way pass a but i still use it because it's so easy to you know make a button bind an event to it age exterior to the server to the php script does something with the database sends it back and it works for me really well and i think it doesn't matter what you use but as long as you use something that's really fast um feedback loop and iterative loop where you can really quickly develop like i can make a new button in like you know 20 seconds and deploy to the server it's really fast and i know other developer friends of mine use a very big stack all those you know kubernetes and all the stuff all these keywords i don't really know and for them it takes sometimes like you know an hour or maybe even days to deploy a new feature and i think what we learned from startup and lean startup is that the customer feedback loop has to be very difficult to be very fast iterative so you can really quickly change stuff and it also makes your customers really happy because they see something they have a problem or a feature idea you can really quickly build it and then they see it and that's i mean if you want happy customers that's how you get it you make something for them they're like oh my god i influenced this product and uh yeah so that works for me so very very simple stack we won't laugh at you because not because we're nice we just we don't know anything about i don't know what jquery is neither the samsung i mean nobody these days you're safe here we're too dumb to to call you out on any of your technical nice nice it's a good podcast what do you what do you think what do you think this whole your whole thing's worth because if you go okay so depends if you do 5x sorry sean go to his like sites and you could see like it's like something slash open it's usually like the website slash open and then like it says like so many stats most of which honestly are kind of useless but it's just like it's cool uh it's like you know like how many seventy percent of them are like you know the equivalent of like a step counter it's like uh it's like oh how many dms did i get today how many uh no i don't need it no you do you have it but it's collective it's like dm sense you know it's collective events yeah but for example i'm on nomadlist.com which you said yeah i think your biggest one slash open and on it you see the revenue chart you see you know co2 removed from the atmosphere you see the full p l you see a bunch of other things and one of them that you see is my okay so 73 profit margin your team says 0.78 so i guess that's like part part-time yeah like full-time equivalent like fta yeah and then plus 492 bots what is that service yeah yeah yeah so uh he has the valuation too he is if you scroll down it says we sold for i mean it's not super accurate i did business but it's the pe ratio of public companies that are similar in industry and i try like sync it to that sometimes um but the dude it completely depends on the multiple somebody's going to pay for it right like uh have you seen those those are extremely low no i've sold nothing i've been in selling processes with previous guests on your podcast you know so uh but it kind of bounced off i'm just a lot of i think i'm just going to guess it was andrew wilkinson because he loved manchester united yeah because he loves john boards that that's just a guess i can't say anything but 80 i signed any 80 of the acquisitions they bounce off right so right now i'm like i don't really care uh i like that i have cash flow and my life is nice and but i until recently i was really like until like a few years ago i was like obsessed by the selling because you build a startup like in the movie like social well not the movie social network but in big movies about startups they're like oh my god grow big and sell and you're a millionaire but then if you become millionaire yourself with your cash flow you're like okay why does it matter actually well let's actually talk about that because what's interesting about you is you have a few that you could sell so like remote okay and nomad lists are both pretty cool have you calculated like how much money you want and how long it's going to take you to get there via cash flow and if it's better to like well why don't i just sell one and i can get like an eight or ten million dollar lump sum but then i still on this other one that's making like yeah three million dollars i mean have you thought have you done that math and and what are you doing the thing is most of my revenue is profit like the margins are really high especially remote okay it's like it's like 94 margin uh pre-tax so it's very high um so i'd say 10x after thanks gets interesting i think the problems with bootstrap companies you usually get three four five x uh profit or review which is too low for me it's like i can i might as well wait three years or four years and sit in this chair and the sites will probably keep running because they're fully automated and i barely need to work on them they kind of just keep going it's like heavily automated like really heavy heavy uh it's just that i won't build new features anymore then and the site will start looking a little bit old because you know design trends change but generally it will keep running so it doesn't make sense for me to sell for you know 5x or 4x if i might as well wait and also like normal this is like my baby so if i sell it uh they're gonna [ __ ] it up i already know because they always do um like let's say a big a big remote startup buys it okay i know vc fund remote startups are cool but they're also going to be bought by big boring companies later like corporate companies right and they're going to shut this [ __ ] down they're like and this is my contribution this is my life's work it's like a legacy so uh remote okay i care less because it's a job board job is not very interesting but normally this is like this whole movement and culture and and there's like tens of thousands of people on there and my friends are on there and it's like this work of love you know and um so yeah it's hard it would be hard to sell that because people are going to [ __ ] it up are you the largest go ahead sean well one thing i was going to say you tweeted out something that said a 10-year overnight success which i think is a common uh uh idea that most people don't don't realize which is by the time you hear about something you don't know the 10 years of kind of toiling and tweaking and iterating that it took before the big kind of breakthroughs happen i had my life was the same way you know i started my first startup when i was 20 21. and i made my first million by the time i was 30 or 31 right like it wasn't it took 10 years and um and you know and then and then every year since then a bunch of great stuff has happened but like it took a long time to get that breakthrough and i was looking at your chart sam i don't know if you saw this tweet that he has but the chart basically shows i think you start the sum of all my revenue together in one chart yeah yeah it's all your revenue from all your projects all together in one chart and it's looking like it's like i don't know 2012 or 2013 start and basically if i go all the way up until let's call it 2019 you're at maybe 600 700k and per year in revenue and only in the last like like kind of the pandemic boom you know let's say 2020. from 2020 you went from under a million dollars to 2.5 million a year right so you two and yeah x and you like it's because it sounds amazing wow this dude's making almost three million a year it's like yeah but he's also been building that momentum and stacking these assets and it just really took off and which i'm guessing is like pandemic fueled a lot of people wanting to be nomads and like you were there to catch that wave you were the guy ready to catch yeah but now he this was coming like right this was like i did this presentation in 2015 where i predicted there would be one billion remote workers in 2030 and everybody laughed at me and i was like even in the comments like youtube comments were like this is ridiculous whereas your sources is [ __ ] and then confident happened and it suddenly seems very reasonable and but nobody could have seen this coming and i had no idea i was actually kind of like thinking like you know of it or what exactly but it kind of like it if you look at the chart it's kind of like you know it doesn't really go anywhere and i was like thinking okay this is [ __ ] like i i tried i tried everything to make it grow and sometimes it grew and sometimes it didn't but generally it wasn't very it wasn't like a vc startup where like well it looks like there's these p there's these run-ups and then a plateau and run-up in a plateau which is by the way that's how all progress actually looks if you zoom out and i remember that like during 2014 when i first moved to silicon valley there was a small group of people like you this i think when you created that first slack community that was like nah being a nomad is the way to go and um yeah but those people were like freaks you know they were they were very yes and but there were some people who took the red pill at that time i think steph smith who was just also worked at the hustlers she met you in i don't know indonesia or something like that because um she had i think probably during that more like that time period 2014 15 16 something like that she was one of those people that defected then whereas now there's like another wave and like if you look at kind of like any lifestyle movement it happens this way it starts with like very i could take crypto it starts with the the cypherpunks exactly you're right yes they don't they hang out in cryptography forums and they took the pill first yeah and then came you know the next the developers then came the the finance bros and then it's the same with the next music like music genres like hip-hop like early hip-hop and i come from electronic music so drama-based music it was my previous career like music producer it's the same thing like edm taking off in the us in 2009 2010 with dubstep that's what broke edm and u.s that kind of stuff it you like these these movements these scenes are almost dead and then suddenly something happens like right and it's so unpredictable you have no clue what's going on you can only surf it so i think the metaphor of surfing is very accurate it's better to serve these waves in general i think life just surf waves stop trying to control it uh just serve it and kind of like you know pivoting like pivoting startups into that's pretty much just serving like steering the surfboard over the waves because you cannot you cannot control the market at all you cannot control society at all you know one of the things that bothers me about the this indie hacker movement is well i i just i really i really like it i like it but in general what i don't like about it is like people think pretty small so they're like uh you know like there's it's kind of related to like the fire movement which is like oh i just want to save a little bit of money so i can make 40 000 a year in passive income and and i'm like oh that's cool like getting your first step is cool but like that can't be it with life like you have to like you know you're going to want more you want to do more things and contribute to society and with a lot of these indie hackers they kind of come up with silly stuff where it's like a small widget that they sell for four dollars a month and they hope that they can get to a thousand dollars a month and i'm like man that's like neat if you're just starting out but i think that this could be bigger and you're actually one of the few people that i've seen go harder you know you're going harder on this um are there any others like do you think i'm going harder on it like well your numbers are bigger like it's like like it's it's substantial like your numbers are nice already and it could be survivor bias right well yeah definitely but i still think that there's a mindset of like um like for example your twitter bio thing says your meter is going to three million i would say most people who are indie hackers and makers and kind of like the the sort of tinkerer community they don't even have their meter to their their meter you know initially is going to start much lower sixty thousand or seventy thousand a year yeah and maybe yours did too but then you like oh cool i filled up that meter i leveled it up so what was your like initial goal was it like making enough to not need a job or where did you start when did you get more ambitious so i i mean back when i started i had a youtube channel for this electronic music i was making and stuff and i was making like a few thousand dollars from youtube adsense so i had some runway uh some cash flow to live off of travel off and work on mini startups but it was very fast it was shrinking because of the competitive like the copyright claims on youtube in 2012 and stuff so it was pretty much becoming like below a thousand dollars a month um but uh so i had that cash show but to go to your question i think it's a power law like you always have a few people in a scene who will make more money or get more successful and stuff also there's a delay effect i started in 2013 or 2014. all these indeed this indie scene didn't really it wasn't cool until maybe i think 2018 or something 2017. so these people that are going into it now they're just starting kind of and i think the widget thing is interesting because you said it's only a widget uh if you make one feature really well that solves like one problem you can get some customers and you get some cash flow and then you can build a second feature and you can slowly scale up uh to a bigger to a real business to real product toolkit right and then i think another thing is you don't see a lot of people with multi-million revenue because they will quickly raise pc like once you pass a million dollars a year they will switch to okay let's go big let's go become a billion dollar company and i think i'm the exception i'm like i don't want to be building another company i'm fine like like this kind of chill um and that's why you don't see those people a lot because i do know them and they quickly disappear like this app we're using now uh riverside i think is raised pc now started bootstrapped and then i think oprah winfrey used it and because it's my friend nandov he makes it he's like dude overwhelmed for you so i'm like oh my god this is crazy he's like yeah i think i'm gonna raise pc i'm like okay yeah you should do that uh because they think this is like this could be bigger than just a few million right so you tweeted something out the other day that's related to this you go not sure if people realize it but if your app does twenty thousand a month on revenue you're probably already a millionaire twenty thousand dollars per month times twelve months assume you could sell for let's call it four or five multiple yeah that's a million dollar selling price right you're sitting on a million dollar asset and when you put it that way i think that sounds and it is way more achievable than this idea of like i got to build a million dollar business like i don't know i don't do i have the big idea whatever but getting something to 20 to 30 000 a month in revenue seems approachable right it's approachable and that's kind of awesome i think that's an amazing like just a like you didn't all you did is you said something that was true out loud and i think if more people heard that that's why i'm kind of bring it up here i think if more people heard that that is a pathway to a millionaire status that does not require like winning the startup lottery of like inventing the next big thing or working and saving and you know paying your crazy w-2 taxes for like you know 15-20 years to get the same same outcome yeah exactly yeah i agree yeah and i think it's it's reachable especially if you think about high automation very high margins so software business you you're not going to hire a big team of 10 people immediately you work with part-time contracts like i do and you keep your margins very very high because then you can sell for 5x right then your revenue is almost your profit so it's the same um yeah i think 20k brainstorm or business together that could get to 20k so what's an idea that you you're not currently building but you thought of because i'm sure you're an idea guy and you think uh you can make a website that does x or you could make nomad lists for this other niche or you could make you know um the the immigration one for this other thing so what's a business let's brainstorm a business together what's a business that you think could get somebody to this millionaire status dude i think what's man it's like again this is so personal so i've been living like i used to live in hostels right in like dorms in 2014 i didn't have money shared with six people like crazy then i started like private rooms in hotels then the rooms got a little bit more luxurious because i had more money and then i started discovering like apartment hotels and it sounds like [ __ ] but it works so well with remote work so i mean i was part of the hotel right now in europe on the beach and there's a kitchen what's an apartment hotel what does that mean sorry apartment hotel is essentially a hotel so full service furnished nice interior hotel room but you also have a kitchen you have a bedroom you have a living room you have it you know it's very big it's pretty much like an airbnb but you pay per month or per night or whatever you pay per month well you can pay for a night you can pay for a month it's just like sean um it's like that guy or whatever yeah it's like saunder and it's like all uh i forget the other one the guy was supposed to come on the podium canceled you did one of these in nashville right or something where you're like this is awesome it's working yeah it's like a it's basically just an apartment that you can rent for five days and they're pretty cool i do i do them all the time the problem that i've experienced is within new york it's like 10 grand a month and it's like 600 square feet so that's why i tend to go airbnb but i'm in smaller less expensive cities you can get like a thousand square foot place for like six thousand a month and it's just it's basically uh an apart apartment building that has one floor or all floors dedicated to airbnbs yeah the problem of airbnb is that i've noticed the quality is very very high there's a big range of quality and there's problems there's no daily cleaning it's it feels too much like um unexpected like you don't know what's gonna happen the water stuff might break if things break here you just get a new apartment right and i've done this in europe and i've done this in asia too in thailand and i spend about you see two to three k three and a half k so it's a lot of money it's more than normal rent but the cool thing is that it it solves a lot of problems you have in your daily life um because it's surface and stuff and it's it's a huge thing in asia it's a huge thing in in southeast asia even in korea taiwan and stuff so i think that's going to be bigger because of remote work because you have remote workers even with families with kids and you don't want to live in a hotel or a hotel room is very depressing like i go insane in hotel rooms it's just like a bed and you can barely walk around the bed there's no space i need to cook food i need to buy steak from the local butcher i need to cook it with broccoli and spinach and with my friends and stuff and you can do it in an apartment hotel and i think the if you target it's a high-end market i think of remote workers that make a lot of money like 200k or 100k something if you target them you can make a lot of money because it's um service furnished so what would you build you'd actually build an apartment hotel or you'd build a digital product that's a big question because i i'm a software guy i don't wanna i don't wanna own stuff i don't wanna have all this i don't even wanna buy land i don't even want to buy a house i want to be able to be a consumer a customer of these kind of things right but i wanted long term i want to be able to rent for like six months you know or 12 months even i want to be guaranteed to stay so we uh my wife and i are like we're at the point where we're gonna start having kids soon and i live not like you entirely but a little bit where we spend we spend half the year one place half a year at the other place and what we're going to do next year is just rent do a 12 month month lease in new york and just not be there all the time but i'm looking to rent all of my furniture and i've been looking at a place where i was like all right i just want to like book this one place and i want to pay someone like three grand a month but they have to show up before i arrive they've got to completely set it up yes and it's gonna be 100 furnished for me and i've been looking at these and there's a few startups in the space that are doing furniture rental and furniture rental is not popular right now and i tell people all the time i'm like i just want to rent all my furniture i don't want to own any of it and they they think it's nonsense and they think it's crazy but if you run the math it's significantly like it's about the same in terms of price but in terms of headache i think it's a thousand times better and that's another yeah yes yeah so it's it's all about the headaches so if you can afford it you can reduce the headaches of ownership and ownership uh it sounds so privileged though but whatever it ownership is a big hassle [ __ ] breaks all the time and if you are like if i spend my time on my laptop building on these apps it's probably better use of my time than managing all this this stuff and if a company can specialize in you know managing this stuff and renting it to you it's much better i think that's a real you're on point that's a real business and um imagine you can go to a website you can say like okay you can choose different sets of furniture different interior stuff paintings on the wall or whatever and you can just click and you arrive and it's already done for you like you said i think that would be really interesting uh yeah what what else yeah things that you're interested in either kind of niche categories or things in your lifestyle that you're like huh i do this lifestyle thing differently than people this could be you could build a business around this i think that the biggest problem with the digital nomad thing is that there's a maybe it's a good big podcast just to say that uh there's a perception that people travel really fast and i have the data that they don't travel fast they travel like every few months or even i think the average is seven months now it's very slow so the the word digital moment is it's a horrible word of course we have so many connotations but it's mostly remote working people who want a little bit of a different life want to see different places a little bit um you know they have boyfriends girlfriends wives husbands they have kids even this family is doing this as well moving around every week doesn't really work being very slow is big and if people are more aware of that they can find a lot of products built for this long term slow mad market which most of us are we're mostly slo-mats and i'm a little mad also slow meds yes think about education think about like homeschooling is taking off also because of remote work uh if i have kids i i don't know if i want to put him in a regular school maybe you know elon musk builds his own school that's kind of cool but you can do things in a different way and like now it's still very we're still niche like this remote work thing is still niche it's going to get only bigger there's only going to be more more people doing this once physical jobs get automated so um if you make products i have no specific product but if you know if you build products for those people that's a high-end market of like tech workers that are most so if you don't but you said that you don't own stuff or you you kind of said like you don't like owning stuff you said that you you said that you don't want to own real estate so if you're making two and a half million dollars a year in profit this is a question that sean always asks that i'm stealing it which is what do you do with your money then yeah so i'm heavy in etfs um i read a blog post by what's his name the guy from google that does seo and he's like i just put everything into in etfs so vanguard etfs s p 500 um but also i'm heavily invested in asia because i believe in asia i believe in the future i know the west there's a lot of things about asia that are good but it's very i still think it's very futuristic and um i also invest in crypto like i hold bitcoin and ethereum um it's always scared to say those things on the podcast right but it's all like very secure and stuff so it's not exactly the most shocking thing to us every tech guy every tech girl is crypto yeah exactly but i i mostly you're actually not allowed to have that haircut if you don't own like three yeah you can't have a high fade with like long top hair yeah yeah if you don't on three um i spend about like four five k a month or something that's it so most of it is just uh i do need to pay tax but after that most of it goes to you know etfs and stuff it's scary to invest now because it's a scary time but generally i'm like i want to do this for 20 30 years in etf invested and stuff and sometimes stocks but my i did a benchmark my s p 500 etf outperformed all my stock decisions over the last two years so i'm stupid just like most people sean you want to tell them what you did recently what oh selling with your stocks yeah yeah so i sold not everything but pretty much everything sold maybe 70 80 of the stocks that i hold um i get that i mean yeah but yeah i'm scared they always say like don't try and time the market so i'm like okay i'll just sit and just crash with the you know why didn't you do that why don't you just like chill uh two reasons one i didn't want to risk a margin call because i borrowed a little bit against my stock portfolio but and you know to what i felt was extremely safe and it's still safe but i was like ah look if this drops another you know 20 then all of a sudden i'm having a headache that i don't want to deal with i don't want to have to deal with freeing up a bunch of cash just to buffer this so i was like i noticed that every morning i was waking up and i was checking it and i was like okay logically i know i'm in pretty good shape here but the stress of having to think about this is taking away from my like you know my day-to-day quality of life it's like that's the opposite of what i want money to do i don't want money to give me stress my money's supposed to take away my stress so what did you do with the money the opposite what did you do with it where is that it's in cash right now um like i might do something like whatever some short term you know fixed incomes type stuff but like for now i was like again i don't care like i don't need the two percent i needed the peace of mind and so that was the first thing the second thing was i thought what will i regret more what do i believe more do i believe that this is the bottom or do i believe that this is kind of like actually thinking that this is the bottom you know six months in and that it's all going to get better soon but basically like there's three paths either it gets better now it stays this is about the bottom but we stay here for an extended period of time one two three four years or it has further down to go and i basically thought that it getting things going up soon seemed like the least likely thing like i would i would actually be betting against that heavily and so i thought okay i have nothing to lose here in terms of upside because i just fundamentally don't think that stocks and everything's just going to go ripped back up again and we're all going to pretend like you know that was it we just had a few months of pain and then it all went right back up and and remember things go things are all green again so i thought either it's gonna be flats boring and sideways for a period of time or it's gonna go down more and i thought well in either case then i won't regret being in cash because a i don't have to sweat it every day i don't have to think about it every day and b i'm there's no i'm not losing anything during you know by doing this and so that was my thought process and i figured okay there's going to be these little bear market rallies so just sell at the top of the next so that's what i did everything rallied five percent i just sold and i kept like i don't know twenty percent still in the market and i just put left the other eighty percent in uh and you know not thinking about it cash but i held my crypto i didn't sell my crypto that's good yeah are you guys mostly invested in the american uh stock market or worldwide yeah like you said i believe in asia i'm like yeah i believe in asia too but i don't know what the [ __ ] you're talking about how do i go invest in asia and where would i invest i don't even know what what does that mean are you buying the equivalent of like an etf for like japan or something what are you doing dude i had a vanguard etf china and then suddenly disappeared from my broker app and i'm like what the [ __ ] is happening and i get this message they're like vanguard left china in march or something because they were like this is too crazy i don't know got something like yeah no privatize or did something made private companies public or something yeah no they they [ __ ] jack ma for sure there's a lot of weird [ __ ] happening but i still think i should be invested in in those markets and uh um have i told you about the jack mom thing how it's crazy that the third richest man in the world that they were trying to was like hey dude shut up and he's like yes sir they just took jack my brother-in-law calls me like so we had one moment where like a month in when people started noticing jack ma's missing and my brother-in-law in the car one day was just like where's jack ma like if he was in the car but he's like bro why aren't we talking about this he's like where's jack and we just started laughing like how crazy is that that jack ma is just not like what if you just couldn't find elon musk because he said something you know that that biden didn't like like that the idea is crazy they did it with the tennis player too yeah i saw that my brother-in-law still calls me he'll be like he'll just call me out of the blue it's been like a year now he'll be like yo where's jack ma and then he'll hang up and like that's the whole call it's so great you just feel like he's yelling where is jack ma but dude that's the thing with asia and china like all the stuff is accurate there's some crazy [ __ ] um but the other thing is also accurate that there's there's lots of happening in in asia and i think in the west in europe and america we have a blind spot because we get so much information that's negative about asia especially about china and i'm i'm not a china spy or something my friends call me china spy because of that but i think it's a blind spot a little bit in the west uh we're gonna miss out on you know i mean china is gonna be the biggest economy in 2030 i think by gdp it's already the biggest economy people pitching power parity or something um ignoring that just you know because there's a lot of arguments why we should ignore china but it sounds like a blind spot in the west a little bit to me do you uh er what well i'll do it we'll do an easy one do you act you like tweeted out your calendar and it was like free for a week or something like that and i know sean and i i i kind of like that sometimes i don't like that because i'll do that for three days and i'm like oh my god i'm so bored it are you is it real that you just don't play in anything yeah so this is the only plan thing and it gives me stress because i'm like oh [ __ ] this summer's coming up um but i mostly like i spend my days like i live with my friends so my friends are my neighbors now so i brought all these nomads friends to portugal and europe and we kind of live together a lot of a lot of them are in the city near here whatever everyone's kind of near so we just have like dinners outside and we cook food and the sunset on the beach and just this nice chill life that i never had because i was alone in hotel rooms i had friends but they were always around the world and now they're all kind of here so i mostly do that so i don't want to do calls about like because what am i going to call about like i like having calls with you guys what am i going to call with other people about like new business i don't know don't you get bored like no because i can i because i work on my websites right i open my make coffee i make open my laptop meet my friend and we code a little bit together make a new feature um you know then you go to the gym we go to sauna uh we go swim uh that kind of like but that's very reason right this kind of chill life and i don't get bored as long as i ship a little bit on my websites i don't really get bored you're like the only rich per so basically it's almost always the truth that no matter how hard you try the more income that you make your life your lifestyle gets inflated uh maybe sometimes not as much but then other times a ton and like i was like oh i'm gonna fight it like i can't imagine spending more than ten thousand dollars on a car or whatever and then you make more income you're like uh whatever who cares um you said you spend four or five thousand dollars a month you're one of the few people that has acknowledged that your lifestyle actually doesn't seem like it's been it's it's not no at all it's 100 on purpose like it's very um incidentally sometimes you spend more right like last month was the hotels were really booked so we had to pay a lot of money but now it's chill again um i think it's on purpose because i try to follow like last one was like 10k or something that's still that's where you know we're in lisbon you're making three million dollars a year yeah but paying 10k for a hotel is ridiculous it doesn't make any sense like it should be the max like two or three k for me personally but i've seen a lot of people um do that lifestyle inflation because i know from corporate from again from studying business i know the management management people and stuff they get paid more and they get golden handcuffs right and they can't leave a lot of my friends are like that and i don't want that to happen to me i mean can't have it to me but you get what i mean um and i know that material goods don't really make me happy so i buy a new shirt or something or i buy a new iphone within two weeks i'm used to it and there's studies on this there's like research about this stuff like if you buy a new car even if you get married after six months you're the same happiness if you buy a house after six months same happiness so if you know that stuff you know that okay you don't really need to spend money so much you don't need to buy stuff essentially and um generally it will probably make you happier do you what do you think you would want to spend more on let's say that like you know food like good food like organic uh you know free roaming i mean it's cliche like joe rowan right but free roaming grass fat cow beef you know that are happy animals organic vegetables uh you know that kind of stuff like not goods you know experiences right it's on purpose i do this what what are some of my experiences that you think are worth the money what sorry what are some experiences that are like worth the money that you know when most experiences no so that's yeah you're right so man you got me like you're trying to find like stuff right yes i fly business guys because no exactly i'm done with uh i i can't sit i only do it long haul and i only fly like i flew only once in the last 16 months and i flew business qatar really nice and you can lie down and sleep and stuff but that's about it i think and you notice one thing i noticed like i was in bangkok in this luxury kind of apartment hotel stuff but it was a little bit too luxury for me you know and i was there for a month and you start noticing that you don't meet as much interesting people like i met one instant person who had this giant wheat farm the biggest wheat farm in thailand because i just legalized it was kind of cool but generally it's a very different it's more like a socialite kind of paris hilton audience you know but in the hostels you would meet crazy people you would need backpackers but also like researchers and entrepreneurs and fledgling entrepreneurs you know you met generally more interesting people because you were more uh in those areas and i found the problem yeah sorry did i tell you about did i tell you guys listen to this sean did i tell you about sam corkos from levels level other levels uh what's the oh yeah i know yeah levels so the the levels health the thing that goes in your arm so this guy so he raised yeah that's right he raised uh so he has a startup that makes eight figures in revenue it's worth i think it was 400 million dollars so let's just say that he's worth 150 million on paper not real on paper he came over to my house and he was with his girlfriend and she made a comment like joking like oh you know he always gives me a hard time because it takes me forever to pack but that's ridiculous i only had this one carry-on and i was like well how long does it take you to pack sam he goes oh i don't pack i was like what do you mean he's like well he had a drawstring bag you know what a drawstring bag it's like a bag that like where you can get these at conferences yes he had that's all he had was that bag and he goes well you see i only own the clothes that i'm wearing right now which is a white t-shirt a pair of pants socks underwear and shoes i only own that plus another pair of underwear a jacket and uh this bag and my laptop which i have right here on me that's literally the only thing that i own wait what he goes yeah i've been doing i've been doing this for like eight years now or something like that and i only live and like i do what you do he's like he does what you do peter he lives in um like these airbnbs and hotel style setups and he's been doing it for years and that's all he owned and i thought that was the craziest laundry every day i don't understand how is he well i was like i was like so i was like well what if you gotta go to a funeral what if you have to do this he goes well i just go to a thrift store um when i need to go and i buy stuff and then i just bring it back and he does it partly out of i think this is my guess he does it partly out of um like convenience of not wanting to worry about stuff i also think that there's like a philosophy like a very philosophical thing going on here because it's like extreme but have you ever heard of anyone peter being that crazy dude yes actually like in 2014 i was in chiang mai and it was an australian guy who would fly from australia to thailand to chiang mai with only his macbook air and the clothes he wore and not even a bag and he would buy everything he needed on the spot and he would be there for like two or three months uh and he would donate the clothes he wore to charity and then he would fly back to australia with his macbook air in his hand i was so impressed this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform where everything is fully integrated well i can see the clients hold history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago i totally missed hubspot grow better that see that's cool i would do that because i think that actually adds to the experience of traveling like traveling fully light and then when you get there so yeah find what you need and then giving it away when you leave like i'm i'd actually get down with that but like i i rotate to underwear and i put my underwear in my bag no but i think it comes down to philosophy and i do think it sounds pretentious but i don't care uh it comes down to constraining your life in a certain way i think constraints are good in creativity in life and stuff and um it makes you focus on the really important things in life for you personally it must be different for everybody you know for me that's like you know girlfriend friends health food you know happiness all that stuff kind of and and creative work meaningful work very important like i need to be able to i need to have something to do in my day i need to feel like i'm contributing something like sam said and uh so what do you own so i have a backpack i have a rolling suitcase though like a small one um i have clothes i have a iphone macbook pro uh i have a toothbrush um you can name all the things you own right i have two stadia control controllers like gamepads you can use stadia here it's kind of cool um yeah that's about it i think i mean i mean i have like backup phones and stuff because you know two-factor authentication stuff but it's not you think you're gonna do this you mentioned you could talk about your family or not if you want but do you think you're gonna do this when you have kids so what does doing it mean because i'm mostly settled down i'm also in one place i'm just like trying to not by doing it as in uh not owning stuff i mean like i i think your life is cool but you have to acknowledge that this alternative in the sense of like you know one percent of those but yeah yeah for sure for sure i think it's interesting that like the stuff i do may or may not become a thing because a lot of things i did eight years ago now are normal right so it might be that the things that who cares become i mean if you're happy who cares if be oh no it's not about me it's more like yeah it's more like it might become nature um i think uh i think even if you have kids you can do it in an alternative way you can uh you know you can go to thrift store get like secondhand toys or something secondhand clothes that kind of stuff but it all doesn't have to be this so consumerist and and buying and you know i mean it can we can do it in a different way and um i'm just trying to figure out like how how i yeah i want to do that and we've trying to focus on yeah a nomadless style red pill before briefly which was um my i forgot what it's called sam do you remember the name of like the zero waste project or the zero the zero project or something like that so basically my wife told me about this she was like yeah you know there's like uh like in the city in the little town we live in there's uh like this facebook group and what they do is it's just like it's like a barter it's like oh it's not even a barter economy it's like a giving economy so it's like if you have stuff you just give it into the giving circle and other people can take it out and then they can give stuff in it's basically like oh your kid i think it's a lot around kids stuff like my kids grown out of this but that's it it doesn't make sense right yeah like craigslist randos it's like yeah amongst this trusted group of people who buy nothing the same thing but the buy nothing project yeah um and i think i might have butchered exactly how it works sam do you do you know a little bit how well it's just the idea of like um instead of like reduce reuse recycle it like for like consumer or for like plastic and [ __ ] they're like no no let's just like uh reuse we're gonna reuse everything so instead of buying a new toy we're gonna go get one for free and then we're gonna give away when we're done it's just a mindset and then there's uh there's a bunch of companies in the space but the big one is like this uh buy nothing series of facebook groups we're just like i'm gonna give away i'm giving away these children's clothes come get them yeah i think i mean it's that's nice like it doesn't make any sense you have a baby and it grows out of its clothes every month or something or every two months so why would you buy everything new if you can ask your family for clothes they already wore whatever right it makes more sense to me personally um yeah who do you want to be like who do you who do you admire and who do you want to be like because like the reason why people buy [ __ ] for their kids is because they want to have they want their kids to have jordan so they look cool for other people because they want to impress other people who do you want to impress and who do you want to be like you think like who do you look up to um i i like derek sivers i don't know if you know derek sivers yeah he's uh tell me about him who is he he's um he started a company called cd baby in the 90s i think or in early 2000s and which was like one of the first uh indie kind of music distributors where you could send your music as any uh musician and they would press the cds for you and they would send it to your customers and stuff and and they also know on spotify and stuff and he stole those for 30 million dollars i interviewed him for my best first thesis actually he's really nice guy like the most nice guy in startups i think and he's very he writes a lot he writes a lot of books now he's very philosophical also kind of nomadic he's been in like living in singapore he lived in new zealand lived in u.s and stuff and he's very um if you go to his website like derek severus.org surface.org i think he writes very much kind of same concepts that i talk about like um about simple life and and uh yeah it's hard to describe him but i think that's a very inspirational guy to me and i don't really need to impress i think i want to impress my parents just but they're already happy with me so it doesn't really matter i want to um i want to try and stay have like a stable you know happiness because i've been depressed a lot i've been anxious i had like especially when traveling you go crazy in these you know in hotel rooms alone like um traveling can can it brings you very deep into your own self and stuff and i think the most important of me is to impress myself by just you know being stable and and having a stable happy life with with people around me and uh yeah like kind of wholesome life you know and that's my what part of your life are you not impressed by for your either yourself or derek sivers or if any if any of those people right you just mentioned like the lifestyle you mean yeah what part of your life is not at that point where they're you you feel like it's not impressive in that way that that like well like i want to have a family too like you guys uh and that's what i'm working on um and yeah that's like that's more of a focus now you know like pretty easy by the way you just got to do one thing i'll tell you to find the right girlfriend you know and then you need to see if they're not crazy you need to like connect and all this stuff and i think uh yeah that's that's it don um dude sean you have a yeah go ahead go ahead go ahead i wanna hear what you say no i mean like a little bit like you say like like i think about elon musk every time elon musk presents something you're like oh [ __ ] like that's so cool like why am i building shitty internet websites this is my only life i have i'm gonna die i should do something bigger but then i have to like bring myself back to like no it's cool you're doing okay like doesn't really need to be bigger but i mean everybody wants to make like space rockets i guess but it's just so hard to do that you know sean you um you have a you have a dog right a little dog yep i've got a big dog how do i love yeah yeah so you like animals i love owning animals like big aggressive looking dogs that's what that's my thing it's like i'm a weirdo how do you live this the the i want to live a little bit more like you it's and i can do it uh a now because i have a little bit of money so i can just like pay for fancier airbnbs that are pet friendly and b i can only do it basically in america doing this lifestyle abroad with an animal even in america i drive you either have to fly private or you have to drive most places um i drive most places how do you how do you live this life with an animal i don't have animals but i want them i had i had two cats with my ex-girlfriend and it was actually interesting we went to in bangkok to this this luxury apartment hotel and they were cat friendly and it was like this you know high society of bangkok people with cute cats and cute dogs and asia all the dogs are small they like small dogs i like big dogs too like you sam but uh and they walk around in the hotel and it's super cute and they have like cats and dog ice cream and stuff and food and they have little like a little beds for them to sleep in and stuff and everything is serviced and that's another big market i think you know tech people with pets and stuff they want to travel as well dude sean have you looked into have you guys looked into flying in america with an animal so basically if you're why do you think i don't go places dude your animal's under 20 pounds right yeah she is but like that also means like she's not like tough enough to do all this stuff like we're like oh god how's she gonna handle this experience um you know of going on a seven-hour flight or whatever yeah but she she's the dog's able to so like in term i don't i don't know if she's physically able to but she's allowed to you could put it in a carrier and put it on your lap or like in the above whatever the suitcase thing and if you have an animal that's above 20 pounds who's putting their dog in the above thing you can put your dog down i don't know dude it's like it's like putting a blanket over a it's like putting a blanket over a bird cage it's i i don't know that's just what you put it underneath you you put it underneath there whatever you [ __ ] do i don't know i don't have one of these things but uh that's what they say on the directions when you look online but uh uh like if you have an animal above 20 pounds you cannot bait you basically cannot this whole emotional support animal thing that's kind of nonsense it's kind of getting phased out you cannot bring an animal a dog on a flight i i'm always amazed that for popular routes they don't have like a once a month or twice a month animal friendly right it's gonna happen it's absolutely gonna happen it's a huge growing market i think because a lot of something rich people are not having kids sorry right i was gonna say i read something that one airline is like being like yeah we'll fly pets like i think they do a lot of pets in the cargo or whatever because most airlines have been phasing that out and one i think it's southwest i forgot which airline some airline is making bank because they take all the pets and uh it was like a differentiator it's like you know bags fly free but it's like hey we let you fly your pet and everybody else is saying no nowadays man i think you can do it you can i think it's all about slow matting so if you do if you move like every let's say every six months it's not that bad for the dog or the cat uh and you you give them a stable life in where you arrive and not too much chaos and stuff i think it's okay i think it's not okay if you keep moving like every week or every month this might be a little bit stressful for the dog and the cat right but six months like yeah it's okay and especially if you get a tweet you had a great tweet it was if you don't have a dog in your profile picture on twitter are you even trying it's a growth hack it's the biggest growth right sam has one right you have a facebook picture i think uh yeah you can guys use this on tinder right this was a dinner dating trick like you you because they swipe right for the dog not for you but they still swipe right so yeah i've noticed there's like two hacks when i was single if like if i ever walk around with like a niece or a nephew or like a kid uh that's like an automatic door opener to meet women and then the other one was having a a an aggressive but nice looking dog it's like doors i'm all they're disarmed we're good you know and why does that be aggressive but aggressive looking but nice is that one of those things where it's like dog owners look like they're pets and so if your dog looks a certain way they'll think that about you they want to heal you you know like women want to heal you sometimes they're like it's like seeing a guy with like a sleeve tattoos who smokes cigarettes in a tattoo under his eye who like you know just wants to like spend time and cuddle you know like it's like so it's really good it's you know you're you're you're eclectic i don't know it just works don't ask me uh that just works yeah um so dude i love summer yet dogs by the way the big white polar bear dog right and i think it's very strange like it's it's so fluffy it's like that's a very asian move of you that's they're very popular in asia right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i've seen him here too yet but yeah what are some is there anything that people assume about your life and your lifestyle and your businesses uh that you like for example with the hustle as well as sean's milk road a lot of people are like oh that's it it's just a [ __ ] newsletter you just write these these words and you just hit send that's so easy anyone can do it and it's like well no it's actually like a user acquisition play like you gotta know how to do that and then it's also like you're just not good at writing like you have to be good and that's just talent you either have it or you don't and so that that's like some misconceptions about our businesses what about yours is there anything that um people always assume and you're like no because like people can anyone can copy you yeah i think generally people think that every uh website or app or company they're a customer of that it's more simple than actually is because you can't see behind the hood and it's actually way more complicated than you think because there's so many edge cases in every business that you need to code like if statements for or build like little scripts for special features it's much more complicated and i think people realize that when they start because people always clone you right like they make a copycat of your website and somehow doesn't take off because they've been able to copy the outside of it the aesthetic kind of but they don't know what's happening under the hood so it's um it's much more complicated like dude a job board is much more complicated uh than you think like um [ __ ] how do you explain this there's so many little parts that you know especially companies want they want you know invoices for every little thing they add the price is dynamic that kind of stuff i i changed job post pricing based on how many people post jobs on my site for example there's so much stuff happening behind the curtains that you don't see yeah it's much more complicated i was thinking about the misconception about yeah sorry and a lot of your stuff is automated to where like you don't have to be involved it kind of runs itself you said everything's automated i think 99.99 and to post on your job board it ranges from a hundred to a thousand dollars i think whatever the huge range for sure yeah yeah how would you for the like i'm i'm tinkering with something that costs many many thousands of dollars a year is there how would you figure out how to do that like and so in my head i'm like [ __ ] i gotta hire a bunch of sales people that sucks do you think that you could automate most things even that are high ticketed items oh for sure dude i sell job post bundles for like 50k via stripe which is like amazing for me to me like i'm like how do you do that that works so you make a page called buy bundle and you have the this you can go to remote okay dot com slash buy bundle and you'll see like a slider where you can make your own bundle and get a discount based on it and it's all automated and you add your credit cards and then you pay you know 50k or 40k whatever and how many people do that oh yeah it's it's like a lot of it's like 30 of the revenue i think bundles no [ __ ] so someone's use yeah using a debit card or whatever for 50k yeah dude these company cards this is what this is lagging information people don't know the company cards have been upgraded i think because they're using it for much more these days really like it's a lot of money and i have no idea like i never thought like i don't i'm not hiring people i don't know how this works i just tried like okay maybe i think companies ask me like can we buy a few job posts for in the future i'm like okay i'll make this thing and a lot of companies use this so you figure out the features that people want based on uh talking to them of course dude i'm looking at the sales pages by bundle so by 25 25 jobs is 22 000 you do something interesting on your sales pages is you just pack it with information that's totally the right move but you pack it with text like you use icons to kind of break it up the emojis yeah i use emojis a lot yeah no it looks like a circus right but it kind of works it's not like well-designed right it's not like minimalist design it's just like i just add stuff every day and it just keeps growing but it works kind of what's the biggest purchase someone has made i can scroll up i got to jump through it i got another call i got i gotta run too peter this has been amazing i gotta go yeah nice to meet you sean see ya what's uh what what has been the biggest purchase that you've had this scrolls all the way up to 150 000. i think 50k or something around 50k maybe 49. but that happens that happens a lot yeah yeah yeah yeah this is crazy yeah i'm working on this thing and like it's like 10k a year and i'm like oh man i'm gonna have to like get on the phone all the time yeah seeing you is quite in inspiring but i get annoyed if i if i need to use like i want to use these uh location service apis to figure out where are people traveling to for example and it's always like you need to do a sales call you need to like contact us and stuff and i get so annoyed with it and i know people on twitter get annoyed with it that they can't get a price directly and sign up you know um yeah i think it's much easier to do like this like a sales flow um i think it's easier i would argue maybe for me it's easier for you but i would actually argue there's there's a world where it's not effect as effective though because i would i'm in the same boat as use i don't want to have to do all this crap and i'm not naturally a sales person but when i hired a sales team and uh they they shockingly were shockingly good at drumming up demand and i remember a cool podcast with the founder of squarespace i think it was and he was like you he's an engineer he's like i don't want to leave my room i don't like talking to people i like freedom and he goes and he goes the biggest one a huge mistake i made was i looked down on sales people and i looked down on this like type of pricing where i think i got to get him on the phone but he was like i looked down on it and i was wrong it was effective they dr they created demand for a product and that surprised me most so like yeah i don't know i think so i think you're right i think my problem is that it's it's been it's very hard to meet good salespeople or to find them and it's unclear for me how i how i can hire them and um you know i how can i rate a person to hire them uh as a good salesperson i don't know what's a good salesperson and i i've never done outbound almost never done outreach and stuff um and i'm scared that if i hire sales people i need to manage them and then you know they might [ __ ] up they might start spamming everywhere in linkedin and then it becomes like a screenshot thing on twitter like look peter levels is spamming with his website and stuff that might turn bad and i think you're right if you get the right sales people it can work i just i'd never been able to you know find those people it just matters what you're optimizing for if you're optimizing for happiness and a well if you're opting for happiness and like a good life do it your way your way is working really well if you want to like grow at a certain rate per year and you want to really push it i i do think a sales person is is you do need a sales team but that's not what you're optimizing for you're optimizing for freedom so and happiness yeah and i also think that there's this there's different types of companies for example there's companies that ask for a lot of forms like they want like a w8 form like all these us irs forms and stuff they want you to sign everything they want you to sign an nda and and there's some companies that just you know enter their credit card on stripe and it's done and it's different customers and the customers that ask for a lot of questions on email they generally convert less for me they pay less money and they are more of a hassle to you know do customer support for and stuff um so you also you get different types of customers if you do it all automatically you get more kind of modern customers that are easier to deal with i think is there anything that we didn't talk about that you wanted to talk about um no i think i think we maybe transparency like the reason i'm so transparent is uh um i think it's very like i said i think it's very important to to to be honest and to to show other people that you can build a a nice indie company like this um by sharing every like ups and downs of it um and instead of because everybody else is only sharing like the good things and the we're growing so fast and we're hiring and we're funded and blah blah and i think it would be cool if we did business in a maybe in a more wholesome way where we uh you know share everything and share the ups and downs and uh yeah maybe not grow super super super big but more in a you know wholesome manner i have a i like that but i have a few critiques the first is yeah i think that if you're high so you remember buffer so buffer uh they did the whole stick they did it even more extra well equally as extreme as you i would say but they revealed one of my inspirations for sure yeah but they revealed everyone's salary and they did that yeah i think they did it as a marketing shtick they did it because they're like well like you know like our products okay it's good enough but like let's come up with a cool shtick so we stick out and it aligns with our philosophy it's great and it worked really well for them but i actually think that it probably hurts them after a while it's really hard to do that after 100 or 150 i don't know what the number is some amount of employees because you're like dude i don't want my [ __ ] all out there and when if i was you like i don't like like when we sold our company i didn't exactly reveal how much i made because i'm like man i don't want to be a target i don't want people to take advantage of me i don't want to be judged in a particular way i don't want that type of attention so i'd rather just say like round whole numbers instead of like exactly no there's a real there's a real security risk for sure yeah like you don't want to talk about where you are right now yeah yeah part of it is because yeah for sure 100 yeah yeah 100 part of the downside but at the same time it's a marketing it's maybe it's agree it agrees with your with your life philosophy and also it's a pretty sick marketing stick like yeah thank you yeah i think it's all it's hard to stop it because i've been doing it for so long it's become part of my identity it would be hard to like hide all this stuff now and they're like where did this open page go like why are you not sharing anymore i'm like i'm just done with it now um you know yeah and i don't think it's it's this recurring marketing machine that i think is a big part of why uh my businesses work became successful and why i got a lot of audience on twitter it's because of this i cannot deny that so it's very hard to quit that right once you've been doing it for so long yeah that's why i'm nervous about even doing it in the first place yeah yeah yeah you know it's kind of like a i haven't gone hard on youtube or any other social platform because i'm like oh i don't want a commitment uh like you gotta keep up i wanted to do youtube as well and i have the same problem yeah i'm like this is gonna be a new recurring like activity i need to do every week i need to upload a video make a video yeah i think there's a world where you could do seasons you know like a tv show has a season i think there's a world where you could do seasons and do quite well but uh the majority of people do it like regularly and i'm like oh man i don't want to get on that treadmill that's scary no i think it burns you out like look at all the youtubers burning out it's uh they all bail extreme yeah yeah yeah it's extreme schedule yeah i think this is my i think it might be interesting if i just sit in front of the laptop like this and i just tell the stuff i i know and i think and instead of writing it down and just making like little videos uh derek savers also did that he makes little videos about small topics you know five minutes explain something in the next video and so alex for mostly is doing it uh the guy on our pod he came on our podcast alex for mosey he's been doing it lately and he loves it and he and it seems it seems like a lot kind of a lot of work but not that much work no more work in this podcast and i don't consider this podcast to be too much work um but it works well but uh dude thanks for coming on this has been fun i uh i hope you you will come on more often and we'll do a little more brainstorming this time yeah there was super fun thanks for having me yeah hopefully we didn't you you said you were nervous because we were going to ask you no but no i don't think we asked anything because we didn't ask anything crazy yeah cool there's not much to ask when you tell everyone on the internet about everything you do yeah this is always when the good part of the podcast starts right because you end it and then like the the real [ __ ] hopefully not the real stuff i hope was was going on the whole time it was great um yeah dude thanks this is awesome um pimp out your stuff so it's at levels yeah it's a twitter.com levels io so l-e-v-e-l-s-i-o um and there's all the links for my websites there so you can click from there thanks dude thanks for coming [Music] you

large percentage of jobs in the tech world are jobs they're only there because the person who's running this particular division has to request more budget and hire more so they get more responsibility and more credit they seem more important so then when they go to their next company they get paid more and they climb the ladder because it seems like you manage 200 people you must be legit if everybody got the same budget and then you were just measured on how much you got done and you got to keep the extra i think companies would work wildly differently than they do today

so this is what i call it the trillion dollar venn diagram success right uh i just made that up but so you draw those circles of your skills and say okay well i'm now not like one in a million i'm one in a billion right or one in five billion whatever that is and if you can convert that into some kind of monetizable business thing or whatever that's when magic sort of happens so that's kind of thing number one it's like what's your thing what are your skills um and what drives ones how much value will that intersection create is two things one is how rare is that intersection whether it's two circles or three circles or whatever how rare is it and then the other one is [Music] so on the pod right now we've got darmesh darmesh is the uh founder of hubspot he's uh your technical title cto right that is correct i see you more it means that uh that you have to do the ad reads for your own company today why are we talking about hubspot you do the ad reads you tell people why we're talking about hospital because you guys do a much better job i am terrible at that i'm terrible at the promotion side of things but the uh sean do you you're renting a house right now yeah and darmas you do not rent though right not anymore i did for a long long time i'm a big believer in rentals as it turns out but i uh i'm staying in brooklyn for the summer and i rent uh a furnished house and it or apartment and it is so much better than owning a place and having to worry about stuff all the time it is so much better i i think i i'm about the renting train i think now like i've kind of been there but like i actually love it more do you like it because sean you owned a place in san francisco for like four years and then now you rent again way better in fact every time something breaks i now just have joy to be like let me call somebody else it's their problem their cost to fix they have to arrange it they have to do whatever and i don't have to think about it plus also in california property taxes are like insane or like in san francisco because the the house price is so high so you know even if you try to do the calculation it's so hard to beat just this annual property tax every single time on rent wait so dumbass if you if you had the choice again i mean i i think maybe perhaps you bought because like your wife wanted to or your kids wanted to but if it was up to you even with the family would you be a renter if it was up to me yes um because just the the decrease in maintenance and wear and tear on one's psyche and soul that ownership uh you know bestows upon you is just not worth it it's that's that's my thing it's just like like i don't want to worry about those things i want to i want to get as close to like living in the matrix as i possibly can right and renting is a step closer to being in the matrix we don't have to worry about physical things and atoms and things like that it's like that's somebody else's problem how how many people in your socio-economic like ballpark like uh you know founders of multi-billion dollar companies or people like you do you think also rent because i think that'd be a if it were a fair amount that would be fairly shocking to a lot of people but do you know a bunch of people that are similar to you that still rent i know people that are similar to me in terms of they would prefer renting because i've talked to them about this but almost everyone i know now once you get a family once you have like other things that you're trying to factor in um for instance uh you know one of the things my wife loves gardening and loves having a yard and that's kind of hard to do in a rental um not that you can't do it but it's right one thing that a guy told me who who's similarly you know i think he's probably got like a 10 or 10 or 20 million dollar house he was like it he's like renting is amazing until you want until your wife wants a specific house and then once your wife wants a specific house or in a specific neighborhood that neighborhood like like higher end neighborhoods have no rentals so you just can't get into that neighborhood which means you can't have whatever so then you're forced into a different path and so i thought you know it's a it's a version of good problems to have so we'll count it that way um all right what are we what are we talking about where should we start well you have a few things left over from the last episode sean i don't know if we want to jump into some of those um let's do one because i think you will have a take on this so so have you ever read i don't know do you know paul graham by the way i do we're not best buddies or anything but i do know of him i've met him yeah so he's from boston right or cambridge cambridge yep yeah so you guys know one another he wrote a blog post back in 2008 it was october 2008 so this is like right after the the crash and it's it's just if you go to paulgram.com bad economy um is the name of the blog post and he makes this case where he goes the economic situation is apparently so grim that some experts fear we may be in for a stretch as bad in the mid 70s which is when microsoft and apple were founded and as those examples suggest like a recession may not be such a bad time to start a startup but he which you've heard before but i thought there's one interesting part where he goes i'm not saying it's a good time either the truth is more boring the economy doesn't matter much either way for a founder starting a startup and i actually thought that was a really good point because i hear this so much it's like i'll talk to kind of young founders and they listen to twitter and they listen to podcasts and they listen you know they listen to kind of these like a lot of it's like you know vcs who are you know also pandemic experts and also you know you know macroeconomists as well and so they hear and then they they sort of start to adjust their plans and their mental models and like their room for everything it's like dude if you're a startup you're like an ant in this world does the ant care what's going on with the presidential election no like you basically just need to build a product you need to carry your little piece of dirt it's like build a product get a customer get 10 customers like it doesn't matter if the economy is bad if you can't get 10 customers it's not gonna work anyways and so i thought it was a great little blog post talking about like kind of starting a startup during the downtime which is where i think we're about to or we just officially entered a recession again so yeah i was curious dharmesh do you have any thoughts on that yeah so my position is i lean more towards kind of paul graham end of the spectrum which is i think it's either neutral that it doesn't matter it's uh one of the things you're suggesting uh towards positive um and the positive elements of being in a a kind of downturning economy or recession is that things become available that would not have been available to a startup before like talent uh it's like oh well there are people sitting at meta facebook or sitting at google right now that may be reevaluating their lives or they may have just been let go from a venture-backed uh company that raised 200 plus million dollars right so now you've got this um talent that's coming on the market that might not have come on the market before uh things that were super expensive like buying google adwords or certain marketing channels because you have this glut of money and a lot of venture capital you know i think of venture capital is a very efficient machine of turning like money from lps into google adwords revenue right that's uh they're just a conduit between the two um and as in a downward economy you're going to get less of that kind of glut of money flowing in which drives the cost overall down for certain things that i think are important to entrepreneurs so i'm i'm generally net positive that and down economy is actually a roughly good time to start a startup for like the last 18 months or you know whenever like the last 24 months when everything's been booming i've my wife works at airbnb and uh you know i've got a lot of friends that work at obviously hubspot and all these and sean was at twitch so we have like some some perspective on how on the salaries of big companies and i've seen some of these salaries and they are crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy as the as like a leader and uh the biggest shareholder of husband and you like see these see these numbers are you thinking to yourself like this like we can't afford to pay someone like an entry-level person 250 000 a year i don't know how this is going to work like what what's your perspective on that when when these salaries are going so high and now it's like a little bit normal more normal yeah but as a startup i mean you can't afford those salaries anyway right unless you're one of those kind of rare exceptions that has 50 plus million dollars going out of the gate which is uh very very rare and so you know one of the things a founder has to kind of get good at it's convincing really smart people to do this irrational thing which is join you in your startup right and if you can't if you can't do that if you can't make that sale which is the most important sale you'll make is being able to attract people and then it's customers um it's not going to work so you have to do what you have two things um either recognize kind of superstar talent and give them something they can't get um because it's beyond confidence it's like oh you'll learn more here oh you're gonna do your own startup someday this is the place to get your startup mba because you'll be exposed to a bunch of things you'll meet your future co-founder of the company those kinds of things um either you have to do that or you have to say i'm going to be really good at identifying diamonds in the rough people that have not made it uh to the 200 plus 300 000 plus dollar salary yet but they will someday i caught them early in their kind of evolution and so i can get them there's that so it has to be one or the other form of arbitrage otherwise you can't play the game that's just not uh i don't think it's viable i i i'm doing uh when you're saying that it's like resonating so much because it's basically all the three things we just talked about i'm doing it's like i started the milk road in january this year and so you know it's been it's about to be six months or it's been six months and um it's like here let me start a crypto company right when crypto crashes you know like 78 and at the beginning ben even my co-founder ben he was like you know um the only thing i can see going wrong is if crypto goes in a bear market i go well crypto's gonna go into a bear market like that's like one of the few certainties of crypto is that it goes up and down and when it does it is dramatic in all both ways it goes from the elevator is dramatic in both ways and i was like you know so it's just a question of like do you what do you think that kills it or do we just make it through like this that's really all we have to think about here um so that was the first part of starting in a bad economy the second one on talent was i recently hired this guy and he quit a pretty well-known uh venture-backed company that i think it just raised maybe 50 or 100 million dollars and he joined and i talked to him a little bit before he joined like he was thinking about doing his own startup he had we traded a couple emails nothing serious just he he wanted me to use his product then he took a job at this place all right whatever i forgot about him then he emails me and i shared this on twitter he emails me subject line i have made an irreversible decision and i was like okay i got to click this what's inside and he's like i just quit my job and i think you should hire me and i was like okay directed to the point and he tells me why blah blah blah and so i was like all right boom i'm sold very bold approach i already liked your hustle before this because when you were hustling to try to get me as your customer i was like this guy's good um so okay let's do this and i made him a job offer which was not like you know a silicon valley job offer but the guy lives in san francisco he was working for a silicon valley startup so he was like oh dude that's like a 50 pay cut and i was like um and i didn't i didn't say this out loud but in my head what i what i felt i i told him i was like that's what i could afford to pay right now and like look you come crush it the sky's the limit but like that's what i can pay you right now uh sight unseen and i said and in my head i was about to tell him the the line that i had heard from warren buffett you guys probably heard the story but when warren buffett goes and tries to work for his you know kind of hero or whatever ben graham and he's like you know i'll work for you for free and ben graham goes your price is too high sir which is which is the truth which is the idea that you got to shadow ben graham and work side by side with him every day was you should be paying for that if you really want to be like a successful investor that's how i felt and i didn't want to say it because it's kind of arrogant but it's like dude if i take you under my wing my team is like three people if you become one of those three and you're working out of my he came to my house yesterday you're sitting by me working out you know side by side every day like really i'm providing more value to you than you are providing to me at that point and like there's still a you know i i i appreciate the value you bring but let's like the dollar amount is um like uh the salary dollar amount is not what not the value you're getting uh and i think he knows that intuitively and that's why he said yes but like uh that ben graham story always stands out family no no he's a young guy just graduated from college but here's the thing i think people uh couple thoughts on that one is the salary slash compensation is just one vector of value that you get from a company that you join right another one that you get is you get the learning whatever it is that they get expose you to another one that you get is a network that you build while you're there right there so there's all these other things that also in kind of in aggregate and maybe and i think it's common for people to over index on the compensation or the kind of current compensation um and under index on other things that um and then there's just the just raw emotional value do you like being around the people that you're around uh do you enjoy the idea that you're working on like is that you know those things matter as it turns out um i have a fun hubspot story so when we started on this compensation thing uh you know ron and i had to pick salaries for ourselves something more than zero and so we picked five thousand dollars a month right it's like okay well that's it's it's a number um and uh obviously uh below market value we've been out in the market for a while and had worked in our lives uh so when we hired employee number three um we had to decide what we were gonna pay them five thousand dollars hired employee number four five thousand dollars and so we just like okay if you're here for the salary you're here for the wrong reason right that that's not why you're gonna join this motley crew of uh folks and that lasted for like a while it's like we and then we and then it kind of has this inertia built in where it's like okay well all of us sitting in the room chatting with you that we're trying to get you to join the company are all paying each other i'm paying ourselves five thousand dollars a month now what do you think you should be able to get when all of us are making five thousand dollars of course that doesn't last forever and you have to uh what was the pitch at that time so it's not like you know no offense to hubspot but it's not the sexiest idea you're not saying we're building the electric car here you know like you didn't have that going for you um you know you might have had like a you know your own magnetism which is like you know like for me i get this cheat code because like this guy he listens to the podcast and this happens this podcast is a great talent pipeline for us because people will listen to it and over time they just they decide for themselves either i think this guy's a dummy and he annoys me or i think this guy's smart and i really like you know i'd love to hang out with these guys i think i could learn a bunch from them and so it becomes an unfair advantage but you didn't have that back in the day so what was your how did you convince people to do this five thousand dollar you know lego block of uh salary building so we cheated a little bit right because um of the first eight people in the company seven of them uh came out of mit sloan the same school that brian i went to and we met in class so it was kind of in-network kind of thing it's like okay well it's just a bunch of friends that sort of know each other in network or whatever let's let's go do this thing right and it's also and they were kind of far enough along in their careers that they were not missing meals or anything like that right they had just gone to you know business school or relatively uh good business school and and so that was it like and then the other thing and this is the part there's equity but there's also the like this is not that risky dude like let's say this doesn't work out we end up being chumps so the idea is really bad three six months from now you will basically be able to pick up where you left off right there's like there's no loss other than the opportunity cost of those three to six months this is not like a irreversible lifetime decision that i've made this call and that's all i'm gonna have to be able to do for the next five or ten years um that was enough it's yeah um what did things change how many people do you think um how many people do you think at hubspot have made like eight figures because of their equity and once you worked with those people for a long time and you're like oh [ __ ] like we the company went public and like you don't need to work anymore and and does that change the dynamic um it hasn't so i'll to answer your questions uh i always have to there's this little it only takes like a second and a half for me to translate eight figures into what is that actually so that's ten million plus um yeah like maybe maybe five or ten million is like the number where you're like [ __ ] this i don't need this job uh probably somewhere in the 20 to 30 range if i had to guess of people that have made that much um you know over 50 maybe even 100 like millionaires in the seven figure range uh but even when that was happening right like well a couple of things one is it distorts it a little bit because as a private company even though the valuation from the last round or whatever is x uh the shares are not liquid right so they're worth it but they're worth it on paper they can't go out and actually sell their shares so that's kind of thing number one um and so it doesn't even if they wanted to doesn't we can't really change behavior you can't go off and um you know buy something with with uh with your shares so that's the number one the thing number two is that uh we did have like this kind of spree decor right it wasn't really about the money it was about winning it was about kind of building something together and i um i like to believe that it wasn't even really the idea that if we had taken that same early group of 20 25 people and parachute them into some other company in some other industry there's still software in sas that we would have likely done reasonably well as well i think it came down to the people have good chemistry they were focused on the right thing i think we um our early hiring policy was um to hire kind of smart people that get [ __ ] done that was kind of the the thing right we want people that have high what we call high wattage they were like measurably smart if you had to have them take an iq test we didn't do that but uh measurably smart uh but there's lots of very very smart people in the world but they have this kind of predilection to action like they could not help but like if they found a problem they're gonna go try and start solving they're gonna jump in um you know feet first and they're just going to do it or at first whatever the phrase is and that was enough so we had we made a deliberate decision not to hire what we call press release hires uh press release hires when you hire someone and then you feel compelled to issue a press release say oh hubspot just hired the vp of sales from such and such company whatever that has a 30-year background in doing x if we felt like we ever hired someone that was worthy of a press release we did it wrong right that's not the kind of person we were looking for because they may have done amazing things at google microsoft facebook pick your company of choice but the startup is such a different context and you're you're paying for these kind of specialized set of skills that may or may not be relevant uh arbitrage is really really hard so we're bigger on the identified diamonds in the rough people that are going to be big you know it's like you're buying a stock early um versus going after the folks that already were press release worthy so i think i uh that's been my skill sean you've kind of seen my journey i think my skill has been finding the diamond and the diamonds in the rough so we've had like well sean and i kind of discovered one another uh but then like there's steph smith who's now at a16z we had trung who's popular we've had a bunch of people who went on and founded different companies and what i've always looked for like i i purposely have looked for these diamond the roughs because i was like i can't afford you know to pay xyz so i gotta hire this 24 year old who i know will be a boss in like five or ten years sam it's not just that you can't afford them i remember once the hustle got to the point where you could afford them you were just kind of disgusted by the concept of somebody making that much money i remember you were just like how much do you how much does this kid over here work this like engineer at my office and i'd be like i don't know like whatever he's 150 170 you're like what 70 oh my god like this is uh you know if if this person left would the company fail no no not at all well it was like this is crazy that was ten years or that was the year yeah so things have changed a little bit uh but also like your people would show up to work at like noon and i'd be like what the hell man this guy like just waltzed in and like you're gonna get he's like he arrived right when they're serving lunch uh but uh we've we've like discovered some cool people and i always look for a couple things the first thing is actually this is from paul graham he goes i like to hire animals like people who like you're a little bit afraid of and they're like uh just like freaks where they work a lot i also work look for people who are like weird so i always want like weird people who have like fairly extreme opinions even if i totally disagree with their opinions i really like that someone's like well thought well well researched and has a strong opinion on something but i love like weirdos and eccentric people and i have found that if you can at our startup at the hustle we did a really good job of like accepting weirdos and letting them be odd and like we like embraced it and i always found that to be kind of like a a uh we used to say you know let your freak flag uh let your freak flag fly and uh we're like you know i don't i was like we'll have we had all types of different people we we had uh just just every type of like person we worked at our company and they'd like that we like embrace their odd they're kind of like them being different yeah we have something so we have you know five kind of core values as part of our hubspot culture one of them is is uh remarkability or being remarkable and what we mean by that is there's something noteworthy they've done in their past or there's something quirky something different something that's an outlier about them and it doesn't have to be specifically business or whatever even role that they're in but there's like they're just kind of like off the kind of main beat and that we've done well with those kinds of people we give them a home kind of let them uh do their thing and that tends to work out yeah so sam had weirdos and kind of like let your freak flag fly you have the um the remarkability have you done something remarkable we had one at bibo that was the same as we used to say we hired degenerates it's like intentionally a word that's usually negative right like we hired degeneres and what we said we would always ask me fur khan we noticed this in each other we were like dude we've gone through these phases in our lives where we just got really obsessed with something that didn't have a clear payoff like it wasn't the popular thing to be obsessed with um like it wasn't the like cookie cutter good thing to be obsessed like it wasn't like grades in school it would be like you know for kind of got really into you know um this video game and he's like yeah i became like a top 100 ranked player of this game and like it was a total like you know in one hand i knew it was like a waste of time but like i couldn't help it i just loved it and i obsessed with it i became the best at it and i just wanted to win like so badly and at some point i even stopped being about winning it was just like i wanted to like get to like the next level and and keep going and i had i had done the same thing with poker he had done it with poker also so we kind of identified these do you it's like hey do you go through these periods of like three years of deep obsession around some get competitive like thing and um and then when you do do you like really like try to study the game and figure out how to like what are the loopholes in the game what are the rules of the game you immerse yourself with other players in the game because like well cool our game now is just startups and we would try to find people who had some evidence of degeneracy it's like yeah you come in at noon because you stay up until four in the morning like building that uh soundcloud player that works like tiktok for no reason because you're so annoyed that soundcloud like is too slow in the way that they develop things it's like other people would look at that as like oh you're not really reliable or very structured or you you know why did you work on that that wasn't even like the task at hand whereas we would see that and we'd be like oh all we need to do is just point this guy's degeneracy at the right direction and then we'll win and that was like our mindset yeah i i think of that as a kind of borderline pathological obsession like that's like once you attach yourself whatever it happens to be right and what our job is to kind of bring it just shy of pathological where it's like kind of harming themselves but it's like you can't help yourself you're gonna like just dig in and whether it's video games or whatever it happens to be people that have i don't call it a gene but to have that trait um tend to work out well in startups because you're trying to attach yourself to a particular thing to your problem um the other thing i'm just as aware since we're on the topic of talent i've got this little mini framework works at multiple levels of abstraction they're like um three kind of vectors of kind of measurement of people one is that you have the creatives and these are people that start things they have ideas they have 180 mile you know ideas an hour kind of thing if you sit down in a room with them uh then there are the so they're the starters uh then you have the completers those are people that can make a list of like here are the things that need to get done in order for us to ship a product to do whatever um and often those folks are at odds like the the idea folks are kind of really frustrated with the the completers that are like i'm just trying to check a box and make and it's like yes but i'm doing this thing and it's not good enough yet but you have that tension and that's what brings in the third person which is the collaborator and the collaborator is really good at communicating is really good at bridging gaps across departments across individual people and kind of pulling it all together and usually you're looking for someone that has at least some like a nine or ten on one of those dimensions a seven or an eight another one and usually very low on the third right it's like you can have one for you we're creative i'm on the creative side i'm like yeah um for sure well but how that doesn't make sense to me because you lead a 20 billion dollar software company that and you've been doing it for 20 years like and as a cto like how on earth do you pull that off and it's public it's publicly traded which means you got to go through all the [ __ ] that like is the opposite of creativity yeah how do you how do you like well like one thing you shared last time you talked about those little like kind of calculators or the little like kind of growth growth tools that you had built which was just like oh i was just tinkering and i made this little like page load speed test site and then or whatever i don't remember the exact example but you had built like three or four of those that drove like a substantial amount of traffic for hubspot early on and like even now with wordplay like you know you're just you're still creating stuff even now that yeah but we were just talking we were just talking he's getting ready for the earnings call and like that to me is the opposite of creativity you know what i mean that's like you're you have so many you have such a narrow lane that you could stay within that's like seems so hard yeah so i'll say this um i have done everything in my uh in my power to reduce the time i have to spend on things that i'm not good at right which is the things that are kind of non-creative not a part of that so i don't have any direct reports which is unheard of for a company that's you know for a founder that has uh 7 000 people in the company a lot of them on the kind of product and engineering team which presumably um you know the cto would kind of help manage lee i don't do that um and so and the only meetings i go to are where there's some creativity involved i don't like to go to kind of status things and updates or whatever it's like i can read an email as well as the next person um so but yeah but there are things that are non-delegatable that um one we should we should probably talk about is on my list of things uh so one is earnings calls um another one is getting on the public stages right so for instance we have an annual conference called inbound that you know the last time it was in person had like 25 000 people in the live event right like it's um it's big and i have to give the keynote every year and i've been doing it for 10 plus years now which i hate and i'm bad at uh but that was one of those because i'm founder that was one of those non-delegatable things right i couldn't say oh well we're gonna have someone else to go do that because you know in my role as founder i have a certain kind of weight to me just by virtue of the title um of being a founder versus um someone else so sean listen to this listen to this dharma story in darmash you could fill in the blanks as we go because you could decide how much you want to reveal but there's been a couple different times maybe three different times i've introduced dharmesh to a founder of a company who was raising money and literally within five minutes he replied and said i looked at the deck i'm in or blank him out he dumbest you could reveal if you want to say some of the some of the times how much it was but uh and he replied with i'm in just so you know though i've got one rule which is i always side with the founder um and i'm always on your team but the downside of that is like i'm gonna make close to no time you didn't say it this way but it's like i'm gonna make close to no time for you or like you know like i think you said it like i'm totally going to be silent a silent partner i'm not going to bother you which means if you want to bother me i probably you know i'm not going to talk to you that much but that's like the stipulations for taking my money if you want to take it great do it i've seen that happen three different times and do you want to reveal how much it was or no i i don't recall but um i will say this i've made roughly i think a little over 100 investments now across my angel investment i won't call it a career but my activities and eighty to ninety percent um i've never actually talked to the founders or ever met with them um over the vast majority of my deals i make the decision within 24 hours it's like like i don't have time to go dig in to do due diligence on some industry or whatever it's like that's not the point my point is not that there's only two reasons i do angel investing um and it's not neither of them are to make a return um one of them is around living vicariously through other entrepreneurs i just like i like that process um and this is you know predates even starting hubspot and the other one uh quite immodestly is just bragging rights is to be able to say five ten fifteen years from now it's like because no one cares like how much you invest when i was like oh yeah i was in octa back in the day i was a stack overflow back in the day i was like you know first money on this company this company this company uh and that feels nice it's uh it's not such a kind of magnanimous giving back to the community it's purely like oh it'd be cool to be able to have been part of you know these great founding teams that went off and built great companies i really respect that you said that part because i thought you were gonna say like um you know to support the causes yeah i just you know just to foster entrepreneurship or like you know you know use the d word democratize something something and instead you said a true thing that i i think every angel investor feels is like it's awesome to have a notch on your belt and be like yeah i either i saw that or i backed that i bet on that and it worked out and it's awesome it's an awesome feeling it is a perk of the job and it's a real one so uh the fact that you said that to me shows me that you are a real one darmesh i'm i i'm what i refer to myself as like a warm-hearted red-blooded capitalist right so i have compassion it's not like i don't like people i'm not a sociopath um but i i'm a capitalist it's like okay well for instance this is going to sound completely immodest but uh we opened this door in the last episode so might as well walk through it now is so last episode we talked about kind of putting a value on your time whatever it happens to be and that anything that falls below the line in terms of you can outsource a delegate or whatever for less than that you don't do those things right you don't mow your lawn whatever if um and so i haven't uh i should recalibrate but you know my number personally the one i use just because the math is easier it's like ten thousand dollars an hour like that that's what if i were on the open market i think i could i could make that if that's well dude i would have thought higher i would have thought i think it would be like 50 or 100 000 an hour maybe like i mean way higher one could make the case but i couldn't make my point without having to make that particular case okay let me ask you a question to make it real so uh you buy something you book a plane ticket it's like whatever it didn't work out or you deserve a refund but you'd have to go chase it down do you just have somebody who you're like this is my chief of staff my ea that like i just say you do it or you're like hey it was two thousand dollars but it's below my hourly rate i'm not gonna do it i just eat the loss and move on i don't do it because even delegating then requires some follow-up requires some explanation and they're gonna apologize because they could only get half back or it was only a credits like i don't i don't care i just honestly don't care um and so and back to the investment thing so let's say you know my when i started my average investment rate was we'll call it a hundred thousand dollars give or take a little bit it's grown considerably since then but if i spent like five hours doing due diligence or having founder meetings or whatever i basically doubled their valuation or have my investment amount right because like not only did i put cash in for which i'm gonna get shares but then i put another 50 000 or 100 000 worth of time in just in the due diligence which is easy to kind of run up that bill it makes no mathematical sense why people would do that right it's like okay do you really feel like you're going to and the reason they rationalize and this makes sense is that if you really believe that as a result of spending that time on the margin you're going to make better investment decisions you're going to pick better companies you're going to do these things and maybe for the first hour to list an early stage startup there's just not that much diligence to do right like what are you going to dig into it's like like the idea you don't you like the founders or you don't move on our software is the worst have you heard of hubspot see most crms are a cobble together mess but hubspot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous i think i love our new crm our software is the best hubspot grow better or the the other part that's obvious but worth saying out loud just in case people are like well then why are you doing this podcast well you also just do things you like those are the things that you don't do you don't put a dollar amount on because you enjoy them and therefore it is not a cost to you it is like a you know a benefit to you so so yeah if you love gardening then you garden you don't put a 10 000 an hour mark on it is that fair for you that's how i think about it at least that is fair and so what i solve for is i like to solve for it's because it's a little bit of a squishy term it's just raw impact i like scale so if you folks were a much smaller blog let's just say it's like oh i'm going to reach 50 people as a result of this and i have ideas that i think are worth sharing um and it was smaller i'm like and and it's not like oh i don't get up out of bed in the morning unless there's at least you know ten thousand people like if this was morning bruce podcast then amplify my time right to what little time i have left on the planet what things that i know um so i'm always looking for uh to do things at scale like how can i find a way let speaking of things at scale let's talk about this thing because like on the surface this thing that you recently did like a year ago is incredibly silly and not worth your time but basically i think a year and a half ago whirl is it like a game that an online game is like a word game that that went viral you built a thing called the word play is it wordplay.com it's wordplay.com right uh by the way you buy domain name so you bought the hustle.com for us you bought me copythat.com thank you for that um i forgot to say thank you in person but uh uh so you buy like a lot of amazing domains but you have wordplay.com and did you tweet that it was getting seven million users a week or three what was the number what so the i just went and checked the numbers okay so just to kind of place the timeline in frame uh so november and december of last year 2021 is when wordle took off and january is when it really kind of hit it's i think close to its peak and that's roughly when the new york times acquired wordle um and a couple of things kind of i mean it was fine i think it was um a great outcome for josh wordle but there were things that were kind of bothering me that were limitations in the game and i was an avid player of the game um and now it's like okay well the new york times has bought it there's no way anything's going to happen for like years if ever so that was kind of thing number one uh thing number two like it was uh it had been a while since i had launched like some simple free thing publicly uh i hadn't gone through the process and there were other things i wanted to learn it's like oh i want to learn more about vercell and xjs and typescript and things like that so it's like okay well this is a excuse and then that intersected with the third thing which was like the dominant variable in the equation is my son was taking a python programming class he's 11 right he's going through this process and for him um it's still very abstract he's learning programs he enjoys everything involving technology and screens but it was abstract so on a saturday night i said okay well let me build something and python happens to be my language um build something so he can see because he plays world he knows the game and so i started on a saturday night with a deadline for sunday that i'm gonna launch something with him tomorrow we're gonna have google analytics on it so we're gonna launch it i'm gonna launch it by tweeting it and so he know he knows what social media is right he's um you know uh so i'm like oh we've got this thing that didn't exist yesterday i wrote the code over the course of last night in python the language that you're learning and we're going to launch it and now you can see users coming in right you can see this and so now what i want him to have in his head is that when he has through the course of his life as he encounters problems that are solvable with software which is a lot like it's actually tactile for him it's like oh i don't know i don't have the skills right now to do what your dad just did but i know it's possible i know it's possible because he did it in the span of 24 hours right so if i want to go off and build a video game i want to go off and build some tool for my school i want to build some social network for my whatever it is it feels like now it's it's more approachable for him he's got years to go before he'll get to that level but um anyway so those three things sort of came together and so we launched it on that sunday this is i think in february or so give or take and since then it's had like 45 million games have been played uh nine and a half million people have come through it um any given moment in time right now for look at the google analytics should be two three thousand people playing like right now um which how did it get so much traffic where did the traffic come from well it helps i have a social media following right i've got a million followers on linkedin i've got 300 000 on twitter so there's that uh there's some that that's that's a lot but that's not i wouldn't have thought that yeah yeah it's not enough for that is it how many users you think got from that um in the early days was it big right off the bat like the first week was it big i know the first day probably a bunch of people checked it out but like i'm sure you posted it and that was the big surge so what was like the first week roughly do you remember the first week was probably maybe 50 to 100 000 so it was it wasn't a lot but it was something uh but that means that once you kind of get into it this is the you know kind of power of iteration is that oh well one of the things that i found missing in the original wordle was that it was a single player game like you played and you played once a day and that was it uh so two big changes that we made in wordplay one was it was unlimited play you didn't you didn't have to play just once a day and two it it allowed you to challenge your friends so you could say oh i just played this word i solved it in four turns here's my score and send literally a simple link to anyone or a group on and this happens tens of thousands of times right like someone will take a link they just play they're really proud of their score and then their family they can post it to their whatsapp group uh they can post it their you know wherever they want and say i invite you to like beat my score kind of thing um and so that's the viral element and so then as more people play you can unlike track that as you might have as a google analytics event and say how many people how many times are people clicking that share button and issuing challenges to other people and so that once you can kind of get into something where there's a compounding effect on the user base so as a user base grows um and so now the thing i'm fighting though right is that so that's happening that's going well but then the interest in wordle in related games is waiting because everything has it's kind of peak and it's uh and it's ebb um and so but it's been an interesting exercise so on the kind of learning path one of the things i hadn't done in a while is like okay well what's traffic actually worth let's say i had to make a living on this thing or make the company quote-unquote or project profitable so i put google adsense on it which is the easiest thing to do and discovered that like if i weren't bothered by the fact that there would be two ads on the main game board page if i were solving for monetization it was like thousand dollars a month uh in google adsense wow based on the traffic yeah wow i thought you were gonna say way less yeah i thought he's gonna say like 500 a month but 90 grand a month and you're you only have your only costs are hosting right yeah and and my time right and first of all sean go to wordplay.com and then go to like the about page his about page is incredibly well written it's wonderful copywriting it's wonderful uh you've got a wonderful voice it says uh i'll just read the first sentence but it says why would you do this or the better yet why would i do this that's a really good question my wife asked me the same question and then you like go on to explain why it just you you're you're quite a good writer for also being like this amazing engineer typically those things power writing course that sean put on you know that right it's like i'm not right around here with my alumni [Laughter] i like to say i taught darmesh everything he knows even before he met me i somehow taught him all that good stuff before he built hubspot what uh what are you so this is making 90 grand a month maybe or about what do you is it it could it it's not right there's no advertising i turn ads off because that's the point and people are asking is like darmash why do you have ads on this thing and like to learn like it's like i've learned what i needed to learn so i can was was tweeting and linkedin posting this on linkedin the only way you got users what do you think this could sell for right now and is the is this the biggest side project you've ever created our buddy tried to buy it silly tried to buy it off you did he really he he tweeted out he's like i'd like to buy this off you i've you know i've built mobile games before you know he was like semi serious at least i don't know i don't know if you talk to him or not but i did what do you think you could say what do you think like if you cared what do you think you could sell it for two or three million dollars maybe right now that um let's say the ad revenue would go down to like 50 000 or something like that because i haven't turned google adsense in a while that's 600 000 a year apply a 5x multiple uh so somewhere between two and ten million dollars would be my guess if i like if that's what we're solving for so and um is this the was was posting it on linkedin and twitter the only way that you got users or did you do some other weird hacks i had my blog had my it's like i'm a big believer in like you know what folks call like the flywheel there's all these little things that are attached to the flywheel right it's like oh well linkedin helps a little bit puts a little energy twitter does a little bit and i have my blog and the email goes out and there's like things that i sort of do um yeah so it helps but it's like the hardest part is that cold start problems like how do you get your first hundred thousand people a hundred to a thousand people and then it's a matter of like tracking the retention rate on those users do they come back the other thing that's been interesting about wordplay as far as the lesson learned um is that you know when it started the average time a user spent according to google was roughly four minutes um on the game okay um in the early weeks and now that number is at 14 minutes is the average time a user spends um you know across however many thousands of users come in a given day so right what uh and is this the biggest side project you've ever created uh depends on how you measure it um so technically no not in terms of just like raw traffic um i've built graders and things like that before that uh have done better but what what have you built that what side project have you built outside of hubspot that gets more traffic like clearly because it was a game had it been anything other than a game i would have rationalized some way to bring it into the spot umbrella because i like to have like all my eggs in that basket uh but just given the the circumstances here didn't really make sense um and even now like i'm thinking about uh doing a uh kind of a marketing and sales related edition of wordplay right it's like oh the entire list of words or uh do it based on more tech companies like okay do you know the the players in the space kind of thing and then you can get sponsorships or whatever anyway but um yeah website greater was the this kind of a project where it was like a free i'm i really like low friction things that people can come to the website and this is why my son and i were chatting yesterday is where i'm we're looking at flutter this new development environment and language um well darts the language but flutter is the uh the app framework for building mobile apps across ios and android and things like it's what the cool new kids are learning and he's like no why would i ever want to build a mobile app that's like something people have to download i have to get approval from you know apple to kind of post my like i i want to like just do it like immediately he's got and he's right just like okay anyway so that's the word play story it's been it's been a lot of fun i've um it's hard to know with these things like like where the road leads like wordplay itself may or may not kind of connect back to other things whatever but the things i've learned through it i think will it's like okay well here's what it takes to build this kind of thing it's like okay well then i'm using it to uh play around with community it's like okay can i take the word play user base what are things they care about and build a community around wordplay using one of the existing kind of community platforms um and and see if that's a thing right it's like okay if you could aggregate people with like interests um that in itself has value and i wanted to send you something that kind of self runs but we'll see if you were uh i'm gonna ask darmesh if sam had built this as a side project and he was at the same point you're at right now what would you like kind of advise him to do if it was sam's project and you were just kind of an outsider said oh that's really cool you did that and it sounds like you've kind of reached this point where you don't really have a direction of where it's going to go next what would you kind of tell sam um decide what you want to do which is okay do you want to like take this to the next level and you turn into a 100 million billion dollar business uh you know spit it off or decide that it's just going to be a personal project and just like my personal blog is that i made that decision it's like i'm not going to try and monetize and hire employees i'm not going to do any of those things right it's going to be and my son will continue to act as out of product um because he's the one that tests the thing every morning um and we play tournaments every evening that's the big new feature that's coming out is the multi-round tournaments uh by the way in terms of like i think half of what i know sean i learned from you the other half i learned from from nfm right it's like so one of the things around chess.com which you guys talked about which i've been a a member and player on for ten plus years i knew of the site but then you think about wordplay as like okay well this is chess.com but for word game enthusiasts versus chess enthusiasts and then which is as a reminder to people chess.com is like a huge business like like multi-billion dollar evaluation we talked about this when we talked about chess also which was what other things are like chess and we had said sudoku and we had said i think we had said like a scrabble or whatever uh word is yeah i think they're almost as big if not i think it would be i wouldn't be shocked if it was bigger than chess i wouldn't be shocked i would i would be more shocked if it was like a tenth the size as the chess enthusiast audience um i would guess it's like in the range and there's very few games that are in the range and so that alone makes it an interesting comp um in that sense so so the lessons you draw from chess.com right which is a relatively straightforward is you have like a rating system right you have leaderboards and scores you have challenges you have social connections where you make your friends on chess.com so you can invite like it's all the things right these are uh very easily translatable into other games like we're playing um so anyway so we'll pick and choose as well i'll give you one little feature i think would be cool because uh leaderboards are always this problem in general where uh like leaderboard's cool for the top 10 people and then for everybody else on earth it's like oh great i'm player number three thirty nine thousand fantastic right yeah uh and so there's all these like if you i kind of studied this once i was like who solved this problem and there's really three models that work one is more like chess uh and and games do this they create a rank system so it's not your number 80 000 in the world because that doesn't mean anything but you go from bronze to silver to gold to platinum to master to grand master and like you you just compete to get your own level up within that to get to your next badge and that's a karate belt the karate belt method let's call it then there's the next one which is your social rank matters when it's with people you know that are either your friends your school your city something like that so you can kind of hack a proximity based thing and then the third one which i think is somewhat interesting which is it doesn't even matter what my rank is but there's something cool like if i go to workplace right now i feel like i'm alone in this experience i don't know that there's 3000 other people solving this right now and also i don't know i bet you there's like some celebrity that plays wordplay every day right like i bet you like i don't know mila kunis plays this every day and i think there's something really cool to like sort of like a stars they're just like us vibe of like if i kind of knew that that x-known people have solved it for today that's just kind of interesting and it's kind of like you know makes them more approachable so i almost wonder if there was like a little feature like that where if you're a blue check tech person you could kind of like auth in and be like i either solved it or failed today and you could just have that as a little board uh anyways those are my three random features that's a good idea the one thing's and i don't it's not surfaced on the on the pro this is a really good idea but uh one thing i do have is in the comments there's the there's commentary so as you're playing the software will kind of give you little kind of sometimes snarky sometimes fun messages sometimes data it's like oh you're one of the few people that's ever guessed this particular word that's not a very common word to use congrats good for you or this is the thousandth time you've used this particular word uh points for consistency um so there's this kind of running commentary but i like the idea of like just kind of front loading it's like here's a number of people that solve this game i give you stats at the end of the game it's like oh only 14 of the people or players solve this particular word and it took them on average seven point i mean uh 4.7 guesses so yeah can i throw two more at you uh this is now my my future brainstorm for you uh if you've ever played there's nothing more there's nothing more than like an entrepreneur there's nothing more than like a person who has no stakes saying hey have you thought of have you thought about have you thought about this why haven't you done this yet there's nothing less entertaining on a podcast than me telling you features for wordplay but [ __ ] it's our podcast if you ever played candy crush they do this thing which was they make they uh so steaks steaks matter a lot in stories or any kind of like adventure um and so like you know if you open up a pack of warheads and you see a black one oh that's the really crazy one candy crush does this in their games where if you start a level it says this is nightmarishly hard or this is a you know medium hard or whatever so i'd like to see that in the wordplay when i come into every day i'd like to know if this is a nightmarishly hard puzzle or if this is just okay it gets me amped up from my play that's a really good idea combining that with your tiering idea and then we can move on but so imagine we had a tiering mechanism that you go from bronze to silver to whatever to ninja level um you know right now when you start the game you get a random word that and other people get random words as well and there's a daily word um that everybody plays together but imagine that like as you move up the rank it gets harder it's like now you're a level that few have achieved let alone solved right it's like no one even gets here you're here um and then you do things for streaks like okay well you're the first person to have solved like 50 games in a row at this tier or something like that i think that'd be fun so one last one i think you'll like which is um you are a fan of crypto and i think you would if you like the crypto ethos and i think if you could advance the cause of crypto that would be like a win for you personally um so we gave out this milk money grant that's like milk for the milk we gave out like a bunch of money to people just to build whatever they want and one guy this guy dave he built this thing that was like a wordle game but it was with crypto which was just you play wordle as is but if you solve it you could win like one matic like a tiny amount or like then he was like playing with different ideas he's like oh there's actually 100 matic jackpot for the day and like only winners are eligible for the jackpot you might you might get it or you might not and so you got a bunch of people connecting a wallet so i think what you could do is you could actually just add that into wordplay which is by the way there's a 100 a day prize paid out in matic or whatever um all you got to do is create a little wallet here and like you might win and so i think a bunch of your avid players would create a crypto wallet where they might not otherwise so you'll onboard new people into the world of crypto you can create a dead simple meta either funnel them to metamask or create a dead simple crypto wallet that will become like a the play to earn uh crypto wallet you know for the future anyways that's uh i will i will now stop talking about a good idea yeah by the way i so i actually added the ability to connect your um connect your diesel wall to your ethereum wallet um to wordplay um and my idea at the time was instead of turning ads off i'm gonna make that the pot and so as ad revenue accumulates until the next payout whatever it happens to be and then it's like oh the top 10 winners are going to get this distribution and let's start over again so not to make money but we'll have money coming in through adsense and then we'll kind of write a sustainable play to earn game that's awesome yeah that would be amazing so let me uh sean this is uh an interesting topic but i understand there's like laws and sec stuff around what you can i cannot say darmesh just tell me i feel like you can't but basically i think it was in late may i'm looking at now in like may 25th or something like that um sean i don't know if you saw this but like there was headlines that said like darmesh uh cto co-founder of hubspot buys hubspot shares and i think it was like was it 10 million dollars it was it was a pretty substantial amount it was over three i forgot the exact amount is but it was millions of dollars and then suddenly like the stock like the next day like went up because it was like oh man dartmouth like this insider bought it he uh like he has faith in the company that was a pretty that that's a pretty cool move when you're doing something like that what is your thinking like are you thinking like um like is it part of you like i just want to prove to the world that i'm brave is it part of you like oh no this is just undervalued like they're they're foolish uh it's i mean like what what's your what's your motivation there um it's exactly what you said which is uh i just thought the company was undervalued given the long-term potential and i've done this before i did it a couple years ago um and i bought a bunch of shares i think even more at that time like at 125 a share right i'm like okay well and this is when hubspot stock had dipped over the ensuing um i mean the pre-or prior two or three months i'm like i understand the market's more like it's but this doesn't make any sense like it you know hubspot stock to me was worth more than um at the time 125 um turns out i was right um and so it's it's a similar thing it's like and it does signal belief in the company right it's but it's what i it's what i believe and there are regulations around and you know people ask like well why did you you buy at that time as it turns out it was the exact window of time that i had to wait a certain period since my last transaction um to when i could buy in the day that i was eligible to buy i bought it's like okay the price is low enough i still have conviction that um over the long run buying with money that like where does three million dollars come from let's say isn't that just stock you previously sold that you now were buying or like it's like you have some other huge side right yeah yes yes or can you can you take a loan against your hubspot shares to buy more like there's like 100 things you cannot do that's one of them wow no i think uh i saw that the other day and uh you've done you've made a few decisions like every once in a while you do something and i'm like oh this guy is nutty in a cool way and that's not exactly nutty but it's like a pretty bold move i i thought it was a pretty cool move and i saw that and i was wondering what was going through your head when you did that because what's the psychology like when uh i don't know hubspot stocks like i'm just rounding i think it's down like 40 maybe 50 something like that from the all-time high like during the the last kind of the peak of the peak last year or whatever um and so you know we come on here sometimes and i'll be like uh all right guys you know you know sam will be like dude how are you and you lost a bunch of money today i'm like yeah yeah i lost like a million dollars today and like you know ethan's down and i'm i'm down a million dollars i'll share my psychology of like dealing with this this travesty of a loss or whatever and i'll be like yeah you know here's how i think about it you play that game at like a thousand x higher stakes where like you know more like 500 million yeah exactly i'm losing 500 000 you're losing 500 million or whatever something crazy like that what's what's your psychology like i don't know like i think you know what question i'm trying to ask even though i i don't have the word how does it feel to be half a billion dollars is what you're asking me or dad how do you deal with that and like yeah go go is that how much you lost you think it's more than that but yeah who's counting he's like this podcast is more fun when we were talking about wordplay actually fine like i'm i'm not really and i'm not just saying this uh but it's true it does not phase me like one bit because the reality is um it does not change my life one iota right other than like okay well it impacts you know hubspot employees and children i get that but in terms of me individually like nothing changes right like i wasn't off planning to buy smile small islands or take over governments or something like that um or by twitter right i was not i didn't have any of those kinds of plans and so absent those kinds of plans um like i feel sorry for the non-profits that i would have invested in but you know my wife continues to invest there's you know we have uh plans to do the philanthropy we want to do and so it's like okay well i still wake up every day then do the same things i did before and i'll look at the wordplay things and respond to user emails or what's i can do my hubspot stuff it's like okay like what's really you don't even have you don't even have the self-talk in your head where you kind of need to like because for me when it happens i'm like you know i have a instant reaction as i go look at a chart or a price or whatever and then i give myself a little self-talk and i'm good like it'll last 17 seconds but i do have those 17 seconds it sounds like you don't even have those 17 seconds because you're like well i've already been over this before in my head at some point in my life it doesn't let alone the self-talk the self-talk is one thing let alone like that but and then there's also this other thing that you and i have sean which is like it if the markets are [ __ ] for a year or two like we will change our day-to-day actions like you know we may not buy x y and z or like we might you know we're not to that point where it's like it doesn't matter major cutbacks at the puri household right now major cutbacks yeah it's like we'll maybe change behavior but you don't even change i laid off my son yeah they change in the other direction right so as the market has dipped um my kind of average check size has actually gone up i've made bigger bets and things because i think valuations are starting to adjust you know slowly so i think they're better deals now um good entrepreneurs starting companies um so but overall like the psychology of it has just just does not like have any impact and like over the long term you know um i didn't make this up but is is that the you know the valuation of a company which is like the market price um will oscillate around the value right and value is like the revenues you have the products that you build what are you actually doing um you know for your customers and so that you know if our revenues have dropped off you know before something if something like that would happen that'd be a different story but it's like okay well that hasn't changed we are the same business today if not better than we were three months ago six months ago um and the valuation over time will kind of self-correct some of the things i like about the market um is that i think things will kind of wash out and we'll see yeah and a lot of hubspot's customers are kind of like you know medium-sized let's say businesses um so do you like do you spend much energy being like okay where is the economy going what's going to happen to my customers which will have some knock-on effect of like what's going to happen to our business do you care spend energy there because i find myself for the reason i ask because i find myself sometimes going down these rabbit holes of like okay what do i think's going to happen then part of me is like well does any of that really matter or affect me or you know is this energy useful or is this just sort of nervous energy that i'm wasting thinking about this stuff do you think is hubspot is that customer base even how many customers does husband have like 130 000 like i think when i sold it was a hundred thousand or just crossed a hundred thousand in the grand scheme of things the one the reasons i sold i'm like well hundred thousand customers that's like kind of a lot but that's not that much uh i was like the market's way bigger than a hundred thousand people who would want to buy this and so is is a hundred thousand or 150 000 whatever it is is that number even big enough to have the needle move significantly when the economy is [ __ ] uh on a on a percentage basis like it's um i'll answer it this way so i'll answer the first question then we'll move the second one which is you know do i spend time thinking about this do i do anything about it the answer is yes um at hubspot we will try to model out here's here's the impact we think it could have on our business uh but there's two sides to it there's the kind of defensive side of it it's like we want to make sure um that we have enough cash in the bank to weather the storm we don't know how long the storm's gonna last and we have models for how um you know how long it's gonna last how deep it's going to be those kinds of things as far as impact but then the other part which is to me much more exciting which is okay given what we know what can we do to capitalize um on this crisis right this is what's happening right now what can we do to make this net positive for hubspot and we had something similar happen in 2008 at the last uh spot was much earlier so things uh we did even when the pandemic started well the things we did is like oh there's lots of uncertainty businesses are struggling everyone's kind of batting down the hatches and so we said okay we're going to give even more value we're going to um for our partners we're going to front them the cash for the revenue we know is coming over time because cash is a is an issue and we had a bunch of cash on the balance so we did things that kind of made us stronger and helped our customers and um and so we're looking for those same kinds of opportunities it's like okay now that everyone's kind of looking at the p l and looking at all their line items or whatever is can we benefit from this because hubspot in some ways is counter-cyclical was like okay well instead of buying the big incumbent and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars maybe now people that might not have considered hubspot a year ago would now consider it because they're more value conscious now than they were historically um yeah so when you were starting the company so like there's a there you know if you just look at the math there's a world where hubspot in the next five or ten or who knows how long can be worth like a hundred billion dollars which is you know one of the biggest top 200 or something companies in the world when you were starting the company did you have a number in your head where you're like man i think this i think this could make a hundred million dollars a year or i think this might be a billion dollar company or was it as big as man i think this could be worth tens of billions we didn't have a specific number in our head but we had um i'll say comparables for lack of a better term which is okay there are successful software companies that have done similar or related things either they're in the same market or um in the same target customer base that achieved it it's like okay well and this is what we told to vcs at our pitch we're like okay we're not we think at the time we were just in marketing software so here he was i'll give you the first 30 seconds of the pitch is that in the history of software no one has ever really built a 10 plus billion dollar household name global brand marketing software company had never been done amateur was the greatest one at the time with a billion half dollar um you know price tag at the time and we're like and the reason people you know companies have not been built in the marketing tech spaces because marketing is an arts and crafts kind of discipline it's about the shade of your logo and you're outsourcing a bunch of creative stuff whatever but it's not the kind of problem software solves and our belief was that marketing was increasingly turning into the kind of thing software does solve lots of data coming in you're trying to make decisions around all this stuff this looks exactly like an industry that software can help with and so our thesis was that someday someone will build a hundred 200 500 billion dollar software company that's doing the thing we're trying to do and we said it might as well be us we're wealthy nice people and we're uh and we're kind of committed to this and seeing it through so you know do we think the odds were relatively high that we would pull it off no but do we think there was an opportunity to do the kind of thing that you're talking about yeah i'd like others have done it we were not putting someone on mars right that was not um it's like okay well people have done this before and it's just a different time and maybe now the time is right for a new company to do something that you know has been done but uh but better this goes a little bit to your pixar um kind of vision sean it's like okay well you know people sometimes just like okay well you know what are you gonna do that's different and why is this you know what does the world need more the answer is world doesn't need more pixar's and so you know saying to you like oh you don't really need to do that it's like telling elon musk does the world really need another car company and like they kind of downplay the fact that it's like yeah it's got four wheels it gets you from point a to point b but it's all like there's just one interesting element about it makes it completely different right it's like it's the same thing like most ideas that have been super successful are not complete new from whole cloth cut right they're like they're and i don't like the cliche of buildings on the shoulders of giants but it's like like just about everything that's ever been done is derivative to some degree it's just based on your level of abstraction how many steps back you're willing to go so it's like okay yeah i can see someone building something massive here it's like i'll get off my rant it's like so we had facebook did awesomely well then twitter comes along and people said oh well that's just facebook but you have shorter messages or something like that it's like facebook with constraints with lessons yeah facebook comes along it's like well you can post photos on facebook why would anyone ever use instagram that's like facebook with all the other cool things that i like as well right no messenger none of that stuff and then tick tock comes along it's like well that's just kind of videos that you can do on facebook you can do on instagram you can do on twitter but it's this it's like just different enough in a compelling enough way where and it's still a video social net social based video app and lit the world on fire right it's like so even something as old as video or as photos is still not over it's just not over it's just part of the kind of the human condition right now anyway sean if you go off and want to do another pixar and if you're ever looking for an investor that will make a decision 24 hours by your god what was that tweet about sean that was on the left field what are you saying uh okay so all my tweets are out of left field so that's just twitter that's what twitter's supposed to be right just a bunch of left field [ __ ] that i'll get to put in a feed um i was watching i don't know what i was watching i think my nieces were over they were watching toy story and i was like twister is amazing pixar's amazing and i was like why is like i was like i want to do something amazing this is literally how my brain works it's like oh that looks so awesome that's like an awesome end output i would be so proud if i had made something like that i bet i could right like it's this combination of like um seeing something that is really appealing and then having the delusional belief that like of course i could do it if i just tried and so i just thought it to myself i was like you know that would be a fun company to build if you could just make great stories great movies um and put them on there into the world like that would be so fun as a thing if that's like the thing you did and like hundreds of millions of people not just like use your product it's one thing to use your product it's nothing to like love it grow up on it and have like you know like this extreme like nostalgic emotion around around like these movies right like if i see you know for everybody's a little bit different but for me it's like i don't know home alone and mighty ducks and then you know lion king there's like a couple of movies that just like uh they meant a lot at the time and they still mean a lot even though i don't interact with them um so i have because otherwise i'm gonna forget there's one thing uh i need to say on this particular episode because otherwise it'll uh keep me up at night so i have like a handful of like frameworks and things i think about the way i think about the world and this ties back to uh sean's next trillion dollar company thing uh pixar which i think it can be by the way sean just so you know okay so imagine let's take a step back i'm on a whiteboard and the whiteboard it's the universe of all possible people everyone on the planet and you draw a circle with one of your skills so in sean's case let's say we put copywriting as one of the skills that he's in the top one percent or top five percent whatever number you want to associate with it and so that's the circle it's like okay x number of people are at sean's level um or better and at copywriting awesome let's say we draw another circle that's um we'll call it crypto knowledge is just how crypto works and that's a group of people awesome rarer skill because it's newer there's fewer people that know how to do that versus copywriting we can accept that we'll be a smaller circle uh what happens though is if you intersect those two circles and turn into a venn diagram the number of people that know copywriting really well and also know crypto really well is a hundred times smaller than either of those circles combined right and this is we see the same effect like in standardized tests if you took the sat or the gre or the gmat there are people that are really good at english portion of the test there are people that are really good at math portion of the test but the ones that score really really well are the ones that are good at both they don't have to be the best at both because that's the thing that's actually rare is the combination of the english and the quant same thing here so now imagine so this is what i call it the trillion dollar venn diagram success right uh i just made that up but so you draw those purples of your skills and say okay well i'm now not like one in a million i'm one in a billion right or one in five billion whatever that is and if you can convert that into some kind of monetizable business thing or whatever that's when magic sort of happens so that's kind of thing number one it's like what's your thing what are your skills um and what drives how much value will that intersection create is two things one is how rare is that intersection whether it's two circles or three circles or whatever how rare is it and then the other one is how um how much does it kind of reinforce the other skills that you already have so for instance i'm a software developer that's one of my that's my core skill i've been programming for like 30 years now that's my thing deep down inside my core if i combine that with i'm going to go often which i could never do become an olympic level swimmer let's say like also very rare the intersection of that it's like okay well the opportunity that reveals because the two things are so unrelated like i don't know how i would take my ability to build a web app and intersect it with my like yeah there's some things i could do i don't know if that would be that huge but uh software development is applicable to lots of if i was going to be an academic researcher if i was going to go into music if i was like other things um there's a lot more overlap to the degree that it's like those two they reinforce each other so software helps me do this and that helps me do this and this is one of the reasons uh so my advice here was as you're picking skills to acquire acquire skills that are both rare but also reinforce things that you're already exceptional at um that will kind of drive that kind of that rarity and that's what drives uh drives the overall value uh which kind of brings me to is like and so when i think of things that i want to learn it's like okay well this is why i got into copyright it's like if i can and copywriting is another form of this is communicating at scale is what copywriting is right like it's uh in usually textual form it's like okay well i don't know that many software engineers that can copyright really well like literally like other than that have not started companies right it's like they don't exist but um very rarely do you get like really really good um engineers that went off and read six books on copywriting and took sean's class that that's not a comment you are you were a good writing a writer before you got into this no no i mean your writing is great and by the way sean let's let's we got to pimp it out maven.com power writing or just go to maven.com and you see it yeah yeah just go to maven.commaveen.com i'm on the homepage starts in two weeks all right so the the uh what you said is great i would add one more circle to that pixar thing by the way the reason you might pull it off is because you have a very weird and unique and related level of skill so yes there are people that are better maybe better creatives better animators better entertaining whatever but they don't know crypto maybe that's the thing that unlocks the next trillion dollar company is entertainment intersect with crypto it's the netflix for the blockchain whatever it is right something like that where two things combined that never had been put together in that way before um the the other circle that i would add that i think people underestimated so i tweeted this out right so people i didn't explain what the tweet is the tweet was i said the next company i build is gonna be like a new new age pixar uh like that like the next pixar and um i think i i think i would work on that project for 30 plus like 30 30 plus years i just keep going with that company i wouldn't be trying to sell it or flip it or get out of it or whatever um so that was the tweet and then a bunch of i basically had two reactions one reaction was awesome like where can i sign up how do i work for this company that's that sounds awesome i love pixar you could do it and those are like fans about mfm type of thing or people who themselves had been thinking god that would be awesome to create another like pixar type of company you know because i love pixar then there's the other half of people that were like what makes you think you could do this um you know like you know how hard it is to make a movie you know how expensive it is you know how how unique you know steve jobs and you know whatever uh lasseter and catmol like how rare those talents were when they came together that's a once in a generation company and then other people were like uh one guy had this amazing burn he was like uh check uh aquahire like green checkmark aqua hired power writing like course podcast next pixar and i was like oh thanks that's pretty solid actually um and so you know a bunch of people were sort of all in the same bucket of like this is so hard this won't work what you you can't do it that's some version of that and so the third circle one is like i'm really great at x i'm really great at why the third is just i have the courage to go do a thing and like um tim ferriss once told this story he goes i went to a business school class at harvard business school class i gave this talk and then the talk i go oh by the way guys i'm doing this challenge um only for you guys you know whatever i want to get in touch with either bill clinton jennifer lopez or you know some sports person you know michael jordan or whatever um if anybody here can connect me over email with them like you know just reach out to them and if you get a hold of them connect me over email i will buy you two round the world plane tickets um you know for you could fly business class for a year uh around the world anywhere on my dime all right guys thank you very much and he told that to one class and um he's like you know you have 30 days to complete this challenge and then um i think i forgot what it was it was like he did it to two classes but he gave a slightly different message in each the first one he just just said that 30 days go by nobody did it uh sorry nobody's completed the challenge he's like ah what happened you know turns out nobody even tried the challenge the perceived difficulty was so high that nobody did it so in the next one he told that story and i think he added a twist which was whoever gets the closest to it uh wins and all of a sudden like everybody tries and in fact i think somebody did get in touch and actually successfully completed the challenge and he was like he had this principle which was sort of like you know everybody wants to fish where everybody else is fishing because they think it's so easy to catch fish there he's like in actuality often it's easy to just go go catch a fish where the fish actually are and you you don't have to base it on how how many people how many other people you think have tried something or how what the perceived difficulty is and in fact sometimes the bigger you go the easier something can be because nobody else is even trying to do it and so i would say like you know this pixar thing who knows if i'm gonna go do this or something else i tweet things just almost to my prototype it's like let me say this out loud let me see how that feels if i sleep and to wake up tomorrow do i want to tweet five more ideas about that or am i over it it was just a passing fleeting moment um yeah but but the the core ingredient i think most people lack is courage to actually go and do the thing and i think that's the the people put way more emphasis on what skill am i top one percent and they kind of they they under credit themselves one quick one skill you could just have for free you just got to go it's like at the santa the deli at the grocery store go pull the number is yeah i have the courage to actually go do it like you know i'm i will go do pull the trigger on this thing and not wait for other people to kind of like reinforce that it's a good idea to me yeah and this is and i could not agree more um and so and i think people conflate sometimes skill versus talent and they believe they don't have the talent for entrepreneurship or for design for programming whatever it is uh in my mind uh so skill is something that's learnable that's an easy definition uh talent is the rate at which you could acquire a particular skill so if you have a talent for music that means you will acquire musical skills faster than someone that doesn't have a town for music it doesn't mean that someone that doesn't have the town for music can't learn it so they may have a ceiling as far as how far they can go fine i get that uh but this doesn't mean they can't do it and so one of the big lessons kind of in my in my life in my professional career is that most things are actually skills not talent mostly like it's like you can start with zero like i was i would have been voted least likely to ever start a company in my entire like generations of family right like that's not uh a talent i ever had like when i um until i went off and did it like public speaking was not something it's like oh that that's a skill and you and then um there's this thing from software engineering i think it's worth sharing uh i think some of the best ideas are we take stuff from other industries and pull them into this thing and apply it here in a weird way but in software engineering there's this thing called functional decomposition which is take a problem be able to articulate well it's a function that has a set of inputs and an output and what it's supposed to do and really all software problems are being able to take the highest order function is let's say you want to grade a possible uh investment based only on the website it's like oh i'm going to give you a domain and you're going to give me a score from 0 to 100 as to how good this is okay well that function is easy to define like domain goes in score from 0 to 100 comes out what other functions does that function need in order to pull that off it's like okay i want a function that looks at the domain and looks at the level of seo they have that's one layer down the person that's writing the seo function goes down levels like i'm going to look at the on-page seo and see how good they're doing at meta tags and h1 titles and i'm going to look at the off page seo then their link acquisition and that kind of stuff that's it's like so if you roll it all down and you go down far enough individual functions at the atomic level are so simple as to be trivial what matters is the fact that you were able to abstract it down that simple thing right so most things uh can be broken down that way so so if you look at oh i want to become someone that can give a talk in front of 25 000 people on a stage that seems like an insurmountable task for someone like me that's never done that and that's not my that might not my thing it's like oh well what does that involve number one you have to have kind of overcome i didn't have like stage fright i had severe stage anxiety right stage fright is like oh there's a ship that's gonna come down from space and just suck you up because you were so bad and stage anxiety is like man i wish a spaceship would come down and send me off the stage right now i want to get off um so there's that like don't you don't pass out on stage and then there's the oh you learn about storytelling you learn about writing you learn about slide design you learn about humor and i did all those things right read books took classes on all those components of public speaking in an aggregate i'm okay now right like i can do that and you then it's practice and you do it over time so anyway my point here is uh startups whatever skill and startups are a skill figure out what set of skills you need to acquire some you'll be good at acquiring because you have the talent the other one you're just gonna have to grind it out more than others may but it's doable it's a doable thing one question that i have if i can do it anyone can do it that's my point i love that so sean kind of sean kind of added this thing to your uh your event diagram of like just people brave enough to get started and would you add another thing like when with the hustle we sold in year four or five and i'm i don't regret it i'm very happy with that but i actually like we lo i looked at the numbers this year and i was like oh wow we would have made like maybe like it's it was close to the point where like you could have potentially next year made more revenue that year than all the revenues uh combined um and i'm like whoa that's kind of crazy like i again i'm happy with it but like real value like i guess for me i was like real value was created in year like five six seven eight of course you probably could say like when you're in your five seven eight you're like oh wow it's really created in 10 11 12. but um do you think that um what portion of hubspot and your success has been well i'm just really i'm just willing to shut up and focus on this for 20 years as opposed to uh you actually being amazing or good at product and marketing and things like that um yeah here's how i think about it i think the outcome is a combination of like dreaming really big and like iterating really small and having tight feedback feedback loops so the dream really big is you have to have something that can someday translate in it doesn't have to be as clear of vision as you know shawn is kind of laid out as far as oh it's going to be pixar for the new generation um but you have to kind of have start with something roughly big in mind at least at some level but then it really comes down to the iteration right it's um i think and others have demonstrated this through data is that the quality output is almost i won't say always but frequently a function of the number of iterations not the quality of the you know people's for instance so one of the common examples that's thrown out is and i've heard it with a pottery class or a photography class but it's like oh one set of students divided class and half uh let's say it's a photography class uh one set of students it's like okay every day you have to submit a photo for the next 30 days while this class is running the other one is like at the end of the 30 days you're going to submit your best photo and then your grade is going to be based on the quality of that best photo the first class is like as long as you submit a photo every day you're going to get an a at the end of the 30 days the other one is like as long as your is eight quality material that photo is going to win and what's been proven out across disciplines is that the class that did the multiple iterations had a better output than the one was trying to solve for quality like the arguably the first one's like all they really had to do was like submit a photo it didn't have to be like world-class quality it's not the best i could do but just by virtue of doing it they're going to make it better and make it better at the end of the 30 days they produced a better photo and they produced a better clay pot if it was a pottery class than the other one that was solving for quality and they were like too much in their heads trying to say oh i'm gonna do the best i can do like no just do it repeatedly but the key to that it has to be meaningful iteration if you're just iterating and doing the same thing you're not learning anything there's no feedback loop then the iterations have no value but if you're if you have a tight feedback loop like i'm going to do this thing and i immediately get response back that tells me whether i got better or got worse that is amazingly like powerful to be able to do that and compound it over time so so i think my i'm not that special candidly it's like i'm willing to grind it out more than people that are smarter and i'm a little bit smarter than people that are willing to work grind it out that's my venn diagram that's awesome have you you've probably seen this or maybe you guys have done this but there's this group of like consultants that created this thing called the marshmallow challenge which they go to a company and they give you like a bunch of um sticks uh one marshmallow some tape and like a string or something like that have you seen this star mesh i think i have yeah but i'll kind of summarize for this for sure yeah yeah those who have it basically they give they give you this these set of um tools and they say okay your goal the game is you need to get a marshmallow the winning team is going to have a marshmallow like as high above this table as you can so build your tower as high as you can if you can whoever gets the highest marshmallow whoever's tower has the highest marshmallow at the end wins we're right we're gonna stop the clock after 30 minutes we're going to say hands up and you know your marshmallow whoever's marshmallow is standing the highest wins okay good good so they go and they do this test with like a bunch of different types of people they do it with consultants they do it with like kind of doctors and they do it with you know engineers they do it with um whoever creatives like ad agency types and they're trying to see okay which group is going to perform the best at a challenge like this and basically across the board what they found is that uh they suspected maybe engineers are gonna do the best and the engineers do on average do a little bit better than than others but not by much they actually are all pretty horrible at it and i think like you know whatever 80-90 of the groups at the end of the challenge their marshmallow is on the ground it is fallen over it never even um you know got up at all like if you had just put it if you're just taking like you know two sticks and put up one marshmallow on top you would have won the challenge um and the reason why is and they did this test with kids and kids actually are phenomenal at this kids on average will beat the adults at this game and why is that well because what happened is they would give the project to the adults and the adults would spend the first five minutes like delegating roles like okay you're going to be the person who does the planning you're going to be the one who you work on the sticks and the bottom structure we're going to do this over here then they would just like kind of draw out like okay let's do a tp no let's do a ladder let's do this a cube or shape or whatever and they would do all this and at the very end they would try to stick the marshmallow on and what they don't realize is the marshmallow is a lot heavier than it looks and it will outweigh the sticks and it'll all fall over and because they're doing that thing where they wait on the very end to like ship the final good product they don't even realize we're the flaw in their plan until like it's too late essentially whereas what kids will do is kids will immediately grab the thing they'll stick the marshmallow on and it's like if the kids don't eat the marshmallow the marshmallow will like get into the structure very quickly and they'll see oh it falls over okay it falls over that means we need to iterate we need to do things differently than we would have otherwise assumed and that like one lesson i've done at pretty much every company i've ever started because it's the only way i can get engineers and designers who by nature are often like sort of like perfectionist or quality and like they in their associate they in their mind associate the longer we work at this the better the quality will be before we ship it and i'm always like dude let's ship it today let's see how bad it sucks and then let's remove some suck from it and like tomorrow it'll suck a little less and then tomorrow it'll suck a little less again and the best way i've been able to drive this point home is to give them the marshmallow challenge and not just like watch the video watch the ted talk it's like no go fail at this so that you taste defeat and then you will actually learn this lesson dude that's like the greatest ceo thing that you've ever done that's a good one that's a really good one is to make people do this and then make them watch the ted talk that's like that's a really good leadership tactic i'm 100 gonna steal that one day yeah it's it's an awesome one um all right i don't know we went kind of long i don't know if we're good to keep going or not but ben's telling me uh wrap up but uh but uh darmesh this is awesome man i love having you around are you uh you um the last time you were on was like a year ago i think and i've been like i've been like begging you i'm like man just come on and so we messaged him today and he goes i'll just come on today i was like all right cool are you uh i actually i have a quick question what you know people ask me about selling to hubspot and they're like has it been good from a creative perspective it's been awesome you guys have it like we haven't been told a thing on like what we can and cannot do of course i don't think we do anything where anyone would ever tell us you can't do that but uh it made it darmas do you ever get complaints about anything we say that's what i was gonna ask that's what i was gonna ask is there anything that like so far i guess there's nothing that's crossed the line because we've not heard a thing but like it we've it's been crazy how productive uh this relationship has been i did not think that because you know people say one thing and the reality is different but it's not been that way that's been pretty cool yeah thank you i'm glad uh glad that it's working out in your teams you folks have been kind of great for hubspot um and i know this keeps you up at night in terms of valuation i've thought about that a lot um probably not as much as you have but at the time i i would not beat yourself up over it i think it was a fair deal i i don't know that and even at that just so you know even at that price uh and not nothing to do with you but like it was a board level discussion we had this like okay was do we really want to yes not that it wasn't worth that but was it worth that to us at the time because it was a relatively new um new thing that we were doing but um i think there's some perfect for both sides but yeah for sure i think there's a world i think there's a world where in one to three years the podcast alone is worth more than the deal yes i definitely see that yes um yeah but in the same way kind of when we can kind of wrap on this is that when we were talking early in the beginning of the episode around kind of compensation as being just one of the kind of dimensions of value in a acquisition the kind of the valuation that you get the price tag is just one dimension of value then the rest of it is how happy are you how happy is the team did you meet people that will kind of uh you will enjoy working within your future years are you are your future co-founders that kind of thing it's like uh we know that this is not forever we like we know that going in with uh even with people we hire uh but especially with m a but um yeah but hopefully the in aggregate um you know spot delivers a bunch of value that's my uh pitch for why it's okay to join hubspot if you're ever uh out there looking but no it was awesome well thank you this is awesome sean what do you think yeah great episode and i'm glad you used our line against us i i he emailed us something i was like oh you should come back on sometime which is like the sometime is like one of the most dangerous words in the english language yeah because it's like you think it's soon and in reality it's never um and you'd pulled a great move which was what we talked about which is like forget scheduling stuff like either i want to do it and if i if i can do it right now let's do it right now and if not like let's not schedule it for the future because just because we didn't want to do it right now and you were like how about today and we were like all right let's do it let's do it perfect and i intentionally made it um like open it's like okay i knew when my last meeting was it's like any time after this so it's not even like oh like i could have made it work this afternoon but i was only available for the small windows like no any time between 2 p.m and midnight if you get [Music] it's a lot of fun thank you for coming on all right thanks for having me [Music] you

[Music] all right we are live uh what's going on man how are you what's going on gentlemen so we have patrick campbell well the company was profitwell yeah but originally it was it was something else for first right yeah we called it price intelligently so we did a little piece of pricing software morphed into pricing software and service a lot of service actually and then started building this metrics tool and all that kind of fun stuff and then recently sold the paddle which is a payments infrastructure product and the headline the headline price was 200 million dollars and you bootstrapped the company and i think in a tweet you said you owned i don't know if it was you and your co-founder or company owned but like you guys owned almost all of it right yeah we were bootstrapped so we owned 100 of it um and so we uh yeah but we were pretty generous i think i tweeted about the fact that we're pretty generous about giving out equity so it wasn't like i had 100 um we had i think the headline number is we had 13 millionaires we had like 30 35 people made 6ks or more and then i think there's like 120 people all in people who had worked at the company previously in the current employees who got some sort of consideration out of the deal so i think it was true it was over 200 it was over 200 technically like we're not public i don't know it's so weird about these numbers it's like what are you public with what are you not and i have a board and a boss now so i have to have to be a little careful not that careful but a little careful about all the things i say you do you do seem like you're cultivating that trillionaire energy that we like to seize i gotta say i'm getting the vibe i'm getting that i'm getting that extreme satisfaction and relief vibe that comes when you sell a company well sean ask him how tightly wound i am so yeah that's interesting ask him where he just moved to go ahead tell them where did you just move to uh i moved to puerto rico for all the obvious reasons just put it out there just to be very clear uh very obvious reasons why i moved here and it's 80 and i'm not a huge fan of the heat but uh i am like basically recording with a 6k camera right now and that's that's that trillionaire energy where it's like where do you put the money i don't like cars so i got a really cool like dope set up basically i mean that bookshelf needs a little upgrade too if i must be honest here i feel like this was literally like ikea i don't have anything behind me like let's throw some books up and kind of go from there so we'll we'll get there we'll get there so what what exactly did you guys i i we used you i believe but i think we got i think we used you for free and i was like how did these guys make money what exactly did did you guys do yeah so the the headline kind of positioning is we we basically exist to run and grow subscription businesses automatically and the automatically thing was the thing that like really worked well for us um and what i mean by that is like in the perfect vision world you should be able to plug in profit well to any subscription business so into stripe charge be zora whatever you're using for your billing and then automatically like you get all of your metrics for free which is probably what you're referencing and then um we reduce your churn your cancellations automatically optimize your pricing automatically and now with the whole paddle deal we like take care of your taxes automatically chargebacks all that kind of fun stuff and so yeah i think the the the big thing for us was when we were this pricing service um we wanted to get to something that was more pure software and we were helping a company with their pricing that was about to ipo and we actually discovered they were calculating mrr and churn completely wrong which was really fascinating um and so we kind of put those two insights together and then started producing this metrics product so you get all of your financial reporting if you're a subscription or sas company and then there were like 30 competitors and it was like all overnight like the space where we thought we were going to be billionaires for like metrics all of a sudden it was like oh my god like everyone and their mother is building a stripe integration and so um we did some homework we did some research all that kind of fun stuff and basically discovered that like either this is a terrible business and we should stop doing it because no one is really great at monetizing metrics or the free route which is what we did and um i think that's probably when we should have raised money like in in hindsight but long story short that's what grew and we had at the end well it's still going but we had 30 000 companies using profitwell um basically when we sold and that number is just kind of going up every single day which is great and when you you reached out to us and you were like hey i think you do you listen to the pod is that kind of why you reached out of course yeah absolutely i'm glad to hang out with the 12 year olds from a recent episode i learned yeah you said something which kind of tipped me off you were like i grew up in wisconsin doing hood rat [ __ ] hat tip to sam i was like oh okay he knows jokes he knows about sometimes you just want to do hood ratchet of course that's why we're getting a ranch built in utah right now everything's gonna be great like that's that's that's the hood wrap world there are are you really you're building a ranch in utah yeah that's the goal so i grew up in wisconsin right so i grew up like literally milking cows as a kid and like you know kind of having the let's say the sampar lifestyle like my dad has no idea what i do he's like just confused he thinks i'm being a tax evader moving to puerto rico like all that kind of fun blue collar sam he's like he was just more rich yeah yeah what'd you say sean that's funny yeah yeah he's like you're just more rich it looks like it that's what it i do what i can s think the difference is that sam's living a little like i'm like all in like just still like nose to the grindstone but yeah i grew up in wisconsin and then after school i moved to dc i worked in us intelligence and then worked in tech in boston and that's kind of when i got into the to the business space basically but what i was gonna say is you reached out intelligently because we get a bunch of people who are like hey would love to come on and tell my story it's like yeah i'm sure you would who wouldn't want to come on and tell their story like i also like to get you know free fame but the the thing you did was you sent us like i don't know six or seven bullet points you're like uh here's you know here's some stuff i can talk about and then you sent us i would say like five or six really interesting things so i kind of want to hop around on those um sam did you have a favorite one that you liked from these uh okay well let's so do you have it in front of you it's hidden industries i got in front of it so okay so yeah that's the juicy that's the juicy one so basically you said i think we have the largest subscription financial database in the world right like you you guys have 100 20 30 billion dollars of annual recurring revenue flowing through your system which is just a bunch of data that will tell you i bet you there's some things that are like huh no way they make that much right there's like some surprising niches that that make a lot of money and then there's maybe some trends or benchmarks so take it where you want it but i think that's one that's going to be super interesting for i know i want to know i don't know the answer so i know people listening will too yeah totally so there's there's there's a couple things so one like just to give an example like um we we would always like so we study the data in aggregate that's what helps like train our algorithms for like churn reduction and all that kind of fun stuff but then the other really interesting thing is like we publish a lot of content on this so a lot of sas companies it's like oh what should our churn be what should this look like so we publish a lot of that the other thing that got really interesting was we would basically be kind of like a hidden like helper for deal flow for a lot of vcs and we would never like reveal someone's like particular numbers of course not but like what was really fascinating is when kind of the the jungle scout amazon you know kind of play was happening like we would all of a sudden have like all of these apps just break our qa scripts because every time like someone was growing too fast we would go oh something must be broken with the metrics right right so that's a little bit of context um there's like three or four really fascinating industries especially going into a recession that i think are really good for like people who want to fast move into them one one of these industries that's kind of crazy to talk about quilting and crafts quilting and crafts subscription companies are like growing insane um what's fascinating is the quilting space if the if you didn't know quilting is um it's about a four and a half billion dollar per year industry um the average quilter spends about eight to nine thousand dollars per year on like quilting supplies um most of that comes not just online but it comes through quilt shops so there's a really interesting local play that we've seen some of these companies um use and some of the more popular apps quilting just means like making a blanket that has like designs on it right uh for the most part um now as a mom a midwest mom who does hardcore quilting like there's a lot of other stuff like our house we didn't have pictures up we had quilts that were hung right of like different designs and all kinds of stuff but yeah every major milestone in my life i got a quilt like i have six quilts in puerto rico that are useless to me just given how like warm it is here there's there's paint i see went to someone else's house they had a painting on the wall it's like no no you don't need that just put a blanket on the wall yeah yeah it's great sound deadening it's really good sound ending but yeah it's really interesting because like that market has gone wild like even like knitting like crafts that type of stuff and what's really interesting about it is like especially in the subscription space there's a lot of these built-in type projects that these companies have started taking advantage of so there's this thing called block of the month club that has been around since quilters have existed you create a block of a quilt every single you know month basically and it's like a community type thing um so there's something there quilt retreats are a huge thing like quilt retreats like i didn't know about that like all of these mostly like middle aged or older women coming together like hanging out and staying up all night talking and like you know quilting so that's one space the craft space knitting all that kind of stuff is really interesting another one that's interesting is uh basically old people uh but before you move on before sam yeah do you know stuff about quilting i feel like you know we have knowledge about this stuff no i i don't but i'm looking at i just googled block of the month club so that that's like a that's like a genre of clubs that's not like the name of a of a club right and i just i'm just looking at yeah or i don't know a style and i'm looking up what what these are what these are and i'm looking at the businesses it wouldn't shock me if some of these are doing nine figures so 100 million dollars plus in subscription revenue based off there's some other traffic like there's craftsy there's annie's kit clubs.com do you know anything about these yeah yeah so there's there's there are definitely nine figure companies in the space i'll put it that way and then nine figures a year so 100 million plus in subscription revenue for sell and they basically like i don't know what differentiates all them i'm just clicking on the ads but they just sell like they send you a block you know what a block is sean like just one square patch of the quilt a square patch and during the holidays this is making my dreams come true right now just this whole like learning you guys right now people think that i i am midwestern i grew up in like an urban environment so i grew up in like the city so we didn't we weren't exactly quilting but we basically what they do is they they send you a patch like a like a block like a six inch by six inch block and it looks like it's like got like pumpkins and a snowman on it and that's like the holiday version of what do you do with that you stitch that into the other blocks that you've been getting yeah so basically here's here's how quilt gets made i can't believe i'm about to explain this so a quilt gets made by these blocks now sometimes it's just designs sometimes it's got stuff on it like snowmen and stuff like that so you create these blocks you build a top so let's say you want like a king-sized bed it's just the top so it's just one layer of fabric what you do is you take it to a quilt shop and then you go to the quilt shop and that quilt shop is going to charge you per inch to put a back and then a batting which is like the stuff that makes it kind of a blanket and then they like put a design in there as they like put those layers together and then you have a quilt um right and then some hardcore moms like my mom has her own basically quilting machine it's like an eight-foot machine to basically make all of these quilts out so yeah it's and this is the thing your mom's a bad 99 of them are on like facebook they're all like they're really targetable which is really fascinating and like the youtube content that's come out of like the quilt community is pretty wild as well and um yeah there's there's this one in missouri i can't remember exactly but it was like this town that was like basically you know on its last legs this woman her you know basically her son started doing youtube videos where she would just explain how to do quilting stuff it's created it basically revitalized the town like because everyone comes on buses to come visit the town and go to the quilt shop and all that kind of fun stuff and um the quilt shows quilt and craft shows are pretty fascinating this is all my childhood coming out because i got dragged to use bookstores and quilt shops basically and the quilt shows are wild like they'll just be famous quilters on stage with a camera like doing quilt stuff like basically which is just kind of a fascinating world and it's a lot of money in it that's like kind of like old school meaning like there's a couple of really big players that kind of sell everything and there's all these new school folks coming in and kind of lopping off different segments that i would look at uh so the one i was describing uh these moms while you're looking at that up these moms these quilters are not using instagram a lot it looks like i'm like looking up quilting on instagram and facebook groups real heavy there's not a ton of pages on instagram that are doing quilting but it's like an opportunity by the way uh to like build big quilting pages on instagram they are facebook groups they're the facebook group i've seen everyone just researching while i'm here i'm looking at tons of highly engaged quilting facebook groups well it's also interesting like you'll even in boston like there'll be these little like meetups so the younger community they're kind of going through um knitting into like quilting because it's like oh you get to build something the designs are a lot more modern all that kind of fun stuff but yeah it's an interesting interesting world a missouri star quilt company is the one that i was referencing the youtube kind of kind of world how big is that uh i don't know their revenue individually i don't think they have a subscription sean have you heard of hallmark you know hallmark cards of course so neighbor used to own like 50 hallmark stores really i was like how's these how are these people so rich and they're like oh now they own like 100 hallmarks so hallmark is an interesting company related to this and i'm everything i'm saying is is off the top of my off memory so i may be wrong but they hallmark is a privately owned business it's owned by a family and i think it's one of the largest privately owned companies in the world in america and they do five billion dollars a year in revenue and i think that they make money in two ways they uh have these stores that are franchises and they just sell cards so hallmark just sells cards and then the other thing that's kind of weird is they owned hallmark media which is a hallmark tv station channel yeah yeah where they make like it's a joke it's like a genre hallmark movies which is like sappy movies that moms like but i wouldn't be surprised if they own like if if they're just like uh you know behind the scenes in the quilting game just calling the shots you know what i mean they're deep in the underground quilt game yeah [Laughter] some of the big originals they're huge this this hobby i think has legs for a couple reasons one is um it has a bunch of factors that individually are strong characters of like you know potentially good businesses but when you stack them it becomes even more valuable so it's like this is a stacking of trends so you have the trend of diy and crafts at home right then you have the trend of oddly satisfying which is you've seen these videos of people cutting sand or like asmr stuff like this which is like there's a therapeutic benefit to doing these things tac like these repetitive tedious clean straight lines you know stuff with your hands that you can do that has like a tactile feel to it then you add on community and it's like oh yeah people get together and they do this together okay so now this is an excuse it's like you know guys getting together to play poker or something like that it's like yeah yeah we don't all really you know we're not trying to be the best poker player but it's just an excuse to sit around and [ __ ] and so you start stacking these on top of each other then it's like nostalgia because people are making quilts out of like their kids clothes and stuff like that because you know they don't want you what else yeah what do i do with these old stuff and then all it becomes this like this like memory in this heirloom and i'm like you know i have a blanket that my grandma made before she passed away and it's like that means something to our family because she made it right it's like a memory of her so you stack all these things on top of each other and now you have this like you know sort of like this uh you know long island iced tea of a business where you stacked all these different you know things into one cocktail and it's it's just a strong you know son of a [ __ ] additionally i think uh maybe you could kind of tell me if this is true or not but from my experience most people in silicon valley and young people they're like we're going to make this app or this widget for like millennials or gen z in reality every business that i know of personally that or the majority of my friends who own businesses that sell stuff to women in middle america between the ages of 30 and 60 hands down has the highest loyalty and engagement and lowest amount of churn is that accurate other than businesses i'm a group of consumers yeah so normally if you're selling to normally older audiences from a consumer perspective retain at a higher rate um mainly because of the implications that you're already alluding to um it's they're less finicky like they're harder to convert sometimes because of that loyalty but once they're in they've like made a decision and then they're they're sticking it out for quite some time um and this is kind of like as a lesson like i can tell you anytime there is a more premium product or a more niche audience you just have better churn like every single time so like butcher box started with the you know whole kind of paleo crowd a very niche it was very premium in terms of price point worked out really well whoops started very high they were like we're athletes and then all these people who were like i want to be an athlete too and they're charging 30 bucks a month right um that's always what i recommend is if you're starting something especially if you're bootstrapping um start high and then come down it's a lot easier um than it is to like start really cheap and then go back up unless you're running a freemium model which is a very different model to run sean have you ever been doing have you been doing applebee's lately oh hell yeah chili's and applebee's baby have you really been doing applebees yes i have that's hilarious um so do you know how their whole shtick is like even though it's a chain it like they they put like the neighborhood baseball team on the wall which who knows if it's they're actually from that neighborhood like you know whenever you go there they make it feel like that well i had a friend that worked on the advertising part of of applebee's and one time we had to go there and like order everything on the menu and drink and eat it all it was horrible but i was like tony this food is like quite bad like this is horrible i don't like i don't i don't think you're gonna be able to be able to make this cool like you know you're telling me like a it was like a nuclear green like limeade like i was like dude this is horrible i don't want to drink this [ __ ] this is awful or like one time why does the cheese taste like beans and the beans taste like cheese let's go yeah well they they sent over something i'm like i don't know what this is and so we dipped it in there and it was icing uh like it was like a side of icing and i was like dude this is horrible why do people like this he's like well it's mostly middle america and they call i believe that they called their ideal customer a jim bob which is someone who is in their 50s 60s and 70s and has a little bit of money but wants to continue going there because it feels like it's the last like hoorah for the neighborhood and they're supporting their neighborhood and they're willing to put up with the crappy food because it somehow feels like their way of life is under attack and this is like the last like thing that represents their neighborhood even though it's some huge national yeah the world is changing so much and this is all this is the one staple that like you walk in and it feels exactly the same as it did when you were 14 right what yeah are we gonna say i literally wrote this last night so i'm reading a slack message last night 12 35 a.m so right after midnight i just slacked this to myself i i wrote if you're selling a cool thing to a cool person you're playing the game wrong that is hard mode and this is all of you know you meet most people in d2c most people in silicon valley it's like they're they are in their 20s they're cool and new in the world and they're selling to cool and new people in la and new york and san francisco and they're like yeah of course like you know i'm gonna create this new cool thing and i'm gonna sell it to new cool people and what you wanna do is you wanna sell simple things to simple people and so um and i had a buddy tell me this with um a project i was working on he goes he goes okay so what's your main like sales channel i was like oh facebook ads he goes okay so that means your customer at scale is an overweight overworked mom in texas and he's like so i look at your website and i don't see anything that like appeals to her uh like it doesn't have to look like her at least to look like how she wants to look and um and it basically was like you know if you can't sell to an overweight overworked mom in texas like you can't scale and i was like what the hell like okay okay you don't even know any overweight overworked moms in texas do you i used to live in houston that turned out to be a valuable it's just like you were saying like you know my mom used to drag me probably kicking and screaming to these quilting shows and now that you're an entrepreneur you're like ooh quilting niche tell me more right like it's like we flip you know the thing we used to resist now we we you know want to want to go go for it and so it's the same thing like growing up in texas that's like man i just thought everything cool was in new york and san francisco and la and i just wanted to go there and now that i'm here i'm like dude i don't want to sell to these like fickle millennials who are like you know you know trying to do like berry detoxes like i want to sell you know something to a mom in texas because if i can do that that's a license to print money and like if you go look at you know the best-selling car the last i don't know 30 years is the ford f-150 it's a you know it's a pickup truck that sells for for 36 thousand dollars you go around san francisco you won't see one right you know you would think the best-selling car in america is the tesla model x you know and it's like that's just not the case uh because you're in you're in a bubble and so you know and i think the jim bob you know overweight mom in texas the you know the other one is you know the enterprise sales one is like you know you're selling to bob the mid-level manager or the senior manager who's you know got a little bit of a belly and he's losing his hair like that's who you're selling to and you gotta like can you nail that sale because if you can you could build a very very big business and i mean that like the most loving way possible which is basically just saying to most entrepreneurs and most kind of young people like get out of your bubble well you end up not chasing fads like there's a lot of fads like business builds on built on fads right and and those are great businesses right like we hear about them all the time the guy who what was it the um the teeth like i can't remember like the the hillbilly teeth you remember this at gas stations like apparently like 20 million like business right like the snuggie huge fad you know hundreds of millions of dollars i believe in revenue but like something like quilting has been around forever it's not sexy right but the targeting gets really interesting and like some of the other things right like you guys talk about this a lot where it's like services business you know lawn care hvac all these other things end up being like stuff that sticks around for a long time and you know through the businesses that you don't really hear of and there's a lot of opportunity in terms of roll up or like flipping the model that you know was basically being used by the folks that are the incumbents so what are some of these other if you're if you're going to innovate innovate on just one thing so it's like oh quilting people love but there's not a lot of instagram theme pages and communities on instagram okay that's like it's just like i can do one new thing on top of nine old time you know uh nine things that are still gonna be the same and that's like a new thing right sam did the news but he did it through email instead of through you know printed papers right and so like one new thing and then he didn't need to change everything else everything else could stay the same because the human needs stayed the same oh yeah sorry we went a long ass time on quilting but talking about quilting baby that's great yeah what else do you got what are some other kind of niches three other spaces have to go deeper uh trades roll-ups plumbing companies hvac companies electrician companies there's a lot of that stuff happening it's not like machine shops or those types of things where it's just like hard to innovate it's like skilled enough that there's a niche and there's like a moat but it's not skilled enough that you can't roll it up a lot of these guys and gals are looking for basically a way to retire and it's kind of like accountant you know shops like they don't get more than one x max right in terms of their business um basically things to sell to kids of old people that's the best way to look what is that what does that mean i don't know i saw you wrote that products that prey on baby boomer kid guilt yeah yeah so a really good example um it's not a huge company because it's a one-man shop out of boston is nanograms it's basically a um i don't know if you email or you post it on instagram and then it automatically sends a postcard to your nana or to you know whomever you want to send it to um so there's some really interesting things that are happening there where like you have high disposable income in a certain group low amount of time that wants to be spent necessarily with like you know their parents or their grandparents depending on you know the the personality um and as basically the trend that's happening is there's a huge portion of population that are aging so you're seeing like the multiples on things like um old folks homes or hospice care actually increasing pretty substantially which is kind of crazy and then there's there's got to be more technology plays i don't have like a giant technology play there i just have seen like a number of people like start to build on that particular trend um and then the last one which i think is really interesting is death that sounded terrible that i found death interesting no i'm not that that's scary but um there are four or maybe five companies that basically own everything in the literal last mile of your life coffins um uh the the funeral service homes everything that's being sold in the funeral service homes even like how the memories and kind of like that last part looks um there are some businesses that have tried but because of like the five people kind of owning everything and multi-billion dollar companies what's the biggest essentially happened i don't have the names in front of me i know someone tried five years ago um a guy named dave balter in boston basically tried to start a like memory company where basically you would load up memories essentially and then all of a sudden you would get that information back via alexa so you could be like oh alexa would tell me about my grandpa or something like that and what happened like six years ago or something with him um in an adventure but um he was the one telling me that like basically he would go visit you know these companies like hey maybe i could sell to these companies and they were all like buttoned up suits you know all that kind of fun stuff and so that's a space that i think given the aging population there's probably something there that makes sense as well gotcha okay let's switch gears real quick you had said something else which was um let's do some quick hits okay so let's try to do these uh give me the kind of the quick quick jab on these you said i used nsa learnings to do competitive intelligence what the hell are you talking about yeah yeah yeah so i my first job out of school i worked at nsa uh so i was an intel analyst best way to put it i was like jack ryan's desk job so none of the cool stuff i did have weapons and defensive driving training which is kind of cool the defensive driving training is like so much more useful than the weapons training in my real life um but what's really interesting about it is like it's basically was the best career start in like first principles thinking and like thinking about like a target um and so i had a competitive intel program basically at profitwell it was just me running it where um i had every quarter i had stats and it's kind of like what you guys have talked about before but like a little bit deeper so what i did is i had shadow lists of like our each competitor even our partners like customers and i would send like shadow nps surveys um you know product research surveys these types of things and the thing that people miss on competitive intel is like it has to be done over time um and this is something that like they teach you when you're going after a target on the inside which is like i need to understand not just a point i need to understand like multiple points in order to kind of create a profile basically and how did you get this how did you get that mps stuff no he said he sent a fake nps i straight up sent surveys to their customer sent surveys to their so walk me through that how do you get through all your research methodologies this is crazy fascinating yeah yeah so um there's two there's two main sources of information there's moles and then mass data moles are like qualitative like almost like customer development product conversations these are former employees these are um you know customers i know that are friendly to me they're not going to switch because of whatever but i can like talk to them okay well let's pause that former employees you go you find okay this person used to work here what what happens what is the what is the guy i do this all the time present this way yeah me and sam talked about this on the pod once but totally so i like you meet him at a conference uh oh it looked like on twitter that didn't end well they weren't like after four long wonderful years at so and so i've now moved on but it was like i'm now over here right they took out the competitor name that's someone i want to like like a better phrase target and have a conversation with and be like hey man how's everything going right like that type of a thing um and again you're not going to get a vast amount of information but again it's about collecting different points right and then i've talked to an investor and then i've talked to an investor who's thinking of investing in the company and then i've talked to like some customers who are officially churning from the product and all of a sudden i can start putting this together but that the more fascinating stuff and that's color right like that's color that kind of guides your analysis because you as an analyst what you're trying to do is you're trying to predict what's going to happen or based on some sort of stimulus what they're going to do right so if all of a sudden something comes in or there's a feature that's launched or some sort of messaging or marketing thing that happens what are they going to do and that's going to help you respond to whatever they're going to do right and prepare for it right so that was really interesting because you almost get like feel from those types of people like oh it turns out like there's an exodus a lot of people are leaving that's great let's step on the gas here but the real kind of secret sauce is what you know sam started asking about which was there are many lists of customers that you can find um if they have some sort of a snippet obviously built with clear bit all those types of things right that's one everyone likes to talk about their customers right so they have case studies that's two everyone likes to put the logos on their website that's three right and so you're looking at social you're looking at built with you're looking at all these logos and then i'm like well who's the main customer right i can go find all those email addresses right and you're not looking for like oh my god i have ten thousand people because most of these people have ten thousand customers right but we're looking for is enough but then i'm gonna start sending on in every three month basis a survey or every other month i'm going to send an nps survey and then i'm going to send so what domain did you send the survey from like yeah like your name plus feedback feedback.com or something or what there's a couple i don't want to go too deep but like like probably like meditation's already fried on this so like um let's say you're let let's say you're trying to uh let's say you're creating a hubspot competitor and you want to get hubspot mps information you send an email that it's like um uh hubspacefeedback.com or like get hubspot feedback.com or something like that i wouldn't go that far because if someone finds that out like it looks real bad right um but what i would and i'm sure people are gonna think everything i'm saying is really bad but like whatever right and so what i would do is i'll do more like marketing softwareresearch.com or something to that effect and then the way that i position it is hey so and so you've been identified as a user of hubspot i would love 30 seconds of your time to understand what you love and what you don't love right and the 30 seconds there 30 to 60 seconds there is really important we've sent our pricing software's fed through surveys we've sent like probably 10 million surveys at this point if you're not compensating someone on an individual basis the raffle thing doesn't work it's i mean it will work with some people but most people doesn't work but if you're not compensating you have 30 to 60 seconds so i'll send a survey that max five questions right nps standard question here's five features what's the most appreciated most preferred feature of that list same list what's the least preferred right so three questions maybe i'll throw in uh anything else you want to tell us about hubspot right and then all of a sudden i have like a picture and then i'm gonna send oh it's interesting we're thinking about building this thing they're thinking about building that thing like let's do something next next quarter or next month but the same survey can be sent multiple different times but the important thing here is you're building a timeline right because now all of a sudden i can see these trends and what was really interesting and the thing that i told you guys about was not only so first you should never show this information to your product team it is the worst information like we've seen like competitive based product teams are really bad like it just doesn't work um but i have data and i'm happy to share it that competitive based marketing teams like teams that it's correlative of course it's not causal but those folks who have competitive programs typically have much better retention and lower cac so because they just understand what are you talking about what basically he's saying what in planning is what he's saying is you learn this stuff if you go tell the product team hey here's here's what they said they want or here's what you should build them up they screws them up they don't they don't build the right stuff but if you go you should be part of the team and you say here's what's here's what pain points were most important to them or here's what benefits were most important to them or here's what here's how they rank these guys versus us the marketing teams if you have that competitive intel as part of your process a marketing team will perform better than a marketing team without that perfect example real world example we start hearing this is the early days of the metrics product we realize getting accuracy for metrics is actually incredibly difficult because it's not like marketing metrics that can be like five percent off like financial metrics if you tell me i have this much money that's supposed to be in my bank account i'm making decisions based off that it has to be 99.9 if not 100 right so we start feeling this just as a product team all of a sudden we start hearing from some of my like my my moles if you will and they don't know that they were these people just to be clear it's not like i turned them and they're like you know there's drops and everything like that but also i start hearing like ah yeah we're using up the accuracy sucks right so all of a sudden we start hearing this totality of information all of a sudden that is our core marketing strategy every single time comparison pages we didn't do that many of them but every single comparison page is the number one thing all of our ads like competitive ads that's what they were and then over time all of a sudden that became their home pages right because they're reacting to us rather than us reacting to them because we found the snippet that makes the most sense and the the most like aggressive thing um if this doesn't sound aggressive enough is so i have all this data i have all this information i've collected it i've synthesized it i know by the way do you keep that like a spreadsheet or like a notion and you're making and you're writing like narrative formats it depends on how i'm using it right so the data is just tracking over time right so i've i can send you like some slides or something like that so i have some slides that like i put together for when we were going to go raise money for the first time as well because it's just really good data in general one thing i have is is basically spreadsheets that has a lot of this information especially the qualitative and then the other thing that i build off of this are red team docs i don't know if you guys know what those are but basically like every thought i've had or every thought that i learned from this data because this data like customer data and market data is probably 10x more important but this is like some interesting data that's easy to talk about in a podcast um but red team docs is when i look at all this data it's like what are the things that kill us every single thought that i've had that could like kill us or hurt us goes into a dock some of those docs get built out oh someone accuses me of x someone says this on twitter and then it basically at minimum has here are the steps that we're going to take so that when that thing happens all of a sudden we have a head start on the little critical piece of the thinking um but to make a long story short the the thing that i reference with you guys is i would have like these are all funded competitors so they would try to go raise money i would have their um the people they were trying to raise money from come to me like not tell me that they were trying to raise money but it's obvious because they invest in the space it's not the associate it's like the partner coming like all that kind of stuff some of them would straight up tell me like hey we're thinking of investing and so and so what do you think but what i would do then is i would show them these slides and i would just basically be like here's all the information on us and and the person that you're thinking of investing in i wouldn't say that unless they were upfront about it and what it i i know for one we we killed one of the rounds that someone was trying to raise like i can tell you that definitively um because one like okay i'm gonna invest in someone going against this psycho who like has all this information right like that's pretty scary thing and then two like all of our numbers are better because i you know we just ended up you know doing really well at certain a certain number of things right and so um that that i think is again it's a program that i think that you should have at least at a bare minimum um from a marketing and go to market perspective if you have a market that becomes really competitive if you're in like the blue ocean as they say like it's probably a waste of time um but it's just something where our ocean got red real quick um i think the look on your face tell me what you're thinking right now i think i'm very good at research and i'm very good at doing what i do which is like doing the exact same thing of finding moles getting intel reverse engineering you have said i think i'm a nine out of ten you have said some some things to me that i realize that there's another couple levels that i can go to improve it's pretty magical uh the that's pretty amazing yeah well then keep in mind like i have all this market data right so that was interesting too because all of a sudden i can understand like so for example covet hit again i can't look at anyone's accounts and we're very very um very very like strict about that but i can see oh this sector that has 50 plus accounts which is our terms this sector's tanking this sector's taking off i can change my marketing almost instantly right and when you have some competitive intel especially on segments like i knew the segments that our competitors were going after and i knew the segments we were going after um it just helps feed the wheel and when you're feeding the wheel and you're getting that phd in your business which i think is really important if you're if you're going all in like all of a sudden it's like now a lot of the decisions like we don't have to think about because it's like we know what's happening we know what string is being pulled let's react to it let's respond to it and kind of go from there how much of your time is spent on that r sorry well now it's a system best way possible it's a system now so it's a system so i don't spend that much time i just get the collect right and it's just documentation right so for example i have names like i know i have i have six names that i can tell you of users of a competitor of ours i see them pretty regularly especially since events are back i'm friends with a couple of them right and i'm not like i i'm not hiding the fact like hey how's it going with competitor a right like i'm not hiding it right like and that and that's the thing that like there's a point here where i think you're you're kind of being an [ __ ] like and and you're you know being like conniving and then there's a point where you're just like being smart and collecting data and i try to stay like obviously on that part of the divide if that makes sense did you ever think about turning would you ever turn that into a business yes yeah i think you could create a really good business around collecting nps data honestly g2 crowd reviews that's where there's a ton of like data like i would love someone should create this because it would just do my job which is great um quarterly report kind of like for this is the thing forrester reports i think there's also like a market to like blow that whole business up give me like quarterly reports instead of these reports where you called 100 people a quarterly report on the same company or on the same industry that has here the reviews the new reviews positive of a competitor hear the bad reviews negative of a competitor um here's mps data all that kind of fun stuff and you know again you have to be careful on how much you use this information like you're using it to build like a profile you're not using it to like immediately react to and that's a mistake a lot of people make shauna and i had we brainstormed this a lot and we were talking about how we both use glass door reviews because even though like glass doors typically like either fake or incredibly happy employees or like disgruntled employees there's not really a middle but like you could still get a lot of interesting information from there and you get instrument information from like linkedin like they'll say like you know i manage a pipeline of a 10 million dollar a year business and like oh okay thanks for telling me and like we would like we we we brainstorm this idea of this business where we i think we call it like i spy or something or like it involved like spying on like many people in a in a particular industry and just sending you an email because you can use like facebook ads manager and be like oh wow these guys just made a switch they are now targeting older women as opposed to younger women and we called it like spy something and it's kind of funny you worked for the nsa you you you you know you are the spy that we were talking about so like it is kind of interesting i do think actually a business could be built doing this i can't find this client info have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases hubspot grow better i think the problem is is that so i've been talking about customer development customer research because you should do all of this for your customers that's what you first start with rather than your competitors like better stuff sounds sexier right but i think that like i used to talk when i give talks at conferences or like events all about customer development 15 of people like care and then even when you give them like everyone cares everyone tweets the tweet oh yeah you should talk to your customers right 15 people actually do the work and then when you actually take care of the work for them and just give them the data and this is the one risk of this type of a business i'm sure there's a big business in it but then they like don't know what to do with it right and so all of a sudden it's like okay you're kind of giving people information which that's probably fine because it's a vitamin then like they don't they they like that they have it right but then actually implementing on stuff like they probably don't do it and that means like i don't know if you if you get a 36 month customer like i'll take it right like they don't need to be 60 months necessarily for for you to build a big business right you're doing one other thing that i find fascinating uh actually actually well there's two you said you're but i'll start with the less fascinating one you said you're buying a [ __ ] ton of debt for pennies on the dollar and gonna forgive it so what's actually going on there everyone wants to be mr beast on a long enough timeline everyone wants to be mr beast that's what it feels like theory i like it no so like here's the thing i i'm probably going to reinvest everything that i got into this into like another business did you say how much how much did you make from the sale trying i gotta work with a lot of people uh so i'm trying not to to be super over or under nine figures uh i'm not going to say what i got let's just put it that way but um i was i asked you if it was over or under 100 million dollars and it took you a minute to think about it so what i'm going to assume it's that number give or take 30 percent uh give or take 30 yeah let's just let's but like again part of its stock it's not all cash like there's a lot of different factors here that we i don't want to get into but i am i'm going to i'm fine right now like i'm going to do fine that if that makes sense so um but i want to reinvest it because like again i'm i'm not a car guy i'm not like and again i've had it for like two months i went from like this is a fun fact i did the whole dave ramsey don't have any debt pay off the house as soon as possible thing so in january i had twenty thousand dollars in my bank account in a paid off house like that was it and then this happened so um i haven't adjusted to it is what i'm trying to say so like this might change in like six months but i i want to like you know i want to go all out and go all out not in a way of like you know like fancy cars and stuff like that but like in stuff that's really interesting and gets me on the quickest path to learning and one of the reasons for the debt thing um and also the i don't know if you're gonna bring up the other one but like the debt thing was this mark the debt market's just crazy like it's insane right it's it's insane how much debt there is how that debt is purchased i don't understand it and this is one of the ways that i can like really understand it and also do some good in the world where it's like i can buy a bunch of debt for pennies on the dollar i can understand how that system works how debt collectors work how the debt collector sell to another debt collector um and then also like obviously forgiveness so make it simple what what debt have you bought what how are you buying debt what bet are you buying are you buying it what are you doing with it yeah yeah i'm i have not actually purchased the debt yet right i am basically exploring right now i just put some feelers out because that's the other thing the debt market who did you reach out to to see if you can acquire something see that's the interesting part that's about to was about to bring up it's so shadowy that like there's not like a website that's like we buy all the debt and then sell the debt and all that kind of stuff there's nothing so i have a buddy um i think he's i don't know if he's cool with me saying his name but he used to he runs a really cool subscription conference now but he used to do this and i was asking him he was on like the the board of one of these debt agent like associations like a business association and i was like hey man isn't it scammy and he's explaining to me that like in that market there's like 20 of the market that's like very bad like those are the ones you hear all the stories about threatening people the other part of the market like he was in this he was like he would just call people and be like hey like what can you do right because he bought it for pennies on the dollar so he's like give me 30 percent great like he made money they get it done all that this is like someone who studied that market this is like someone who owes two thousand dollars because they got an x-ray or took an ambulance or um yeah i don't know whatever else you have credit card debt for right yeah and the other thing is the reason the reason this is interesting and this is like to kind of speak a little bit more like how i'm thinking is like i don't want to build a quilt company although it would be fascinating don't get me wrong like i the stuff polymer lucky's doing in defense i'm i'm all about it the stuff that like uh aaron swartz did uh before his passing like in terms of opening up uh databases that were that were behind um gateways but supposed to be free making them free like that's the type of stuff i want to do and like if you look at debt money in politics and defense those are three giant areas where like there's huge things holding us back um cost plus pricing and defense is holding us back the palmer's working on it debt there's just so much debt um most of it's student or not most of it but a lot of it's student debt and so like there's something interesting there of like how can you make money but also like not be a jerk right and also like you know take that burden off people's plates and then politics money and politics there's something there because i don't think we're just gonna magically have you know people wake up and be like let's vote against having this much money in politics so like what's the world would look like where you accelerate the money in politics and hopefully break some of the log jams and kind of go from there so that's that's those are the three things i really think about um in terms of like post paddle life if that makes sense and uh sam you want to do anything on those otherwise there's one yeah well before we i want to get to this last one this is interesting but i i do want to do a quick i have a quick question which is you you're 32 right 33 how old are you uh yeah 30 33 yeah i turned 34 in a couple months so you're 33 34. you just made a huge sum of money have you done the math to when you become a billionaire uh i'm sure you have and uh how does it feel to have such a huge sum at such a young age i mean that's pretty wild right here's the thing i learned and some of your guests so actually friend of the show hermosie i talked to him a couple weeks ago and what i told him and he kind of was like yeah exactly back was it amplifies the worst in you and the best in you you're just the same person right so like i thought when i was gonna get money i was gonna like oh i'm gonna be healthier because i can like afford you know someone to yell at me about eating it's like no like now i can afford to go to terrible places all the time right and you know i could afford that before but like i think it's one of those things where i'm a big believer something i talk a lot about and i don't know if this is interesting but like teddy roosevelt of all people wrote this speech called the strenuous life and is basically his concept and i think it's a better speech everyone references man in the arena i think man in the arena is [ __ ] versus strenuous life he basically said in a modern parlance like if you've been given something like whether it's you know middle class life upper class life whatever it is if you've had an exit even though you worked for it right whatever like your duty is to re like go be strenuous again right your duties to go crazy and like you know go deeper do make big swings right and that's why i'm talking about like i don't want to go into quilting because it's like yeah there's a money grab there i think it's great but like i want to like fix democracy i want to like have defense i want to fix debt like i want to try and fix those types of things um because i think like for every person doing that like you obviously have tons of people that are digging ditches who have no ability to like you know they're leading a strenuous slice because they have to so yeah i'm and i know that sounds like i don't know people judge that answer like in multiple different ways but like yeah i'm having fun but i'm also like all in right like i'm trying to go and it's part of the reason we went to paddle is like i didn't want to like hand over the keys because i wasn't done yet i want to see what a company going through a public offering like looks like like i want to see that so that i can decide do i like that do i want to go big next or do i want to do more like small [ __ ] so that's kind of what what i'm thinking about if that makes sense when you were younger were you kind of like highly competitive at anything or like you know you between ages i don't know 12 to 18 did if you look back now if you were like a a researcher just getting to observe you behind the glass panel would you have seen anything in the way you behaved that would lead you to think oh this guy is going to have like a really interesting career in life or would you have looked like an you know an average teenager at that time um yeah so i had a not i don't know how sam would look at this i had like a midwest childhood let's say a bad midwest childhood which is like the things that happened to me like would clearly be abused today but maybe back then like they were like okay and so um so there was that and i think that like that makes me an incredibly insecure human being like i'm incredibly insecure about like most things but what i kind of learned and i don't know if this was trial and error but i had some good like mentors in life is like instead of like taking that and go become you know a deadbeat like channel it right like use that anxiety like and channel it the one thing in the answer to your question um fun fact i am a national champion debater um so i uh i did speech and forensics um in in high school should i make the joke john yeah or do you like it would you consider yourself a master 12 year old 12 year olds i love it yeah so i i did by the way so this is this segment i don't know if you heard this we did this segment on here i said i've observed these three patterns people who are amazing at debate go on to do amazing in business people are amazing gamers can go on to do amazing um i think poker was maybe my other one but those three are like not you wouldn't associate that with success in the business world but they have like this i just keep seeing it over and over and over again well so you know what it is so i i did um so i like i was doing football and like wrestling and all that stuff i had to have foot surgeries for whatever some reason and basically i was like oh i can't i can't do wrestling that season so i went and started doing what's called forensics when you're in high school and then i was like oh you can get scholarships so i went to the school i went to on scholarship to to do this and it was one of the best schools in the country for it it's bradley university like lovely school but like as the northwestern kids would make fun of us in illinois like you get a public school education at a private school price basically unless you're on scholarship that type of thing and if you think about it so what i was doing is at least in college for 40 hours a week four years i was synthesizing information and structuring arguments and getting to root cause right which are these things that we always talk about i never wanted to go into business i my dad still thinks i should be a doctor i was going to go into law law but you know more people were graduating you know in law school than actual legal jobs when i graduated so long story short it was one of those things where i was like you know i can synthesize information really quickly right and that's like i talk a little faster and all this other stuff and so i think that's that's helped me a lot because literally our marketing strategy in the early days was i just write blog posts and i can write them pretty quickly and they're relatively deep they're not all gems but you know it's one of those things that that definitely helped me and i use it i probably use it every day you want to go to the last one sean this is the most interesting one you're doing you're also doing a hostile takeover publicly traded person so i saw this is this guy i don't know how you say it i've only heard like the background k mikey m is his handle and so there's this guy yeah yeah yeah tell the story who's this guy what did he do with him what the heck are you doing okay so again quickest path to learning that's i think that's really important for like entrepreneurs executives in general mike merrell like 13 years ago 2008 something like that he became the first publicly traded person so he sold shares in himself he's there's an interface the the website is a little buggy sometimes but there's an interface he sold shares he gets the money but then what he does is he gets to choose to put votes up and then the people who bought shares vote their shares and he doesn't do little stuff like he does little stuff like what color glasses should i get so a lot of the things we probably don't want to make decisions on ourselves which is really interesting hack but he also what he'll do is he goes and he'll put should i move in with my girlfriend he puts that up for a vote the debate is fascinating because some of them are his friends and his family and then there's just randos in connecticut being like i've known mike for like a long time through the project i don't think this makes sense he said this like three years ago blah blah blah blah it's fascinating so i knew about this uh girlfriend what's the url again say spell it out k mikey m k m i k e y m.com um so i i got a little money and i was like i've i don't know what it's like to like do a takeover of a company right and this is when elon musk was like doing his stuff with twitter and so long story shirt i was like oh this could be fascinating one because there's like i don't know how people react when this stuff happens and so he put an auction up for um additional shares and this is what he does every so often when he needs some cash he'll actually put an auction up and people can buy presumably if it's a dutch auction under the share price right and i did like by the way do you like do you get anything as a shareholder you there's no dividends there's no like uh nothing like that you can sell your shares people buy like shares so like i put my shares up and get money like actually get cash right dude sean go to the website so he he just says the things so look let me give you an example it's called the finger holders contract gig i guess finger hole is the name of the company but the short the tl dr is should i take a short term gig contract coordinating the development of a community around the launch of an nft project called finga hole finger holders yeah and then it goes the whole background of like why i'm interested in this why do i want to do this what are the contract details how much they're going to pay me what's the proposal and then there's 300 i think there's like a crazy amount of comments that says like pros working on a project sounds fun cons nfts are divided the uh divisive and it may alienate some of your shareholders and there's like incredibly thoughtful discussion on why he totally what so listen to this so i sneakily i start buying shares and i start researching people who haven't been active because you can see the last time they like logged in and stuff because i want to start contacting them he launches this auction of about 2 000 shares and i know that ev most votes there's only about 5 000 shares that are voting so i was like cool if i get 2000 shares which is like 10 11 of the entire thing and then i did a sneaky way of doing the auction which we can get into if it's interesting but anyways so i get the shares and then i go speak at his shareholder meeting he has a show how much did you pay for the 2000 shares uh i was like 13 grand and so his market cap is only like uh yeah it's not it's it's that's 130 000 where everyone gets in yeah so right now he's got i think 16 000 shares or something that have been sold and the share price i haven't checked today but there's a share price it goes up and down based on like purchases and stuff but he's worth it it's in the six figure range i think ballpark i think so yeah yeah so if you owned all the shares theoretically that's the value but then the other thing is the community makes it interesting so i go speak at the shareholder conference and i go hey and it's on youtube and i say listen i'm doing a hustle takeover of mike here's why like i think the project's undervalued you guys voted to like make him not go on social media like that doesn't make sense like in order to get more people he has to like do this blah blah i think and then all the questions are like well what about like is this good for mike because there's a lot of his friends like his actual in-person friends and i was like listen i think what's good for what's good for the share price is good for mike and vice versa and i talk about it it's like a half hour interview i did and and then everyone and then there's all these people especially the people who don't know him who are like i think patrick i think the takeover is good for the project i think it's this you only need to go through lulls 500 to a thousand more shares roughly to control the vote you thought uh no no i already i already had i got 1930 out of the auction right right but you said each vote has about five thousand and you just need that yeah you just need 51. it's never it's never one-sided it's never one-sided so like if it's can swing 2500 vote and and what's funny is i'm texting him and i'm like hey man just so you know here are my intentions like it's like a little it's a little takeover right that that's cool that's like some insider trading though no uh no i didn't i don't do anything just like when he left the shares elon goes and talks to perrag and he's like hey look i'm doing this and here's what i want to do with twitter and also there's kind of nothing you could do about it but i'm going to inform you because that just seems like you know the standard the writing process here yeah what does uh what is what obligation does this guy have to follow what you say like we know what if he just says ah [ __ ] off i'm done with this project in i mean he could shut the project down i don't know like so first before i started doing this i started tweeting to him about what happens if there was a hostile takeover elon musk seems interesting right because i wanted to see like is this like it's is this gonna be a good investment probably not but like i'm learning i can't tell you how much i'm learning right because all of a sudden it's like oh interesting shareholder mate they responded to this and these aren't like the investors that i want to be working with in the rest of my life but it's really fascinating um he has never for to my knowledge in 13 years gone against what a vote has said but he could it's all in good faith he could i mean there's no yeah there's no like oh my god i can sue him or anything also he he gets to choose what he puts up for vote so if he's like yeah you know i just want to move on to my girlfriend i don't have to put it up for a vote but there has been some talk of you get to burn some of your shares in order to put a vote up for a vote which is fascinating it's he's been covered by wired atlantic all kinds of stuff it's it was in a lull and i'm injecting some excitement into it again and yeah i'm looking at the price chart so it looks like it's it started 2008 it opened at a dollar 99 cents it looks like and it basically was like between one and three dollars then it kind of peaked in 2013 maybe he got some press or something like that it was 13 yeah 1350 something like that and then for the last six years it's basically been flat at roughly four or five bucks for a takeover and and now it's 685 right now and so um it was about five when i started the takeover this is far more interesting to be as small as as it is right i mean it's cool to be as unknown of a project it feels it feels unknown to be as unknown of a project as it is it's been around this 2008 it's pretty under covered right well so in the beginning he got a lot he was like on the today show he was on all kinds of stuff and then he did because what was interesting is he's had some epics with it like a project was i think it was called the girlfriend project and it was literally about his relationship his his girlfriend buys shares his ex-girlfriend is still a shareholder i'm pretty sure his current i don't know if it's his wife or not is like a shirt like and that was the end of the shareholders meeting was his ex-girlfriend his current girlfriend or wife having a conversation it was the most interesting like half hour i've ever seen in my life because they were just and they're friendly i think there might be friends but just them talking about mike and it's kind of beautiful because you have all these people who like either just from a money perspective or just a fascination perspective in my case or from a love perspective like supporting this guy and like trying to make the right decisions for him so i think it's brilliant like as soon as i announced this on twitter we got some inbound from like some like i don't think they're documentarians or something like that like i don't know if it'll come with anything but it's like it's a fascinating story that i think deserves more more more give so i'm glad you asked about it because you guys have a pretty medium audience so it's great there's there's even like a what happens when i die like unlike a company i will die so what happens to my shares after i die there's like this is pretty crazy i mean it kind of makes no sense in that like yeah you know there's yeah it's completely nonsensical yeah but bro you bought a 150 000 image of a monkey so like this is you know like did you buy a name punk you got a oh you're a punk guy this is from ape fest so this is my nice fun little yeah it was a 50 it was a coin flip to uh use the milk portfolio either we buy up an ape or a punk and they were the same price on that day and we knew that the the purchase was gonna have to happen the board was about to buy the punks and so it was like what do we which asset should we buy knowing this news is about to break or it has just broken or something and we flipped punk and then apes went through the roof and punched something down everything's down now too it's interesting very interesting dude check this out so if you go to uh mike's blog so there's news.kmikeem.com where he like it's ran like a shareholder company i mean like like the investor relations page of a publicly traded company and he has the list of all of his principles and on health it says like as of october 23 2019 i'm in favor of experimenting with psychedelics and you click psychedelics and there's a like notes from a board meeting about like who voted and why they voted and what is the reason and what the reasoning is and how they are or are not going to start doing psychedelics then in 2016 i will not take uh a psyllium pills i don't know what that is um and it's like talks about why he wanted to take them and everyone's voting and he has like a update on that and then like entertainment um shareholders will have direct control over my television television watching i will and then 2019 i will watch spiderman um i will not subscribe to spotify uh yeah some of these are like stupid like the glasses one it says that 34 users voted with 1800 shares so 34 people participated in that vote for the glasses i guess that was not a very uh not a very big one let's see this and if i didn't put i haven't i'm pretty 44 people like who he's voting for like president up like he's done stuff like that as well which gets really fascinating yeah but that's just as meaningless as the classes interesting uh i believe he's in oregon so i'm not sure i mean he's in a state that is going to vote one way or the other anyways wow yeah 2020 i will endorse bernie sanders for president okay uh amazing listen man this was this was fun uh i'm glad you came on and uh yeah good times thank you brought some good stuff sam what do you think dude can you send me send me the uh the research thing that was the most fascinating thing that was really interesting and i'll send you some redacted i'll send you the structure and you can don't redact it no no one will i won't share it with any of these losers it'll just be for me don't get back let me think about it i met again i have a boss i'm on a board i gotta be careful now so yeah well are you guys i'll send you something and paddle isn't public now but it will be right uh i mean we're we're not going next year in a number of years probably before anything like that right but i'm great you know there's no laws [Laughter] i'll hook you up i'll hook you up with something don't worry don't worry this was awesome i i typically hate having not hate i say no to everyone shawn brought you in yeah we kind of hate having guests but then we have many ways and we're not we're not fully sure why we do it but we do it in the moment it seems like a good idea halfway through the episode it's like yeah i kind of wish i was just bullshitting with sam uh instead of doing this conversation but i'm always happy when we do it because i don't have to prepare but um one out of every four is awesome and i'll just hope that everybody thinks they're that one out of four you actually were that one out of four so good for you what makes a good guest versus not a good guess just for the audience to hear if they come in they listen to the pod if they already know the vibe if they know the the what's cool that that tends to work really well i think what do you think sam i agree and most people ha most people aren't like sean and i and that they don't do this for a living and so they need to come prepared with the things and even us we come some the re we do research sometimes we do sometimes we don't but there's at least bullet points so it's like all right next and you did a good job of saying next a lot of people um if you i don't know if you paid attention but sean very purposely in the beginning he's like i don't really care about the company in your background let's just move on to the other stuff and uh we actually we we tend to do that a lot and so that was cool um and so that's also the least interesting except for michael saylor that episode was like that episode was money because he was just so weird like it was just like what's gonna happen guys like what's gonna happen the next minute that was that was an interesting one did you hear when he out alfied me i was like yeah i like fast cars he goes hey i don't like fast cars but i have a really fast jet that's well no the quote the quote i tell everyone from that episode is yeah i don't really like things that you can't in normal use go at their max speed like and that's what he was referring to with cars like it was like boats and jets i'm allowed to to go at max speed you know cars not really so i just i thought who even has that thought about like am i utilizing this machine to its fullest velocity into bitcoin that's that's who has that thought which is great that those people exist dude sean i did you see on my instagram or twitter or something i did i uh this weekend i was in the hamptons uh that's not a humble brag it was my in-laws house so i had nothing to do with it but and that's a midwest thing he just did a midwest thing just so you know they're very very blessed oh i have a yeah i have an equinox member but like they're gonna do my laundry so it's like worth it was on sale it was my in-laws house and i went out there and i drove we went to the beach for a bonfire in the fourth and we drove by this area that was just pat it was like a it's like a small one-lane road and it was packed full of cars but they were fancy cars and in front of me was a bugatti and it was a special bugatti and i looked it up there's like a 5 million bugatti and i was like what the [ __ ] is going on here and so i get to the parking lot to park my car and it was full of black limousines but not limousines like the escalades full of them and then in the corner one of the limos had their trunk open and literally i'm not exaggerating i have a video of it a hundred limousine drivers were just hanging out drinking coke eating chips and i was like what the [ __ ] is going on here and they go it's michael rubin's party uh michael rubin has a famous white party and i made a joke i was like he only lets whites in which they didn't like the drivers no yeah yeah i was like you know like oh white's holy really that's weird maybe i should go um i don't know it was a bad joke and anyway i go reuben and they go yeah it's reuben he um he's having this party he's famous he goes i drove this one guy was like yeah we drove drake and it's like i was like yeah jay-z's there and i was like wait really and i looked it up on instagram and it was this crazy party and i was like uh well tell me everything he goes you know i drove this guy and he's broke one guy goes uh i drove tyreese you remember tyreese from fast and furious yeah yeah yeah he's like i drove that guy and and the driver goes i'm richer than he is that guy's broker than a joke i got more money than that guy and i was like wait what really and he like auditioned he he kept telling me all this said he goes the guys who are really rich they typically drive themselves because they got that bugatti and they want to show it off um but it was really fascinating i was just hanging with these we hung with them for like half an hour just asking them all rumors and gossip and they knew it all dude that's amazing i after you you sent that you sent me that video and then i went on instagram and i saw like six nba players were posting stories from the party so i was like james harden's at the party and then whoever you know like these other guys were you know joel embiids at the party and it's the all-white party wherever it is uh everybody's uh like it was just rappers and athletes it seemed like which is which is great exactly it was it was so cool and like he's got like this private beach area and then we were like 100 yards down the beach and right next to the parking lot and it was just packed and we there's bugattis there's all these crazy cars it was pretty it was i just imagined you in the in the party with like you know that meme where it's the guy at the party yelling into the girl's ear and you're just like it's a newsletter we my first million i said million yeah no no with an m do you use spotify we're up there you got video access on there no we mostly talk about 12 year old

there's this thing called talent and it's real most don't have it and a very few do and if you do yeah you can make it look easy but most just won't never pull it off regardless of how hard they work once you stack talent that becomes the the sort of like the juggernaut right it's like when lebron was trying to play against the warriors the warriors had staff clay and kevin durant like draymond they had like this full five-man team of talent and on the other side even if you're the most talented guy even if you're lebron you're not gonna be able to compete with that squad and so to me the most important thing in businesses is to quickly aggregate like a sticky amount of like top-tier talent because then they'll all make each other better too

compostable straws make me question if i really care about the planet these paper straws that just basically melt in your drink they are compostable straws that don't suck there's something made out of i don't know cassava whatever that is or like bamboo they work they feel like plastic but they're not plastic this is an obviously huge idea to say that oh over time big companies are going to feel pressure to be more environmentally conscious and their current providers are not going to specialize in this it's a pretty capital intensive business but i do think it's actually could be potentially quite large

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
i was reading an article in the new york times and it was about um these malibu homes and how like the these crazy rich guys are coming in and buying these homes and grant cardone was one of the features and they didn't feature him as grant cardone they're like another local buyer is motivational speaker and real estate entrepreneur grant cardone and you know he was just like a guy they were interviewing not like this internet and he recently bought a house in malibu i think it was for 60 million dollars and he was like i'm gonna spend another i forget tens of millions of dollars renovating it and that's one of those things that when you see people what they spend on their personal real estate you know i mean it's hard to fake that and i'm just thinking who would have thought that those things that he's selling would make that much well [Music] i have a question when was the last time that you have flown i just flew last week oh no sorry not last week last month hawaii where hawaii how about before that uh yeah i don't know when we went to austin miami something like that so like once a year at this point or once every six months yeah yeah i'm not flying a ton right now um when you flew to hawaii did you fly first class or coach yeah first so i uh i went to idaho this weekend with ben podcast ben and i spoke at an event which we have to talk about convertkit's new thing and i don't like to travel you don't like to travel uh and this was work related so like they wanted me to speak at a conference and whenever they want me to speak at a conference i say yeah that's cool i'll come and speak but you have to pay for a first class flight for me and sarah my wife i'm like that's a fair trade you don't don't pay me to come because i like you but like i do want you to pay for my flight and it has to be first class because i don't like flying coach well my uh flights got screwed up for some reason both ways and i had to fly like middle c like back row because like basically the flight got canceled and they like fit me on these like last ones and i was flying on this and i started thinking do you know that stereotype a story of this like rich billionaire and they say like oh yeah you know even though he was a billionaire he still flew coach and like nothing changed like i think the idea guys nothing changed and it's like that is oh amazon all their desks were old doors i tried to dude i did that i did that to be cute at our office it cost more to do that a door isn't a door expensive yeah i bought like the shittiest door and it was like eighty dollars and then we bought cinder blocks and it was like a pain in the ass i'm like dude this thing's in ikea for 25 bucks this is way better also flat that's a stupid story it's like maybe like they had a door while they like folded t-shirts on that door like for a day while they waited for the real supplies to come uh this whole like flying coach as a rich person thing and i'm not talking about like rich like uh millions or tens of millions i'm talking like when you hear billionaires or hundreds of millions of dollars people say this i think that is total nonsense and i tweeted that i'm like this is that is just a lie any rich person that i'm talking like real rich who says they do that they're lying and i want to see proof if that's true and i had a bunch of really really rich people holler at me and tell me they do it and so do you know who palmer lucky is so palmer lucky started uh he created oculus which he sold for he is in the ballpark of billions of dollars and he has a new company worth tens of billions so if he's not a billion he's like he's like right there basically he tweeted back he's definitely a billionaire that guy's definitely a billionaire dude he tweeted back to me and he said i only fly coach and then i had a other i had yeah and i think that's crazy i had other some other people dm me they go and who i know the companies public and they're like i'm worth hundreds of millions and i i'll i fly first class no matter what internationally but like i have no problem taking southwest if it's like a short flight and i understand that argument if it's like an hour but if you're going from new york to la or some anything above three hours i don't believe it i think they're lying i just think they're full of it i asked darmesh on hubspot i'm like do you do this he goes no that's a ridiculous thing of course i don't do that and he like had this if you're like us at the my first million podcast where we are cultivating that trillionaire mindset that multi-trillionaire mindset hashtag grindset you have to even before you you have multi-trillions you better be flying private you better find private when you can't afford coach because if you can't afford your future can you afford your present and that's how i feel i just thought it was the most ridiculous thing when i was sitting in this seat uh i was just like my back was sore and it was just terribly uncomfortable and it took forever just the vibe of the peasants that you're sitting next to it's awful it sucked and i know i have a problem doing i mean i i will do it but i'm just saying if i could like if i'm worth hundreds of millions of dollars what's the difference between fifteen hundred dollars and five hundred dollar ticket and anyone who lies and says otherwise i think they're an idiot and they're lying yeah so some people were like oh bill gates i read that thread because it's pretty interesting they gave you a ton of examples they like slams you with examples of it happening and i think the main they just told these fake stories well yeah so so that's the thing i think the you know the main thing that they were saying was like ex person used to do this which is either simply just their pr team being like hey bill we need you to do a coach like uh flight here and like you know whatever we'll we'll keep your your private jet and epstein's jet like off the radar you know just so we can kind of have this measure of austerity here and so that you know i i'm pretty sure it and because it works by the way like the fact that so many people posted articles of billionaire flies coach it's like dude that's not news by the way but the fact that it's newsworthy is like more proof that this is likely a pr stunt because i've done it too i've been like oh you know bill you know warren buffett you know still drives an old beat up you know 83 you know camry and like um you know oh sam banker freed he's the newest young billionaire and did you know that he only eats bananas and sleeps on a bean bag and you know like these stories work they're like worth telling which makes me think this is like a pr scheme but the other interpretation was they did it so that they could like tell the company hey from the top down we're all being frugal we're not wasteful so like you know mr you know senior director of business development is not like you know flanked first you know to every country i understand that but it's like dude you and your three kids are taking your vacation to france and you're going to fly coach on spirit airlines yeah that ain't that that ain't gonna happen like that's right you're you're lying you're lying it's an absolute lie she'll be speaking receipts if you're really doing this like show me your spirit airlines frequent flyer miles history if you expect me to believe this like dude i've sat in spirit air and i've had the pilot come out mid-flight and rearrange the seating because someone was too fat and had to like hey we need to do a two-for-one trade you need to get to the left side of the plane and then two you all need to move to the right we need better balance like that's absolutely unless you've done that you don't have that trillionaire energy yeah dude i've done that on pontoon boats like where you have like or yeah people in the back you're like hey you guys gotta switch seats uh there's boats going a little sideways but i've never done that on the plane i didn't even think it was real i thought the pilot was joking and it wasn't a joke they literally were like we need to rebalance jesus christ let me tell you about one more interesting thing another rich guy thing so you know who grant cardone is of course i know grant matt graham so so i'm not gonna like even comment on if i like him or not but i will like okay that's cool i don't entirely dislike him i don't dislike him i don't really i don't like everything he does and i like a lot of what he does um and but i kind of paid him as this guy that was kind of like in the internet marketing world just selling like talking like cheat books and cheap courses and if you're so rich why are you selling a course right yeah yeah yeah yeah a question i've asked myself many times also yes speak it up and it's my course available july 11th power writing sign up today go to maven.com and sign up baby market's down daddy needs a new course i was thinking about that i'm like all right if if this is this course guy and he has this like uh he's wearing all his nice suits like is that legit is that real and i was reading an article in the new york times and it was about um these malibu homes and how like the these crazy rich guys are coming in and buying these homes and grant cardone was one of the features and they didn't feature him as grant cardone they're like another local buyer is motivational speaker and real estate entrepreneur grant cardone and you know he was just like a guy they were interviewing not like this internet and he recently bought a house in malibu i think it was for 60 million dollars and he was like i'm going to spend another i forget tens of millions of dollars renovating it and that's one of those things that when you see people what they spend on their personal real estate you know i mean it's hard to fake that and i'm just thinking who would have thought that those things that he's selling would make that much wealth is that's pretty that's pretty crazy isn't it you know what's even crazier so the one time i talked to grant cardone for an extended period of time like we had like i don't know a 40 minute conversation 20 minutes of it was on why buying a house is so stupid and why he rents everything and he was going off like people were like oh your penthouse is rented that you're in he's like yeah bro your house is not an asset why would i buy a house and he was like he's like i buy real estate that pays me brother and he's like you know um yeah i rent this penthouse i always rent i rent everything i want to be able to move i want to live in the place i like and i take my money and i put it to work you see that over there that's my money working and you know because he's like he's like a big-time showman right and so uh what is it like dollar bills like digging holes i don't like what's he pointing at he's like he's like hold on brother i can't hear you i got something in my ear it's a voice tell it's asking me one question who's got my money and that's what i gotta ask every every morning i wake up and i look to the heavens and i say who's got my money and then i go and i get that money from them and i was like well this is incredible [Laughter] wait where'd you where did you hang out with him for 45 minutes so he used to use blab the same product that where i met martin shkreli i've it attracted a whole bunch of grifters and grant cardone was there and i was like all right who's that i would go into all the rooms that had a big following i was like okay this guy's driving a bunch of a growth and engagement you're a power user who are you and sure enough like you know it was it was often you know people who are you know somewhat controversial that's who people like to watch live stream and so grant would go on there and he would do his 10x meetups and he would just see people come in they'd be like uh i got to keep doing my impressions it was so if you haven't gone into this world by the way you need to spend three hours and i need you to i love watching his videos he's got great videos watch his uh watch his community because you'll be like wow this is like the kool-aid drinker so they would come on they'd be like grant they put up their uncle g uncle g what's up man what's up brother and they'd be doing the 10x 10x all right uh thank you so much for all the content man i was i was broke and homeless i used to eat mcdonald's wrappers instead of the food and now um i just had i got a ruth chris uh subscription membership and i just want to say thank you and i had a question for you right so they would do this and then it would be one after another of uh grant grant 10x 10x brother um just want to thank you before i was thinking where the sky's the limit and now the sky is the floor am i right amen brother and so they were doing this stuff and i was like wow these people are like really like this these are the converted right so a lot of people really found value in this thing um because this wasn't like a recorded testimonial this is a live stream where random people are calling in and it'd be very hard to like fake this and they're wearing the hat they're holding up the books they're like they really liked his stuff and i've never heard of this guy he's like in the tech world you don't you don't know who this character is right like and you're if you're in real estate you know if you're in the motivational self self-help thing you know but he's not leaving like ty like tai lopez crossed all boundaries people like all knew who he was uh grant cardone's like not like that that's the first thing you should watch second thing is he does these deal breakdowns very interesting to watch so he's sitting at a at a table and it's like you know what's that guy ramsay dave ramsey who like you called in and you're like dave i make 80 000 a year and i got student debt like what should i do and he's like save your money and so people do that with grant they're like hey grant i got 200 000 i'm looking at a property the address is 3909 you know west boise street and in idaho whatever and then people and he'll go and he he basically googles it he's got a white board behind him and he basically he's like talking to the guy he's like all right so what are you putting down all right what terms are they giving you and he basically like workshops the deal with them he like kind of like uh sort of like a speed version of underwriting the deal live and i've actually learned a bunch from it like i'm sure somebody who's like you know a real estate master is probably like oh this is all just like this is the jim cramer of like real estate here where he's saying things that make it sound smart but he's actually not considering xyz but just from a like if you're a beginner in real estate which i am you will learn a bunch and you'll be entertained just in the style and he does things so i like that the last thing he's like uh it's like the price he's he's got like pro wrestling vibes yeah exactly and that's why i'm doing the impersonations because i'm like why i said i like him i like him because he's entertaining like i like him because i've learned some stuff and i've been very entertained through the rest like have you seen these videos on youtube where he just does sales calls for an hour i have i think i they're so good i think they're fake yeah it might be fake because he'll be like he's always pulling a rabbit out of a hat and you're like oh dude it's like a pickup artist it's like you watch their video you're like oh my god you know she was uh she was like literally just she was running she was getting into her cab but he said this one thing and she got out of the cab and started talking to him this guy's amazing and you're like wait a minute maybe he just like edited like three really good ones out of 500 failures into this video that's kind of what it feels like but he's doing an hour of continuous sales calls and so it might be scripted where the guy on the other line is like yeah i'll say yes just call me yeah we'll play we'll role play here it's like the tv show pawn stars you're telling me like holy [ __ ] and one day you had a guy come in with like a like a civil war gun a guy who had napoleon's hat and another guy that owns a picasso all in las vegas coming into a park that's crazy yeah it's like dude the undertaker was dead and then he came back to life and won the match it's like yeah yeah you're falling for a scripted drama right like so it might be that but nonetheless these sales calls are very entertaining to listen to and like they're it's obviously like very wolf of wall street style like macho sales but i like to see it because i've never seen anything like that like first of all i don't do phone sales that's not like it's not even like in my life secondly i don't know people who are as ridiculous as grant cardone and are willing to say things as ridiculous as grant cardone and third like this is not a style of communication or sales ship i've i think you can read or study or intuit and so it's just nice to like see it so anyways i've gone down these rabbit holes of grant cardone and i've come out the other side being like yeah he is definitely self-promoting and he's making most of his money it seems like on the like the brand and not the like meat and bones of his business but um you know respect he hustles really hard he's a good self-promoter and he is smart and like you know he does well so you know i i don't think that you're you're not learning from somebody who's a hack uh like he's somebody i don't think he's a hack i don't think he's a heck at all i think the criticism isn't that well i think maybe i just don't always agree in his values but i don't think he's lying right i think the criticism would not be this guy is dumb or lazy or anything like that the criticism would be um he's just selling you you know a bag of dreams basically and like you know he makes his money on people who want to be him and want to be like him and they're not really going to be like him and he's sort of like you know promoting that dream i would say that that's probably true but i think that's true of a lot of things in life like that's true of nike also like would i go buy nike sneakers you know because michael jordan wore them do i really think michael jordan's a scumbag for you know i'm not he's not tricking me into thinking i can i could be like mike but yeah that is actually what the commercial literally says dude i'm i'm working on this new thing and i want to tell you two things about it i'm working on this new business and i'm like i'm still like mvping it out and making sure it's legit and i i i've got six figures in revenue now six figures of cash in the bank um and it was all from phones i from calling calling constantly no website a type form and calling them and then setting a stripe link so what's if what are you doing that's effective on the call give me the give me the strategy of the call uh without sharing so i don't want to show i'm not and i'm not really selling so basically the thing that i'm making like a community for a particular salesman claim i'm not here to sell you anything well because because here's here's the thing no offense but of sales so the the place where the business is at right now which is like i only want like let's say 50 people to join right now i don't want a lot of people to join because i want to make sure that it's like legit and good and also because it's an exclusive like private paid community i need to make sure that like each person actually can provide value for one another so i can't just let anyone in i can only let in the type of person who makes like the true person feel yeah feel more valuable right they came in so in a way i'm like no like i'm i really like i don't know if i have space for you i don't know if we can make this work um but we may be and that's why i'm here to interview to see if this will be a good fit for you and uh that's basically what i'm doing it's like i also you're using the [ __ ] line but this time it's not actually [ __ ] it's real this time i i i yeah i guess that's true but like i don't know how to explain it it is true like we we only have a certain i can only make it truly work for a few amount of people otherwise it sucks and so remember how we interviewed the chief folks she said they had 60 000 people apply it but they only have like 10 or 15 000 members so i kind of believe it um uh but anyway i'm working on it and i went to this i'm starting it with uh my friend joe and we did something interesting the other day and when i had started companies in the past i did i partnered with the wrong people not every time but sometimes and and the mistake that i'm trying to not make this time is basically making sure i partner with the right folks you're saying partner like business partner not like an external partnership you're talking about like your co-founder type of thing business partner like someone who you give a substantial amount of equity to um which is very similar to a marriage and i actually did this in my marriage but i've never done this in a business partner uh but we basically like said like hey like separately write down three things write down what like what does success look like to you in 10 years what are you willing to give up in order to achieve that and um like just your day-to-day like what what do you value and how do you want to get there and so we each wrote that down and we came together and we're like all right here's all the things that are important to me let's look at what's important to you oh wow they actually align really nicely this thing doesn't align is that a game breaker for you and then we and then there was another thing that we went through scenarios we're like let's say you're lance armstrong it's 1999 you know that everyone's cheating and you have to cheat if you want to win what are you gonna do right like how how do you want to play like what do you want to play and there's no right or wrong answer but it's just like let's just see how our values align in different scenarios and so anyway we've been doing this thing where we're like trying to figure out why won't this partnership work let's get all that out of the way at first and it has been awesome more people should do this have you ever done this uh i have actually done that which is so funny you say this we did something so similar we sort of stumbled upon it organically at our first business because the first business i ever created was that sushi business and uh the idea was to create like a chipotle-like restaurant chain for sushi and so we're going about it we've been at this at this point we've been doing it for i don't know six to nine months something like that so we're not like it's not like it's not like day one we've already already committed we already have the equity splits and we're all best friends we've known each other for four years so like surely we know everything about each other right and a smarter business person kind of like a mentor type dude was like at this time we were really big on mentors and he was like oh um he was like you know um how aligned are you guys he's like if i so it was the guy we wanted to partner with the chef he was like he flew each of us out one by one to la and hung out with us and he told us he was like yeah i feel like all of you guys say the same words but they mean different things and i was like what do you mean he goes like you all be like you know oh man this what really matters is that we do this like uh the right way he's like but i think you all have a different definition of the right way or like we yeah we all want this to be a success i i think if i asked you what do you mean by success like put a number put a time frame around it like i bet you it's all different and so we came home he totally gave us that feedback and we did it we did the same exercise we go i created a list of questions and we all went sat in our corner of the room silently and we wrote our answers and then we came and we compared and jesus they were so different me and one guy were pretty lined and the third guy and we all thought we were all totally alive the third guy his was like way different and the biggest differences were like time scale like how long do you how long do you expect to work on this before we see any like any like tangible success what are your expectations on that and then what would be a win for you and it was like one guy was like oh man like if i could be making six figures and like you know and you know i'll do this forever and then i was like oh dude i want to like i want to make 10 million dollars in you know three years and the other guy was like somewhere in the middle and then we were like oh wow like we all have like you would be happy with one path and i would be completely unhappy if that same thing we both are and if we didn't talk about it our definition of success would have been very different and the same thing with values of like what for one for two of us it was super important like look i don't know if this business is going to work or not but i want to do it our way like the thing that makes this fun for me like there's a lot of shitty components to doing this business the part that makes me like want to wake up and do it every day is that i feel like we're putting our own stamp on this and for the other guy he's like yeah that's cool but like i don't really care about that and we're like oh shoot it's important to know how important it is because so we're going to spend a bunch of energy doing it yeah well it was clarifying like we were sort of the partner the partners yeah well that's what i'm saying you got to do this early on because in a way a business partnership is actually more of a commitment commitment than a marriage because with the marriage you can just like end it and be over with a business screwing up your cap table and someone owning a portion of your i mean that could be it it's just a it's just kind of an irreversible decision and the only way that you reverse it is by spending a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot of money yeah like what we did what was lucky for us was that we were all 21 years old so we were all like a blank slate it's like dude i don't know this is just my first thought i'm not like married to this to this belief system you know like so it was very few things that we were like no i am certain and i'm stubborn on that point now in my life if i said something if i may if i answered ten questions eight out of the ten would be things i'm like no i stand by that like that's really that is what i've thought this through and that's what i believe back then it was like i don't know i hadn't really thought about it but if you had now you're asking me to articulate it so i'll just say these things so what happened in our thing was we kind of we would all hear each other's answers and then we would be like oh i like that that's right let's all agree to align on that and we were like yeah like sure that sounds better i don't know what the [ __ ] i was thinking it was that wasn't i'm not married to that and so it worked for us because it got us to like get to a right answer versus who's right you know what i mean yeah this exercise that i've been doing um with joe we should be wonderful publish this by the way because you know we i think we talked about this one time was like some new york times article that was like 17 questions you should ask your future spouse or something like that like before it was like it was like 27 questions to ask on the first date like as a single guy who just wanted to like meet girls i was like oh i'm just going to ask it was like 27 questions to like make someone fall in love with you or something like that and it was like for like relationships and i was like oh i'm asking every woman this like this is the first day question this is the first hour first day question and i remember doing it like three times and like those [ __ ] at them new york times they didn't know what the hell they're talking about none of these people like me okay yeah maybe i misremembered so we should but i do think it would be useful whatever you and joe just did because i did this like i don't know 10 12 years ago now uh i think you did it just like last month so you should definitely like compile these so that more people can can do this because it'll save it'll straight up save people years of pain in their life if they like can identify some of these things up front versus just rushing in to the co-founding yeah i mean i i i like it was like all right so here's what i want just in my personal life and i put like a net worth um i said i want i want to have a seat at the big boys table and i want people to think that i know what i'm talking about when it comes to business i want freedom i want to be able to live in different cities with my family i want to be president my children's lives i want to own a bunch of real estate i want to have fun and adventure uh and i want to work like really hard for three or four weeks or for uh six or seven months and then i want to chill for like three months uh and then it was like all right and ways i want to get there is i want to build this particular business i don't want a boss i don't want to have any meetings i want a few if any employees reporting to me um and then it was the ways in which i'm going to approach this particular business i want to be incredibly aggressive about it i want to treat it like a job so we're working 40 hours a week on it i want to have close to no standing meetings few employees and basically that's it yeah oh and a revenue target of 100 million dollars in five years i don't care if we actually hit that but i want that to be the target and then he like answered similarly on a lot of those it's like all right there's like some alignment here nice nice okay i like that and um yeah okay i think yeah i think you should i think you should publish some of those things also the lance armstrong things i think those are if nothing else like it doesn't it doesn't really matter but it's like at least knowing how the other person is wired and being like am i okay with this am i okay with the weird psychology of this person um i think it's not so much that do all of our answers match just like in a marriage it's not do we do we think the same way about everything it's like do we think the same way about the really important things um all right so what did you say would you would you if you're in the land situation what do you do i for sure cheat uh you basically have two options you either exit the sport or you cheat right like uh it's not even cheating at that point when everybody is doing it it's just the new normal right like there's not a it'd be one thing if it's like is if one person's cheating and they're winning and everybody else is clean would you would you cheat to try to win or would you stay clean it was like my belief is that all these olympic sports plus pretty much all professional sports are full of pd's and uh like you know it's just a it's just a naiveness test whether you believe that people are clean or not it's like in the same way it's like oh my god what percentage of nba players you think cheat on their wife it's like um like you know i don't know but yeah the answer is yes not a not a number and so like there might be one outlier and like cool you know credit to that person for for being the the you know the the outlier the ac green of this but but i think same thing with cheating so yeah that one's the easy one for me our software is the worst have you heard of hubspot see most crms are a cobble together mess but hubspot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous i think i love our new crm our software is the best hubspot grow better dude you wanna you've got some you wanna like quickly go through some of your topics or do you wanna uh talk about a company that i had listed that what do you wanna do uh let's do one of yours and then we'll be one of mine we'll finish up all right um have you heard of this company called n2 publishing no what do they do the reason i like this story is because they're succeeding wonderfully in a place that everyone thought that it was impossible to succeed so it's called n2 publishing they just rebranded it like last week to stroll and it's basically neighborhood magazines so magazines in like upscale neighborhoods and i'm almost positive they have like 800 of these or 650 of them but they're all print so it's like in your in like danville or in like the nice suburb i don't even know what the like the very specific neighborhood you're in what it would be i don't live there but blackhawk is like are you in black no no but blackrock's an example of a nice neighborhood in danville so what they do is they send you a magazine like once a month and it's just a magazine it's like a bulletin it's like it's like a newsletter i don't know what you want to call it but it's literally physically a magazine and the company has like 250 employees most all the employees are ad sales people and they hire someone and not exactly hire they friend it's a franchise so someone who lives in blackhawk pays like five or ten grand to become the official publisher of that area and that person has to gather a couple stories every single month but like the stories really are like they're not that good but it's just like people there's this old like uh idea with local publishing we're like dude people don't care about the writing they literally just want to see people they know and their friends and places they know in a newspaper and you can just list all their names and they would like that and that's kind of what they do and it's just like a magazine every month and it says here's what's going on like uh uh you know the local high school had their graduation and like eight people went to stanford um like this new restaurant opened and the guy is a greek immigrant and he's bringing some of his greek like taste to the area and like the fed is amazing and like that he just like goes from thing to thing so anyway it's a bootstrap business that's been around for like 18 years and they announced that they're doing like 150 million dollars a year in revenue and they've been profitable every single year and they don't have a website so like or they the hq has a website but each individual magazine there's no website it's 100 done through through paper and everything that they're doing is something that you would say like it it can't be done and it's kind of killing it it's kind of it's kind of a major business isn't this one so how did you get these numbers did they is it something public that like do they have all their numbers uh yeah so if you google stroll axios they just did a big um announcement on axios last week where the founder and the ceo kind of get he gave the revenue he said we do 130 million dollars in revenue we have 18 000 plus advertisers wow um we've been profitable every single year we expect rev revenue to double every four years that was an uh i believe an exact quote and we're just expanding to all these cities and we changed our name from n2 to stroll um it's kind of a really fascinating story i guess if it's doubling every five years that means it's growing what like uh 10 uh 10 or 15 a year so it's not like killing it but it's doing pretty good yeah 14 a year wow this is i mean you've done it again a sample special like how do you find these businesses this is amazing it's pretty wild no literally that's a real question how did you find this business uh i just read like there's this blog i read called flash and flames there's this blog i read called flash and flames if you google flash and flames it's just some guy named colin in england who just writes about cool b2b uh media companies and i just i read like loads of trade publications like trade publications that has like literally 500 website visits a day like just the most niche stuff i read it and if you google if you dude google it it's hard to even find their website the only way you find it is you type the ceo's name is dwayne hixson and so you have to type in like n2 because there's like 10 or 20 companies called n2 n2 and then dwayne hixson and that's how i found it and when i did a little research on him i think they're it's heavily rooted in christian stuff because their their mission is like to like to bring like to create jobs and value people and to bring glory to god and we're just so happened to be doing it through like creating this like newspaper thing uh and so that's our podcast or the stairs both so anyway like it's just kind of an interesting guy outside of our world uh really fascinating this is great i wonder how many more of these there are like i could imagine somebody doing for again doctor's office daily or doctor's office monthly or whatever doctor's office magazine and you just go to every doctor's office and you're like hey here's you know this awesome magazine for whatever for doctors who run their practices and you just if you eat the cost of the print then you're like you could basically go to advertisers and pharmaceutical companies and be like hey yeah we have 15 000 doctors offices that read and subscribe to our thing um and you know you should advertise but here's the thing like selling local ads so they're selling like the advertisers advertisers are like local dentists local realtors selling ads to those types of people is really hard because you're selling like 500 ads that's a hard business you just have to be like smile and dial you know you gotta do it constantly so like maybe they threw that whole godstick in there because they're like but you're doing it for the will of god therefore you have to be like that's the only way that you can motivate someone in order to like be on the phone all day selling uh a 500 ad to kathy in scottsdale arizona about coming to her open house that's a hard sell that's a grind that's a grind ben ben did it for two years he probably wouldn't want to do it for three or four more years it's a hard job but but what i'm saying is if you did this for other just say other like subgroups right so like doctor's office you wouldn't then need to advertise locally because you could advertise like to all the companies that sell to medical professionals or like if i created you know ecom you know shopify mag right and i sell i send this to every shopify owner's home and i'm just putting out like awesome case studies about e-commerce and just cool like stories of brands or whatever and then i just go tell klavio and postscript and like every e-commerce company every company that sells to e-com stores like every shopify app i'm like yeah you should advertise in this thing we have like you know pretty like pretty like hyper targeted distribution basically the question is is this better than a newsletter like you know you you know both spaces we know that andrew's doing this local news thing but for not neighborhoods but it's for like local cities and he's doing it through newsletter right his company overstory uh what's better this magazine idea or newsletters in your opinion so i actually think that's the wrong question the the because the what's what's quite interesting is that they're selling a franchise which is very weird for a media company that is actually the more interesting thing um do i think that this i think this is an awesome business do i think it's better than a newsletter no i would probably do that the newsletter but i would consider doing it this way where you're like you're like hey like we have 10 000 people already pre-signed up to for uh this small neighborhood in arizona if you want to you want to buy this list from us as a publisher it's a 10 000 buy-in and we'll monetize it for you and you get 15 of all the revenue that we sell but you got to make sure that you put it out all the time um that is that's kind of an intriguing that's an intriguing business model the do i think that it's better because it's in print i definitely think it's potentially more interesting i think the ad rates could potentially be higher because i think that like it is actually quite cool to hold and see something i think it's a very fascinating business model um i think you could also do this with a lot of different things what is the did they say anything about the cost of actually the print in the delivery like you have to print in mail magazines right which is uh gonna cost you something so that's that's like the biggest difference from like a newsletter you get the tracked clicks and you get no you have no hard costs for the for the print and for the shipping and the and the printing of the magazine do you know at all what that costs no i don't so they didn't reveal too much but they basically said that their national team has editorial oversight on what's published to ensure editorial editorial standards are non-partisan and community focused news they keep a cut of all ad revenue they have local operators so the people who run the local papers the local magazine used stroll's national printing copy editing and operational resources and the company distributes the magazine for free in readers mail right it's pretty it's it's pretty fascinating it's an interesting business you know what else is kind of interesting did you hear what convertkit so convertkit is like a mailchimp competitor i went to the conference this weekend it's a email platform i think you use them right yeah i use them do you see the thing they loki announced something that's kind of amazing so and the reason this is actually quite fascinating they launched this thing where they now hired an ad sales team and they're going to go out and sell ads and they're going to give you sean the user uh 85 of the revenue that they go and sell yeah this is smart i was always wondering why the like email platforms don't do this because once you start your newsletter you're like alright cool you get people being like hey can i sponsor it you're like yeah and then you de facto become ad sales and guess what you're like not great at it because you're not doing it fully it sucks and you would happily pay somebody a 15 commission for filling your ad spots and doing it well and i was always thinking like you know a sort of a mailchimp a beehive convertkit like why aren't they just making this their business model like in addition to their sas revenue of like paying for the email stuff like couldn't they you know convert it's at pretty significant scale like i wonder how big this is going to be for them dude listen to this the hustle there was a period of time where trung was on fire and he was our only writer he basically we had like people that would kind of fill in when he was sick but basically he wrote the email by himself every day for like eight months and we were doing over a million dollars a month in revenue right and there was one trunk and there was like 20 ad sales people that's ridiculous that is crazy it was pretty crazy and then we had like atoms so we had like four uh like growth marketers so like but it that business could have been trung and like four growth marketers and it could have been making over a million dollars a month and but it had we had like eight or ten or fifty i don't remember exactly ad sales people and then each like for ad sales person needs an operations person and then like uh uh editors to edit the ad it was like like morning brew i think has 250 people i don't know for a fact i would bet you that morning brew has 30 editorial people and 220 ad sales or ad sales related people well there's some management overhead but like so with your ad sales yeah managing the the the sellers when you when you had your ad team you you probably had like some commission structure or whatever right like um hey yeah four percent yeah so so what how did you accommodate them and basically what so what was your comp model and then what is what was like the overhead so the fact that you employed them versus them just being let's say like with convertkit for example if i write a newsletter i'm not paying for the overhead i'm only paying for the placement i pay this 15 placement fee once they once they get me an ad that's their commission well did you spend more or less than that in overall ad sales for the hustle do you think so we basically when we kind of were getting going we had two salaries like the entry-level people so the people who were like um two or three years of experience and then we had the higher people which for us was like five or six years experience so still not a lot of experience but i was only 24 when i started it so it was basically like a 22 year old and like a 27 year old like those are like do you get my jokes or do you not get my jokes yeah yeah yeah yeah and uh the the earlier ones uh the younger guys it was like around it ranged from like 50 to 70 000 a year in base salary and then the upper guys got like a hundred to like 120 000 a year in base salary in the upper guys there it was expected that they would sell i forget exactly but between one to 1.5 million dollars a year in ad revenue and they would get four either four or four and a half percent of that uh the younger guys their expectations was that they were going to sell between 500 and like 900 we had some sellers like this woman katie who would sell i believe the year we sold she was going into the year with like 2.5 million booked 2.5 million and and so but um so basically but then they had to get 75 of their quota so if their quota was one million dollars if they hit only 600 000 they only got their base salary if they hit 75 of their quota that's when the four percent started kicking in and then if they got 101 then the kickers would go up and they would start making a lot of money so the highest paid person at our company oftentimes was a ad seller and do you remember like did you just look at like uh what is our percent of revenue that we're paying out in commissions like did you have like because let's just say the easy apples to apples math is let's say convertkit launches this thing it's 15 and that's your that's your cost of ad sales basically um if if they placed all your ads do you remember what your you can over simplify it yeah you could oversimplify it by saying uh 4.4 of total ad revenue and then just assume a hundred thousand dollars ahead plus so let's say that you've got 10 sellers doing 10 million so that's uh a hundred thousand per salary for ten people that's one million dollars and then the commissions would be four percent of 10 million so 400 000 so 1.4 million people 1.4 million dollars for 10 ad sales people for 10 million in revenue um but then of course there was like some account executives who would help with that and then like uh operations people but yeah that's basically it bro you just did a shitload of public math and um i forgive you because you're my friend um you know we don't do public math but that's easy so for you to just do that listen it's just not who we are it's not what we do did you follow i i tried to follow but it's like you're speaking another language you you did it 10 million in it's 10 million in revenue right which is about the same as theirs right so you for all that headache of employing all those people you saved like one percent let's say of like the commission rate now maybe you would feel higher or maybe maybe you'd do a better job than like the centralized service would probably i would guess but um but here's why it's also a better model one time we had like goldman sachs or something as an advertiser and we had a story on [ __ ] jerry and how [ __ ] jerry [ __ ] jerry's like this meme instagram account that says like funny stuff they like launched like [ __ ] jerry news or something like that and i was like oh well let's for this email by the way every single sentence let's use the word [ __ ] it and then like another time we talked about donald trump and we're like this entire email let's write it in the voice of donald trump so like if you read it to yourself it sounds like donald trump and goldman sachs got really mad at us and they're like you said [ __ ] like literally 84 times in this email like we're not sponsoring you anymore and i was like well good [ __ ] off like i don't care about you like you know screw you [ __ ] you but katie sold the ad and her commission was gonna get lost so i was like okay i don't want to hurt you so i'm willing to like not say certain stuff just because i don't want you to experience the pain but i don't give a [ __ ] about that brand if they want to like you know muzzle us screw them right so now with this new with this new uh setup it actually could be a lot more advantageous for the creator yeah katie's amazing by the way we uh we work with her too she's really good um so so what are the uh do we want to do another one are we gonna wrap it we can do one more maybe uh let's do okay let me just do a you want an idea or a life hack a life hack all right so so ben business partner ben not podcast ben um you know ben i might just refer to you as god's been and the the other band i'm going to have to say is is not god's men so not god's ban was was entitled he's you got to come up with yahweh and jesus so he's visiting and i was like um and so you know it's always interesting right like in one way you know he he came you know basically stays in my house we we hang out for the week we get a bunch of stuff done so he gets to see a bunch of stuff in my world about how i live life and i'm sure that's you know somewhat interesting to him where he sees some things he's like oh wow thank god i don't do them that way and other things you're probably like oh that's cool like maybe i should be more like that and the but the same thing happened for me because ben um on the last day i see ben and he's like i'm like oh yeah you know you're just packing up what are you doing oh what are you writing down because he's like hunched over his table he's right he's like got a pen out he's writing something by hand which is not like you know we do everything on our computer so i was like what are you right now and i noticed he's not holding a pen he's holding a marker and he he's drawing and i was like then what are you doing man what are you drawing and he's he's drawing like a birthday card basically on a giant piece of paper and he's got six of them and he's drawn all these cards and i'm like what is this it's like my daughter's birthday what are you doing he's like no it's my dad's birthday and he's like ah it's a family tradition we have he goes every time it's someone on our family's birthday we all get out of get out like paper and markers and we draw them like birthday cards and it'll be like you know inside jokes or like oh dad you're the man for this reason you know i we always say that you got the best whatever yo just you got the best calves and so he draws a picture of him with like huge calves or whatever right you love this you love the suns here's a picture of chris paul holding a birthday cake for you singing you happy birthday like this player on the suns it's just like whatever it's just goofy and i saw it and i was like this is amazing and like everything he's told me about his dad by the way by the way his dad listens spot so shout out to it shout out to andy um his dad's amazing and like i'll tell you one thing is amazing about his dad is he's like so his dad's a huge phoenix sons fan so was ben i'm like oh did you get it from your dad like your dad you know growing up as a huge fan so that's why you are he's like no it's the opposite growing up my dad didn't really care about basketball or the suns and i got super into it and he's like my dad just does this thing where like whatever each of his kids is into he like he's like all right i'm into it too and like not just like a small that's a great dad movie the great dad move right so i was like holy [ __ ] i didn't even i'm a dad now so i'm like i don't even think about that he's like he's not just supportive because i think that's that's normal the common would be you're supportive oh you like this great good you know go on do your thing i'll i'll show up at your game and i'll kind of be you know doing the crossword on my you know in my lap because i'm bored it's not my thing his dad said the opposite he's like oh we like the you like the sun suns no we like the suns and we we love everything about the suns now and we eat live and breathe the suns and so for his other kid his other son is does real estate he's like oh you do real estate no no no we do real estate and so he works for his son for free just helping him sell real estate 40 hours a week because he's like oh yeah we got to sell some real estate i'm in and so he's like a free employee who's like hitting up linkedin he doesn't pay him like he loves this podcast because he'll hear growth ideas and he'll be like oh so i'm going to do that for my son's real estate business wait that's it that's an amazing bat an amazing dad and a horrible son pay your dad dog he doesn't want the money he's that great of a debt and then the other son like he does this like comedy thing and he's like oh comedy all right i'm in the comedy scene now and like he does that and i was like wow i'm gonna do this so on the dad's side i was like holy like ben ben works with me andy basically works with me too he's like he listens to every episode of the podcast he responds to every email like we put out he'll like he's not trying to get special treatment he replies like a fan like he'd be like oh yeah i do my five-to-three tuesday he's like i love number three or he's like the podcast oh i love the way you and sam did this and i'm like dude how sick is that to have your dad become your wingman for your favorite hobby or your passion like i'm gonna do that so that was the first learning the second was this birthday thing he's like yeah my mom like she came up with this early on like you know love's not about the gifts and like this is just a fun thing we do for each other and we always do it we we did it you did what this birthday poster so when you wake up is this like a white person thing i don't know about i don't know but i mean at my house when you wake up on your birthday you wait my mom would put puts like posters all over the house that that all the other kids like throughout wow okay i don't know man what did you play did you do this too we don't where did you get this no this is this is new to me as well no no no sam yeah we had it as well and honestly it made my day it was like i would i would be so eager to walk upstairs it's kind of like when you walk upstairs and you see like stuff around the christmas tree it was like i felt that same joy i walk over on the surface i see my signs all over the place and i know that like i get the breakfast that i want that day yeah it's pretty cool this so so i i basically like i don't even care about my birthday anymore because it's always like the same thing and i hate the same i hate the sameness of life there's so many things that are just the same all the time like when facebook came out with that you can write happy it'll remind you happy birthday then your wall becomes a thousand people who don't really care about you writing happy birthday i hate that because then i feel guilty like i gotta reply yeah i never reply and like you know and but it's just the same thing right or what other people do is uh let me throw money at the problem which becomes a different kind of burden it's like i gotta get you a gift um i gotta think of something or let's say i go buy you a nice card it's like dude the birthday poster is so much better than a hallmark card because it's like hey it's like actually thoughtful b is like kind of goofy and funny it's like more entertaining and it's kind of personal touch right and so so i love this idea when we came home from that farming conference my daughter had drawn a poster that says welcome home data and it's still the first post like in my bathroom it's a poster on the wall every day i go to the bathroom i see welcome home data like the the bathroom is my home which is you know a little bit true and so i'm like this personal poster thing is a great life hack and it got me thinking i'm gonna start stealing everybody's favorite family tradition and so that's my new question for people is like yo what are these like family traditions you got like what are the things that y'all do and like people don't even know that they're so like baked into their operating line they don't even know them and then you kind of keep digging and you'll find them and if it's like if it's a family tradition that's lasted like you know 20 years of your life it's probably awesome and like i should steal that from my own family what do you think yeah i think that's good i'm trying to think if i even have like my family we're all atheists but we still pray before every time we eat dinner like you don't eat until you pray even like no one believes in god um that's like an interesting tradition we do do birthday posters um i don't think we have any other traditions like that i wonder i bet ben has a ton a bunch but the one that we started i think i talked about this so we started doing our uh end-of-year reviews where we uh like do product reviews and and talk and preview the year to come that's our newest tradition i like that one a lot yeah but that that's some new age [ __ ] though actual product views like i love this microphone or what do you mean no i don't know just like uh just reviewing like the year that what was ben's 2021 or whatever and then previewing yeah yeah um but no the other like we have a bunch of tradition we do have a bunch of traditions um like one of the simple ones we eat waffles like every sunday morning and that's like a thing i know i can look forward to every week my wife makes really good waffles with like strawberries she does like goes all out yeah that's just one over the top it's one meal a week that i know i can always look forward to and i love it you don't have any sean no i do i have some and now i'm like and i i give credit to my dad my dad was really the one who was bringing the like the fun factor with some of these whereas my mom's more like practical whereas my dad would be like like once a week he would do the same like the whatever like the monday night dinner and it's like oh dad's making dinner oh sweet it's not because he's a better cook but he would like he would just add some showmanship to it so he would like make he was like get this tray and so everybody had their own circular tray with like four dishes in it and and then he would add a quarter and we were always like yeah the coins there like i got a quarter and like it's like an equivalent of a mcdonald's happy meal but like with a quarter and there would be just like some flourish there was always something that was like a little extra that he would do and um and like you know or like these little things he would come home and he put his wallet down but the game was i would always steal the wallet and i'd have he'd run and chase me i'd have to hide it and like the game was like can he get his wallet back and it's like how do you turn that like two minutes of coming home from like oh hey how's it going like autopilot into like something that's actually like fun and breaks everybody's kind of like mood for a second so he used to do that's a great question to ask someone what family trip what's a really good family tradition yeah i'm going to steal them too good idea got a buddy actually that just came to mind i don't even i don't think i want to steal this because i don't think i could convince my family to do it but his family did it and i remember because he started dating this girl and i was like how's it going you know dating mike or whatever and she was i think maybe the other way around i was like how's he going dating dating this girl she's like they got the she's like they got this weird tradition to kiss on the lips yeah basically that he was like yeah they go to he's like i went i went on the they're like annual like uh come on annual family like vacation to tahoe or whatever they went to a cabin and i'm expecting skiing and all this other stuff and there was but at night they did this thing i'm like oh [ __ ] what did they do that's like blood cult like what's going on and he's like yeah they all read harry potter but like they read it aloud and they read it like in the voices and he's like oh my god that's a bit more sitting there in the circle yeah exactly but i was like but to them it was like their thing and i was like i you know what like as as cringe as i would feel doing that and i love harry potter by the way but as cringe as i would feel like doing you know dumbledore's voice as i read the book that would be a lot for me and definitely a lot for me if i'm the visiting boyfriend into that family that was like a lot but like you know respect to have a family that's like willing to be a little silly even as everybody gets old like i really respect that and like if that's your thing that's your thing all right whatever like you know let me go ahead and and read you know order of the phoenix like in in the voice like let's do this you know like i say like cornrows and tattoos or cornrows and sleeve tattoos i respect that others do it but that ain't for me not for me my new line i tweeted this out yes i just bothered people but i i called i was like product managers are the bottled water of tech and it's just a funny backhanded slide like nobody nobody knows what to make of it like it's a compliment but it's clearly kind of an insult like i like bottled water but i guess bottled water is useless and then somebody one-upped it and i'm like oh that's my new [ __ ] he goes he goes they're more like the throw pillows and i was like dude throw pillows such a good disc because it's like it's like you know girls love them they look good but they're completely [ __ ] useless and annoying and like annoying when you actually need to go to sleep and so calling something the throw pillow of x is just an awesome slam that i'm like saving up in my back pocket to use i met people at this conference that i went to and there was like a lot of listeners there and someone came up to me goes so um like when did you guys decide to make the switch to go from talking about business just being like 12 year olds [Laughter] yeah that's what they said and he goes are you happy with that switch and i was like a i don't remember and b yeah i think so [Laughter] but i was like yeah there definitely was like a decision [Laughter] but he wasn't trying to like roast me he was like it was steph's uh fiance steph smith's fiancee and he goes he's like i love the pod um but like when was that switch made where you were gonna like go from like talking about actual business to being 12. when i was 12 we had a question like this which was um i was like you probably know what it was like um when did you tell your dad you're gay and it was like it was like a viral question that went through our middle school like covid it was like instantly someone said this and people realize like oh my god it's a hilarious trap question there's no good answer to this question and literally everybody in every school in the school district of texas was saying this question for like three months and then it went away that's what that question is like oh when did you guys decide to like switch the podcast up to being like 12 year old idiot it's like yeah he just totally like alphaed me and i was like oh i don't remember calvin it was pretty good and on that note all right we're out see you [Music] you

fortunes are built during these bear market times if your strategy with investing is to only buy in when things are going up and then like sell or do nothing when prices go down like you have inadvertently subscribed to a buy high sell low strategy i think we know that that's not a winning strategy the opposite of that is if you have conviction or if there are good assets that are underpriced temporarily those are the times where you're supposed to buy in i'd rather just earn more income and build more companies than worry about these losses

you own a holdco i think gridley enterprise is the name of it within it you have a bunch of different things so you own stuff as funky as like a fireworks company called alamo fireworks you own like a software roll-up called dura software um you have like a coffee chain i think is that right you have your a drive-through coffee chain that's got like three or four locations or something like that um and then you incubate a couple a couple projects one of one of which i used actually recently [Music] uh michael what up dog shawn where are you you're in tahoe i'm in lake tahoe yeah how is it it's amazing yeah this place is great is it just a getaway from crypto no it was a father's day trip so uh you know came out here with my wife's family and uh yeah it's been cool just been like at the lake in the pool all that good stuff that's awesome who who so you sean you want to introduce this guy yeah okay great so we got michael gerdley is that the way you say it yep yeah michael's here i've been following you on twitter for a while and uh and i think you almost want you almost bought our nft for the five minutes of fame but uh you got outbid at the last minute is that right yes yeah i had a whole plan about it i was actually going to shard it and then try to make profit from it and sell it in 15 second increments but some really rich crypto person came in and swooped it out from under me sorry sam loves i had a huge plan i had a huge plan [Laughter] uh and and but you but it worked anyways you got on the pod anyways without it because uh you're a pretty interesting dude i've been following you on twitter mostly because you tweet about chili's a lot and i'm a big chili's guy huge chili's fan um but you also you kind of fit into this sort of like andrew wilkins bucket which is like you run a hold co and you run like a pretty big hold co and so let's just give people kind of like your your rundown here's what i know about you um you own a holdco i think gridley enterprise is the name of it within it you have a bunch of different things so you own stuff as funky as like a fireworks company called alamo fireworks you own like a software roll-up called dura software um you have like a coffee chain i think is that right you have your a drive-through coffee chain that's got like three or four locations or something like that um and then you incubate couple a couple projects one of one of which i used actually recently called near which is like a way easy way to hire people in in latin america and i found this awesome dude you know not a plug for near necessarily but it did work it did work exactly as intended i found this awesome operations guy for my ecommerce business there nico um so so yeah so that's what you do and um i don't know sam where do you want to start we could we can go into into kind of high level or we could dive into any of the details where do you want to start he put together this really good document that explains all the different businesses but to summarize it looks like it's like eight or nine or ten of them and so so i understand the size it's over 100 million in revenue right and over 750 employees for all eight or ten of these yes whenever i hear people be like okay yeah my my kind of the accumulation of the businesses that i own some percentage ownership stake in is worth over 100 million dollars or like a real estate guy will be like you know i have a billion dollar real estate portfolio in my head and i'm sure there's a bunch of listeners who are like this too they're like so what does that mean are you like are you are you super loaded is this a like how do i think about that number right because like you know if i get a salary that's the money i keep if i run a business and i say top line revenue that's not the money i get to keep so when you own a you own 100 of your hold co and your holdco owns businesses that add up to over 100 million in revenue does that mean you're just big ball of shot calling are you paying yourself like 10 million dollars a year or more out of out of the profits of these businesses or what does that really mean yeah well i mean part of the way i've set up the structure is like i wanted to be very flexible in terms of strategy so there's some stuff in here that's just like compounders like um dura for example like we want to be the next constellation software someday so like i don't that's just compounding the money i put into that and the effort and time and i put into it like i don't i don't get cash flow from that stuff but that's by design like i'm just a long-term player and a long-term person on all this stuff you know the things we went through just kind of the 10 big holdings that i have those are all things that i have 50 60 30 40 percent of companies so it's not like i i told him with you like i've i you know i felt stressed being like okay well i don't want to be the guy coming in and bullshitting about a bunch of numbers but also like i'm from texas and like like i have a hard time like bragging and being like well okay here's some here's what my net worth is and here's how much money i make and all that kind of stuff so i'm trying to balance it out to where we can actually get there without getting past my comfort zone how do we let's let's not balance that out let's just go to the other end and make it incredibly uncomfortable tell me how your net worth your checking account number and what it felt like when you lost your virginity you could pick one go now uh really drunk four and uh yeah yeah let's let's really get into it it's like oh you don't want to reveal you don't want to reveal your penis size that's fine just tell me about your net worth then we'll settle for that but it's just there's like a mental model for these businesses right like some businesses like you call it a compounder right it's like uh if you go into a business like this you're gonna put up it only takes x dollars to start and then it takes y years to kind of get to some good outcome like like i'll just give you like a venture startup right like i come from the silicon valley venture world silicon valley venture world is you put zero dollars of your own money up but you're gonna raise likely somewhere between three and 300 million from venture capitalists over time uh you shouldn't expect to see any big money until you exit which is on average seven to ten years and so like that's the profile of that versus my e-commerce business took i don't know i put in 600k to start it uh like that was my first kind of year uh commitment that i had to put in um but we can take quarterly profits now you know a year or two we could take quarterly profits if we wanted to we decided to roll that into growth but we think that by three or three or four we should be seeing pretty healthy you know quarterly profits that will pay for a sweet lifestyle right so that's like just to paint a picture of what type of business you're getting into most people don't know how the holdco business works so give me those sorts of like what does it take to start how long do you have to wait to get a payday how big are those paid you know are you playing a software game like a vc software game you can make a billion dollars e-commerce unlikely to happen but you can pretty safely make tens of millions of dollars if you do it right yeah well i mean i think my theory on stuff is it's been incredibly difficult to find good opportunities over the past five years so i've structured stuff that i want to be able to do any opportunity that comes through the door right and so like so the danger is say for example i run across a fun idea to work on that you know maybe is in the roll-up space well like like that's going to require outside capital right dura required outside capital my partner and i who started the business he's former head of support for rackspace he's the ceo of the business now we put up our own money to do the first acquisition and then we started when we ran out of money right after a couple million dollars um we had to go out and raise money and so that's playing that kind of vc compounding game that i talked about you know other stuff like the coding bootcamp that we start like that pays me money every month it's it's similar to what you're talking about um so you know those the thing i like about those kind of cash flowy llc's and stuff like that is like you know the upside isn't as good like you can't have a billion dollar exit in that stuff 20 years from now but you can start cash flowing really quickly um so i like to have a blend of all those things because you can you can't live on appreciation how much how much profit does the 100 million make or i think you said over 100 million but let's just say it's 100 million how much profit does it actually make and let's say that you own 30 of one company that makes 10 million in profit do do you say like all right we're gonna take of that 10 million we're gonna uh take out three million in profit we own thirty percent we get one million yeah well i typically the stuff in a portfolio for small businesses like this is going to end up run 15 to 20 percent you know ebit emergence so then you do a calculus and say okay well based on that like free cash flow potential margins like okay you got to pay off debt service and all that kind of stuff if you have it and then is it better if you take the money out or should you reinvest it inside the business and by and large most of these things are reinvesting because i don't have better places to put the money than reinvesting in assets and new acquisitions and all that kind of stuff which business is the best cash cow is it like you know that the fireworks company where it's like well yeah open like three months a year and it just prints ca it prints profits for three months and then we like don't have to think about it for the other nine like yeah that's true i'm just saying that out loud which business is the best one and why is it fireworks dude fireworks here's why i love fireworks it was the first business that started my whole platform and i was the ceo of it and it is the hardest business in the world to run like it the cash flow sucks like we we aren't even open yet for fourth of july we open in two more days and we've been spending money to get ready for it all the way through through uh since january the second and you have to predict what's going to happen six to twelve months ahead of time and then you have to put up all the cash for it buy all the fireworks get all the locations out of we have 200 locations across the state of texas and then open them all up uh and then we really don't break even until about seven or eight pm on the night of the 4th of july so it is when i ran that business that was where i cut my teeth as a ceo like it was the hardest business to run to where i went to these other businesses and people would like pay you before you delivered the service or like like when you started the coding bootcamp was the second business and i was like you mean they pay us before we teach them the classes like this is amazing i thought it was the greatest thing ever so every other business feels like how much revenue does the fire one do fireworks uh it's multiple tens of millions yeah no [ __ ] that makes let's say 20 30 40 million dollars selling fireworks for two weeks uh we do it twice a year uh fourth for the fourth of july and then we do it again for new year's in texas it's warm enough that actually new year's is more pleasant than any place else golly that's amazing and that's good and that's quite profitable if you do well for the like the remaining like three hours and then three hours you make all your profits all your profit because everybody shows up at the last minute that's the other part i didn't tell you yeah nobody buys anything until the last day because consumers have this habit of not doing things ahead of time so that that business is actually kind of an ugly business then um because it's like you have to predict things and i don't know the world is very unpredictable the last few years so you have to predict demand you have to operate really well in a very tight time crunch like all your demand gets squeezed into this tiny pipe um you're putting up all the cash up front so you're taking some some risk there did you you're a clever guy did you come up with any clever operating hacks to like make that business suck less that other firework people don't really do uh yes we have a bunch of those i didn't come up with any of them uh the thing i realized and this was about 14 15 years ago i actually really suck at optimizations like i want to live at like 80 000 feet with like big ideas and strategy and doing what we're doing right here right like i want to live in an idea space and what i realized about six years into running that business was i am precisely the wrong person to run this business because what you're talking about is just like game of inches where you have to be like optimizing stuff all the time and like i find that incredibly boring like that is the mo like that and accounting and hr are like the three most boring things you'd ask me to do in my life and what we've done is a ton of those kind of optimizations like that business has exploded in the past five years no pun intended through just getting the right people on the field and it means me not doing it because absolutely the wrong perfect wrong person to run that business but we do a bunch of different stuff like we brought digital point of sale to that business it used to be handwritten for a long number of years um so some pretty basic stuff that you're like really it took that long but yeah we we've done all that kind of stuff but the it's the royal we it's not me how much money did you you said you started this thing with two million dollars of you and your partner's money and then is the rest like a fun that you raised so um so dura was something i started we started with our own money uh the fireworks business i got that the old-fashioned way i it's a family business i inherited it so that's why you're like how this kind of with the fireworks business i i was told i have a fireworks business now and it's great what about the other things did you have to it's like is is each one like its own you raise money for each one if you need to raise money or you just use your own money yep just uh if if i need to syndicate the deal i syndicate the deal with other people um you know what i've learned and i only do is i hate raising money for stuff unless i'm putting my own money in it so i'll put a substantial amount of my net worth and new stuff and then when i go out to raise money i feel like not yucky otherwise i feel yucky but yeah which of the business okay so we thought maybe the fireworks business is the best one it turns out that's kind of a pretty pretty gnarly business what which of your businesses would you say is like the most in the cash flow category like it's just so beautiful because it works it's just it just worked right away didn't take a ton of money it's uh you know it's profitable it's not like this brutal business to operate which which one do you like the best yeah uh the coding bootcamp is the best one it's all services low capex um and then i mean the thing i like the most about it like it actually like helps people like it changes their lives and that's not [ __ ] by the way like you'll notice a theme like on all this stuff i really like enjoy helping people and it it's a life transformation thing when people go through that and get a better job clearly you've never had a bottle rocket fight man because those are pretty amazing too uh that is that is uh low eight figures that's amazing and very profitable uh that runs kind of consistent with what we're talking about that 15 to 20 even emergence and and so um so you got a bunch of these so um i like your twitter because um you talk about a bunch of things that i think most people aren't talking about my feed is very like i don't know my twitter feed is just like the same crypto people the same silicon valley people and then there's like five people that are like just you know different and i think you're friends with all of them like that guy molson i think is like a total nut i find him his feed to be hilarious uh you're kind of a nut you're hilarious uh there's this guy jay vasileva i don't know how to say his last name exactly long indian last name he's super smart and like you know people just don't follow you guys in the same like to the same level as i think you should um like i'll make a list of these people i'll tweet it out because i think you guys are all way more entertaining on twitter than most um but i want to read you a couple of tweets and i want you to just kind of riff on like kind of explain it but riff on what you what you mean there like what was the kind of the golden thing there so um you had one about going to touristy places but doing non-touristy things you were tweeting out like you were in china you're tweeting out like what a a paper recycling mill like what is waste paper from the us where does it go once we like where does the waste paper go and you like found where it goes in china it was this gnarly factory and so like i don't know if you could talk about that or just this idea of going going on vacation or going to a touristy place but then hitting the non-touristy parts of that country uh talk a little about that yeah well that was a i mean that was a business trip like i was there training the team and helping them go learn how to buy fireworks um and like we were just like driving down the road and like literally so the process of going to buy fireworks uh is there is like a silicon valley of fireworks and it's in china and it's about a two-hour flight from hong kong in the southeast of china and you go to this place and like it's the same thing every day you go the chinese take you to a fancy dinner and there's always the same restaurant the same food and then they take you to a factory and then they shoot you some fireworks and hopefully you buy them and that happens like for six days in a row and then and you have to drink a bunch of nasty bijou they just they have like budweiser chinese budweiser they serve you and it's pretty fun yeah it's pretty fun um but yeah after like the fourth year of doing that like i was there with with the team and i was we were like driving along and i was just so sick of going to yet another fireworks factory because they all look the same it's just like the same little old ladies like doing the same thing and all the fireworks workers by the way are like 70 years old they can't hire young people to work in fireworks factories this is crazy and i was like what is that over there and uh and they're like oh that's the box factory and i was like a box factory let's go over there and so they pull over to the side of the road the driver goes in and the chinese seller to us like takes us in for a tour of this box factory and for me it was just like an opportunity to kind of push a little bit and like really get underneath and understand like how a culture like lives and really functions and like he told us like look they're they're having problem making boxes now because they can't put the waste water directly in the river anymore i was like oh this is why things are so cheap in china um but yeah that's it like just you just kind of start wandering and then magic happens so that was one of those what type of trip was that where you uh bring a bunch of texas firework workers to china and like yeah i just imagine like just like what the [ __ ] is this soy sauce [ __ ] you know what i mean just like imagine that conversation and uh that was you must have had a blast hanging out with a bunch of uh texas firework guys and a bunch of chinese fireworks guys you guys that we really got brought together there on that one our love of blown [ __ ] up yeah well i mean i'm somewhat worldly the guy the guy that we took on the trip actually the ceo for the business is a former uh a former senior military officer who's romanian and lives here in san antonio now used to work for aldi and they didn't know what to make of him like they were just totally confused why we had a romanian with us like going through rural china so it's pretty good times have you had any of these other like have you intentionally gone and sort of gone off the beaten path to like because i feel like what you're when i look at your your twitter feed you've sort of accumulated a bunch of random disparate business knowledge and a lot of this comes from like oh you see a guy selling something on the street you're like hey so what is this where does this come from how do you do this right that sort of thing can you tell any other stories of you know sort of like intentionally stumbling into interesting things because i think more people should do that um and i want to kind of like you know hear some of those stories hmm it's a really good question i need to think of a good hat you think of a good answer i'm glad we're i'm glad this is being edited um when have i done that the most um yeah we went down one one time we went down this is super interesting um you know our business dura has some employees in medellin in colombia you know where bob escobar is from so we went down there to just kind of like start wandering around and like meet our employees and like understand should we outsource more here um and we just started like going around with a guide and just like asking people questions like what do you think of americans what is it like here and like you just start to see random stuff um i mean the reason i started the coffee business by the way is like i was riding my bike around arkansas and i'm like just riding outside the walmart headquarters because like i'm a business nerd and staring at the walmart headquarters and uh like there's this like drive-through coffee shop there and it was coveted and i was bored and i just sat there for an hour and these guys were just printing money and i came home and i called my buddy who i'd wanted to work with for years and i was just like hey we should start a coffee business and he said why and i sent him the pictures i was like look at all these people they're just like printing money um so it's just kind of this idea of just like for me like like the way i build ventures and the way i find them is just kind of by like stumbling around like an idiot and then like you end up in front of the walmart headquarters and watch some guys sell on millions of dollars worth of coffee um so yeah that's another story and does uh you went to the berkshire hathaway uh like summit which i think is kind of like a pilgrimage for like business people slash entrepreneurs it's like you got to go visit the mecca and like you see the old kind of religious you know leader you know the 90 year old guru sitting there and uh is it worth it should i go uh you definitely gotta go at least once i mean it was like so i'm 47 so like i always regretted i didn't see jared garcia before he died and uh like that was the way i felt about seeing charlie and warren and and you know it's like one of those things where i was kind of happy to be there because it felt like a once-in-a-lifetime thing and the people watching is amazing like it's like it's like the combination of like cash like investing and like a nascar race like it's perfect um so i just had so much fun doing it but it's also kind of you know i feel like going at this point like charlie and warren are getting up there like they're 92 and 98 like the morning you know warren spent a lot of time just kind of trying to find his words and then he got into a rhythm and it was like he was his old self again it was pretty awesome but i mean i think if you're a capitalist you got to go once you just gotta go once because you're just like it's just such it's just such an insane experience seeing these people so devoted to the company dropping 250 on a pair of roper boots or justin boots and then walking over and drooling over like how they can buy like a sunbeam boat like it's just like just the coolest thing so you gotta go at least once sam have you been no uh i was invited to go i think you and i were invited with sieva and suli and i didn't go is it i guess i i guess i would go just to see it dude those guys are old aren't they like isn't charlie munger like 93 98 oh my god yeah i got a connector it would have to be that yeah i guess next year would have to be like the last one maybe you gotta go just to watch him and see how much peanut brittle he eats in a four-hour setting like it was unreal the guy ate like four pounds of peanut butter and when i like live-tweeted the thing like it was like i can't believe he's still eating this much peterborough i'm 47 there's no way i could do that he was just sitting there pounding it the whole time dude that peanut butter from seas is fire i feel that it is pretty amazing these guys have like they have the most success and they do the opposite of what every like you know success coach and like motivational entrepreneur you know tells you to do it's like you know they're like you know it's like if you would go on instagram it's like oh i need to you know wake up at 5 00 a.m i need to you know meditate i need to do my ice plunge then i need to do my crossfit workout then i need to like you know do my daily gratitude journal then i need to do my like hyper focus chamber where i go and i figure out my priorities for the day then i need to like speed read and listen to my podcast on 2x speed and these guys are basically like you know they somehow made it they became the richest people in the world lived until they you know until they're about 100 years old and they wake up every day they eat mcdonald's breakfast eat a bunch of m m's and diet cokes and then they read and play bridge all day and like go for walks and uh you know that's where they get their their ideas from and so you know i think there's something to what they're doing i think it's a you know i think they're still alive because they're low stress despite what they eat uh and i think they're they're smart thinkers because they don't overload their brain with information like uh i'm guilty of and i think a bunch of people are when you when you're hooked into social media you're just constantly consuming info this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform where everything is fully integrated well i can see the clients hold history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago i totally missed hubspot grow better one of your of the things in your uh the the things in your portfolio which company besides the um besides the the boot camp are you like this is just the greatest thing ever i'm so happy we own this uh i more people should know how easy or not easy but how straightforward this business on it feels like i'm winning an easy mode yeah well i think the near business so it's higher with near.com so it actually this is a this is the this is the apex of what i want for gridley existence to be which is i want i've gone from starting businesses myself and working in them then starting businesses and having other people work in them and this is one that has started basically with me doing no work but i have substantial amount on the cap table like it's the apex of girdly automation like i'm always scaling stuff so then your business like we looked up and like like i i'm in a ceo peer group and like none of my peers could like hire people like it was the past couple years it was just such a mess and then i'd ask them well have you considered hiring overseas and they're like i don't know how to do that how would i do that so we we basically i took one of my associates and i said hey we should go build in this direction there's this huge wave and here's this problem let's go try some stuff and see what happens and that business i like so much just because everything seems like it's on easy mode because everybody's offshoring like everybody wants to do this it was that way when the economy was going well now it's even more so when the economy is going poorly and i've hired personally of my associates i have three of the six that work work overseas i've never met him in person it's like the best and you partnered with someone to make this according to the about page right yeah so um hayden is started as an associate of mine so i hire these people i call them associates and it's basically an entrepreneur in training program so i like mentor them through i pay them a salary um and then i help them like get out of the like 12 bad ideas that every entrepreneur has to get when they're 27 years old i help them like think through all those and then we work on a good idea together and then at the end of it they can either start a company with me or they can go take a job or whatever and so hayden and franco were two of the guys in that program and like i'm on the cap table with them like i put up the money and have been guiding them through it but they've done all the work when you're hiring ceos how much equity do you give them and how much uh how much do you pay them and how do you incentivize them to want to stay with you for a long time yeah so totally depends upon the situation um you know obviously if a business is much more established or demands somebody who's like much more like um like mature um that that makes a situation where oftentimes you have to come up with more my best situations are when i can partner with somebody so all this stuff i'm in while i have significant stakes in it i have other people on the cap tables like that's one of my like i feel like superpowers like i can just like maintain partnerships like i have a 100 success rate on partnerships with people so the absolute best way is if i can get somebody like paul at dura is to be like a co-founder and the absolute best way of that is if they're a co-founder and they put money in it like me and then they make that their job like that's the absolute best skin in the game kind of outcome but you know you can have anywhere from a 27 year old who will make 60 to 80k a year plus benefits to some of these people who are much more senior like our coffee our coffee person you know he worked at 25 years at circle k and he's running he's running that business he obviously needs to make much more money than that and then the equity really depends totally depends on the opportunity it depends on how much skin in the game they want to have what level of commitment they have and how early they're coming in the venture but it could be anywhere from 40 to 20 to 5 and why does let's say for dura uh why does your partner want to give you what let's call it let's pretend you have 30 i don't know what you have maybe it's 50 maybe it's a little less let's just say 30 what does he want to have give you 30 and he's a day to day in it but you're not right uh so how do you think about that like value exchange um when you're not going to be the operating person and then they are yeah well i mean so you're asking that question from the same lens i have which is like being an operator isn't our dream most people their their dream is to be an operator they're excited when we're able to work together and create an opportunity for them to be their best self right and that's what i see kind of as that benefit and so and and so i think a situation like that where like you know oftentimes i'm part of the very early figuring out what the idea is going to be i'm putting up a substantial amount of money i put up more money than than say the other partners did we did some debt to do the first deal like i personally guaranteed it and then the last thing is like like great teams they have these complimentary things like how much money would you use to fund a new business so that one was like a couple million and then some of these are like 50 to 100. wow okay so that's why you do put up a lot of money yeah so yeah skin in the game matters um then that also helps me not to try to do too many things like i could just be like okay like i'm putting real money in this i better really believe in it um but like like the last thing with these operators is a lot of the things i feel like i bring to the business where it's like strategy insights like best practices and connections like those are things that they're happy to have somebody along on the journey with them who has the same level of commitment um and wants to be a board member like i i don't want their job and i'm not i wouldn't be good at it so you know i think that's that's the partnership i end up having with these folks sean have you heard of um this guy named kevin ryan only through you he's like a media right is that the same guy yeah so michael have you heard of this guy kevin ryan i'm googling him all right so i think there mike there's probably a billion kevin ryan so like maybe a baseball that's like a baseball player oh he's the ally so yeah so listen to this guy so early in his career he worked like in the newspaper business nothing particularly exciting and then he worked at this company called doubleclick and he was like the 30th employee there and then took over as ceo and then doubleclick was sold for like a billion or many billion and it eventually became adsense for google so a pretty big thing he told me that he had made like um very low digit eight eight figures uh he was like there's enough money that like i'm set but uh like i still wanted to like create stuff and so him and this guy named dwight who i think he worked with at doubleclick they started alicorp and their whole thing was we're gonna fund companies with 200 to 300 000 and all the ideas are going to come from us all the ideas are only going to be back of the envelope math and we're going to hire someone to get it off the ground and we're gonna give it 300 000 and six months to prove if this is a good idea or a bad idea and we're gonna do it a bunch of times a few of their successes that they've done this with are uh mongo.mongodb which i don't know what it's at now but in the range of like a 20 to 50 billion dollar uh market cap publicly traded software business the second one is business insider which sold for 600 million i think but it's like a big company now the third one is guilt guilt group which was a clothing company that was huge it didn't actually work out but it was huge for a little while and i think the fourth one there's another oh the fourth one is zola you guys know zola it's like where you go for wedding registries i believe that's a unicorn and there might actually be two or three more of these companies that ali corp has like uh founded and basically he was like yeah so me and dwight just sit around and we come up with a cool idea like i go to a wedding and i just ask people where they bought all the gifts and like he's like i just had this idea so i knew someone who worked at guild group who mentioned she liked this type of business i hollered at her i go hey here's 300k if you can get this going and you get a small portion but we get most of it you want to try it and that's how it worked it's a he's pretty amazing speechless that's impressive it's like yeah i was like yeah those guys are really good there's this like holdco model is it's like in vogue right because it's sort of like to me i i worked at a startup studio for a while i think that was like the thing for a period of time probably still is a thing where yeah you build one company you run it for a while you sell it great now you got cash you still want to do more entrepreneurial things and so you self-fund a studio where like we're going to work on a bunch of ideas and then you try to find like new winners out of those bunch of bunches of ideas and so like you know i worked at out of one that's how i got into tech um you know mark pincus the guy who created zynga then he created one the guy who created uber he created one kevin rose created one like it's just a bunch of serial entrepreneurs who create these and they've actually had a pretty poor track record of success and then we see that like the holdco mafia is sort of the same where you get you know um guys like andrew wilkinson who's got tiny and then you have you know a bunch of other people who are doing their own holdco versions of that whether they buy boring businesses they buy sweaty businesses they buy software businesses they buy whatever um and you're kind of in that boat you're in that boat too uh what do you think is the i guess like how do you think about that you know in terms of like who do you think should be the type of person who who should do this and and what are some of the misconceptions or like traps that people fall into when they go down this path because i'm sure you've seen a bunch yeah well i mean i think there's two there's two bad things going on with hold codes right now i think there's a whole group of people that are doing them and they actually uh think it's not that much work like i talked about i'm like so why are you doing this they're like uh it seems really easy i'm like this is really hard and the reason number two that it's like super hard is because this is exactly the opposite of operations like the everything that you do and all the habits and skills that you learn when you are a ceo running a business which is where most these people are coming from or your senior exec in a company like everything you do in a hold code is exactly the opposite like like when there's a problem you don't rush in and fix it for your company you actually say man that really sucks what are you gonna do about that two entirely different things in terms of the way you approach it so i mean it'll be interesting to see what happens with all these people who think hold codes are really hot um as i talk to most of them i don't think as many of them are wired to be holdco people as they really think they are like the me's the xavier hulkinsons like like we're odd like we're different people and there's a reason for that that we're not operators and so it'll be it'll be interesting to see what happens um with some of these people what's so hard about it you know i think it goes against people's nature right so like like take me for example like i love to live in this idea space right and i'm i have like a relatively crappy memory which is like why i have to write stuff down like crazy um but that's different for other people like a lot of the people that i partner with as operators they look at like what i do as insanity because they just couldn't imagine letting go of the vine of these particular things going on and so you know it goes against this human nature where a lot of times like for example those people like there's this problem going on in the business they want to sprint to that problem right and they can't imagine even stepping away from it so it just goes against in my opinion who you are as a person and makes it almost incredibly difficult or impossible for them these people yeah you say that but at the same time i'm like oh everybody i know is like oh i like to operate at a high level you know the 10 000 foot view and i'm an ideas guy i don't know anyone that doesn't think they're an ids guy maybe i just run in the wrong circles but you know i don't know a lot of people who are like you know what i like to grind the operator likes to go grind the day-to-day optimizations versus i like to be the idea guy who helps just get it started and somebody else goes and does all the hard work you know that seems like seems like there's a ratio of 100 idea guys to every one guy who just truly loves executing you ever heard of excel dog that's my jam oh no no you i lived in the silicon valley bubble too like i was i fit right in i was great there and then i came back here to the hinterlands of san antonio and like i started to see these people and like i've got buddies who for example are senior executives at the largest private grocery chain in america heb have you guys heard of this company yeah i love heb it's like my favorite grocery store it's insane you should see how optimized those guys are when they're running at three or four percent even at margins and like they think it's great tell me everything about heb yeah uh what do you want to know like what what why what makes it so great it all comes down to it all comes down to the philosophy of the family that owns it so you have charles butt who is the majority owner and then his his relatives are the other rest of the owners and then they have a percentage that's owned by the employees but it's like 85 90 percent owned by but by these guys um and so they'll just do crazy stuff like when they heard um when they heard that trader joe's was coming to san antonio so he's located here there's an anecdote that they just packed up all the senior executives who were in charge of product selection location selection interior store experience all that stuff they put them on a private jet and they flew out to uh to california and said don't come back until you have the best of every single one of their products because we need to up our game um there's another anecdote when walmart came to san antonio that heb went and lowered their profit targets because they're just like we're not losing to walmart that's just the way it's gonna work and that all emanated from the ownership right you didn't have this like public stock people coming in and saying like oh like think quarter by quarter now you had these folks that were thinking like we've been here for 70 years how are we going to be here for another 70 years and just go crush it and that goes all the way down the culture my buddy works there and he said it took 10 years um before people stopped referring to him as the new guy people just stay yeah imagine that in silicon valley of all the it sounds like to you that like heb is almost like a dream business or not a dream business but it's one that like you look at and you're like damn that is cool that is well run i admire a few things about that what else do what other companies do you admire that most people don't maybe know about or think about when it's like oh that's actually really neat for these following reasons hmm really good question what other businesses are super sexy i feel like i've talked about sexy but it's just like things where it's like uh man this is these guys got it made they're it's hard work but it seems like it's like pretty fun and i think that what they're doing has a lot of soul and they're doing it right sam do you have one while he's thinking yeah uh i mean it does seem like it's a lot of family guy stuff i would say um do you guys do you guys know blah blah uh black rifle coffee i've heard of them but i don't know much about them i don't drink so i don't really drink too much of it i drink the black stuff because the other stuff has a lot of sugar they're typically drink by like conservatives like they've like do they've done like they advertise on fox they've done like a good job of uh like like this is made in america it's all about freedom like that whole thing which is well you know whatever that's cool and but they're like yeah let's sponsor rally dirt rally race cars and i asked them i was like why and they're like because it's freaking awesome and like what's the point of like having this company if we can't do dope [ __ ] like you know go to a go to a rally car and give out our coffee and or they'll do it with like mountain biking races or they'll do it with the like they make all this all this cool content where they're just like doing like the redneck version of red bull stunts you know like uh and i think that's awesome i love that stuff i think that to me i imagine in their heads they're like yeah they're like we kind of care about coffee but we really just care about living a really cool amazing life and letting people have fun and it just so happens we're we're selling a bunch of coffee that allows us to to do that so that's a good example of a business that i like and they took it public and it's worth like six or seven hundred million dollars so it's like really successful yeah they're located here in san antonio have you seen it's it's super cool that that business you think it's like a coffee chain and it's actually just a lifestyle brand it's all like you go into the stores and there's like a little coffee thing on the side and then it's like all t-shirts and swag and it's good-looking stuff like i'm not like their demographic obviously but like it's super fun to like go in there and be like man these guys like i'd wear that even though it doesn't represent me i like them a lot sean do you have one you know uh i do ha i do have a couple um i like to i kind of admire like oh [ __ ] that's simple i like when it's really simple and the person has cr has like good life perspective so uh the guy came on the podcast mike brown i met him through you i've been about i went to the hustle office and he was he was just sitting there hanging out with you and um and you were like this guy's great you know you know what's great about this guy and i think sam you probably know the story a little better than i do but like what they did was they would go around to families in texas that that were like basically living on a gold mine right it's like they were living on some valuable deposit of you know minerals or oil or whatever and they would go knock on doors and they would say hey you know you um you're living on this land i'll like we'll pay you for the land rights in some way and they would go of those assets and then they would never go do the oil mining or oil drilling themselves they would then flip that to the oil company and say hey look we got the title rights you know clear and easy that are in the earth and they were making a killing so they were making you know i don't know almost almost 100 million dollars doing this is that right sam yeah i believe it was multiple eight figures in profit a year with like a team of like eight people and they're like yeah so it was super profitable super small super simple it's like well basically we go knock on doors we call people we explain what we're doing and then we make them an offer that they can't refuse like you know they're not going to do anything sitting on that land and so you know it to me i'm like this is so simple you compete with pretty much nobody um and then you and then he was like i was like so you bro it looks like your brother's working the business like how's that working with family you know some people say different things about that and he was like no it's awesome he's like i love my brothers he's like you know uh he's like my philosophy is you you know you find the people that you love and you do life with them and he said that and it kind of changed the way i i operated i was like oh yeah who are the people i want to do life with and like you know just kind of pick the five people who are the most awesome and then find excuses to do life with them that sounded really simple like i love sam i'm gonna do a podcast with sam and it's like oh our buddy ramone's awesome cool i'm gonna go on vacation with ramone all right you know like you want and like you know hey this person's awesome why don't you come work in one of my businesses right rather than just go work in your own job so i really liked i kind of admired that philosophy and i admired just the like sheer profits of what they were doing and how simple it was and how it didn't require you know genius or like honestly i'm sure he felt like he was working hard but it's not that hard like it's not well he used to say he was like everyone we hire we make him get into cycling because we all we like going bike riding for two hours in the middle of the day he's like we all want to go for we all want to go work out yeah yeah so i kind of admire people who are the anti-hard work crowd because i'm more of that like you know can you work smarter not harder and then can you even like not feel like you're working can you turn it into play by you know having people who are awesome you know doing it with you so i like that example the other one is uh bill simmons who started the ringer like i really don't think media companies are very good business and you know ironically just started a media company but like bill simmons is [ __ ] awesome and he kind of changed the game for what he does like every sports journalist did things one way he just did it differently and built this he built his following uh sort of unapologetically and what did he do differently so he just like he wrote from the perspective of a fan and that sounds actually that's actually giving it too much intellectual credit actually what he did was he was like all right what are the rules if you're a journalist it's like you need to be objective he's like how can i be objective dude i follow sports because i love the boston red sox i love the celtics i'm from boston i grew up my dad used to take me to the games he's like i'm going to write as like this die hard fan and when my team wins i'm going to be so happy when my team loses i'm the sky is falling he's like that of course was super relatable to a reader because that's who your reader is it's like a die hard sports fan so he like didn't pretend to be objective that was like the first part then he would be like cool i'm also not just like this flat thing that like i can only like talk about sports so he's like oh you know i love the die hard trilogy so he'll write a column that's like you know if nba players were characters in die hard here's who would be bruce willis and die hard 2. and like you know he would do these crossovers that didn't nobody else really took those risks it sounded crazy like sam you know you and me both watch the mtv's the challenge he's like a huge challenge fan and he'll talk about it he'll do a separate podcast about it even though the audience is kind of niche but it's so niche that when it hits it hits in a very big way like it's if it has a high like emotional score when he does talk about something you get you that you're in on the joke be like the trade values he's one of your heroes or the male bands one of your business heroes and uh anyways then he spun off did his he was doing podcasting before it was popular before it was like an obvious thing and so when he he recently sold the whole company to spotify for like 200 something million but you know that i i kind of admired that because it was like he deserves that he was podcasting before podcasting was a thing and so yeah he now has the number one sports podcast and he can cash out and all along the way there was never really any plan you could draw up how that podcast was gonna make the guy 200 million dollars someday it was like that was an unfathomable thing but he did it because he again it's kind of like your black rifle example it's like yeah i'm just gonna do it because i think it's fun and it's cool [ __ ] and like i i kind of believe in this magic this philosophy that if you take a bunch of cool [ __ ] you put it in the in the hat you kind of mix up the hat like something really good comes of that and you don't have to be able to draw it out you know ahead of time so i kind of i tend to love examples like that because i want to live my life more like that where i just do things without so much of a of a of a mind map of exactly how it's all going to pay off dude i love that i think um i saw this amazing quote i'm trying to find it but it was from kanye and he was like saying i despise people who do things i can't find the exact quote but he's like i despise people who do stuff and they don't want it to be dope he's like i wanna if i'm gonna do a clothe if i want to do a clothing company i'm making a dope even if that means i lose money i'm making it dope i'm making it awesome he kept using the word dope and he's like i'm just gonna do stuff because it's amazing and yeah it'll probably make money but for all the people out there who just do stuff just to get the money but they don't want to make it awesome in the process i think that's really weak and not cool and not difficult you heard that dave chappelle's story he tells on like some late night show about kind of yeah tell it my life is yeah yeah yeah i don't remember the exact day he's like i was hanging out with kanye and then kanye got a call who was it somebody called him who was it so it was uh it was uh kanye was backstage with dave chappelle and jay-z and kanye was just coming up and he was playing a uh a jay-z song and kanye's verse comes up and kanye's like the noob in the room and he goes wait stop that track rewind that and listen to that guy and he like made him rewind and then um he's like they're like dude what are you doing man you're not like you're the big shot here and then uh he gets a phone call and he goes oh hello yeah yeah that's fine but uh can i call you back uh yeah well i'm backstage watching never seen before clips with dave chappelle yeah because my life's dope and i do dope [ __ ] and then hangs up i think that's yeah exactly i love that story that is the best and also um like that philosophy is actually kind of amazing first of all to believe in your own life being dope like how many people think that their life is dope that they are dope and they do dope [ __ ] and therefore they have a dope life like most people don't give themselves that credit and you know they're kind of waiting for dope stuff to happen for them to be able to say that kanye's the opposite right he's crazy in a bunch of ways but one of the good ways he's crazy is that he just declares my life is dope and i do dope [ __ ] and guess what you'll kind of live up to that reputation if you believe that about yourself right like if you say you know um you know i take chances you know i'm bold i take i take bold risks well guess what you're going to actually take the next bold risk when the opportunity presents itself because you've kind of hardwired yourself to have that identity when we were sam you'll like this at bibo when um we hired this guy jason hitchcock and jason was jason's the best person you can hire because he will believe in you and the cause 150 like he'll believe in you and the mission if you're like his boss and your manager or whatever like more than you believe in yourself and he'll believe that the company's gonna work even more than the ceo is gonna believe he's like i call him a kool-aid drinker like he drinks the kool-aid and he's not ashamed to do it and so he because he's like an amazing person to have at a startup when there's a actually a lot of people have a bunch of doubt and uncertainty in their mind and so one day i was talking to jason and we were like um the hustle con was coming around around the corner and i was like i think i'd message you i was like i want to talk at hustlecon and i think you were kind of like yeah like yeah i don't know we got a bunch of speakers already you kind of blew it off you're like you know we no and uh and i was like all right fair enough but i asked and i was like i was like jason next year we're going to talk at house of con i was like in fact not just next year we're going to talk about hussocon in fact everything we do this year i want you to think about how it's going to play at your hustle con talk you're going to give when you're going to give this talk about how we grew from what zero to a million users how we took over the game in our industry like i want you to not just wake up and be like okay today i'm gonna send out a bunch of emails it's like i want you to think about how this could be part of your talk like how i landed the big fish through cold emails or how i you know growth hacked my way to do x and we used to talk about that literally on a weekly basis like this is part of the hustle contact it was just to hype ourselves up to like do the more dope version of the task we were already gonna do because like imagine you're gonna talk about this on stage that means it must have turned out pretty dope or you must have done a pretty dope attempt in order to have that mindset and i i'll st i still carry that to this day of like that's a pretty cool way to work um here's the uh here's here's the quote by the way so this is from kanye he said for me dopeness is what i like most people who want to make things as dope as possible and by default make money from it the thing that i like least are people who want to make money from things whether they're dope or not especially make money from making things the least dope as possible and i i've read that quote and i was like yeah we need to make the intro of the podcast find a clip of kanye saying that out loud and let's make that the the opening clip of the podcast um the other thing we did by the way that's in this bucket that i highly recommend people do is it's tempting to say we should do cool [ __ ] yeah blah blah blah and then like fast forward a month everyone's feeling tight about the budget or the deadlines or the the goal numbers are not being hit or whatever it's very what's the first thing you cut is the stuff that doesn't easily map to this quarter's result and and so we separate we created a separate do cool [ __ ] budget it was 15 percent of our total budget we put into a do-cool ship bucket which the outcome of it had to be where at uh there's a bib and then i tried to do this also at twitch where um which was like hey whatever the number is that we have to spend 15 percent is gonna be on cool [ __ ] that we cannot like we it doesn't have a measurable immediate payoff so that's like the criteria you can't it can't be used in this much like like making a flamethrower like making a flamethrower or like you know i don't know if you saw this we did the milk red rebrand or whatever and i paid this guy to make this little video that's like this mock apple commercial and like it doesn't do anything it's not gonna drive subscribers it's not gonna like make revenue uh it's i mean in many ways it is arguably a waste of time and money to just like pay the guy to do that and even think about the concept and all that but i've always had this with my companies which is like i need 15 i was like at the very least this is just to keep myself amused and engaged and like a fan of my own business and because i know if i'm like the mo if i'm just more engaged in my own business i'm gonna do that part will pay off and on the other side it's like i think your consumers the customers of your business also pay attention to that if they see you doing dope [ __ ] just for the sake of doing dope [ __ ] they kind of see you as the cool kid in school in a way right like if you're always just begging for for customers or users or doing a discounted sale or like saying please please please follow me please please please subscribe like you kind of are low status in a way and i think at the hustle you guys did a good job of this too did you do do you have any examples of this yeah like we did stuff early on that we kind of like people got mad at and i was like they're like you're gonna lose money lose customers i'm like yeah but it's hilarious like one time uh we wrote entire we wrote an entire email in trump's voice and so we're like imagine like if you read it and you were saying it out loud like that it would sound like you were donald trump everybody loved it everybody's saying it's the best people are saying that they're saying it's the best yeah like that's how that's that's like how it was written uh and then another time um this was like pretty vulgar but it was pretty funny we wrote the subject was here's the only tip that you need to know for how to be productive today at work and you open it up and it was just that picture of johnny cash where he flicks off the camera and it just says close this browser and get back to work and now and like that was that was that was it that was the email we sent that to 120 000 people we didn't even like we didn't even we didn't even send an email and then maybe one final thing this woman lindsay worked for me and she sent the tuesday's email on wednesday which is like a mistake and she's like [ __ ] she's freaking out and i was like here do this um i wrote in slack i was like hey uh you know i heard you sent the wrong email and she replied in slack yeah my bad i was really messed up i go we gotta talk but until then just like fix it and she replied with like what should i do i was like i don't know man just put the new email in and send it again just take a screenshot of this and like put that on and they'll understand i'm sure and he goes and she replied with something like funny and that was just the screenshot that just went at the top of the email there was no explainer right and so we would do like little things like that all the time what about you michael are there any companies that you look at that uh kind of fall into this category it's super fun uh well i did i did find one to talk about the have you guys done pop sockets before you talk to that we haven't talked about it now yeah it's a crazy story so um it's the it's the little like you take the the back of the case of your phone and you put the little ring on it well that's patented and they're called pop sockets and they're very litigious so the business started in 2014 and they sold 30 000 of these things so they're you know 10 or 12 bucks whatever um but then they got really popular and people the chinese started trying to knock them off and sell them on amazon and all this stuff um and so it was a uc boulder professor and by 2017 they sold 35 million of them in 2018 they sold 60 million of these things so all because they have a patent on this little way that you know teenage young girls in orange county want to grip their phone like they're just printing money so supposedly in 2018 they had 200 million in revenue and 90 million in profit all cause of a patent it's one of the great one one of the greatest yes i know this is true because i got it off of wikipedia when i researched this a few months ago yeah that's that's amazing got to be several hundred million at least i mean they got to keep growing every lady i know has one of those things fit your nails in there it's great sam you want to know a little realization i had today when michael was coming on i was like all right what do i know about michael i was like he does that like chili's little schtick where he's always like you know you know the only thing i don't even i don't know how i would explain it but basically you just find an excuse to name drop chili's and say how great chili's is and like why it's the best place for a meeting and like you're just like you know oh my god you know so happy for you know mother's day i love my mother but not as much as i love chili's right like you just come up with some way to like integrate chili's in and so i don't know if you've seen this but i i actually me and ben talked about this once we go when we were like trying to build up uh my brand it was like all right i got this podcast is brand new i got a twitter it was like you know a few thousand followers at the time it was like what should we do to like build a brand so we did this one like you know two-hour exercise we just looked at people who had good brands we're like what are what are people what's some common things that they do and one of the things we found was that a lot of people had early on in the tech industry like uh or like sorry like early on not early on the tech industry that's like in the 70s or some [ __ ] but like early on when i got into tech i was following some people on twitter and um and i saw this guy ryan hoover and he seemed like he was blogging he started this thing called product hunt but ryan would always it was always phil's coffee and lacroix like he would always talk about phil's coffee and lacroix and in fact like lacroix kind of became like a startup meme i really give ryan a lot of credit for it because he was always talking about lacroix and then when products got popular it just like accelerated the like the lacroix meme in the community as like you know what's like loki great lacroix and like um and so he had lacroix and then i don't know so pop pomp does this thing with dominoes all the time where he's like he'll do like a domino's pizza he always says that like domino's is the best i think and um and he's just like and it's kind of this thing where you get this serious business persona in one way but then you show this like human side and it's like oh i'm just like i love this thing you know i don't know if yours would be like topo chico or something like that like you used to like kind of pip those out michael's got chili's we got to make ours cheesecake factory yeah like i was like chick-fil-a cheesecake factory we need something that's like our stick that's like you can't just be false like you got to genuinely have that love for it the only part that's to stick is that you talk about it and you don't really talk about it's like you're serious serious serious topo chico because it's like you know this makes the cut it's that important to me it's that good it is i'm that big of a fan you're like michael oh yeah we had a great time you know what let me know when you're when you're in austin we'll go out some time for some cheesecake factory and maybe get the chicken piccata we'll have a great time yes that's good is that a menu like page 14 of the menu or 57 skinny-licious menu so i think i think when you pick this thing the thing i would recommend it's got to be something that's well okay so here's the story for you so i'm 25 years old and i'm finally figuring out how to talk to women in my life like it's like i had not figured it out at this point and so my buddy and i decided to start going to parties and we would dress up in suits and this is like when everybody's like dressed in like grunge like in san francisco like so it didn't work so we'd show up dressed in these fancy suits and it was just odd enough that the women would be like why are you guys doing this like it's just it's just slightly odd right and so i think you need to figure talking what's it called peacocking yeah okay i could have been one of those like uh with the pickup artist guys who who needs to do this holdco stuff i could be a pickup artist i have i could not do that anyway uh i don't i don't like hair gel enough but anyway the um i think you got to figure out something that's just a little bit odd you're like why does this like technology entrepreneur in san antonio like chili so much so if the cheesecake factory is that i think you're good but whatever it is it's got to be just a little like that they're like why are they why why are they wearing suits to this party like what's going on they can't be cool yeah that's the first thing it can't be cool because if you're just trying to say something fad that like everybody thinks is cool now you're just hopping on a bandwagon you're actually you have to say something that's actually not so cool like for me like the genuine one would be cinnabon like i [ __ ] love cinnabon nobody even thinks about cinnabon so that's the corner for cinnabon is open i can take that corner you know that's a that's a piece on it's a piece of land on the board that nobody's touching right now i could just pick that up for cheap and but the people who but people do know it it's kind of nostalgic and it gives people something to like something that they can gift you someplace they can offer to take you someplace that every time they go there or see one they will think of you like every time i drive by chili's god damn it i think of michael gurdley right and it's like same thing with lacroix and ryan hoover it's like they own that mental real estate in my mind and so sam we could do that with cheesecake factory we could just every time someone sees it they see us you definitely should do that that's a great idea all right thanks for coming on man wait wait he's got problems himself what's on twitter sick well thank you thank you for coming on that was awesome [Music] you

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
i read something very interesting that ftx as a you know 30 billion company only has um like 200 employees or something like that and i believe you you know for the first year the product was built by just two engineers and even now you only have sub 20 sub 30 engineers a is that true and b what the hell is going on like do you is ftx he's like he's like i can only think of one of two things either ftx is simply like you have a unique set of problems so you could do you can operate your business differently or the rest of us are doing this completely wrong which is it and um and he goes the latter [Music] what up birthday boy thank you what's good how's it going uh it's going okay i um you know a little bit i was gonna sing to you you facetimed me i facetimed you earlier oh i'm sorry i didn't even get the notification i was uh i had to personalize but uh you did miss out on what would have been a good serenade actually can i tell you a funny story about that wait was your kids there no it was just me and ben um oh man what a bummer i'd rather see your kids though i've got baby fever oh nice yeah well actually my son was there but you know before the age of like two they're kind of just like an inanimate of an object that you just carry around i was working out and when i work out i put my phone on like focus mode or whatever so i'm sorry but thank you swole mode so uh how old are you now 33 33 okay you're getting up there too all right i like it uh so you're i think a year younger than me we um i was at a birthday party uh like two weekends ago i had to leave the house it was crazy and we get there and this guy did this thing that i saw and i was like oh what an amazing little life hack he basically had so it's like some kid's birthday party they sing happy birthday it's time to blow out the candles and cut the cake and the guy grabs the mic and he's like hold on hold on we got a special birthday song for you and this guy apparently because my wife knows him she's like oh my god he's doing it he always does this and it's like he has his own version of happy birthday that he sings but it's not like a singing thing it's more like um like he's indian so it's kind of like an indie vibe to it but let's just pretend it's sort of like when i say happy you say birthday happy and everyone was like birthday happy birthday he's like he's like i always love all those of course it's like you know there's something in my body that just i can't help but become like you know the the the follow the leader during that moment and he'll be like you know who's the birthday boy sam sam sam right it's like it'll make you feel good and then um and i was like what a life hack to just be the life of the party is to simply have a cool version of happy birthday that you can do uh that's amazing that's like having a joke that just always kills so listen to this i've got this friend named and jonathan we'll get we'll get to the sameer thing in a second but i have this friend named nick ray uh sean do you know who nick ray is i know of him i don't know i don't think i've ever met him but i've seen his like his like website and like you've told me about him and uh he looks like he's like an entrepreneur but he kind of looks a little bit slick i don't know who he is so i i call him grown-up dennis the menace because he looks like a 40 year old dennis the menace like if you think of like what dennis diminished would look like when he's 40 that's like a dick he had a company called uh he had one business that was like it worked it was the aviation industry sold it then he started this thing called museum hack which was like you pay like 25 or something like that um and you get a group museum tour like a private museum tour whatever he sold it and then he loves hosting parties so much that i believe he used scribed like you did and he wrote a book on how to host the perfect two-hour evening party and this guy yes i'll i'll try to find the the title have you read it it just came out like two days ago and he just sent me a copy it's called the here i'll find it but it uh it's like uh it's like how to host the perfect cocktail party and this guy whenever he hosts parties he brings name tags to all every time you're with him he has a name tag a kite a frisbee and a blanket i'm telling you this guy's like a 12 year old that's like growing up dennis the menace because he's just like he's like these are the best things to bring to like a park party and uh they just it just works and so he brings this to like all of his parties and it's hilarious i bring the rule book to the game red rover and it's a great icebreaker to play the game red rover it's been working since preschool and he brings like a harmonica and when he goes he'll like play the harmonica and he goes all right everyone come to the circle and he like does these icebreakers it's hilarious so the book is called uh the two hour cocktail party and it's just a book on hosting a two-hour cocktail party he's been working on it for like two years so give him a shout out but i actually wasn't i'm only bringing this up because we were talking about hosting the perfect party and everything it's hilarious and it's like might actually become like a brand around host it's like you know like maria condo made like putting your clothes away into like a martha stewart's dies business that's what this guy might be doing like a cocktail party oh wow okay so i have three instant reactions to this number one what a great idea what a great idea because when you first said it i laughed which to me already means this is kind of remarkable as a product meaning you you had to remark on it it was worth telling so that's already like a good thing second thing is it's actually a real problem like nobody teaches you how to do things in life that are life stuff and so if you can hone in on a piece of life stuff like you know the classic example is like you know the book the game which is like you know about how to like pick up women like how do you approach a stranger that you're interested in and like you know can you get a date and like we all laugh and say oh man that's so uh you know people will sort of point at it be like you know the sort of a loser thing right in reality best-selling book it was one of the best books i've ever read um and like really helpful a lot of people who literally don't know how to navigate this social situation that they get put in yeah i dude i think it's awesome yeah so by the way look at the link i sent you i sent the link in riverside and i didn't realize this but look at the reviews the reviews are all of our friends so it's nick huber it's kat from best self it's ben the guy who uh i think he started uh what's that group on deck sarah and then david your wife is she on there she might be here yeah it could be her and then david perell's on there they're all like the isn't that hilarious they're all like they're reviewers or whatever uh i don't know yeah i agree it's a pretty pretty funny niche to own so my first thought is it's actually what a great idea helping people know how to host a party just like fun in a box it's like look you don't have to be creative and you don't have to have experience doing this like i will help you know the like three or four things that will make you look awesome when you do this i think that's kind of great second reaction what a terrible idea why is this a book why isn't this a twitter thread like if there's ever a thing which is like this book could have been an email um like this book could have been an email i guarantee it so that's my second reaction to this it's just like love the idea of creating a brand and content on this topic the book wow overkill like it's a book takes more than two hours to read uh like the book shouldn't be longer than the full party would be in this case i i kind of agree with you but i think you have to forget that most people don't have charisma and although i think i definitely have like a little social anxiety i think you do too like i don't like leaving my house that often i don't want to like talk to like strangers that often but like i could like i can turn it on and be like all right fine i'm in that mode uh i think most people like all of our like nerdy ass friends i just don't think they just like stand around like what do i do with my hands like they don't know like where to hold their hands they don't know anything that's amazing actually dude i i still remember so i've been to a bunch of like startup events i was in this accelerator called the mass challenge back in the day it's like a boston based like startup accelerator i don't even know how i ended up there and i've heard i would say at this point in my life i've heard at least 500 in person like talks to entrepreneurs okay 500. if you know what's the most memorable one it was this guy this old school guy who came he was probably in his late 60s and he's like he did two things the first one was he goes all right um you guys are all entrepreneurs somebody stand up and pitch me your business tell me what your business does and somebody would stand up they'd be like hey we uh i'll go i'll go right it's like a bravery contest i'll go a thousand hands go up because he's entrepreneurs you got it you got to be the one who's like courageous so every raise your hand pick the first guy um sam i hope you know i'm ceo of the hustle we're a media company for millennials who love to learn about business no you're not actually i forgot the very first thing the best part of the whole thing is he started the talk from the back of the room and he was like he's like and everybody's looking at the stage all the chairs face one way right and he's like i'm back here entrepreneurship you gotta adjust that was the first time it's like you know dodgeball whatever you want to so this guy was like that guy and he's like i'm in the back of the room what are you gonna do and he's like uh he's like all of a sudden you gotta adjust turn your seat around are you stuck to the ways that the society works are you just gonna do what makes sense and so that's how he started then he goes and he's like picture business and if if you just said like i'm sean um you know we're the milk road we uh you know we we're a uh a web3 focused uh newsletter that does no he would just cut you off but he wouldn't tell you what you're doing wrong and his process of elimination everyone is trying one thing and then finally some guy said it right he goes we're smart shade um you know when you're in a room and it's too bright through the window we help you make sure that you have a shade on there that doesn't make your room look ugly and the guy was like yes that's exactly right you explain the situation and you use the key word help your business exists to help someone do something help someone get some outcome some benefit he's like all of you guys think you're entrepreneurs and you couldn't tell me who you're helping do what and then we're all like oh we're like reeling and then he transitioned into he goes put up a diagram of a of a meeting room of a bunch of six chair table or like an eight chair table it goes biggest meeting of your life where do you sit hey smart trade guy where do you sit [Laughter] the chairs had numbers on them and you're like three and he's like no he's like you sit in chair two it's the corner of the table so you're not the head of the table but you're the corner of the table you have like you know sort of like 80 of the visibility as the head of the table but you now have both angles you're kind of at the wide angle where people can see you and talk to you and then he showed another diagram of like another a round table where do you sit at a round table if this is the door where do you go sit uh then he's like you have five minutes before the uh your meeting is about to start in 10 minutes not everybody's there you have 10 minutes to talk to the number two person what do you say and he was like giving these like real world social and businesses around i don't remember that was like you know uh you you go to the other you basically go like i don't know it's like you don't have your back to the door you kind of have a side-facing uh thing to the door you don't want to be directly facing the door because then you're like a little child sitting in your seat waiting for the teacher to come back like you know you do that and like in your small talk thing he's like do you talk about the weather in sports no uh he's like you've done already eight hours of research on this person you already know abcde and you were going to bring up this topic and so this guy was like so opinionated so crazy but i remember it because he was answering things that i felt like nobody had instructed me how to do and it was the where do i what do i do with my hands while i talk problem which is like i definitely run into these situations and i've received zero guidance in my life on what i'm supposed to do and if you have like the solution in a box i'll take it that's interesting well nick's going to freaking love that because uh you know like cocktails parties is such a niche thing but he'll probably do well he's pretty successful um so we want to talk about colin sameer jonathan so colin sameer that episode went live on youtube people probably noticed john so we have it's shawn and me and ben typically and jonathan most of the time is actually on air i actually don't know jonathan why you're on air like why you're here but i know what you do as a job you grow the podcast but i don't know like why you actually need to be sitting here why why do you stay here um one because this is fun and two this is the only time i can get like face time with y'all to talk about these types of things so it's like my only time i can actually carve out time on yale's calendar our calendar we are the issue he slacks us he asks us to do stuff and we just never respond like yeah it makes perfect sense it's like you know oh why did you open the sushi restaurant because like because i knew you loved sushi and i just needed to get your approval on these three things like damn we're that much of an [ __ ] sorry sorry jonathan i apologize that we are not very responsive in general and so he came on and you said you said hey talk about the colin smear thing because a it was interesting and what was the b um i think there's just like some good takeaways that we should probably implement into our youtube channel youtube and the podcast as well um but first of all i've hosted a nick grey party and it was awesome and like like you just described sean like there's so much nuance to you know like hosting a good meeting and like where you sit and how the experience is for everyone else and so you kind of do need a book to like piece all that together chapter one here's the pre you know party stuff and all that but yeah email templates and all that stuff are kind of necessary and all that wait wait wait wait wait wait you said you hosted a nick great party what does that mean you you did his method or you attended a party dude he's like famous he he did like a beta launch for his book and so a few people myself included hosted one of like the beta parties wow wow wow this is you're blowing my mind right now hold on wow holy [ __ ] dude he's like famous in austin it's hilarious which by the way we gotta give him a proper shout out so it's nick gray g-r-a-y i believe his website is nickray.net so if you want to go and learn whatever go ahead so you were like a pilot for this thing first of all how much of a friggin early adopter are you that you like knew about a book that's not even written yet and you were like i'll be one of your test cases to test your your party thing okay wait give us the rundown give me like one or two of the golden nuggets that like you wouldn't otherwise have done at a party that nick kind of like helped you try out yeah well so nick everyone just kind of knows nick and austin if if you're kind of running in the same circles and so i went to another guy who hosted a nick gray party and i was like this is awesome and so and i knew the guy so i was like let's co-host the next one and we had it at my house i got like a backyard and everything um and so the takeaways were i went i bought a house uh i got ready for this uh yeah we got pizza and it was just it reminded me of kind of like a prom party just to begin with but the pieces that were uh kind of crucial are the one like the icebreakers so like you start the night with like you know everyone's getting their drinks and getting comfortable and stuff like that and then you blow the harmonica or whatever you're like you play you strap the banjo or whatever it is you strum the banjo and you get everyone's attention be like hey we're doing icebreakers say your name and then like the fun fact would be like what was the first thing you did for money and so it kind of gets people like you know to get a little bit deeper and then that can lead into the next conversation and so on and so forth so there's like two or three of those throughout the night and then you know it's just like the email before the email after and like how you nurture those people i guess and like actually you know connect them and all the little things like that but i feel like there's like a bunch of little hacks like emailing is part of this template i didn't even think about an email as part of the experience dude he's got a whole [ __ ] about it and the funny thing about nick is he's like he's very flamboyant like he's like gregarious but he's like loud and a lot of people think that he's gay and he gets more girls than anyone i've ever met and it's mostly because of this party this party stuff he like he like dates so many like well i i won't say that i'll say girls love him women love this guy and uh partially because it's called straight up gay [Laughter] he kills it this guy is very interesting that's another huge thing about this is like when you become the connector when you're hosting these parties like once a month or once a quarter like that's really valuable when you're able to like kind of be that person they're like oh i'm gonna reach out to jonathan because he knows x y and z or whatever so that's like kind of what you did in san francisco i feel like with the hustle meetups right yeah it is a hack it totally works and sean did the same thing because we hosted like all of our events at his house like at his office so he was like my proxy was like the man dude so i know we probably have other things to talk about but i'm so mind blown by this and i just have so much more that i need to know okay so uh give me okay so give me something that is you wouldn't um expect it right like let's say uh maybe like i don't know okay like email kind of counts the harmonic is a great example of this like have a little instrument that will help get people's attention and like you know just kind of like lightens the mood a little bit by just hearing it's like you know great sound give me another one let me give one jonathan he hosted a party one time called a petting zoo party and he hired like a mobile petting zoo for like 400 or i don't even know what it was but it wasn't like a big deal and it like was the most fun at a party i just sat around and petted like rabbits and like guinea pigs and it was awesome so he like does themes like then he'll have a dinosaur theme where you wear like dinosaur themed clothing which i don't know what that means but what else jonathan what else does he do again i've only been to like one or two but it's if it's not that like you really don't need to put a theme around it if you're just doing something super simple like i did but like if you want to make it a little more memorable like yeah i feel like he's done like uh he just did a paddle board thing where like everyone went out to like austin and were on their paddle boards and like did a whole thing there and he had a thing where he gave numbers he gave a whiteboard to three different people and he said we're having a diving contest so the best the person who has the best cannonball off of their paddleboard and he he goes the contestants are and he had already planned he goes there this person this person and this person you guys get up front and do your cannonball and we're all gonna and these three judges are gonna give you a review the second or third thing that he does is he has a very specific end time to the party so he goes come on over the party's gonna end at eight o'clock at eight o'clock he goes all right everyone thank you for coming the party's over you don't gotta get you don't gotta go home but you gotta get out of here and he's like parties need an end otherwise they drag on for too long people don't wanna go anymore and so he always has an ending to his parties which is actually pretty great because i go because i'm like i don't got to sneak out like it's going to end at a very particular time so two hour cocked up on it dude we uh okay i don't know if we're oprah but i feel like we just sold the [ __ ] out of this book like uh you know this this guy he's gonna get a lot of sales from this uh from this this plug because this was incredible but honestly i'm genuinely interested in this topic uh you know i had heard something once like um charity water is kind of known for their events and they raise a ton of money for charity and like most charity events are kind of the same old stale like dinner gala you sort of go it's sort of a drag in charity waters events you feel like you're you know you feel like you're at some like hollywood party basically and it's not because they spend more money it's like they're just more creative with like the way that they they like create memorable things and so and every year they top themselves which is like this impossible standard it's like last year the super bowl halftime show was this this year's gotta be even bigger that's how they treat their annual events and they raise like i don't know 75 million dollars in a night doing that and that funds clean water for a lot of people and i remember asking scott i go well so what's like how do you think about these events like how do you everybody always graves about these i've never been to one what is the secret sauce like how do you guys think about this and he goes oh that's my wife victoria that's her her thing he goes she has this phrase which is um it's about the moments in between the moments like it's the moments between the moments that matter and so it's like everybody thinks of when they planned their event okay for dinner we're gonna do this and then for the dancing we're gonna do this but they don't think about the like 20-minute period right before dinner when it's like getting set up or served and like the the five-minute walk between this place to this place or whatever and if you do something there people feel like wow i'm having a like a 10 out of 10 experience because they thought of everything like they thought of like i know for charity water it was like they really thought about like the walk between um like where the cocktail hour was and the dinner and they were like okay yeah you could just like traverse through this like you know hallway but like what can we do in the hallway that will like send the message and they basically created like i don't know like a visual light show of like i don't know a woman in africa a real woman she starts when you start and she's carrying these like 60 pound gallons of water and there's one on the you see her carrying it and then 15 steps in there's one sitting on the ground that you could pick up and you could try carrying and by the end of it you've had like it's like dang that was heavy and that was hard and i only walked 54 steps she does that for three hours a day just to get clean water for her family and you're like are you likely to donate by the end of that yeah right it's like but they just used the hallway as this by the way i made up this exact example because i didn't go to the event but like that was a really good example that was great yeah i had to put the disclaimer because i was like damn i just made up a really vivid ass lie about what they did at their event and like scott's big on integrity so let me be clear that's not exactly what happened that's what i kind of remember from him telling me while we were drunk six years ago and he was telling me like what he did um so so yeah but if the moments between the moments is just a good uh like phrase to remember when you're gonna host an event i might write my own book [ __ ] you nick ray [Laughter] all right let's talk about colin and samir so these these guys came on they're like these youtube i don't exactly know how you describe them but they're popular on youtube and uh people seem to like it in the comments you know my takeaway was sean do you think being a youtuber is a good life or not i can't decide actually i think it's a good life the way they did it so that the daily vlogger style i think is a is a tough one and i think the uh like gaming streamer who's gonna sit in their chair and play video games for seven hours a day every day is not a good no not a bad nor is the mr beast like i have to up my pranks or my stunts like i gotta come up with a new miracle every month or i lose relevance that to me is like stressful and to be fair that's like 75 percent of youtube success is like daily vlogging stunts and pranks or like gaming so you know if you're not that good for you colin and samir for example not in that they're an interview show that's like paced out well they do you know like whatever one or two a week or something like that it's not as treadmilly as other content things what i'm learning about through them what we need to do and what more people should do that woman rebecca uh i keep calling her like that woman rebecca texted us and she was like our friend rebecca our friend rebecca sorry rebecca uh she uh told us that this guy she worked with i won't say the name went from zero to eight was it eight million subscribers in eight months or was it like three million and eight i forget the number but i think it was eight million in how many months 12 months like a year a year yeah and all from shorts is that crazy all from freaking youtube shorts i never watch youtube shorts yeah i i i do i actually watch youtube choices but the thing is once i've worked inside a tech company i was like oh i get it like i'm youtube the biggest threat to my company is tick tock every day like you know somebody there's like every every quarterly off site we're hearing about the latest tick tock numbers wow their growth is crazy wow they're blowing us away wow the stars are going there you know like tic tac is your like kind of like main priority if you're one of these big social media companies right now um beyond like you know your core business like if you're gonna think about growth you're gonna think about tick tock and so you release a competitive product shorts and you announce it to the world and you put your best people on it and like you can't let that feature fail right away and so you like you gotta pump the engagement how do you do that you're like all right you know engagement was a 10 out of you know 10 out of 100 okay uh if we put it at the top of every time you open the app it jumps to a 40. okay now we're also going to add it every three scrolls we're gonna add another little shorts banner oh also we're gonna like you know make it one of our we're gonna change our recommendation engine to just recommend a short after a long video and so you you're gonna try to game the system to give yourself the best shot at that feature becoming successful and so at least in the short term if you're a creator you say oh their priority is pushing like you know oh instagram's priority was pushing stories and then reels then i'm gonna make great reels and stories because that's what they're pushing right now that's what the algorithm wants to they're gonna they're gonna favor that in the ui and the algorithm and so um i'm gonna get faster growth because i'm sort of like piggybacking off of their priorities and i think that's actually a really good strategy for like if you and i or uh my first million wanted to get popular on youtube is just like exploit the ego of the social media platform like it totally works just just give them exactly what they want and not always but sometimes they'll give you exactly what you want which is you know more followers but are we going to do it maybe it's clearly a good idea that we may or may not execute on just hilarious thing that i saw so uh there was like some page that's like uh you know like there's like meme pages on instagram that get like a bunch of followers so it's like i had like friday beers i think this is what it was this is like friday's i follow so many of them yeah they're great they're very humorous they could post great memes whatever so they did a collab with something called like it was the word entrepreneur but it was spelled like super whack because like you know the word entrepreneur is like kind of a whack word in general so it's like android and trainee poor and like that was like the name of the account or something like that and i went i clicked on it and the bio cracked me up so hard it was like cultivating that trillionaire mindset that multi-trillionaire mindset and then the next line was uh mindset is hashtag grindset [Laughter] i have decided that on this podcast our new intro is gonna be about cultivating that multi-trillionaire mindset hashtag grindset and i'm gonna start every single podcast by saying that and somebody who doesn't know what i'm talking about they're gonna be so turned off but the people who i listen to this podcast are gonna know that that is the funniest thing ever because it is that's amazing what we're saying jonathan um i i love that they always also say they always also say uh read that again like they'll do the post and then all the copy and then it's like read that again yeah all right guys that's the show listen to that again go back you know what you got to do now rewind for the two time double time get double get triple trillion our mindset hashtag great set go back and listen again what was that phrase the latest post says read that again their latest post says you keep your money in the bank i keep my fish in the tank think about it like you know we named this my first million and the reason we get flack for that and the reason we give ourselves grief for that is because my first million is in the middle it's like neither um it's not like trying to be humble and like um you know thoughtful about life it's like no you want to make a million dollars but it's only a million when you say we're you know we're all about that trillionaire lifestyle you you all of a sudden you it's like hey we are not trying to be that guy who's trying to sell you a dream of making a billion dollars and so i think i realized the mistake in the name the name should not have been million uh the whole brand should have been my first trillion mindset it should have been my first trillion we're a community we're a community of future multi-trillionaires uh who gather around you know to trade stories our software is the worst have you heard of hubspot see most crms are a cobble together mess but hubspot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous i think i love our new crm our software is the best hubspot grow better where do you want to go from here did you have anything on did you have do you have topics i've got one or two do you have any i have a couple uh what do you have i have a couple i have a couple good ones okay so what do you want to do you want to do okay i'll give you three options a really interesting uh thing i heard that i i want to get your opinion on like like a thing about how a company we a big famous company runs their company i thought was kind of mind blowing number two is an idea that i don't really even understand as i don't know what the hell they're doing but maybe it's cool and then um the third is uh you know random business idea which which one would you like to go through number one number one okay so the interesting okay so we uh so the milk road our main sponsor right now is ftx and i don't know if you like do you know what ftx is dude in my on my topics i have a thing about how they run their company and how it's weird go ahead yeah okay so that's probably the same thing is it about how many employees they have and how many engineers yes look at the dock i have the exact same topic go ahead okay so so it recently so we we were like as part of the sponsorship it's like okay we tell people you know hey ftx is a great trading platform blah blah blah and in addition we were like hey we want to do a deep dive on you guys and i was like but here's the thing you don't get to tell us what to write about i'm gonna like i'm gonna talk to your head of strategy i'll talk to whoever and um whatever's the most interesting thing to me that's what we're gonna do the deep dive on and so i ended up doing it on um like the the like kind of like the seven like growth hacky strategies that they used to grow because they went from zero to a 30 billion dollar company in like three years and so i thought that was kind of amazing i wrote the whole thing obviously and then i discovered i discovered something even more amazing which is that they built the whole they built like for the first year or something they had two engineers and even now to this day they have like i think 25 to 30 uh software engineers and they're amazing i think and i think they only have 250 people yeah exactly and so he did this um he went uh this the guy sam baker freed he did this talk at the sewn conference and so sone i don't know if people know it's spelled s-o-h-n it's like this big kind of like economic uh annual conference or whatever and what happens is the big show like sam sam bakeman freed is the 29 year old like 20 or 30 billion dollar fountain roll he was before the crash but like decca billionaire guy uh and he started this coinbase competitor which is called ftx after he got rich in bitcoin yeah it's a platform for people to trade uh crypto and now stocks and other things but basically he he talks there and if you've ever watched these i don't have you ever watched other sewn conference talks they're very interesting to go go back and look because you get the it's the bit it's like a ted talk for it's ted but just for like um invest investors uh just for like finance and wall street people so like bill ackman will go on there and you can look at his old videos by the way if you go watch these so here's what here's my journey i'm like bill like my man this guy's really smart and our buddy andrew wilkinson loves bill ackman says he's the best and um and i go back and i'll go look for old youtube videos of bill actually i see his own conference talking it's like i don't know 10 years ago and he goes on and he talks about um what's the name of the it's like the howard hughes company there's like it's like a home builder uh tool like powerbit or something yeah i know you're talking about no i think i think it's called the howard use companies basically like whatever that famous guy howard hughes or whatever and he's got this company they build homes and he'll give a talk so what you do is you go give a talk about like a thesis that you are really bullish on and basically like a big bet you're making or you've already made basically and you go pitch your case for that bet and this kind of has like two fold effects one if you're in the audience you get ideas on investments um like you know why this person's so bullish on this thing it's it's interesting to hear the case two it's only like the who's who that talk like it's like the top top guys um and that go and talk at this thing and then the third thing is that like you um for the speaker they get to kind of like build their brand but they also get to pump their bags so like they've already made this bet then they go talk here they get a bunch of retention bunch of other people going to invest in it and it might cause the price to go up which is like a good thing for them so they're helping propagate the narrative that helps their their case so anyways you go hear him talk by the end of the 40 minutes you're like there's never been a better investment on earth than the howard hughes company right like you're like so convinced because these guys are very convincing and they have a great track record so you're like wow whatever now if you actually go look at the results it's like i remember chamoth went and spoke and he talked about how box like box.com is like like of all the tech companies we have identified one winner that is going to benefit the most from this cloud movement and ai ml and its box and you go look at the stock chart for box since that day uh it's like down and to the right you know what i mean it's like it has not done well uh but they they put together very convincing cases and of course occasionally they're they're correct so anyways at this year's zone there was a really interesting talk which was sam bankman freed talks to i think patrick or john collison what the patrick hollison's the one of the brothers who started stripe red head or whatever uh the redhead one i think they're are they not popular no patrick they both actually did interviews one interviewed stanley druckenmiller awesome interview go watch it that was the other brother the other one interviewed sam and first of all the one thing that stood out is kind of like um when you watch these guys do an interview it's basically like what if you had like a world-class brain become a podcaster for like you know like like i'm talking world class like these guys are some of the smartest most well-read best executors most like most well-connected people on the planet or they're the company they see everything they were millionaires at like i don't know seven they built cool [ __ ] at 17 that like they sold for a million dollars or whatever there's now they built like 100 billion dollar company and they're like the best of the best like they're the best yc founders and yc is the best group of founders right so they're amazing and you hear them give an interview they hear their talks and how they frame questions that alone is like worth the price of admission just to see that but then they ask questions and there so he asked a question to sam bakeman free he goes i read something very interesting that ftx as a you know 30 billion company only has um like 200 employees or something like that and i believe you you know for the first year the product was built by just two engineers and even now you only have sub 20 sub 30 engineers a is that true and b what the hell is going on like do you is ftx he's like either he's like i can only think of one of two things either ftx is simply like you have a unique set of problems so you could do you can operate your business differently or the rest of us are doing this completely wrong which is it and um and he goes the latter that's a really good way to frame a question exactly and so he goes uh he goes i i he laughs he's like i think it's the latter and he goes you know um we he's like more i looked at tech companies i like you know facebook google successful tech companies i i think i don't know for sure i can't say like you know i don't know their exact business but from what i can gather uh they they employ an order of magnitude more people than they need to you know and he's like how many he's like how many people do you think facebook would have optimally uh and he's like you know he's like he's like i don't know if let's say they have 50 000 employees um you know that's somewhere between you know like um five to thirty times too many and like and so uh you know it's kind of shocking to hear this and it's something i liked it because i've believed this for a long time which is that you um like most tech companies are completely over hired i've told this story before which is that when i interviewed at twitch for our acquisition uh they did the you know the part of the interview is they at the end of the interview they you know hey do you have any questions for us and this is my first one how many employees does twitch have 1800 2000 how many do you think is the right number for twitch like what do you think is is how many people do you guys actually need to be like firing on all cylinders and like i would get basically three reactions the first was sort of like just like shock like what are you even saying and are you insinuating that like i shouldn't be here or like we shouldn't hire you or that we hired too many people we don't know what we're doing like you know the people were just like what i don't get what you're getting at but it's not good whatever you're getting it's not no matter what interpretation i have of this question it's pretty bad um the second was a genuine answer which was like you know uh probably like you know 15 to 20 percent less but we you know you don't know you don't know over time who those top performers are you figure that out and like you know it's good to have buffer and redundancy or whatever and then uh i asked emmett the ceo and he was like i think 2500 and he's like you know because his plan is like to hire and grow and he's like you know he he and like we didn't get into a big debate about it i was just curious what he would say and so what was your reaction to this thing where you found out that ftx has like you know 20 engineers and is running this yeah pretty large tech platform and everybody else has thousands of engineers i think people over hire and so i wrote um a tweet that said you know i'm really fascinated with the idea of just hiring less people who are higher quality and paying them a lot more versus hiring a ton of people and most of them by definition are pretty average and you pay them a medium or market rate i like that idea of doing the first thing but is that actually practical and what are some examples and the reason why i wasn't sure if it was actually practical is like even if you get the highest performing people in a room does it just become natural still whereas like the 80 20 where 20 of the people does 80 of the work and it's just always and i think actually maybe that will actually would still exist but at like a higher caliber and then also i was like i actually understand why you want redundancies i understand why if you rely on five people and three of them quit like you're really screwed but let me give you the and someone tweeted out uh and i found two good examples one example was sam bakeman free with ftx and here's what he said here's the tweet he actually tweeted this out i guess after that talk kind of summarizing his thoughts he goes i've looked into hyper growth companies and time and time again growing from 200 employees to 2 000 doesn't seem to 10x your product per year productivity as a company in fact sometimes it doesn't even one extra productivity sometimes the more you hire the less you get done so why exactly uh is it that hiring doesn't scale the way it should a coordination becomes really hard and b diffusion of responsibility five people could theoretically do something maybe no one will actually feel like they have to get it done and have to do it and then uh he just goes on to say that basically companies hire more uh sorry companies lower the bar as they hire more and over time the average co-worker people an actress becomes a worse experience and incentives become harder to align as people have less and less of a sense of what each person is doing and i completely agree i think that them i don't i'm not smart like these guys where i can actually come up with a number but i think a large percentage of jobs at least in the tech world and i would say most companies are [ __ ] jobs i'd call them [ __ ] jobs and they're only there because the person who's running this particular division has to request more budget and hire more so they get more responsibility and more credit and they seem more important so then when they go to their next company they get paid more and they can climb the ladder because it seems like oh well like you know you manage 200 people you must be legit yeah that's why i think it happens the number of people under you is a is a power consolidation technique inside of large companies and even if people aren't doing it for malicious reasons it it is the incentive like you get it's just the game a larger of a group of people that you can manage and so your incentive is to hire people promote them to managers have them hire people have them promote them to managers and have like layers and layers of people because if you were if you were if everybody got the same budget and then you were just measured on how much you got done and you got to keep the extra i think companies would work wildly differently than they do today right and he says something he goes in that tweet he goes sam says he goes as far as i can tell this is the most common reason that successful companies decay it's a race between how quickly new employees can understand the culture and how quickly people are hired the faster you hire the harder it is to keep everyone on the same page and um you know if you're growing at 50 a year maybe you could still mentor each new recruit and get them you know to learn how you guys work but if you're going 300 a year each employee only has four months to learn before they have to start teaching and meanwhile we you know you have to also figure out how to make sure compensation is fair coordination keeps happening like i remember this inside of uh even a startup even a very small company um when you go from one people to two people generally productivity increases like almost every time um one person to two people is almost always a win two people to three people usually a win but there's usually a cost which is oh now we have to have meetings whereas before like one person the whole project's in your head you don't have to talk to anybody two people like by default you're going to basically share everything with the other everybody because there's only one other person knows everything that's shared once you have three people no longer does everybody know everything that's going on and basically i think there's this rule which is that for every um [Music] for every double of your employee base you square the amount of communication required meaning so if you go from four to eight you don't that doesn't double the communication it forexes the communication or whatever right like uh i don't do my public math there but it's basically like a non-linear like it's a non-nonlinear investment you have to make in communication and coordination and like suddenly it's like oh man we have a 12 person team and like it's really hard to keep everybody on the same page and now i'm having to do extra meetings that are all hands meetings or things like that just to keep 12 people organized now imagine that at 1200 and imagine that of 12 000 miserable it's miserable so the other example by the way that someone i don't know if anyone replied or how i found this but have you heard of the company called stream yard stream yard now they're in your world so go to stream i think it's streamyard.com so they're in like the streaming world are they like canadians uh maybe some easy way it's the easiest way they say to create a professional live stream so okay it gives you like a it's like a broadcasting tool for live streaming okay cool so this guy it was two guys one guy named gage and i don't remember the other guy amazing name gage is the first day yeah gage and dan yeah gage like rode a dirt bike to school when he was a kid and uh yeah this guy's amazing so he um so he started this company with dan and they were basically i think just making it away for like i think it was like twitch folks you know or just like streamers to stream but then eventually they kind of pivoted a little bit so it could be like a professional stream so like i don't know who actually would do a quote professional stream i guess like a company but like it had all these like d it had all these like obviously like yeah so you just make it look cool and really easy well anyway they launched this in 19 or i think even 20 and it was just them two and they got it to 3 million in arr just these two guys then the pandemic hits and in one year they go from 3 million to 30 million annually recurring revenue wow zero outside money just these two guys and when they they eventually sold at the uh so they launched i think in 19 the pandemic hit went in 20 or 21 uh but basically in like one year they went from 3 million to 30 million and then they sold that same year to hop in for 250 million dollars in cash and these two guys owned the whole thing and when they sold they basically scaled the company to 20 million in arr with five people and by the time they sold they had 30 million and they had just hired the seventh person and this whole business was built with just seven people really was built with two or three people and then the second half they were like our customer service was just getting out of control and so we had to have someone manage like an agency who was doing our customer service uh and and they're like it was just like of course they did they kind of were already killing it but they hit a lick with like covid that like was unexpected so that accelerated it but they were doing three million with two guys like a year and a half into the business that's which is amazing for software um but it's a pretty ridiculous it's a pretty ridiculous company you should uh google like what the founders look like i think they're like they look like they're like 28 like they're like kids yeah i'm pretty sure i met these guys at a conference by the way and now that now that i'm seeing their faces um yeah gage and dan but we're gonna call dan dirt so this gage and dirt we're the co-founders of stream yard [Laughter] um yeah i love it this is i mean that's that's an amazing story of like you know right place right time uh you know and being ready to like surf a wave can i tell you like another random business like this that's like yeah just deceptively big so my buddy corey um tweeted this out he was like he's like the uh the high school guy no no this rory levy this is corey nicholson um his thing is corey nceo is his twitter account so uh corey's a good dude he's a real young guy he's like doing an e-commerce thing right now i really like him like he's the one if we were gonna do southern sam's sticky icky this is the guy that run it and he's down to run it we're just waiting on you if you want to run it but like he's a d2c guy who he's really what he's really good at is he's good at building a ddc product and using tick tock to market it and um like that's like his current like niche and um so anyways he goes he goes next time you're stressing over a business idea just remember there's a website that just simply removes the tick tock watermark from a video and receives 37 million monthly visits and has ads everywhere and so it's called it's called sss tik i don't know if you've ever seen this website s-s-s-t-i-k so three s's and then tick wow i'm looking at the traffic now almost 40 million monthly visitors for the last six months straight and it's just plastered with that i don't know i just like you know when you if you cr tick tock is a great way to create videos but it always keeps the tick tock watermark in there and so i guess this is a way to remove the watermark because i'm pretty sure if you post a watermarked video from tiktok onto twitter i always feel like they like have a way to like downvote it you know what i mean so it doesn't get shown yeah is that legitimate i i don't know if it i don't know if it's that i i really don't give twitter that much credit like yeah i don't think they can build a feature that smart but um but i know for facebook i think facebook if you upload a watermark video as an ad because those tick top videos do great as ads um they won't let you run it because it's got a tick tock thing you're basically promoting their competitor right so you have to like get the raw video dude this is crazy i'm looking at the traffic now and so it gets like 40 million a month it looks like around that and they're from every country so united states only makes up uh eight percent of the traffic and then there's like colombia philippines mexico peru peru's the biggest source which is makes up ten percent this is crazy what a crazy business do you think this makes money surely it makes some but you think this is big yeah i think it is by the way okay so i tried to get in touch with this so i don't have the full story on this but um go to you're gonna love this this is like i might be telling you about something like you already know you're gonna be like my cousin started this go to eggcartons.com all right why would my i don't have a cousin would start a cartons.com what is this egg i don't know this this is just a sandbar special right here it's just like did you know there's a business called egg cart so many people think that i'm like i thought you were safe i'm from the midwest so many people think they're like oh like hey i want to go hunting can you like teach me how to hunt like they think that i'm like from like a rural southern area i'm not i don't know anything about that like i i i'm like when you think of they they hear i'm from st louis missouri and they think it's the country i'm like think of detroit that's kind of like where i was raised like that's it's more like detroit than it is are you more like the rural area are you more likely to go bow hunting or get a pedicure dude well neither people from missouri don't get pedicures at least men don't but bow hunting like i only know about bow hunting from like the tv show napoleon dynamite where they talk about like a bow staff like i don't even know like i don't know what bo i've never killed a animal before no i've never done any of that you don't have the you don't have the urge to i definitely do it would be fun to look something in the eye and then consume it i think that would be exciting but anyway okay so back to eggcards.com all right so basically it's just a website that sells like the actual packaging you need for eggs so every form factor of eggs you got the 12 one you got the 24 pack you got the plastic one you got the foam one you got the good for the environment one and i thought this was really interesting because this is this is a multi-million dollar business that just is like wholesale selling packaging for eggs and they just like if you go to the website it's like egg cartons.com call 1-888-852-5340 right and it's like you know when that's in your logo that this business prints cash because it's like oh yeah we got like just this like you know every grocery store in america every corner store in america they just eggcartons.com and they they got my number you know in their phone book and uh it's like the biggest tell and so what was interesting about this is i was like who owns this thing and then if you look up egg cards.com owner you're gonna see um this woman named sarah moore and sarah moore if you go look at her thing it says her linkedin says sarah egg carton and packaging fanatic and she's been doing this for four years and before that she went to harvard business school and so i was like who is this and basically this is somebody who's like an m as a mba private equity type that identified this business that's been around for 20 years and um basically you know like when you know either bought it took it over um or you know did something i don't think it's like her dad is the owner because there's this other guy paul b something who you know was the owner of it for 19 years now he says he's semi-retired but i think she bought it and um i was like wow this is a this is a like fascinating like path to pick uh for somebody who's just like smart and is like you know what i'm gonna go fish where nobody else is fishing instead of going to try to build the next social app or the next crypto thing or the next podcast it's like let me go identify one of these businesses that's like a wholesaler of packaging by the company and then just like you know modernize it and grow it so is this sarah moore from uh massachusetts oh wow are you sure this woman owns so this woman does not look at all like you're going to think of a a carton sales person this is the owner are you like if you look if you look at her picture what look at her picture what's your guess what does this woman do like enterprise sales at salesforce exactly i was gonna say the exact same thing she sells high-end enterprise software or she runs an ad agency or you know like whatever i don't know she's a like uh you know professor and part-time model or something like that right it's like she's crazy she's like a really good-looking harvard person and i would not expect her to do any of this in sutton massachusetts like this is crazy if you look at the guy who's the previous owner you go to his uh linkedin it's like a dude on the like he's got his neck sideways he's on the phone he's like a guy's computer he's like looking up someone took this photo of him and that's the best photo he has of himself yeah his desk has like you know 1970s world series like you know ball from the game he was out yeah and he's got like a marble red in his mouth that's exactly how i would imagine this this is crazy how'd you find this so because i just saw the tweet about the about the egg carton i went down the rabbit hole i found a pdf and it says uh she purchased it in 2017 after her after getting her mba from harvard and um you know now she has a private equity she's that she did that by the way in her 20s so she's got a private equity company that basically does egg cards.com fall harvest products and those both those both serve the egg producing company uh sorry industry and um and king supply which provides plumbing materials to campgrounds and parks and i was like what the hell like who is this person what are they doing and so i by the way i might have some of these wrong because i tried to get in touch with her i emailed her and i just subject line like holy [ __ ] you know first line egg cartons you know like who would have thought this is amazing and i sent her i was like look um you know i want to know more about you but i don't want to schedule time and i for you or for me like here's a google doc like would you mind just answering these questions and so i'm waiting on her to answer these questions now because i have i must know more i must know where so this is her family business like how did she get into this so this like model-looking harvard grad owns an a-cart business she owns a plumbing supplies business is that right and i don't know what a fall harvest what is fall harvest products what do you make when you sell that i think it's also it's also for the egg industry what this is awesome this is a really good find i love sarah moore sarah moore i love women named sarah my wife's name is sarah i love sarah moore he's great it's not where i thought you would go with that one i love a woman named sarah no this woman's awesome i'm a big [ __ ] factor you're right party [Laughter] my wife's name's sarah and there's this woman i admire who like with the harvard and knows it eighth guard business who's also named sarah she's i'm fond of hers founder of uh founder of spanx pants love when pants make you look dinner sarah blakely another great sarah yeah i'm a big fan of this this is a good find why did the person tweet about it uh i don't even know it was like uh what did they say they go i think so the thread was like a kind of a golden thread where it was like boring businesses are the best businesses and um and then somebody uh patrick patrick b johnson said i got one that's even better edcards.com this is a multi-million dollar business and that was the only reply to the threat by the way this wasn't like a popular threat some one guy tweeted that first tweet this guy you dm that guy he knows something it's like a heat-seeking missile yeah he knows something no i didn't reach out to this guy uh he's got like a picture that makes it look a little crazy um and so i was like i don't know i mean like assault you it's on twitter so like okay let me read you his bio this is why i was like uh i want to have a conversation right now beats up indian guys you know here it goes teen vogue is this isn't bile ting teen vogue called me a visionary elite daily called me a genius link in bio then he goes at ramit blocked me is my biggest accomplishment i'm the founder of progress labs okay yeah i wouldn't want to talk to that guy either either he's awesome or he's completely not awesome and i just didn't have the energy to go find out this is a badass fine i'm all about is it egg cartons a cartons.com i'm all about this because if anyone wants to give my birthday gift for you if anyone can find sarah moore so please find sarah moore and uh and tell her to tell her to uh join the pod there's this one woman i don't know if i told you this did you see the tweet where i saw this lady at uh whole foods and i thought it was cool and i just tweeted out a picture no wait what happened so there was this lady giving out samples at whole foods and the sample was called uh i actually don't know what it was jesha j e s h a and uh she it's like a sourdough do you know anything about sourdough bread like i don't know like entirely behind it but it like something involving like it doesn't have yeast or something like something where like it you you actually digest it a little bit easier and it doesn't make you as bloated at least when i eat it because it doesn't have like yeast it like is missing it's a there's one ingredient that's missing that just makes it feel sometimes feel better on your stomach so she made sourdough like mix that you can use for like pancakes and like muffins and [ __ ] like that and i was just talking and i just like went to the whole foods and i saw her i was like oh let me try some of this i was like this is great is this your business she's like yeah i just started it like six months ago and i just cold emailed someone at whole foods asking if we could sell in the store and they said yeah and now they're stacking it on all the shelves i was like oh wow that's a pretty good story uh you know what's your background she's like oh i just worked at a fintech startup for a bunch of years and i just always wanted to do this and i just saved up a little bit of money and i quit and i just launched it and i cold emailed them and i just kind of figured it out and i just tweeted that one tweet it was it was a picture of her and it was like you know worked on fintech quit uh started this in six months got the whole food just cold emailed someone and uh it got read by like two million people that tweet and she like me and i have no idea who she was i didn't even like know her handle and she like somehow i i at the end of the tweet i was like if you know who she is send this to her and you know she'll like know where all the sales came from apparently she like knocked it out the park with sales um all from just this one little tweet and then i did the same thing with a pool company trek pools and they sold a [ __ ] ton of pools i like from from this mention it's kind of funny just uh these silly little tweets actually move the needle for people so you're saying if you're out there and you'd like your needle moved your boys are available for hiring bribes actually not even for hire just bribes yeah just money send us awesome stuff or cash in some kind of briefcase and we will move the needle for you needle movers yeah one eight hundred five five hundred move my needle [Laughter] all right that's the episode i think hey we're just a couple of needle movers cultivating that multi-trillionaire mindset hashtag grindset [Music] you

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
i am trying to be intentionally out of touch in the same way that i intentionally avoid the news [Music] all right we're live what's going on well yeah well sam yeah yeah you're my first million has become my first hundred thousand yeah your first my last million yeah on a good day what um you took something out of the milk road i texted you this but you didn't reply you so in the milk road my favorite part was you had what was the starting amount a million or 500 or what was it you had your portfolio it was actually a little bit less it was 950 000. so 950 000 portfolio and every day you would say what it's at compared to what it was you took it out what's it at now correct why'd you take it out uh i don't even want to look we took out the prices today because uh or what do we do we today we did a little different thing so the crypto prices crashed over the weekend and so we were like okay people are definitely going to want to know like what's happening happening all that stuff so no not saturday uh monday we sent it today um no you sent a weekend weekend version yeah that was just a different that was just like a special edition yeah that was that was nothing um today we sent like uh why is crypto crashing the weekend one was about jack dorsey because jack dorsey announced something called web5 and we were like which is hilarious it's just like a hilarious thing because it's like web people are debating it is even a thing and like he just skipped web 4 and went straight to web 5 and like you know people like what the hell is this so we explained what the hell is this that's what the weekend one was but today uh crypto's down like 20 or something crazy um like if the room is is like i don't know thousand dollars or something like that right now um so yeah dude it's brutal uh the million dollar portfolio we basically started this right when i started the milk road i was like what will be entertaining to get people hooked to subscribe and i was like oh i know i'll put up a million dollars and i'll say watch i will publicly invest this money and let's try to turn it into 10 million it became a mission turning 1 million into 10 million through crypto investing and to be honest we didn't even do that much uh we didn't even make very many moves like it just started with a million dollars worth of eth and i think we made like two investments maybe uh since then just because i've been busy with the milk like building the milk road and like the podcast and my other business and stuff like that it's not like i've been super active but um eth is down like 66 and all of crypto is down like that or worse and so uh the portfolio is brutal it's like you know a million dollars is currently 250 or 300 thousand dollars is my guess uh based on where we're at where's your head at are you freaking out or are you still calm like you always are uh i'm still calm yeah so so this is it's a funny little like story i guess um i don't know why i said it's funny there's actually no humor at all in it it's interesting how how i feel about it um ben flew in so ben flew in last night not producer ben business partner ben so business partner ben flies in last night where he's gonna be here for the week we're gonna like work on a bunch of stuff and like basically like you know from the time he took off the time he landed like our whole business has changed and what has changed is basically like well aside from our own personal net worths uh you know going down and the milk road public portfolio going down like we have just entered uh like the whole economy has entered a recession and crypto has entered for sure like a big downswing bear market crash whatever you want to call it and it's good it's not going to like just bounce right back and all is going to be like fun and dandy again like if you think about this time last year i'm not this time last year but let's say like six to 12 months ago it felt like money was raining from the skies like you know i i invested in a bunch of tech stocks everything was up every day everything was up zoom is tripled in price and amazon is up because everybody's ordering all their [ __ ] online and like every company that we invested in private startup was like raising money at crazy valuations and literally like there's a phrase of money raining on fools money was raining on fools and like nfts were selling you know nfts were selling for ridiculous prices and it's so crazy that like you know on a dime uh it feels like the whole world has changed and everybody's mindset mentality has also changed which is that like now it feels almost impossible to make money it's like well where do i go make money this stock market is down brutally um crypto is crashed uh every business is now laying off people or freezing hiring um on top of that you know at companies are cutting their budgets and ad spend so if you're if your business relied on ads you know that's getting cut and so now you know our money was raining and now money's being drained from from smart people too you're seeing advertisers run i tweeted out like what's going on in the ad world because i'm not in it anymore you're seeing it go away i'm not this fast but yeah like you know the first uh shooter drop was like kind of like consumer brands like d2c brands and whatnot they were the first i would say the last three months to start like reducing spending whereas before it was like how do i spend more and then there was like companies that are like well it's hard to have a big ad budget when you're laying off a bunch of people so there now that they went into hiring freezes or layoffs their ad budgets are certainly tightening up we don't see it this month like this month's an all-time high and ad revenue but like i'm sure in the next three months that ad budgets are going to constrict they'd be crazy not to um in our ecommerce business we see sales like this month is good but you could see the tightening happening where it's like you know people just are you know they're not getting stemi checks that they can go spend on you know you know um electronics and toys and and clothes and and all this good stuff and so consumers are start slowing down their their spending and so it's like and all these things are interlinked right like because when the consumer spends less the business makes less money then it has less money to hire less money to advertise and then the platforms get less revenue and then they do the same thing and it's all just interconnected right so this is interesting to me because i have not lived through a bear market as a founder or investor right like 2008 i was a sophomore in college or something like that right like i don't know you would probably say you're like a yeah freshman or sophomore in college i graduated i graduated high school in 08 so basically this is our first time as like money earning professionals that we've experienced anything like this yeah dude it is so i'll give you kind of my my mentality because you said like are you freaking out my mentality was like definitely i've had thoughts of like oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] but then i sort of like well the thought can arise but i'm not like consumed by it like i definitely had like a day where i was like kept checking prices kept doom-scrolling twitter but like i don't know if i pride myself on like you know my mental fitness that's like well this is the time to be fit it's like when stuff that's hard happens this is the time to use all those tools you've been building up all those muscles you've been building about like seeing things in a way that actually serves you and so for me i'm like immediately i'll show you this thing so ben flies in and last night at midnight we're basically he was sitting in my office and we we wrote this thing at the top i don't know if you can see this is like unfocused but it says like how a loser's brain would work right now lose your brain it's like lose your brain says this we all like you know like rich dad poor dad yeah in my head i have this thing called lose your brain winter brain it's like a loser's brain will bring these thoughts up and bring its attention to these things and a winner's brain will have these like so we basically wrote down all the scary thoughts it's like uh you know and so i was like ben just rattle them off so i'll read you some of these if you're interested but like uh well all right but we did this exercise in order to reframe our thinking everything that i think about right now and i've been i'm calm about it because i i've alwa i'm you everyone gives me a hard time that i'm conservative and it's kind of working out right now but even still i'm down a huge amount um and my fear is always rooted in like i'm gonna run out i'm like i'm i'm homeless do you have those fears of like i'm i'm gonna run out no um because if i actu if i asked you do you actually think you're gonna run out no but there's no way you sampler think you're gonna go broke which is the combination of you got a lot of money still and secondly you always have like your core skill is the ability to make and sell products that people are going to want well i'm not saying how do you ever just i'm not saying it's logical i'm saying like it's like my fear of flying i understand that like i'm i'm far more likely to fall off like a set of stairs or to get hit in the car going to the plane but i'm still like it's such a deep-rooted issue and i think it's actually deep rooted in a lot of people of like i just [ __ ] i worked so long for this thing and it's gonna run out joseph kennedy the jfk's dad i read his biography he was like the eighth or ninth richest person in america uh when he was alive and i think he was worth a hundred million dollars and he said i would give away half of my money now if it meant i would be guarant yeah i get i would be guaranteed to have the other half forever and grow at a very conservative but consistent rate because he was like i'm just so afraid of losing everything that i worked for and that lost adversion is often like that it's like way harder would you do that by the way would you take that trade no no i wouldn't but me uh no no i i think that the world so he said that probably in 1920 i think like i think that i still am bullish on america and i still think that over the next 100 years like i'm gonna it's gonna average seven or eight percent a year and i'll be okay so i'm i'm okay with no i wouldn't do it i still think and everyone talks about america like um like oh like uh empire's only last 250 years and we're we're there and in my head i'm like but do you think that we're gonna go to zero like england like has been around for two thousand years and they're not number one or number two but like being number seven is pretty good too do you know what i mean and so whatever people talk about like america's gonna collapse i'm like well like wait they still got like a dude standing in front of a building all day like a statue you can go take pictures of them right so like life can't be that bad there they got the guy with a fuzzy black hat on yeah like it's not that bad like i wouldn't mind being germany or france and like they they like were the best for 2000 years and now they're not number one on number two but like you know i'll be the red sox it's okay like it's not a big deal so anyway i'm pretty like long-term bullish on america so no i wouldn't give away half are italians italians still eating pasta are the spain the spaniards still taking naps in the middle of the day like yeah you don't need to be number one to live a very sweet life yeah yeah yeah yeah so like so it's not like i'm i'm happy so i want to describe because i think this is the main topic right like i had a bunch of like you know random ideas and stuff like that we can get to those but i do think the main topic is probably where most people are at is our audience is i would say heavily entrepreneurial and or work in tech if you let's just go through both scenarios if you work in tech you're likely um you know have a lot of your net worth invested in either the stock of the company that you're being paid in or you um you know you might be invested in the mark crypto the crypto markets or the stock markets and um most likely you are you've taken a bath of like you know something between 30 and 60 of your net worth in like the span of five months has evaporated and like whatever plan you had for buying a house you know you're like oh wait you know the my money is sort of you know a lot of my money is gone and the interest rate has gone up and like you know or like you know i wanted to have that kid another kid and like now i need to like think twice before i do that and like [ __ ] i've been ordering groceries like three days you know ordering door dash three days a week like do i really need to pay like you know 32 for you know a burrito and chips like you know you start to reassess a bunch of things in your life um especially because the last 10 years like if you're around our age we're like you know kind of like early 30s like all you've seen since you graduated was numbers go up and so it's kind of jarring to suddenly see numbers go down at least that's my perspective do you think i accurately like labeled one part of our audience yeah in particular the last uh two years like it's been like up up up up up like crazy yes that and that that is our audience and then you have business owners who are like great this thing i've been you know working so hard at every day for the last x years like here's the here's the good news uh long silence okay here's the bad news now your valuation is like cut in half your customers are likely going to you know start tightening up and paying you less money um you're probably going to have to do some layoffs trimming somewhere in your business in your cost structure and like there's a i don't know 30 to 40 percent chance you go out of business in the next year and a half on top of whatever your normal risk of going out of business was and so like great you know you have risk of going to zero and so that's a kind of stressful thought and so on both sides you have this kind of stressful kind of depressing thought and uh i would say and if you're an investor you know all the same thoughts you know times two so where does that leave you you know you're either in a puddle of despair or you're gonna be like okay i need to kind of like giddy up and rea and i have to realize the environment has changed and if that changed what needs to change in my world and so i think there's like a pretty healthy exercise to go down of like what needs to change in my world uh and i would say like that's the productive conversation so it's not enough to just be like i'm just gonna close my eyes and think happy thoughts and be positive it's like well i need to be realistic a lot of shit's changed i probably need to change with it but also like do i want to sit here and feel depressed or hopeless no and so therefore i gotta like you might have that thought of like i could lose it all or this will go to zero or like all my hard work is gone or like whatever all those thoughts but in my mind it's like i need to reprogram my brain to operate in this new world and i need to like basically i need to like consciously reprogram my brain so that i have well what i'm my point is i do believe like or i do have that fear of it's all going to go away and my reaction is not quit my or my reaction isn't even spend less my reaction is yeah it might go all the way it might go away let's get after it like let's go get more or let's go you you know like it to me it's a very stressful period but it's a period it's not actually stressful when i actually like logically think about it i'm like it's not that big a deal but it is a i think that whenever i look back at the [ __ ] that i've made that's been successful it typically is when there's not a lot of alternatives um and it's like oh man this needs to work so right i do my best work when when back against the wall that's a that's a one thing that a lot of people believe and that's a belief that can serve you well when things get hard so it is stressful but uh you you i i think i said this a while ago i go you're i think i'm more likely to be like a slow and steady like success whereas you're more likely to become a billionaire in like five years or lose it all and so because you take you take well you take a lot of risk or both you'll become a billionaire then you take way more your risk on um so that's why i'm interested in hearing your perspective on this right now because you're like you're you're all in on a couple things that that just so happen are getting hit the worst so what would be fun to talk about what would be interesting to talk about like you know we can go into like why we think it's happening we can go into like what are you going to do about it we can go different well i don't actually man like where do you want to go i don't want to go into why it's happening and i was thinking about this we're in this text group with all those guys and they're all like it's just a bunch of like supposedly smart people uh no they actually are smart but like they uh they're what's crazy is that like america has been around for hundreds of years uh capitalism has been around for thousands of years and yet the smartest people don't agree on the cause or the solution and they can't predict what happens and that's kind of interesting to me because at your business at a business like you have a pipeline and you have a funnel and when you build a good business you're like all right there's a 90 chance that blank is gonna happen and i understand that business america is kind of like a business just with 330 million people and like a weird gover a weird corporate structure where like you can't really like do whatever you got to get all these checks and balances and all this [ __ ] done but isn't it kind of fascinating that we still don't entirely understand the cause or the solution to a lot of these different problems that's always been very unsatisfying it's like stock market goes up or down then there's like this race to make up the cause and it's like um okay so you're saying every time that happens this will happen no okay so you're saying that you could have foreseen this well it's like and what it is is like you know sort of this backwards application of narratives and it's not that there was no cause or there is no true narrative it's just that it's not easy or clear to see what is the true cause and what are the true narratives amongst the many possible explanations and reasonings you could have right like did it rain today because i did this dance or did it rain today because you know the clouds have you know heavy whatever precipitation and why do they have that well because of the changes in weather and whatever else like you know it's very it's very hard to separate the people who think things are happening because they did the they think it's raining because they did a funny dance it's just that we can predict certain human behavior relatively reliably um like you know the whole padlocks dog thing like i i know that if i do this this and this most of the time a creature is going to react by doing x y and z and i was and it just kind of has always baffled me i'm like well why can't we just take all this input and put it together and figure out what the solution or what the cause is and that's always baffled me and it also freaks me out that uh so many people who i view as smart say opposite things do you follow a zero hedge on twitter yeah so zero hedge is like this pretty hardcore i don't know if it's like libert libertarian's the best way to describe it but like they're pretty much always like doom and gloom and every article is written by the guy from fight club what's his name tyler durden tyler durden yeah and every article is written uh by that guy uh and their twitter profile they only tweet in caps every tweet is a is it caps lock and they they tweet the scariest stuff all the time and it's incredibly easy to believe and trust for some reason because i don't know what it is about emotion that i just automatically assume that the worst is actually the truth and i i've had it like unfollow that did you have your do you follow that handle yeah for sure and i i would not unfollow it but i i totally get what you mean which is that like um if you follow zero hedge you're just like wow all of the big people in charge are sort of idiots and all of the stuff that's going up is you know overvalued and overinflated and over everything and like you know no matter how bad it is it could get worse don't think that this is the end of the pain right and and that you know like people have said this about like you know people who predict crashes and recessions it's sort of like this guy's predicted you know a recession 13 out of the last three times it's happened and it's like you know if you're every year you predict a crash you know um you'll be seen as a genius because you predict it for three straight years like then it happens like well you weren't wrong you were just a little early and then like you know all those years where things are going up um you know you're again you're just sort of like you're just early and so it kind of pays uh somebody said this the other day like i would say in general like it in a bear market you know it pays to be a pessimist and in a bull market it sort of uh pays to be an optimist and somebody who's always a pessimist or somebody's always an optimist is not going to have like long-term success the ability to shift gears between like optimism and pessimism and knowing when to do what is a like highly underrated trait that uh very few people have let me tell you what i'm doing with the i don't exactly have a business i don't really have like a business business but i have a a a small version of that that might become a proper business let me tell you what i'm doing and then you tell me what you're going to do but basically my reasoning and keep in mind i'm like i feel so stupid when it comes to this finance and economy stuff i don't know i really don't don't understand anything but my belief is basically like well now's the bottom and i actually discovered this with the hustle where i was like i was creating something that people kind of dismissed or thought it couldn't work but then it takes like four five six years to get to like uh a substantial business and by that point people took it seriously and i was the biggest and the best and therefore could get acquired or was making a lot of the revenue so with my the thing i'm working on now my my logic is well now is the time to work really really hard and it might suck for one or two or three years but when things start changing a little bit that's actually around the time where i'm gonna have a team i'm gonna have process i'll have systems i'll have product market fit and then we can accelerate really hard then because we've already done the hard work during the hard times is that is that kind of how you're looking at it too a little bit yeah definitely i think that's um that's definitely the case so what what i said was i said kind of three things to myself i said number one this is a good chance to remember what i truly believe it's like and this is like first i needed to calm my nerves because if i'm in a sort of fight or flight if i'm in a state of like panic anxiety and stress i already know my decision making is not very good my decision making is at best rushed and at worst it's you know like operating from a place of fear and therefore all i'm trying to do is like um you know like minimize pain and never like get any any advantage out of it just like minimize the amount of disadvantage i'm having in the short term and so our my first step for me is get out of a fight-or-flight mindset and so that's where i first just checked myself i'm like well what do i really believe i truly believe this in the bottom of my heart i don't mean this in an arrogant way but i truly believe that like if i look at my life over like a 10 to 20 year period from here right i'm in my early 30s so by the time i'm 40 or 50 like i think i'm gonna have more money than i'll ever know what to do with to me that's like the spoiler of my life it's like if i flip to the end of the book i'm like oh it ends happily ever after yeah like i truly believe that i truly believe that like i'm just gonna keep doing business projects i'm gonna keep investing in things and like on the whole i'm gonna end up so far ahead even if any individual investment or any individual business project doesn't work out in a 10 to 20 year period that when i check the score at the end of the game like i'm gonna be ahead i'm gonna have more money than i know what to do within my personal life i truly believe that about myself so if i knew that was the ending there's no real reason to panic like if i know that's what the score is at the end of the fourth quarter then like it doesn't really matter what happens in the first quarter like i should i should for sure be playing and doing my best but like it doesn't matter if i fall behind or if i lose a little bit money here if the score doesn't go my way for this next 12 to 18 months that's okay so that that it's like i gotta remember do i believe that or not all right i do believe that then she'll first chill the [ __ ] out okay that's that's like wait wait wait let me let me tell you something though really quick to let me be the huge pessimist here um i believe that that is true about you as well i believe that that is true about a bunch of people who we know but here's the thing that i think about all the time it's like i don't want to be i don't want to have more money than i know what to do with when i'm 70. i want to [ __ ] it now when i'm young and i can experience all this crazy stuff and like enjoy life i don't want it then i want it now by by then i don't care like i i'm okay with having way less i want it today i want the freedom now when i'm healthy and can go do whatever i want that's why i freak out like i'm with you but it's sooner the better it's not now or never so sooner the better is very different than now or never and so okay we got a sooner than better mindset so we're going to take a bunch of shots we'll take a bunch of action now to increase the odds that it comes sooner rather than later the second thing is does it matter did my day-to-day actually change because my stock portfolio my crypto portfolio my net worth changed right like your net worth it's not a figment of your imagination but it's sort of like a figment of your uh like ego or sort of like a figment of your like perceived sense of safety and so like in reality the stock market go down the crypto market go down it doesn't actually change my like day-to-day lifestyle or comfort based on where i'm at for some people it's going to change that but for me it's not going to change that so that also helps take the edge off which allows me to think with a clear head then i start thinking alright you're not changing you're not changing your spending pattern oh like in a small way but nothing that like my happiness on a day-to-day level doesn't change whether i you know like uh like you know have a chef or not you know like oh cool it's cooking season then right okay cool i'm buying i'm going to i went to trader joe's yesterday instead of whole foods yeah i shift some i shift some small decisions but like that's cool trader joe's is sick like you know who cares like those sorts of things don't actually like sway how i feel wait i was gonna get another car did you actually do that i guess i'll hold off on that you're doing trader joe's trader joe's yeah like literally literally yeah like but again i like traditions this is not a big problem for me because i drove four extra blocks and went to the trader joe's um you know like cool so so you know and again not everybody is fortunate we're like these are like their situations i get that uh but like i'd like to believe that in general my my day-to-day like kind of happiness quotient is not so so weak that it's like dependent on these like material or like you know like frivolous things it's like you know sometimes i get stuck in traffic well guess what i don't know radio baby it's a concert right like a big ass honey crisp apple from whole foods it's not trivial if you ask me but i don't know i've always had this feeling of like i've always kept myself honest which is what i want is to have uh you know a fat mansion and be eating a feast with all the people my friends and you know family like all at the table we're laughing and joking that's my ideal but what's even better than that what's even better than having the sick mansion with the feast with all your friends and family all around you and you're laughing at the great joke you just cracked okay that's what i thought was the peak but the actual peak of the peak is you're the type person that you can get stuck in an elevator and have fun because then you're invincible what's better than invincible mode it's like you can put me in the shittiest situation and i'm still gonna be laughing okay so now what now i don't really have anything to fear because my my situation my my feelings weren't dependent on having all those those items all right even though i prefer them so um so yeah yeah i think that i guess like yeah i do make some shifts in my like lifestyle but it's not like to me i'm like oh cool it's a new season like it's tightening up season it's like you know it's like getting shredded for the summer for you know your body it's like cool i'm also gonna go and cancel a bunch of subscriptions i don't care about because it'll make me feel good like i'm i'm i'm putting a healthy amount of discipline in like i kind of accrued a bunch of excess fat when it was one season and now it's time to cleanse and like good like you know where where am i spending that i don't really want to be spending you know where are we where are we advertising that's inefficient you know who's on our payroll that's not really pulling their weight good let's get rid of all that weight now is it spring cleaning baby right so it's like that's the next step for me is like you do an actual spring cleaning and be excited about it i've been using truebill this is not an ad but have you seen it yeah it's called truebill i bought like the 100 subscription have you ever used that you know what that hasn't used it but i've used stuff like it yeah it basically like looks at your subscriptions and like suggests how does it know what you're not using it suggests what to cut right yeah like drives them like i didn't realize that me and sarah both had amazon prime subscriptions like apparently i thought i cancelled one of them and so it catches that and it also like i just see how much i'm spending every month and i'll say you have an upcoming 300 subscription coming up and it's like oh that's my trainer um but there's been times where i'm like oh damn i thought i didn't know i had xbox live or whatever the hell that thing's called uh it's a 29 thing and it's coming up and so you can like cancel it but then what they do is if you need to cancel something that you want to call they'll like do it for you they'll do it for you it's pretty cool um yeah and so so that's another piece of this which is uh me me ben and saffon we were hanging out this morning and so we you know we all hung out together and we're getting our coffee for that's the milk team and we're like or like part of it and we were like okay let's just make a real list real quick let's assume for a second assume this market condition these market conditions last for the next let's call it 18 months so let's assume the stock market yeah it'll bounce back from like whatever it'll find some low and it'll bounce back a little bit but it's not going to be like all right baby we're back to every you know everything just keeps going up we're all printing money right that's not going to happen let's say for for the next cycle um same thing with crypto let's say that you know companies you know they're not giving out raises or hiring as much let's say that customers tighten up their spending so revenues go down across the board like cool let's assume all that to be true do we also believe that like like first some things are going to die some things are going to survive and some things are going to thrive true bill is something that thrives during a time like this right because it's helping you bring some you know austerity or like you know uh financial discipline into your life so people are going to want that product more so they're going to thrive what else is going to thrive maybe short sellers are going to thrive right now because they've been betting that the market's gonna go down and sure enough it has who else is gonna thrive you know the guy who's been sitting on a bunch of cash on the sidelines is like oh actually like there's things that i think are valuable businesses like you know facebook and amazon that are trading at all times sort of like you know lows in the last decade like now is the time to dollar cost average into these companies dude how about assets how about moist saying he had in the interview you did with him saying he had 50 million in cash and he was like i just him waiting it's like oh okay now uh yeah i understand what you want yeah yeah exactly i remember uh just as like a small anecdote like i remember maybe seven years ago six years ago something like that i don't know i bought bitcoin for the first i think i bought 10 grand of bitcoin back when bitcoin was like at 600 700 it's like 700 bucks and the next week it goes up to 800 and i'm like there we go baby just as i wanted buy the thing price goes up love it when they stick to the script and uh like i think two weeks later or something like that i don't remember making up timelines here but very short soon after that bitcoin crashed to like 200 so my like what was 800 was now you know i lost you know whatever 75 i don't know public math but you get the idea lost a bunch of money in that process and at that time 10 000 like i was making 150k a year i think was like my salary actually definitely i made it either 120 or 160. so i i remember when that was and i remember you told me you made 150 grand a year in salary and i was like oh my god you're the richest person i know yeah i was the person i knew at that time so i was like and you know and actually like in reality i was underpaid for you know what i was doing but in my head i was i was like wow don't say anything they might realize how much money they're paying you you know like that was like i was so honored to be making that kind of money so um and like i feel good that i was honored like it feels it's it's great to feel honored at what you're getting that's actually an awesome feeling to be in versus consistently dissatisfied um but like i remember it went down to 200 i walked into the office and i was like bitching about the like the crash of i was like my bitcoin because like you know i'm very public when i invest in things which makes me often look like a dummy but occasionally it makes me look very smart and i was like oh guys my bitcoin purchases my my i forgot to put it 10 or 20 grand something like that i was like it's uh it's like all gone now and furcon was like um he's like this is great right like you know do like do you believe less than bitcoin just like than you did two weeks ago like did you learn some new information like besides the price changing like did you learn any new information bitcoin that makes you less bullish on bitcoin i was like no like barely knew anything to begin with and like you know nothing changed and he's like cool so like if you bought now you could bring your average cost basis down to like 400 and i was like oh like yes that's true and i went home and i did it and i was like i like i remember going from like just what i thought was the only response i thought the only response is [ __ ] and moan and then he kind of pointed out well like did your actual conviction change or just the valuation i was like right well i don't know my conviction didn't change not to say i had a ton of like very well thought through conviction at the time but like it didn't change and so i did i lowered my cost basis to 400. now as bitcoin bitcoin today trading like i don't know twenty three hundred twenty two thousand something like that but like let's say on the average last year it's been like 30k so that that's the difference between basically like an 8x and a 4x in your return was that one conversation during that one time and i've heard this many many times before which is like you know fortunes are built during these bear market times and it's really for two reasons number one if you start a company you're gonna be like the lean mean cockroach you're not gonna have too much competition and you're going to build up your cons your kind of team and consumer base now um so that as you know as the tide lifts all the boats you're the biggest [ __ ] boat that's what happened to you with the hustle and like that's what happened to many companies that started during you know let's say the recessions or bear markets the same thing happens with investing it's like well the goal if your strategy with investing is to only buy in when things are going up and then like sell or do nothing when prices go down like you have inadvertently subscribed to a buy high sell low strategy and like you know i think we know that that's not a winning strategy and so like um you know well then what's the opposite of that the opposite of that is to if you have conviction or if there are good assets that are underpriced temporarily like there's a dislocation because of panic and fear like those are the times where you're supposed to buy in it's very hard to do so because your mentality is like like i just lost a ton of money i don't feel like going and putting more at risk but in reality we kind of know that is the right thing to do for the if you can pick assets properly dude what i've been learning about this and i tweeted this out was like i'd rather just earn more income and build more companies than worry about these losses um so let me can i let's let's shift a little bit can i tell you about a company or this uh you remember how you said i find these things that are kind of interesting and weird i found another one and i want to tell you about it all right have you heard of this conference called shop talk shop talk no name sounds familiar one second let me go to this so start to describe it let me see if i have heard of this all right so it's a conference that i think you would have been involved in because it's for e-commerce people but it's not just like it's not like d2c entrepreneurs it's like shopify as well as like every shopify plug-in as well as like uh retail brands like like the founder of or the ceo of j crew might go and talk to like the see talk on a panel with like the someone at stripe i don't know just like it's like online commerce but like for retail stuff does that make sense but it's like sorry give me the use case so who who goes i'm uh i'm an e-com store so should i go to this uh probably not but if you're like you would go and speak and like executives at gaap would be like oh like these young startups here's what they're doing maybe we should like consider changing our strategy to x y and z or we're we're making apps for this we're making software for this ecosystem let's go and talk to other apps and maybe we could do business together does that make sense let me ask you slightly slightly differently there's like kind of like trade shows or like it's a trade conferences where it's okay it's more like a trade show gotcha it's a trade show all right but here's where things get interesting so the guy who started it i linked uh to his uh his linkedin down there uh in the document and i think his name is jonathan weiner and he has this co-founder he's an indian guy named i forget the indian guy's name but uh so listen to their background and let me tell you what they're doing now and why this is so fascinating so i really linked an article from vox and it said the guys behind money 2020 conference want to do the same thing but for commerce so what that's what that will explain is basically this guy jonathan and his partner they started a company by the way i saw you smirk when i said the guy's last name that was hilarious um i was trying so hard to come up with a good joke uh and i just you know my filter in my brain was like you know what not worth the risk this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform where everything is fully integrated well i can see the clients hold history calls support tickets emails and here's a task from three days ago i totally missed hubspot grow better so this guy and his partner uh jonathan weiner is in his indian partner it's like you and you and me like the wiener and the brown guy [Laughter] so uh this guy they had an ad tech company as well as a payment software business that they sold for hundreds of millions of dollars and then oddly they went and started a conference and it was called money 2020 which was like a fintech payment processors trade show business and within two years they scaled it to like 30 or 25 million in revenue with 10 million in profit and they sold it for 100 million dollars right when they sold it they went and started the same thing and they called it shop talk and they did it for commerce and they sold that for over 100 million dollars and they sold both money 2020 and shop talk to two different publicly traded companies so all these numbers that i'm saying um you can actually go and look at the numbers and like verify the acquisition price as well as the revenue now i noticed that one of the founders spun off and he's doing a different thing called like the fintech meetup or something involving fintech and then the other guy is doing one called health it's pronounced health it's spelled hlth.com and he's doing this a trade show business for healthcare and they're basically doing the same strategy every single time and if you go to all three of their of their conference websites and you click the about page they have these really cool cartoons about uh cartoons instead of like headshots of each employee they just do cartoons they've done that for every single about page so they're more likely than not like hiring like the same people the same graphic designers because they're not yeah they're non-compete probably says like look you can't create anything in the fintech space anymore you can't create a thing in the commerce space anymore and they're like all right let's do health let's do this let's do that and it's so interesting that they're getting into conference and trade show businesses as opposed to software and they've crushed it they are crushing it and they don't raise money and they just like it's like every three years they start something and sell it for 100 million dollars and it's the same thing and they've done it two or three times now isn't that crazy this is amazing that you've done it again sam you have done it again dude i love these in fact i remember you telling me about money 20 20 a little while back because you've always been interested in conferences trade shows businesses from the hustle con days and uh i remember every time you told me about these i was like sort of consistently blown away as to how much money these make um now what do you think is the playbook to do this because like for example well this is kind of in transparency we've talked about this with the milk road of like dude there's a lot of like there's a lot of money and there's a lot of moving parts to like people who are you know have some interest in this whether it's like wall street people kind of want to get educated on this stuff uh you know insurance you know let's call it like mutual funds hedge funds bankers whatever and then there's like crypto people there's vcs like all these different people who are like professionals and there are tons of conferences right so it's not like some uncompetitive space but what are these guys doing that's better or different because i don't believe most conferences businesses are scaling this fast or selling for this much so what are the what's this guy what are their what's their playbook compared to how most people do it do you know a little bit so the misconception with a lot of these make some conjectures make some guesses because of course yeah exactly and i've tried to like deconstruct it just based on the outside but so the misconception about conferences is that you need cool speakers and people come to watch content and as i've studied these guys and read their quotes and figure out exactly how they do it and i ran a conference business that made millions of dollars a year i've realized that the real money like the 20 30 40 million a year money it's not necessarily a conference it's a three-day transactional event it's you you're creating ebay or you're creating a main street with stores on the on the street and renting it out you're creating that but it just so happens that's going to happen in three days so years where the business is going to happen in three days and so what you have to think about is your your speakers are just the bait to get the right people to come and then once a certain right people are coming the rest of the right people will come and they're justifying all of it in the they're justifying all of it by a couple things the first thing they're justifying it because they say [ __ ] our competitor is there we have to be there so that's like a really big thing and so i've talked to my friend um uh who runs block works that other crypto media site and they have this huge crypto business and he was like man it's pretty crazy like if blank companies coming other company is like oh we gotta come and can we like get a better booth than them and so that's like a really common thing but the second thing and more logical thing is all right look if we're gonna buy this hundred thousand dollar booth we got to close all these deals who's you know what shot callers are going to be there and we have to do a really good job of making transactions happen so that's the really big thing is you have to realize that this so there's this guy named sheldon adelson do you know who that is yeah he's like the vegas casino uh guy right or is that his cousin yeah he's a mean as [ __ ] old billionaire he's like known for being like a huge [ __ ] and he's worth like 20 or 40 billion dollars looking guy yeah like he's like looks like this and he like thinks that like weed is like the end of the world and so he like buys uh all these ads about how like wheat is you remember like uh those commercials like julie used to care about stuff now she just smokes weed all day and you know like it's like it's like someone's like this is your egg this is your egg this is your brain on weed and it's like cracks in it yeah it was it was like it was like they used to have these commercials with like someone like melting into the couch and they're like she used to go for runs all the time now she just sits and watch tv it's like anyway he's like a huge anti-weed guy and so but he's just like 90 year old guy i think i forget what he owns but it's like the largest he basically this guy definitely just had like a bad weed experience he like definitely smoked weed in college and like peter's pants got made fun of ford like there's got to be some deep rooted like i've looked at hospitals what is it so it is serious his kid i think became a drug addict and he like thought and this guy like grouped weed and into the same as all that other [ __ ] which is not which i think is crazy but he basically started uh this event called comdex which eventually was acquired for a billion dollars by softbank and it be and it became uh what's that thing the consumer electronic ces and i read i would read all these old articles about him and he goes you know you're in the conference business and now you're in the real estate business building up las vegas strip what are you doing and he goes well the conference business is the real estate business what i learned early on was i got to get people and foot traffic to my event and then i'm just selling real estate at a crazy high square footage and uh it's the same thing and so that's why i'm into real estate now and he basically built up all these hotels i forget all the casinos he owns there's like three big vegas casinos and he owns one of the biggest one and uh anyway so these events are rooted in like real estate and foot traffic and so that's really how you do it the second thing is it's got to be b2b of course a [ __ ] ted talk is like the coolest thing out there but like you know people coming to like hear talk about why sleep matters or like how to cure malaria that's unfortunately not where the money is if your name is anything but ted so if you're anyone else but ted don't do these like sexy things do boring ass b2b we're here to get some deals done and we're going to sell you some [ __ ] you know it's a bunch of a bunch of white dudes with uh tight blue jeans and like those brown leather shoes and tucked in collar shirts just like you know sales bros that's what that's like where the money is at least 40 of participants must have a tucked in button-up shirt uh or polo and uh you know like half the jokes need to be about their wife uh you know like something something complaining about their wife and then uh like if you said the old ball and chain you'd get like a default smirk from anybody you know like their badge needs to be like you know semi tucked in under the belly like that's who you need at these conferences for this to work yeah and if you don't have a tucker in your crew you're out you're just you're not part of this you have to have a tucker in your crew right so there's like a dog like a bomb sniffing dog that's just looking for tuckers in line yeah there's not enough tuckers in this in this queue shut it down yeah so that's what is the german shepherd that's that's where it seems the money is um is like joining these uh industries that are fast growing and making it a a real estate you thinking like a real estate person and how do you um how do they go get people to go buy these tickets so like i'm assuming they're basically selling or is their model you sell tickets for a couple thousand each and then you sell sponsor booths for you know tens of thousands each something like that um is that the model i think what they do so i went and looked at their revenue and so their revenue in year one is like two or three million and then in year two it's like 12 and then you're three it's like 30. so based off of that and it's a bunch of marketing materials and as well as their head count on their about page i think what they do is they just give away a bunch in the first year in the first year you're just trying not to lose your shirt um and i also think that they when they sell sponsorships which are actually can be easier to sell for these things they like only give away x amount of tickets and for the rest of the people to come you have to purchase it and once you get a certain amount of sponsors it's kind of like we used to host we used to host events and we would purposely have like as many speakers as possible because each speaker would bring like 10 people and so i think it's kind of like that where each sponsored company automatically brings a small crew and that is how they actually do it and because they don't they spend a lot in marketing though and they have based on their teams they have it's like that you know that spider-man meme the spider-man maybe they're all pointing at each other like yeah yeah spider-man it's that but just sponsors at the booth being like buy my stuff buy my thing no buy like you buy my thing i'm here to sell not to buy yeah it's a circular economy of just like you know buying buying one another's crap um but uh anyway it's kind of cool what they're doing and i think this business i think events can be a headache but there's a way that you can build it what what i would do by the way if i was international i would study these guys and i would do the exact same thing in europe then i would do the exact same thing in australia i would do the exact same thing in india and in china and in south africa like wherever you are there is a version of this that can be built locally that is not going to be competitive with these basically like this is a clonable template in my opinion i'm sure it takes good execution i'm not saying that but i think this is a business that can like generically work in other markets and either they're converting schools or other countries there can be more than one winner you know like you can go to more than one conference a year and so it it's not a winner take all business so it's kind of interesting and interestingly all the companies that have bought these guys as companies have been european and i looked online about what they were doing and one of the big things that they were doing was first of all they've gotten really good at selling so they host the event in 2022 and at the end of 2022 they already have uh 90 of the revenue for 2023 because you sell the you upsell the people like right away for the next year and you can sell multiple years you're back for now the second thing that they're doing is they're starting to charge money for online communities so like all right you met at the conference you can keep this up and like and so they're doing online communities and that's one of the reasons that's the business one of the business i'm interested in and that's why i've been studying this and figuring this out it's just this is a super fascinating thing i think it is this is great i i really like this one um anything else on this otherwise we could do another topic no i don't i [ __ ] i just so i have i have so much stuff back loaded by the way uh and i know i spent like half of 40 minutes of this podcast just being like the mentality of a downturn but again i think it's the most whether you're an employee you're a employer or you're an investor like nobody is going to be spared from the economy going into a recession the stock market tanking in the crypto markets tanking and global inflation like this is like uh you know like you like oprah comes out and she's like you know you get a disaster you get a disaster you get a disaster to everybody right like nobody is going to be untouched by the effects of this some people are going to get hit to the point where their business goes under they declare bankruptcy personally or in the business whatever that's going to happen but i don't see anybody getting untouched by like a stack of problems like that man when i remember when biden was saying that putin was going to evade uh invade ukraine and uh i was like reading about putin and listening to ben's podcast how to take over the world and i was like hey putin why do you why do you want to [ __ ] this up for everyone like things are pretty awesome right now like what are you thinking like just i that that's just the conversation i wanted to have like you know like putin like everything's pretty pretty good what what what like you're gonna blow this for everyone we're all gonna get screwed and that's like the conversation that i've that's like the kid in class who's the kid in class who raises his hand is just like hey miss you forgot to collect the homework and it's like dude what are you doing are you chilling we're seven minutes away from getting out of here dude do you buy okay so this is like sounds like a very like uh yuppy [ __ ] thing to say but i don't really look at gas prices because they don't drive that much but you know it's just like it's i gotta buy gas and it's not gonna hurt me however much it costs i'll buy it and uh i was driving up here from austin to brooklyn where i'm living now and i was listening to the news they're talking about gas prices and i was like oh [ __ ] i haven't even looked at the gas prices while i've been driving up here i wonder what it is and it was like 550 and it was crazy again i know like what the news was saying but i just wasn't looking because i don't drive that much what's the gas in california where you are are you paying like 650 seven dollars a gallon how the [ __ ] are normal people doing this that is crazy that is crazy seven dollars yeah when you said 550 i was like wait you're saying you found a good deal but you were trying to say that's a bad deal right i thought that was real i mean i've lived in california two years i remember in california it was five dollars but what is it in austin dude i don't even know i just looked in like west virginia when i was driving up here i don't pay attention to the gas prices i don't drive that much and i just don't i'm buying it no matter what it says uh but like seven dollars how this is we're selling [ __ ] fools right now how much gas does a car take i don't even know like i mean it would cost like 150 dollars i guess to fill up like how big is the tank yeah i drive an suv so it's like you know 20 gallons basically um all right jonathan says it's about 450 austin dude so you're spending 150 to get gas yes um yeah it's bad but you know asking for a friend you know like okay i got like a you know a car that says like you should use the good you know pay the most when you go to the gas station like pick the pick the top of the the three options um like let's just say what do you drive what's your suv i got a bmw uh x5 and so it's like let's say your boy's been uh putting the shitty one in for a while like you know does this matter is this is this like marketing or uh you know like do i pay some price later in life or do i pay some price now like i actually never really knew how big of a deal that is like is it pretty strict i don't know i i but you're paying i don't know but i'm going to be honest it doesn't sound great it doesn't sound like that's what you want to be doing to me i'm like you know is that this seems like a recommendation not a rule and uh you know so i've been going with the 87 whatever that stands for instead of the like 90 or whatever the the top end gas is and i've just been like you know okay so the most expensive thing is like eating mcdonald's uh the most yeah i don't even know what the yeah it's basically around seven bucks uh seven bucks a gallon i think i think that's kind of the top oh my god or something that's crazy yeah that's that's wild so every 18 miles is seven dollars for you basically yeah i don't know i don't even think about it like it is what it is i need to get places and like that's the cost of cash right now like what am i going to do i'm not going to drive to west virginia and get gas uh i'm not gonna not drive around you know like i do need to go places and so you know it is what it is of course it's not a big deal for you but uh you remember how we were talking we were talking about how the economy was crushing for years and years and i've got so many friends that they're like man i've got i've been in in my apartment for a year and a half for two years i've got a money burning hole in my pocket like i haven't bought anything out i have i have all-time high savings i'm ready to save and all these people are quitting their jobs because they're like f that like i get these checks i've saved up money like i'm not taking this thing at seven dollars a gallon like people are just gonna run out i guess right i mean like you're just gonna run out of savings a huge amount of people again you again you got to cut back right so you know i cut back down to that low end gas so i could you know save the 30 40 cents a gallon other people are just gonna drive less so they're gonna say public transport or they're gonna carpool or they're gonna find something like people will find a way is you know my general mentality and like uh i don't know i spent a lot of my life living in like jakarta or like beijing and you just see people like in beijing right next to our house there's just people just shucking corn like all day they're just sitting in a squat just like removing husks from corn for like 10 hours straight in the heat and they were just like you know and then they would like take their break smoke a cigarette and play some mahjong and like you know like that's what they did and they were fine and then like you know your driver had different set of problems and like in jakarta like in india people just burn trash on the side of the road because there's no like waste removal thing so they're like you burn it and then it's gone it's like yeah but like it smells awful all day and like what are you talking about this is like how air smells i was like no no man that's not how air has to smell but like you know i don't know you the range of how humans can live survive and thrive is so much wider than like you know the average person thinks um and so i don't know like i don't know i just don't really pay too much attention it's just like you have to like i don't know you just have to like kind of figure out how to govern yourself in a new world it's like are you a self-governing individual or not because like if you are not a self-governing individual every day you're going to get punched in the face with bad news right now and like you got to learn how to parry a punch otherwise you are going to get like knocked out by just taking most jabs to the nose every day like i just got done i was in missouri for two weeks most people aren't like that they're just like they're most people are not that resourceful that's what i've i've learned uh i i actually think that our audience is like that most are not like oh i gotta go start something i gotta do this i gotta i think most people will just are just gonna be [ __ ] that's i mean that's really what i think so so i'm writing a book right now i don't know if i tell you this i write a book i'm using that like scribe media thing where you they like write the book for you or whatever but is it all your content they just they write the words after you say it to the guy on the fun for like two hours every like week or something uh i don't know if it's awesome i'm loving doing it because i'm like oh cool i get to like put something down on paper like i don't know this is fun um and i'm not gonna like sell the book i'm gonna do something different with it but whatever so basically point is um the start of my book is that um everybody wants the same things like everybody wants to be like wealthy everybody wants to be like in great relationships great family and everybody wants to be like in you know great shape you look at like okay cool so like if everybody wants that and that's all achievable then certainly you know like most people are doing that no okay half people are it's like most people have the exact opposite of that result most marriages are ending in you know unhappy or ending a divorce most people in america are you know overweight or obese and most people don't have like you know uh more than ten thousand dollars of savings in the bank or whatever for like a rainy day and so everybody wants the same things everybody wants to be you know uh you know rich fit and madly in love and in fact everybody has the opposite and so like if if you think like most people think you're gonna do what most people do and you're gonna get the result most people get and the sad truth is that the results most people are getting are not very good and like i so that's the start of my like that's the premise of my book and um that's the start and then the the the second part of i guess like i would say a controversial thing about me is um i am totally okay not taking into consideration most people's situation i am so like for example i always i i it sounds like an [ __ ] thing i understand i said it purposely provocative way right i did not want to soften that um what do i mean by that like i always talked about like oh i love to teach and i want to be a teacher um so most people see that as like some like mother teresa you know like sort of like save the world like be the educator who helps all i'm like no no i do not want to try to educate everybody or teach everybody i'm like most people are horrible students they don't want to learn anything they're not going to learn anything they're not going to do anything with even if you told them the exact right answer or how to think they're just not going to do it so like why would i waste my energy doing that like no no my preference is like in a in a population of 100 of people there's like three percent that like really want to know the answer and of them maybe like 20 of them are to be able to actually take action on it i'm only going to try to teach the driven and motivated and capable like and that is not a like society like socially acceptable point of view um but it is my like operating philosophy is to like uh myself i focus on the controlling the things i can control and not other things and secondly like even when i'm like talking about what most people should do i know that most people are not going to be able to do that or want to do that or choose to do that that's okay i'm not talking to most people i'm talking to the one to three percent of the population who like wants to thrive in those ways and uh i hope everybody else listens to it and says this guy's a jerk and like does so out of touch it's like and they leave uh they leave my orbit and they unfollow me completely because i'm like uh i am trying to be intentionally out of touch in the same way that i intentionally avoid the news that's hilarious it is part of my core strategy is to be out of touch and avoid the news and like not not not learn from or speak to the common denominator of the population and i i know that all of that sounds completely awful to some people and uh but you know i'm okay with that like it i i do believe even if you disagree with that i hope you agree that like i'm allowed to have that choice to do that and if you don't think i have the choice to do that um like you know then i disagree with you and all of your your ways of living yeah you're like if you i get that if you don't if you don't think that my opinion is good i get that and you're fine but you're wrong and i hate you that's basically no no what it is if you think my opinion is wrong if you think my opinion's wrong uh i understand and i i would expect that from a lot of people if you think i shouldn't be allowed to have my opinion or to act on my opinion that's where uh like there's a difference between i disagree and that's not allowed or that's not okay or no you can't do that or you know lynch him you know like there's a there's a difference in like being able to disagree and disallow and i would say you're you're you know like a little far with the lynch yeah they're gonna kill them yeah lynch them yeah um yeah yeah that's that's probably a bit bit harsh all right that's the pod we'll see if people uh dig it i uh dude what if tomorrow it just goes back to normal that would be nice by the way if if you want to cancel me i hope people get our voices mixed up and this has been sam talking that whole time why this people issue here is sam i think they're saying that p-a-r-r you could find him he's a is affiliated with hubspot if you want to go get them like that's the guy to go get if you didn't like what was just said dude i still get people messaging me saying that they they they confuse us still i don't understand that yeah i guess i think people go watch the youtube video and they're like [ __ ] i've been had you guys oppos mixed up for like a year i i think what they're saying is i look beefier but i talk nerdier and you look nerdier and you talk beefier so it is what it is you you look dumb and you talk smart and i look smart and i talk dumb uh all right we'll talk soon peanut butter and jelly baby it's a perfect coffee yeah [Music] you

you just explained that like you're a machine learning thing tagging it like extremely visually compelling high engagement to the end like you know i've seen i've seen too many videos at this point i have to put them in the buckets [Music] colin and samir do you guys know what you're getting into do you know what this is at all i thought this was a podcast about procurement is that not what this podcast is about yeah it's all about office supplies i don't even know how to say the word procurement once you get once you get around us that word becomes a problem right and ben is the systems integrations guy right yeah exactly yeah yeah and so give uh give y'all story so i i kind of know a little bit of it but let's assume people listen to this don't know it which is my way of saying i kind of only half know it but give give me your story yeah um so i'm samir by the way uh this is my voice if you're listening um i graduated college um in 2011 and i went to school to study film and digital media and i grew up in la so i was like really into the film business i wanted to be a storyteller i wanted to find a way to um you know become a filmmaker and that was a really challenging thing you look into so how did you how did you swing this i'm going to be a filmmaker well he's good looking though too i mean he looks like an l.a person i know but the parents parents don't care about that no you're right i mean i remember the moment when i called my mom and i was like i'm not going to be a business major i'm going to be a film major uh and it was a scary moment i think for them but i was a bad high school student i was not good in high school i was just not getting college i didn't do homework i was not someone who really lived up to the standard of what it was to be an indian kid whereas my brother was student body president uh he became a lawyer like he he followed more of a traditional path i think they had noticed that i was so unconventional that it was like all right at this point do whatever but my dad's also really unconventional he's an entrepreneur he's a fashion designer like he's he's different um so i think there was a bit of like okay i mean you seem confident figure it out um and and so for me when i graduated school you know i had a i had an issue with being someone who wasn't good in school like i i didn't i wasn't great at like being an employee that was really hard for me i worked as an editor on a film called ides of march in hollywood and i just i just didn't like it i didn't like doing a single task i didn't like doing you know one thing and i had become aware of of youtube primarily because i was up in in northern california in college and was really fascinated by it so i felt like i had all the tools to to just upload a video um and just make something and the subject matter that i picked uh was the community that i was a part of when i grew up i grew up playing the sport of lacrosse i played lacrosse in college and i decided to spin up a youtube channel called the lacrosse network and that is the origin of my first upload onto youtube really outside of like student films and at the same time colin was uploading a series or uploaded a trailer for a series about the colorado club lacrosse team i'll let him pick up from there but um this is this is in 2011 uh just for frame reference let me jump in with one thing i've seen a video where you said something dope calling you go my first video only had i don't know what you said like 100 views or a thousand views you're like but samir was one of them and that view that one view changed my life because then you guys ended up joining forces you guys do a bunch of cool [ __ ] fast forward till today you guys got this like pretty baller youtube channel and this is like you get to do the thing you want to do you get to like i don't know if i can do anything i'd probably be like a professional basketball player that'd be like the the peak of like getting to play and like be super successful at the same time uh but i feel like the second best thing might be being a youtuber and uh and so like you know that's i love that idea though that like okay i only had 100 views i only had a thousand views but like that one view changed that one of those views changed my life i thought that was like an amazing little like nugget yeah i i think for me it was a real lesson in in community probably unlike samir you know i actually was a really dedicated student almost probably to a fault and so when i finally had this experience in college of you know buying a camera and being a little bit more of a creative you know putting out my first video which was about the lacrosse team having it not necessarily be a huge success but you know it did connect me with all these like-minded people one of which was samir he sent me an email that day basically saying if you're going to be making these videos even though you just started why don't you put them out on my network because i'm trying to aggregate tons of people who are fans of the sport so you know from that point on i was like i don't even care about my past education i am so interested now in just telling stories and having it connect with people but that didn't the the lacrosse network that was like kind of a failure right like it got you to like a certain point and then you're like [ __ ] this isn't going to pay the bills is it because yeah i think i mean i think it didn't it didn't it definitely didn't pay our bills in the first three years right um it was something that was not a failure but you know yeah i mean like long story short we sold the company in 2014 which was really positive um so that was a success for us but like the pathway to get there was really challenging because there was no business model really surrounding youtube in 2011 2012. um when we tried to to get advertisers no one even understood that spending money on youtube was a reasonable thing to do that was like the only way people could understand us was a video production company so what we did to make money is we did creative jobs for people like service jobs okay yeah well we you've seen that we can make pretty good videos on online we can make you a video or we even did even more creative odd jobs we made websites for people we designed stickers for one company it was just kind of like oh these guys are like creative internet people so if we have a creative internet task we'll we'll ask them to do it and then what what was beneficial to us was that youtube the company was was very interested in what we were doing and they basically came to me and they said if you can secure live rights we'll really get behind you because we're trying to explore live sports on youtube and that's what i did i i got rights to um high school games first then college games then we eventually distributed pro games and figured out how to acquire live rights and um get youtube behind us and that kind of grew our profile and got us to the point where we we could um we got acquired by a sports media company and a lot of that you know i would say it was an aqua hire to be very clear like the benefit of that was that you know there was cash exchange for our company but really the majority was in you know we had salaries and stock um and we got to actually have like very comfortable stable jobs pursuing youtube and exploring not only there's a company called whistle yeah um so by the way i want to say something here youtube started in like what 2005 something like that yeah yeah and you guys are saying it was 2010 2011 and you're like it really wasn't like uh well a well-trodden path of like be a youtuber make money doing this this can be like a business and this could be the platform versus the way you guys use it was kind of like it's kind of our portfolio and we'll get some clients from this and it'll be a launch pad maybe maybe we'll get picked up by somebody else bigger like real traditional media that will pay us that's kind of crazy right that's like six years into the game and that's why like right uh just a bigger point about like let's say crypto right now it's like these things take a long time before they become a thing before it's like what youtube is today where it's like obvious now that you could be a youtuber you could make a bunch of money you could be mr beast whatever it's still not even obvious if you i don't think it's that obvious yeah yeah i don't think it's that old at least there's examples like i watch youtube on my apple tv and that's tv to me most people only like only teens do that and like i'm the old guy most people i don't think do it like that but i think like so i think it's still pretty like not a thing yet i do think if you take a step back and look at it it's it operates exactly like most media companies uh and that's like if you just take business models from the past like how the radio operated or even how uh you know television operate like any media company a magazine like that's that's how youtube operates too there's a really unique version of advertising when it comes to youtube in that we are uploading and the platform will actually pay us without us having to interface with clients without us having to build a media kit without us having to pitch anyone which i think causes creators to not fully understand the business they're in because they don't have to pick up the phone and sell their audience to someone or sell what they're doing to a client if they're primarily based on the adsense that youtube's giving you when we were first starting out adsense was absolutely insignificant because our audience was extremely niche it was small and youtube was not that developed there were people making good money from adsense checks on youtube which is you know again the money that youtube will pay you uh part of their partner program but you know that's never been that significant of a check for us because we've always been very niche and so we've had to learn the business of media um and apply that to what we're doing with youtube and i think you know that maturity is starting to catch up right now in the space and why a lot of creators are able to build businesses today and why there are road maps and fast forward to now you have uh the lacrosse network's uh no longer the focus it's the collins the mere show and it's basically this it's a youtube channel you have hundreds of thousands of subscribers and you kind of talk about like creator economy stuff but i think that's a little bit niche but like it's it's a little bit more than that but you've got these like really highly produced interviews that you do with people but then you also have all these like clips and you do this thing where you're sitting in your car and you like give um analysis of like different videos and why they're going viral but you do it seems like you do a little bit more than that i watch i watch it all the time uh and so is that how big is that business at this point just to give the audience like a little who don't know you like to to a little sense of how legit you are sure yeah so yeah as you mentioned we were you know we're on our way to two million subscribers uh we have 800 and i think 13 as of this recording the business is myself colin and we have four full-time uh team members who work on uh the actual channel that's uh myself colin we have three editors uh as well as a production manager uh and then a data and insights person uh who who works and and looks at like kind of how everything's tracking from an analytical perspective and then we also have a um a newsletter and there's a team of three that works on that two people one one general manager of the newsletter one more in business development and and sales um and then uh a writer who's who's on staff for the newsletter so the total like people who work in the collin and smear ecosystem is ten um and it's split across two media properties one being the youtube channel and one being the um one being the the newsletter i don't know if you guys and i would say i would say too like we're primarily supported with advertising advertising based business uh our biggest clients are samsung shopify jelly smack and other crater economy companies what's the revenue now can you reveal or no yeah we're i would say we haven't been super 100 transparent with like exact numbers but we're a seven-figure business are you getting close to eight no no do you guys think this uh like gets there like basically sometimes you get in a business and it's what got us here won't get us there and sometimes we just got to keep on keeping on and um so so from a business model point of view is it if we just keep okay we're at 813 000 subscribers today we're probably tracking to 2 million next year or whatever it is and the ads will just keep scaling and this will keep going this will be the business forever or is it like we're going to have to come up with a second act at some point so i think there's decisions you can make as a creator to get there like we we are friends with a lot of creators who you know are pushing towards that eight-figure business mark right and and a lot of that is is at just ad-supported business um there's other creators who have launched you know course companies or education direct-to-consumer content patreon right subscription platforms and you can absolutely get there it's just honestly i think it's based on there's this moment as a an artist or filmmaker someone who wants to express something where you go from like i mentioned i studied film i was very interested in being a filmmaker but you go from being a filmmaker to a media maker and i think that um those are two different things and you have to decide like colin and i have to decide what we want the lifestyle to look like i think you guys mentioned i think it was your mother-in-law sam who said i like taking tuesdays and thursdays off i think that's a really important thing for all creators and all entrepreneurs to look at and be like what what's enough uh for me like what what is what you know what i want to do and i think colin and i this is like a relatively recent um success that we're having with this channel and we're trying to constantly evaluate which parts of this are really enjoyable and which parts of this start to feel like okay now we're just making stuff to make stuff and i think we have to find that balance of uh how to scale what we're doing but also recognize like we we got into this because we we wanted to make something and i think it's okay to to lean in to be like maybe there's part of this that's like we just want to tell the stories that we're excited about and yes there's a ton of opportunity but it might not match what the lifestyle that that we eventually want who who is crushing it so um like you mentioned some creators do x y z like uh what's his name ali ali he's coming on on the pod soon oh he's great i think he reveals his numbers where it's like okay my uh my course business is gonna do like two million dollars this year or something like that yeah where he basically is like you know become a youtuber or some [ __ ] like that it's like it's a course that's around the world so six million uh i think he's tracking to six million this year okay amazing youtuber academy yeah i signed up for timer youtube academy so that's the so that's the course he does and so that's an example of like um somebody's crushing it in the course model then uh sam you've talked about the guy who does like bring a trailer or which one was it the the car doug domoro you guys have doug we bought a car from cars and bids for one of our me too me too amazing great so he is a car guy with at this point two or three million subscribers and he has a a an auction website for cars that could potentially be a nine-figure company i actually think yeah sam was that launched off the channel or before yeah no he had the channel for five years maybe many years i think the unique thing that we're experiencing right like this is entrepreneurship um the difference is we build an audience first and then solve how to you know monetize that audience through products services subscriptions whatever right um whereas a lot of traditional entrepreneurship is build the business first and then try and find customers or audience second um and so i think that's when you look at like creators how big this can become it's really like how uh for a lot of creators who built successful audiences and niche audiences it's like how big you you want it to become the thing that's holding back the creator space right now i think is is operators like really good business operators to surround creators because to make you know like to make on a consistent cycle when you are the subject of your videos uh it doesn't really allow you to operate as you know the the business admin the operator the person who's pushing cars and bids uh the the website and and that business while you're making the content at the same time ask your question again sean yeah so what are some other examples so let's take those two so ali abdel with the courses doug domoro with uh you know has a car channel then launches a car auction site who else has done something cool what are some other cool stories of people crushing it that are like started with content started with audience and then have done have created a cool business off their youtube channel that that's impressive because i don't know particularly that like are not mr beast the ones that you know we all know about yeah yeah i i would say an interesting one that keeps coming up is cassie ho she started blog a lotties so like fitness yoga instruction on youtube and now she has two separate product companies that are both eight figure companies right samir yep yeah there's one that's like an apparel company for athleisure and then um one that's like yoga mats uh and like [ __ ] i i yeah i think like that's that is another yoga creator called uh yoga with adrian who started teaching she's so great uh but her subscription platform's amazing right like she she's her awesome man i'm a customer right yeah have you seen this uh shawn her name's yoga with adrian she's got like the girl next door look where she's like not intimidating but she's definitely beautiful and she's based out of austin and she does yoga with her dog and she's very calming she's the best man i love yoga with you know let's see this there's another creator named amanda rayshlee and she started creating content with bullet journals so she was showing like how she was setting up her bullet journals how she was um organizing her days uh and then she's launched a line of stationery and of journals and that's become her primary engine um of business and and like i think those are a few specifics i think yes theory when it comes to merchandise and apparel i think they've done an incredible job with seek discomfort and building a brand that can stand alone outside of the videos and i believe they also just went into the fulfillment business so they not only have their own merch line they also do the printing right the warehouse for other creators too right that's right i think it's really smart when creators start uh businesses like that where they say okay if we're going to solve all these problems independently and not go with a partner then you know we can work uh we can work with other creators to do the same do what i think people should be doing that you you don't see so i have a couple ideas i if you don't have one uh i'll throw a couple at you you could tell me if they're why people are not doing that maybe they're bad ideas but what do you think creators should be doing that they haven't yet gone into that that realm yet it's not common so i actually have a perspective that i think um i i think i i'm curious why we haven't seen creators band together especially like let's let's imagine the e-commerce space like why have we not seen 10 creators come together and launch an e-commerce retail store um like that to me where they can bring a ton of traffic to it and and pair together and all their audiences or maybe on one brand uh yeah i think that's exactly what i was gonna say like a disney store discovery store type of thing 100 or even like one singular brand it's happening with this brand called cloak in in like kind of the gaming world but like why not just if if every creator had a piece of this one apparel brand like couldn't you make the next big um apparel brand or could you make the next urban outfitters if if you know emma chamberlain plus five creators came together and made a retail store i feel like specifically in beauty and fashion and cosmetics like there's such an opportunity to band together and have one brand because there are so many like stand-alone cosmetic brands for a singular creator but it can it can really happen in any like in gaming this was ha i always thought this should happen in gaming so my company got acquired by twitch so when i was there i was looking at like okay what are these creators doing one brand that stood out was there's a brand called g-fuel i don't know if you guys have heard of it's very like gaming niche but like basically sam i don't know if you've heard of this it's like um i don't know what you it's like a red bull it's like it's sort of like an energy drink uh but a g fuel as in gamer fuel so it's like oh this will be you know give you energy help you stay focused when you have those long gaming sessions what was in it and it looks like a gatorade who knows what's in it like and the guy who started it he's like this absolute like 50 year old bro like he's like yeah 55 and just like jacked to the gills and you're like oh wow this is like i don't know what's happening in this company but i don't want to drink this but like what would happen is they would go to they were like oh dude these twitch stars have influence but the traditional brands aren't going to them they're going to instagram and youtubers first so he went to them and he was like hey i'll make a flavor for dr disrespect i'll make a flavor for ninja i'll make a flavor for each one of these and you'll have your own shaker that you'll like kind of promote that has your brand on it and like he had these like he got like nine of them to be like the sponsored athletes basically and they they grew pretty big i don't know what they were doing exactly if i remember correctly it was definitely over 20 million it might be over 50 million in sales that they were doing just off of like kind of this one real niche channel um and uh what i thought about was like and then and then each of the individual creators was doing their own thing like ninja made a mouse a gaming mouse and then somebody else made a a another like a coffee or a stimulant or whatever and i was thinking the same thing if these guys just got together and the ten big ones got together and they just launched a gaming accessories thing like the best keyboard the best mouse the best whatever like they would be selling hundreds of millions a year if they like put their powers together captain planet style i think that goes back to like the lack of operators in the space right now um and i think it's starting to catch up but i do think that you know there's a lot of short-term revenue to be had um and that's really exciting and there's a lot of there's like quick cash to be made um in in our space that i think now it's probably just happening where you're starting to look at these longer term and there's like you said there's more road maps you know of course you know mr beast is in my opinion singular like it's he's not you can't there's not going to be more uh of him but you can look at some of the stuff he's doing with oh feastables is interesting or even logan paul and oh they made prime instead of partnering like that's interesting and they how's that going together i i'm not positive i would i from what they say it's going well so that's uh i think that's all we know uh i'm not positive i will say it tastes great uh we bought it here and it's like a fantastic drink but i have absolutely no idea how the business is going i would say too it seems like he's following the beats by dre trajectory of making sure to get it in the hands of celebrities and famous people with his podcast anytime he has someone on they have prime in their hand or they try it and they like it it's a good strategy when you guys got to how long how long did it take to get to 800 000 um for i think at least four years right call at least four or five years i mean yeah yeah probably four years to get to 200 and then one year 100 to 800. yeah so let's let's take this journey one second i got a question on this so if we strip away hard work and talent because let's say those are like core ingredients that you guys have um but like every journey has like inflection points like something where something just broke your way or you realized something before others did or like the one thing went viral and that kind of helped step you up to another level because like if i go to the channel today i see the the top thing is like a video with miss an interview with mr beast has 10 million views right and i'm like how the hell did they get mr beast like that's a big poll yeah that was a great interview so what were the things that were like besides hard work and and consistency and talent what made you guys grow and what made it work how do you get to a million subscribers and mr beast do an interview with you guys um my first answer is time and market um i think like we've been in this market for 10 years and that has introduced us to a lot of people that have created opportunity for us as we started to grow right like jimmy shot us a message jimmy's mr beast um he shot us a message when we made a video a couple years ago and he was like that was a cool video and we struck up a relationship and we started talking about youtube because we were both really into it um and authentically into it and that created a situation that you know when we got to a point where we had an interview show or talk show we had a relationship with him such that we could fly out get access in north carolina to his new facility and like he was excited to to be on our platform and we we had that relationship and i i think even when i think about an inflection point for our business prior to that was when we you know really were weren't catching that much traction from a sponsorship perspective but we had made some connections to the point that um you know samsung was looking for creators to partner with on like year-long ambassadorship deals and our names were were up there because of the relationships we had created in in the market so i would say the fact that we just stuck in it for 10 years has introduced us to people that created opportunity as i would say we are late learners and we've like figuring out youtube took a really long time for us um but as we figured it out we were in a position where we had enough relationship that you know our first couple interviews are like marquez brownlee mr beast like we were able to have these creators on um who we had developed relationships with prior that now fit into a format that we had landed on um and collaboration on youtube is like that's how you grow um you know time and market is an awesome way that's an awesome phrase i've actually never heard that before time in market is a great way just because typically we would chart and i would just say like well i'm just like in the mix and i was just like i've been doing it for a while yeah time and market is a far more like formula people usually use it for investing right like buffett i think said you know instead of timing the market what matters is time in market and uh it sounds pretty similar uh for what you guys are talking about i would add too that it's it's time in underserved market because you know the reason that jimmy or mr beast even reached out to us is because no one was really talking about creators or about the youtube space for a long period of time and we continued to talk about it while no one really was giving it the time of day so i feel like it's not that we were just in the market it's that we picked an underserved community and so we happened to be that place where creators could turn that's so uh in crypto that's happening right now like i created this crypto media company not long ago called the milk road and it's doing really well but we're so new and crypto's now cool so you don't get credit for being there when it's cool there's a guy there's a show called up only that's on youtube that's uh started by this uh this guy kobe and uh leisure or whatever and they they've been doing it for a long time back when like there wasn't a lot of heat in crypto they were still just every week going on and just talking about whatever shooting the [ __ ] talking about crypto and so now when famous people want to go hit the circuit they're like well we got to go there because they have the respect of people because they were set they were hanging out here before the tourists arrived you know and uh yeah you can't you can't beat that no i agree with that i think like you know we watched the people go from being not interested in what we were doing on youtube to extremely interested and then a lot of those people who are interested in the creator economy i think shifted over to web three and so like i think you'd like time and market when you're just like actually like this is the this is the career we've chosen like we're going to be in this we enjoy this this is what we want to do this is what brings us fulfillment then you know wherever this goes uh the ups and downs of it we're just we're just here right and so like i think that is uh that is an important thing um as you're as you're going on your entrepreneurial journey so right now sean and i have a really like our our podcast is doing great um we're not we're we're a pot we're like a podcast that sometimes it's posted on youtube and and and so podcast numbers are first but we've each uh toyed around the idea of like maybe we should give this youtube thing a try like maybe like separately like in our own like our like you know like we'll pick a niche and go at it and i've thought about it but i'm like you know i'm not ready to go whenever i'm gonna do it i'm gonna go all in on it and like maybe hire someone to help me do it can you give me and shawn some advice on like look here's like the here here's like the table stakes in order to get to a hundred or two hundred thousand subscribers inside six or twelve months here's like the the absolute minimum and keep in mind like assume that budget this is it for most people assume that budget is no big deal like we're willing to spend money so here's something that i think is really important is like you're creating a video podcast so in your mind the thought is there's not much marginal cost in posting this video to youtube you're already we're producing a video and audio right now there is not marginal production cost there is marginal distribution cost you're going to have to spend time thinking about how to distribute this show on youtube and how that differentiates the audio think beyond so think of it it's like sean does i do something on fitness well sure anything building houses i don't know yeah i think like you do need to go all in you need to understand the audience that you're serving and most importantly you need to understand packaging and what works on youtube from a search perspective and what works on youtube from a click-through rate perspective all of youtube is is click-through rates and then retention right tell me what did you get yeah what works no i mean you're saying you're saying understand what are like what are you getting at what's what's the niche that you would want to tackle entrepreneurship uh let's say i'm just gonna make let's say um i bought a bunch of i'm buying airbnbs let's just use that for an example shortcut yeah short-term rentals yeah so i think like you would want to um go along from a packaging perspective on uh basically how to make money through airbnb rentals right so maybe you would create a series that's like zero to a million dollars in revenue on airbnb rentals episode one right and it's and i wouldn't title it like that but like call i don't know if you have ideas on titles but i think brainstorming titles would be our first step from an audience perspective because you're trying to transform people to understand how they can do the same thing correct yes that would be my assumption yeah so call i guess let's let's spitball back and forth titles on something like that well even that first thing you said that's a like a story frame right like zero to a million and rental income you set the stakes already like i'm a man on this mission which i think is not what most people would just naturally think to do but for you guys it's like well if you have a mission people are going to want to see if you can do it or not and how to do it they might want that too yeah i think for that example too people are people are doing that and that's not a problem um that actually can be to your advantage a lot of times we tell creators you know if there's something you want to talk about search it into youtube sort by most viewed and see what are the videos that are getting a million views there are definitely videos about you know the business of airbnbs buying airbnbs that have over a million views so i think that's a good place to start uh in your journey is like what's currently working you know and then what are those videos about like i think the key for you would be how can i actually make sure that when i get this title thumbnail that's pretty sensational about making a certain amount of money or you know converting some house or something like that how can my video actually meet the expectation of the person who clicks you know that it's not maybe you just sitting down talking about it retroactively but you know maybe it is a video that took you two months to make or three months who knows you know but it's got to match that expectation and be actually impressive i think probably packaging it around like i made a million dollars on airbnb um in 30 let's say let's cut the stakes to 30 days and basically over the next 30 days you're going to track how you went from not making any money on airbnb to even like how do you make money on airbnb so i think that's that's the packaging you'd have to uh fall into and then you'd have to meet that expectation like you'd actually have to do that and then i would think about like where where are people currently getting airbnb education outside of youtube are there places that are actually really popular where those communities already hang out where if you made your video you could seed it to them or it would be a success if they started talking about it and sharing it organically what would you think about where on the internet do they exist what would your early team be would you have just an editor someone filming you would you have a thumb a thumbnail maker what would what would your your skeleton barebones team be for you i think if if you said that like money is no option right that's that's not real yeah just for the sake of just for the sake of argument yes yeah i would hire a thumbnail designer who is is part youtube strategist most thumbnail designers have a lot of youtube strategy in them as well um because they're they're so linked so yeah i would recommend trying to find someone who uh really deeply understands packaging uh and has seen things that work i'm gonna read some titles and uh maybe you guys can guess the viewership in this exact category um how to make your first million on airbnb i mean i would think that's over a million yeah 900 views oh 900 yep you can make a million dollars per year on airbnb in 2022 with the you in all caps oh i hate that that probably has fused i'm gonna say low i'm gonna i'm gonna hope and pray it's low is it low eighteen thousand okay i would say that's medium how much money my airbnb made in its first month high that one crushed it that's probably shelby church is that shelby church shelby church 235 i love her that's right so so i think already through that exercise you're starting to understand i watched that video by the way that's how i know it's great i love her do you know who shelby is sean no she's great yeah she's amazing shelby church is amazing but i think like that's where do that exercise in packaging like just go through all those and then the ones that are not working upgrade the titles yourself like what was wrong with that title what was wrong with that framing did that not match the expectation uh and then for shelby like what was right about that that framing is really great how much money my airbnb made in its first month great yeah me and sean talked to this woman named rebecca what was her last name rebecca z she's got a zamarollo or something like that she's got a she's got like across all of her things maybe 10 or 15 million subscribers she makes content for like 12 year olds um not like little kids but 12 or 10 12 year olds where it's like plays and stuff and uh she was i was asking i was like man she was like yeah like i i we got to like a million subscribers pretty quickly i think like within a year or two years and i was like that's amazing how'd you you know what was the thing and she was explaining it to me and i was like okay so basically what you're telling me is that you just like quit your job and like you just made this like you're nine to five and you just focused on it and she was like yeah like no one else treated this like a job and this was like yeah i'm at the office at nine i'm working until six seven 8 9 10 sometimes but i'm showing up every single day and i'm just like i'm working and versus most people they're just kind of like [ __ ] around it's like oh i'll get to it when i get to it yeah and i think studying as well like really being a student of the platform like that's a that took five minutes to look at some of the top performing in that category and dissect what you thought was good bad what worked what didn't work um you know i think you have to do that first it's like market research i can't find this client info have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases hubspot grow better is there a good tool that shows you search volumes on youtube so uh like you know you could do this with google search you can figure out how many people are searching for these keywords can you do that within youtube yeah there's a tool called vid iq that you can use there's um we do it on google a lot because again like google and youtube are obviously you know connected right so what do you mean on google play people are searching like google like google translate keyword tracker google search trends google translate yeah yeah we'll use google trends to track like okay is this keyword better than this keyword or people searching this more than this but you know on on youtube specifically we do use vid iq sometimes um and i'll tell you like how competitive maybe that that keyword is is there a lot of search traffic on youtube for that and it'll also show you the uh top videos for that keyword so if you if you go into vid iq and you type in airbnb you're gonna start to see like okay what what are the trending videos in this category what's working what's not working what are the thumbnails that are working um and do you guys like vidiq is a great example of as you guys try to be successful on youtube you're like ah this is so i wish it was easier to do this type of research and not just see what's popular but how competitive it is and just quickly show me the top videos in that thing right so vidiq becomes this piece of software that you guys might pay for you know is useful to you guys what are some business what are some tools or things you guys wish existed i know this is a little bit of a hard question but like there's i don't know hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs who listen to this that will like hear that be like oh i could build that i could start something like that where you guys aren't gonna have the time to build it necessarily but what are some opportunities you see that could serve youtube creators the two things i wish existed when we first started and that i still think there's opportunities for are legal zoom for creators and uh turbo tax for creators and i know those two things exist for entrepreneurs but something with a more creator lens uh and i know there's people starting these now but i think those are really helpful um especially on the tack side i think a lot of creators like because you just have this influx of of freelancers essentially who are now starting to like they it goes really fast from okay i made a little bit of money on youtube to okay wait a second what do i what do i do now i just made a ton of money on youtube um so i think some of that would be really helpful of you know the back end business side is what you need the most help with you if you're into it like if you go nine to five into youtube you're gonna figure it out if you're really into it you're gonna figure out your niche your category uh how to find audience time in market baby time in market like you're going to figure it out you you might have to hedge your bets and have another job while you figure it out or have another source of income but if you're really into it you're going to figure it out it's it's the back end of you know that the younger like being 21 and all of a sudden landing figuring it out really quickly and then being like what do i do now so i think some of that business ops that business admin stuff would be really helpful um to to help with creators um to make sure things are like clean and and growing right you were talking about uh like partnering or like you well i mean what you were saying was about operators creators need more operators and in my head i'm like oh that's cool you just like um someone like me who knows how to operate a business i just partner with someone like you who's like famous and we do like a 50 50 split and and i build a business that you just keep getting famous and i agree that that's a great business but in that example as well as the example in your guys's partnership and as well as just like a normal person who just wants to bail what happens if one of you guys dies or you get in a fight or you want to quit um is your business just going to die you know are you going to be done do you think about this i know jenna marbles i think is huge on youtube i'm pretty sure she just bounced like she just said i'm out same with casey neistat he goes i don't feel like making videos so does your money just go away i think creators are a lot like athletes like i think the term creators and athletes are kind of like you can think of them in similar ways so it's kind of like if if we stop playing like yeah your income from playing is is gone uh i think it's about figuring out that the businesses that can support you outside of creating videos because the reality is like you can't sell colin and sameer and expect someone else to operate it if one of us is gone this version of collin and smear is done um that's the reality but the things we build like it's it's a lot of why we built a newsletter because like we were like okay that follows a similar value prop it's similar in creating content i'd say sam like inspired by a lot of what you did and um you know like hey we're educating people about this space we think we can do it in this way we can hire writers we can scale our voice and our thoughts and if we're gone that thing can operate um it's not called the collin and sameer newsletter right you know it's called the published press for a reason uh with that goal in mind that that it truly can scale beyond us but what we do is is unscalable beyond us um and i think we we we're okay with that um you know so i think if we if we were to separate in that hypothetical uh something were to happen i would hope that like let's say i'm no longer around i think samir like could continue the interview show that we're currently doing and serve the brand partners that we have if he wanted to do that that sounds like colin's thought about it yeah that sounds like no i'm just saying like whereas whereas in the past we had a format we had like a really high lift format for creation that just wouldn't have worked like if one of us was gone it wouldn't have worked but right now we have an interview show we have a talk show yeah well you know it wouldn't be the same but like you could carry it on what craters surprise you have you come have you guys interviewed anyone or come across a channel where you're like dude this fishing channel that just says fly fishing is making a million dollars a month or like has there's ever been anything like there's a guy i saw who has a channel just on uh breaking into locks and it's got like it's a huge channel there's another channel that where they just smash stuff it's like a it's like a press i forget what you call it yeah but a hydraulic press is there any channel that you come across and you're like man these guys are killing it no one knows about it or at least mainstream doesn't know about it man i wanna i wanna pull up the exact name but it's a barbecue channel there's like there's a whole barbecue genre on um youtube that's massive and they do huge partnerships with like brands that you know colin and i would never interact with right like sweet baby rays or stubs or um and they're like starting to sell their own rubs right like spice rubs and those are really high margin and like that genre to me is really interesting and people who are into barbecue are really into barbecue um so i love that genre i think that's like they're very good businesses there when it comes to selling spice rubs um and barbecue accessories i guess i'm always amazed by channels like the slow-mo guys where there's literally no need for language it's just the visual of something happening in slow motion and the viewership is so high because those videos can be watched again and again and again all over the world no matter what language you speak that youtube can place ads globally in every market and so just the revenue that they get from youtube the platform is out of control uh that to me is a fascinating business where it's just let's film something in slow motion and rake in massive advertising dollars dude you guys want to hear something [ __ ] up so sure there's this channel that i follow and it has a huge following and no one talks about it because it's really embarrassing so there's this there's a group of people i'm one of them that we we like uh like popping zits but to take a step to take it a step further there's one where people love seeing dandruff come off people's head and so because because like when you have dandruff you like scratch you're like i need to get this out it's killing me and sometimes you can't do it so when you watch other people at least for me when i watch other people do it i'm like oh i feel the relief like it feels relieving for me to see that and there's this guy i think it's just called like the indian dandruff barber and he takes guys with dandruff and he shaves their head and you could see it all like you could see like his scalp get like cleaned and uh i was with my friend neville recently and i went to his house and i turned on his youtube and i go hey let me show you this video it's hilarious but don't laugh at me i think i'm a creep eddie and i uh she went to that video and it was purple he had already clicked on it and i was like dude you [ __ ] guy you want just dandruff [ __ ] too and it's there's like this whole genre of people if you watch if you do like if you type in like dandruff removal there's so many videos of people who just love watching or another one is like uh uh like seeing sis you know what assist is like a lump in a body seeing those get removed i [ __ ] love those videos i love them dude you guys don't watch that don't make me feel like a freak i don't know no listen listen when if i come across a good pimple-popping video i'm diving in like i'm not i don't shy away from that and i've seen the indian dandruff guy i don't think i haven't seen that um i also there's one account that i like got really weirdly into which was the folding lady on tiktok she just folds clothes in different ways and that's it and like organizes them in her drawers and my drawers are a disaster so it's like this for me it's like this aspirational account that i can watch where she organizes stuff well there's a lot of weird stuff out there and how do you guys look at tick tock because this tick tock is this like younger sexier version of youtube it's like you know you're the 37 year old actress and now you see this you know 21 year old come on to the scene and you're like oh no what's happening over here you know what's the perspective on tick tock for from your guys's point of view i i see con i see tick tock as a bit of like a content accelerator that like if you're new to content creation and you want to find out what works faster then go to tiktok because it's a low barrier to entry to post and if something doesn't get viewership no one really sees it like there's not much weight on it because of the for you page which is like this talent show style format it's like if it's good it'll find people if it's not whatever it doesn't feel like with youtube you know when you start a youtube channel it feels like a statement you're like i'm here to make my own version of some big media company and you know that is there for all of time every time you pivot every time you make a bad video it's just sitting there in your library whereas tick tock it's like it's not as much weight on it so just move fast put something out and i think it's a great place to find audience i don't know if it's a great place to monetize that audience though i would say i think a big reason for that is because it's the it's like the closest thing to a leanback experience right like you just turn it on and you say whatever's on the free page like it's really good at finding content that's good for me i might not go in there and search for a creator that's like not really a behavior that i think a lot of people do it's just like you feed me whatever's good here so let's say you take out the top creators on tick tock like the absolute top creators um all of our tick tock experience wouldn't be changed that much like it would still find content that's interesting to us so it's actually not a great place for creators it's a great place for content it's not a great place for creators to build relationships with their with their fans that's why most tick tock creators move to youtube to build that they can build like longer lasting more depth with their audience they can build a library of content that you know you know cruise viewership over time it's it's where like you would if you're serious about the career i think you'd move to youtube um tick-tock you're you're you're there like tick-tock is the creator you're putting content into their system um so i think that's an important distinction between the two what's like you guys are not as bullish on tick tock like i've kind of thought about like i'll give you an example um i put out a tweet the other day sam i don't know if you saw you did you did see it you called the guy an idiot and you're like this guy's an idiot you should hire him um this i put on there he's being like i just want to hire a great content creator because are we talking about the milkman yeah exactly yeah okay i saw it so so this guy i tweeted out this thing saying i'm hired content creator you just gotta be great at content and we will we have distribution we'll help you accelerate here and uh for the milk road and we i get this tweet back yesterday that's like for those who haven't seen it it's on my twitter you can go find it but it's this i don't know colin you tell me i thought it was amazing but maybe it's just because it's about our thing was it amazing to you guys it was to me i think that's an extremely visual compelling piece of content with uh in a format where i have to watch to the end you get to see him struggle to try and finish that gallon of milk you just explain that like you're a machine learning thing tagging it like extremely visually compelling engagement to the end like you know i've seen i've seen too many videos at this point i have to put them into buckets summarize the video sean so the guy is basically like hey um you know you're hiring i saw your tweet you're hiring a content creator and he like he used our joke for my first million i've moved straight to the end he's like so i've moved straight to the end here i am i've got a gallon of milk i'm gonna drink this to show my commitment uh i don't even know what his premise was but he's basically gonna chug a gallon of milk in order to show how bad he wants this job and he made a funny tick tock out of it with the editing and he's like asking people hey can you hold this camera i need to drink this milk he's like in a car mechanics place they're like no he puts it on the ground and he just takes off his shirt he just starts chugging this milk and it's just awful and then he's like has little cuts in between where he's like why couldn't they have called it the juice road because he's like having to drink milk and like you know just little funny bits like that and he whenever he finishes it he celebrates he pours the milk all over his head at the end and he's like whatever he sends that over so i hired him so i tweeted out i was like this is amazing you're hired i just talked to him on the phone before this and he's like all right like what's the game plan and i was like well i think the first thing we got to do is we got to pick the channel we want to be on because i think the platform will dictate what content works on that platform um and so like like i have a buddy steve uh steve bartlett who who says this uh which is like you need to hack the algorithm like you need to understand how the what the algorithm wants and then you have to be able to serve it to them uh if you want to grow like faster than normal and so and so we were debating like should we start on youtube or should we start on tick tock and in my head i'm like i use both i love both products but tick tock does definitely feel like a um i don't know it just feels like the growing wave compared to where youtube is and so i'm like i guess if you're starting fresh you would just start on the platform that's like more of a growing wave and like try to make it happen over there though but that was the downside is even if we get viral growth from it like those people may never see us or hear from us again because it's just the way that tick tock works so that's why i was like i don't know i'm not sure about this bet here which one should we go for your guy's perspective sounds like he'd lean more towards youtube is that right well well honestly yeah i was gonna say i don't think you have to pick and choose necessarily because let's say you're gonna commit to short form vertical content which obviously you would put on tick tock right sure you could post that yes you could post the same thing on youtube shorts uh as well as on reels maybe and like you know keep that up for a certain amount of time and see what takes off because you may find yourself in a situation where youtube shorts takes off and all of a sudden people are subscribing to your youtube channel for shorts and then if you wanted to transition to a long form video you have a home for it and that's a place where you could build a deeper connection on tick tock you don't really have that option right now a long form youtube video i would say like that's the highest barrier to entry when it comes to content uh so i think short form vertical is the lowest is a lower barrier to entry not the lowest like a tweet is probably the lowest barrier to entry um but like that is you want to take more shots to figure out your format your style it might take 100 videos to be like actually that's our format that one works or maybe you figured it out and this guy's just got to chug milk every day until you guys you know get enough users but like i think that's what it is it's format development and you need a lot of shots on goal to to can i tell you my my first assignment i gave them yeah sure i was like all right here's the first first thing uh man on the street style interview you know where you go like you've seen this on late night shows you go and you just stop somebody in times square you're like hey bo do you know about this and then they give you some goofy answer you cut them together i said uh go outside of a strip club and ask strippers if we're in a recession and uh like ask strippers how the economy is going and basically that's what he's gonna do he's gonna go man on the street style outside of a strip club and then when the strippers come out he's gonna ask him how's the economy doing because they are the front lines they feel it first you know they see what you know talk from all the from all the drunk hedge fund guys yeah they get they get all the scoop and they see the tips how they're how they're changing cash you know you know in real time so that's gonna be the first piece of content sure yeah i mean i think that can work uh i think that's a very specific audience and and it'll work for that audience right so yeah dude what happened so i don't know the point i was going to the point where so our podcast gets one or two million podcast downloads a month and compared to like a lot like a website that gets 10 million i'm like i think we're we have a bigger a big we don't have a bigger but we have a far more loyal following because people listen to us for an hour at a time with youtube they watch you for 10 20 30 minutes at a time and i was gonna say i would have thought that you guys had one or two million ish downloads a month uh views a month i'm looking at your stats on social blade you were at like a million a month every month 800 400 500 and then all of a sudden you got to like 27 28 42 million a month what the hell happened is that from shorts that's a lot from shorts but shorts propelled the other content like basically the way we view shorts like a lot of people had a lot of problem with like oh you can't monetize shorts and i was like but if i told you as any business that i had a way that was lower lift to get you in front of way more people to get your brand exposure to millions of people wouldn't you take it um and that's what we did like right when shorts kind of emerged we're like okay we can make a short in a day whereas it takes us a very like a week to two weeks to make a a full long-form youtube video um we can make a short in a day and so let's just try it and as we started to try it like we had shorts that pushed 10 million views 20 million views 7 million views 8 million views and those people were subscribing and then there was concern like are those people going to watch the other content but because the shorts were you know directly connected to the longer form content we were just aggregating more people who then watched our library of content so it worked for us um and that has fluctuated too i think we're back like right now i think we're in like the 9 10 million views a month range on the channel um and shorts are not like as big of a factor we're not putting out as many shorts but a lot more people are watching our library now um and that is what youtube is like you're building a library of content that you know our mr beast interview for example you mentioned it it's pushing 11 million views right now but in the first month it did a million views so you know you look at now it'll it'll be a year in september it'll probably have 12 13 million views um you know and so that's it's about this library building a piece of content that can be viewed over the next year or two years five years and when you do that it does have you know this compounding effect especially when shorts are added to the equation as an accelerant we have a we had a short go viral recently and it's sean explaining who like one of the ball brothers is and i have i don't pay attention any of that any sports and they're in all the guys i just randomly clicked on the comments and they're all like these [ __ ] guys are idiots like he doesn't know anything about lamar ball i forget who it is shawn but yeah yeah yeah and you're like explaining this and people are just ripping us uh of the short comments or maybe just how you went viral really yeah yeah whenever any of our videos hit that mass scale that's when the comments sort of turn and it's just it's kind of a good sign in a way it's just just what happens yeah there's one that um there's one so we did this clip contest for the podcast so we're like uh hey we'll uh take any of our content you own a channel so you make your own tick tock channel your own shorts channel and cut these clips and basically we just want our clips out there so we're kind of doing it different than most where you guys want to you guys want to build your specific channels we're like you can call your thing my first million clips or whatever and uh go ham with the content you own that we just want distribution and we give out a prize for whoever like does the best job each month of cutting it and people have like what this so the first first winner they had a few million views on their uh like tick tock channel or whatever and we paid them the five grand you know prize for our thing but they've actually turned that into a business for other podcasts and that business will do like a million dollars in revenue this year as like a you know pretty young kid then with this one just yesterday somebody said oh here's the clip that's got 1.2 million views and it's this clip from an interview we did with this guy neil patel and he's talking about how he spends like 180 grand a month that's his like monthly lifestyle burn rate and um and the title of it is like billionaire ex like billionaire explains how he spends 180 grand a month and like the guy's not a billionaire but like doesn't matter like the the you know the kid who's running this channel is probably like [ __ ] that's gonna do better then the top comments are like oh like that's that's neil patel he's not a billionaire and then like this guy's like egging it on he's like question mark question or question mark that's his only response instead of being like oh yeah sorry that's a mistake and then somebody else says who is this guy and he just he writes the founder of google question mark and then there's a hundred comments being like that's not the founder of google and i was like who is this genius that's hacking the engagement by putting dumb comments as the creator just to get people riled up so that this you know the algorithm sees that this video has a ton of engagement in it i mean we've played around with that a bit that's that's that's uh definitely something that creators do we've we've misspelled words sometimes in our subtitles we've um we had a short where we we interviewed the chief business officer of youtube robert kinsel and the short begins like we interviewed the we we wanted to say we interviewed the head of business at youtube and we said we interviewed the head of youtube at business and just kept moving on and like people re-watched it so many times to be like wait what did they say so like i think there's there's a lot of fun ways to play with that and play with the audience and oh you know we would never do that because sam would not like do that like now we wouldn't do that but this person who's doing this has nothing to lose so they're of course gonna like just crank the dial up to level 12 of like spamminess because they're like who cares it's not my brand it's not my kind why not yeah yeah i think like your drake um steak short like that that piece there's definitely a short there right like that was really fascinating um you could tell that in a really concise you know like one clip bit like that was really interesting that you guys um what you guys talked about and i think like that was one of your better thumbnails too i would say that came across my recommended like but the challenge there is that your time stamp at 100 or sorry an hour 24 i think like anyone's expectation might be like wait is that an hour 24 on drake and steak um and then you know there might be an opportunity to just say hey can we just clip out the part that was about that um and then you know lead people to to watch the full tank or listen to the full thing on right on audio feeds i the the guys who edit the podcast i think they also edit the youtube so hey guys you hear that do it please yeah i think i think that's your opportunity it's like hey it's actually eight minutes on on the drake stake situation right and it that that was your best thumbnail i think like that that caught my attention that made me curious so yeah well dudes thanks for coming on this is sick um i've been listening to you or watching you guys for a while um it's really awesome that you came on and it's awesome that you knew about the pod so that was really cool and we appreciate it this is great and of course thank me and sean we both run run or ran newsletter companies so you've been helpful with us for new uh videos if you ever want to shoot the [ __ ] about newsletters we got you man that'd be awesome absolutely yeah definitely we definitely want to learn so yeah right on guys cool all right [Music] you

i've learned that in any team you can look for two types of people you can look for people who lack weaknesses meaning they're pretty well-rounded they have no fatal flaws but they may not be great at anything or you can have some people that are amazing at some things and kind of weak in other areas i've learned that the best performing teams are filled with people who are amazing in at least one area so you're hiring for an extreme strength not a lack of weakness

[Music] so here's the here's the here's the situation so this is recording so this is going to go live on our podcast feed so the people listening on the podcast there's you and then there's people who are live right now i think over a thousand people live so we're on this thing called stonks.com i guess i got i got i got to do it to close disclosure i'm an investor sean are you an investor no fan fan so stocks.com it's they uh we were friends with them they asked us to do this and it was actually we say no to everything but this was a cool idea so basically five startups are going to pitch us and we're gonna maybe invest but very likely tear them apart and also complement them we're gonna make like some good content out of this right yeah uh yeah okay great i'm down and we don't know much about these startups ahead of time so it's all gonna be kind of fresh and there's a comment section do you see the comments section sean like where people are chatting yeah so like if there's any good questions and also on the skype they can invest right like they can put in money yeah so like if they see something i i don't think they can like they're not literally gonna fund the company right there but they're gonna say like i'm interested let's talk and honestly that's probably what i'm gonna do i'd never like on these things i know i cannot like i've seen these things and someone's like i'm in for a hundred thousand dollars and they say they're like right on the spot i'm not that impulsive are you uh yeah i'm that impulsive uh and it's also more dramatic so i'm a sucker for the drama i'll do it all right all right well at least one of us will um and then do you if you go to the chat of this video thing you'll see the order of of people that they're gonna go and um we're gonna talk to one person i think they get two minutes and then we get eight minutes to talk to them and then it's gonna say like time's up move to the next one does that make sense this is pretty sick let's do this all right uh we have john hancock uh from stonks is like our assistant here he's going to be feeding a startup so john do you want to bring the first one up john is that a real name i don't think so hey guys what's up tarus how's it going thank you so much for the time okay take it away awesome my name is darris i'm the founder and ceo of 5x um been fortunate enough to spend my career in the data space from being the first data engineer at salesforce the most recently running data for wework supporting thousands of employees over the last few years been super interested in the modern data stack it's estimated that over 77 of companies in the next 10 years in some way shape or form are going to use the modern data stack the problem is that there's a big disconnect in what vendors are selling today and what customers need over 90 of customers are investing in data to get a business roi yet the vendors are really focused on selling individual categories what this means is that customers have to have expertise they need to sign multiple contracts they need to stitch this together all of this is taking away from actually getting business output 5x is the first end-to-end data platform which is focused on business output so we license and integrate with the different vendors in the space and as an end result we can provide customers with an end-to-end platform depending on their use cases industry size budget on top of this we also have a services model where we can give companies access to high quality engineers who are pre-trained on the stack today we interview hundreds of engineers fully automated and we get to hide the top 0.1 percent end result customers can implement end-to-end data strategies in weeks instead of spending time signing all these contracts for less than a year old million dollar run rate on a poc with zero marketing and we're super excited that we are going to be profitable by the end of this month all right uh good stuff um sam so uh what does this business do that's what i'm i'm trying to i i was trying to interrupt you earlier but i think i was muted um i need can you kind of dumb this down for me for a little bit i'm looking at you so so let me for the listeners all right so the website is 5x dot co right now you are raising 300 000 at a 25 million valuation you got to a million dollars in arr in less than a year i don't know what poc means when i see poc at people of color that's what i thought about that point of contact okay so like uh some companies are telling you that they're gonna pay you up to a million dollars right or collectively or they actually have they actually are paying us monthly and dude you got a million dollars at a proof of concept that sounds pretty sick to me okay but i'm gonna be honest i don't know what the hell you do can you explain to me i've never worked at a big company before so i'm kind of like a big dumb idiot it's not just for big companies think of you know if you want to get value from data fundamentally you need two things you need infrastructure you need tools infrastructure you might have heard of tableau or snowflake and the second thing you need is people now the way the infrastructure is working today is every vendor is really focused on one small part of the stack so if you want to do something like analytics you need to go sign four or five different vendors sign these upfront contracts and stitch this together yourself now if an industry is going to become mainstream then you can't really expect ninety percent of customers who don't know when you say words like vendors it's it's still hard for me understand give me a very specific example you used network format yeah you use the format that's like um x x company had y problem yeah they tried z but the problem with z is this so then we came in and we do it differently instead sure so x company you know wants to figure out whether the customer name name yeah name sorry that was actually used one of our customers bank novo wants to figure out where the customers are coming from how do they personalize the app how do they save costs and you know optimize this sort of cash flow they now don't know where to go they can go buy a single reporting tool like tableau but the end-to-end data strategy is a lot more comprehensive there's a lot more than just having a dashboarding tool instead of having to hire multiple engineers instead of having to go sign all of these different tools and vendors they come to 5x 5x instantly gives them an end-to-end platform which has got all of these vendors we license these vendors and can give customers an end-to-end platform on top of this if bank if bank nova doesn't have the resources to figure out how to go use it they can add uh engineers on our site who are pre-trained on the platform end result they're getting business output in weeks whereas if they tried to go do this themselves it would be 12 times slower and six times more expensive all right that's way better um and one question how on earth did you get people to spend a million dollars with you on a proof of concept because this sounds like a very hard thing to sell and a million dollars is a lot of money on and is it actually like they're gonna pay you a certain amount of money every single year yeah so you know at the moment you know we so in the next two months our self-service platform will be live right so anyone will be able to go to 5x enter the credit card for a few hundred bucks a month you'll have the you'll have the you'll have the platform so early stage companies can do this by spending very little money what we do today because the self-service platform isn't ready we combine the a semi-automated platform plus a services model so you get engineers plus you get uh plus you get the platform so our average order value at this point is about 10k a month um multiply that by about 10 15 customers we're at a million dollar plus fund rate which basically means you're doing it by hand from now and then you're uh raising money so you can automate it all correct it's semi-automated already it would take a consultant about three or four months just to give you that platform they would go build it and they would start from scratch we do it in less than one day today that's pretty semi-automated and where are these customers coming from so let's dig into this 1 million of ar so you said you got 10k per customer roughly 10 15k um and roughly 10 customers that are paying you monthly right now um so you got 100k a month uh you know roughly roughly in revenue where did these customers come from is this inbound outbound do you have a growth strategy like do you have a strategy that would just lead you to the next 3 million also sure at the moment we've done zero marketing we've been really been focused on on the platform we have been producing content on my linkedin um on youtube mainly getting customers by word of mouth and by that so really the last eight months were early on using this to the proof of contra uh using this as a proof of concept this is not just a technology problem you have to convince all of the vendors in the space to give you api access to provision them integrate with them build for them um so you know you need it's a little bit of a chicken and an egg problem where you need customers and at the same time you need to show these vendors that you that you they actually is traction and we become an added sales channel for them huh okay i uh what else sean uh i guess i'll just give you a little bit of feedback on the pitch itself so um a couple things your house or wherever you're at super nice um almost distractingly nice i kind of like my founders to be a little more uh scrappy than that just gonna put that out there where are you i'm in bali oh he's in bali man it's probably it's probably not the most uh expensive place yeah yeah fair enough uh second thing um you know i think you wanna i think you tried to get the most information into the pitch whereas i think you kind of want to slow down and you need to just like work on that first 30 seconds to figure out the thing that i was confused about samus confused about most of the chat if you look on stonks was confused about which was i don't really know what this does right when you say end to end that makes sense to you because you're knee-deep in it but for us we've never heard of 5x before so we're like end to end what and yeah you know all of the all of the words were quite um you know generic so like you know vendors blah blah and uh and so you what you want to do is basically just be able to to paint a picture so you know did you ever work at a company that had this problem or if you've ever been the marketing manager to company you know that you spend almost you know six months getting your analytics platform and then integrating it and then you have to get your crm and then integrate it then you have to do this and then integrate it and so it takes months just to get set up with the things you need to be able to see your business and every business has the same problem so what we do is we go to that person and we say hey use us and you get xyz right benefits out of this and people are choosing it because of this we got a million dollars in uh an ar already as a you know during our pilot just you know in a couple weeks or whatever it is now i'm kind of more engaged what else here and look this is actually quite easy what year did you join wework someone in the chat said this guy made a bunch of money off the wework ipo and then i just went to your website and it said you worked at wework so i don't know what the truth is i joined in i think or 2017. uh i did not make money off the ipo that's okay that's irrelevant i i mean that would have been sick if you were it looks like you did because you're in that nice house but um i guess what i was trying to get at is i would do exactly what sean said but i would use the wework story so we were at when i when i worked at we were because you were the head of data it looked like at wework or something like like some like pretty you led data for wework your bio says that sounds impressive it doesn't matter if it is but it sounds like it and so i would use the story of like i led data at wework when we were this size and i grew the company to this size and a problem that we consistently had was blank blank blank and we solved it by hiring tons of people and it was still like riddled with heirs and and talking to other people in this data world i noticed they all had the same problem and so to bootstrap this company and get it off the ground i hired a couple friends and we actually have been doing this by hand and we convinced x y and z to give us some money and slowly or quickly we've actually automated a lot of it um and we've automated by doing x y and z so now all these companies who want to get this thing done they can actually use us and instead of hiring 30 people they just use have one person use this bit of software and it saves them x amount of money in x amount of time you know what i mean like i have by the way i'm just totally written i don't know any of this is true no that was great but you know what i mean yeah totally um but now if we should just get to the product i think it sounds neat and it looks like my good friend ankur invested and he's actually quite um he's actually quite impressive as he knows his [ __ ] i think it's a cool company yeah i would i would definitely just based off your traction alone i would want to learn more because okay uh you know a good pitch is not necessarily a good business but good traction is usually a good business and so you actually have good traction at a bad pitch that's okay so i would want to learn more and uh and dig in to understand how much of this is a service and consulting business versus is this going to be software and this is going to be automated because it sounds like you've actually found a problem that people care about um we'll see how how kind of durable that is and then we can go from there so um thanks for coming on man i think you know for both of us it seems like the answer is like we'd actually want to learn a little bit more and look at the deck before we uh we go too far amazing thank you thank you you're awesome thanks for uh bringing brave and doing this so sean he um so on this stocks platform it says he's got 75 000 of interest i do agree this potentially is more of a services play um but we actually just talked about that company worldwide technology and this sounds just like it doesn't it yeah there's there's several companies that are like this uh there's a lot of a lot of sas companies that have like a like either a consulting thing that's how they get it embedded or it's like just an ongoing revenue stream and it actually can get quite substantial so i don't think that's a complete um no i didn't i didn't think about that i didn't mean that as a disc i kind of said it as like uh is this just this consulting company because if it was just a consulting company i would not do it but um but yeah i i was just so confused for half the time i didn't really get to think about uh didn't really get to think about the business to be honest i was trying to figure out what that does yeah that was a little bit of an error hopefully he'll fix that but uh this type of business i think it'd be sick to own i don't know if you if i don't know why you'd want to raise money if you got a million dollars in just selling by the way the simple test here is uh like just say the first like 30 to 60 seconds of your pitch to somebody and then be like uh to a friend and just be like um hey can you play that back to me like so based on what i said what does my company do like and what you want to know is do they get it first of all like you have to get it and then are you interested in it does it sound compelling and if it's like if you don't get it it's not compelling like don't move forward don't go to the rest of the pitch and you need a friend or you need like random people who are going to do that and the format you use was good because you you sort of like added the team and credibility well when i was leaving data for wework right you know uh all the shenanigans were going on but in my little corner of the world we actually had this much you know this big problem that we had to deal with and uh that's where i kind of realized that every company has this issue that they can blank blank and it's like oh yeah that's a good format generically for a pitch yeah i agree um all right uh john hancock you want to send us the next one all right all right kenny you got it hey guys thanks for having me on the show so i am kenny i'm one of the co-founders of baccarat and we've built the world's first online marketplace for group airfare and the problem that we set out to solve is that group airfare flights of 10 or more people traveling to together it's sold offline so what does this mean say that you are a uh you're organizing an 8th grade school trip and you're flying 50 people from san francisco to orlando if you want to shop for uh for quotes you actually have to call the air call the airlines group desk over the phone and once you get something that you like well the offline nature of groups doesn't end there it's really important to note that group airfare is unlike booking a normal ticket so it actually takes place in five unique stages and that's from shopping to deposit to final payments and make names list and before baccarat all of that happened over the phone so we thought in 2022 this is insane that a world with so much money in it uh operates totally offline so we created what's like a b2b expedia-like marketplace for shopping for flights of 10 or more people in terms of traction we we did launch baccarat in october of 2021 we have really strong growth great unit economics and we're actually profitable um as a business model we make between 10 and 15 margin on flights and from january to april we've done 4.2 million dollars worth of total sales we take about 1700 in revenue per per group and have 40 corporate customers that are using the platform today and one of the most exciting things that happened as a result of the pandemic is we got a ton of inbound from corporate meeting and team off sites that are looking to book group airfare it's our fastest growing customer segment and it's caused us to build out a bunch of tools to meet the needs of meeting planners and you're probably asking why is uh why is this the team to bring group airfare from analog to digital well we have really deep uh domain expertise in group travel our ceo eric previously sold a tour operator business where he kind of learned the ropes of the business and then our team internally from the service side to the tech side we have a lot of deep expertise in travel tech and we think that we have a shot to be both the storefront and the underlying operating system for group airfare so we'd love to answer any questions that you have about our business are we live or can you hear us dude the top comment is actually pretty funny which it says fly together and brewflights.com is available uh go buy the domain yeah go buy the domain yeah get on that one you got the uh the stocks chat adding value here they're the real value-add investor i love this also i like how you just like looked downstairs like ma go buy the domain wow the meatloaf yeah i thought you were like a chinese gambling website when you uh when you first came on i thought this is baccarat well based on your last podcast that wouldn't be a bad idea too this is crazy fair enough let me ask a clarifying question on the pitch you said that you get 10 to 15 percent and i think your chart said did your chart say a hundred thousand a month in bookings or did it well your i forget what you but you you said four million did you believe attraction slide again yeah it was like four million between january and april does that mean that between january january and april you did four million but then yeah so we gmv correct we did yeah exactly so we've sold 4.2 million dollars worth of group airfare and we're averaging about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a month in revenue and that's the revenue that like it's real revenue and how old's the business so we started in 2018 uh we survived the pandemic just barely um and then probably like half of our clients kind of uh didn't make the pandemic so it's kind of like a fresh restart for us um prior to us launching flight shopping we were just a trip management platform for tour operators so like if someone did like a lot of student travel sending people to like dc and orlando they would use our trip management platform just a way to stay organized and make sure that they don't miss deposits and final balances uh and then we had a lot of time to ourselves during the pandemic so we made flight shopping because it was our number one request people don't want to call the airlines for quotes and then how many people work there we have 11 now cool got it okay okay um so maybe in each of these sam when we do like uh first i kind of like clarifying questions slash like reaction to the business and then maybe some pitch feedback at the end of like how to get that better but like okay so reactions to the business and clarifying questions so um you are trying to do group travel uh for corporate and um and you said something at the beginning which was like it's insane that there isn't really a good solution for something with this much money in it i didn't catch did you say how much is spent booking group travel every year yeah so i didn't it's about 130 billion dollars worth of just total group spend um and that equates to about five percent of an error line's revenue so floating around about 225 million passengers fly as part of a group um pre-pandemic okay cool so five percent of airline rev airline revenue is done via these groups and that's all kind of the over the phone or something like some other old-school method at the current currently exactly yep okay cool and then what's the why now because people have been doing like travel startups forever uh like you know booking.com priceline these were i think booking.com person came out like in 1995 or something crazy like that yeah and so why has nobody tackled this part of it because i've seen travel startups in every angle but what is there anything that's unlocked now or you're just you finally have a great idea what's going on here no so not finally have the great idea uh we do have some people that are competitors that sell a sas solution to airlines that allow airlines to make like a white label version of what of what what we do the why now is before the pandemic lufthansa american airline united is rumored to be working on it they want to go digital for their groups and they've actually instituted a private white label and so we see it happening in the same way that like single tickets came online we think groups will come online so the airlines are already starting to do the underlying tech and we think that's amazing and we want to be basically that that second shelf that they sell their their their group airfare in how are you getting the customers now because isn't travel like the hardest like uh when i think of like hardcore customer acquisition people i think of like online gambling i think of gaming and then like travel yeah like that seems like the most cut one of the most cutthroat industries to get customers because i think um the guys who started reddit started hit monk and uh it didn't work out because they just like couldn't get like or you know it wasn't as big nearly as big as reddit uh how are you getting those customers yeah so currently right now about 99 of our business is b2b so we get customers really in two core ways uh one we have a referral pro of referral program so we are a we're a preferred partner for like meeting planners and tour operators in the student travel space and if you refer us business we give you like five dollars per uh per per ticket book that has been enough to send us so much business that we have to like hire and raise money uh then the second way is kind of old school like industry events are still really popular just meeting with meeting planners and tour operators uh and then something that we'll try to get better with um in time is like seo there's not a lot of of competition for like the keywords group airfare before the pandemic we got it down to like 72 cents a click um but admittedly since we just survived and we didn't have the capital to run a bunch of marketing experiments uh we're not doing any paid at the moment and then until now you get a bunch of savages in the chat that are all going to start beating you up they already bought the domain fly together before you can get it so explain what are the terms of the raise so you're raising how much at what valuation yeah so we would like to raise 1.5 million dollars at a 15 million cap great and so for somebody listen to the podcast there's people who listen to podcasts that don't uh they're not part of like the angel investing scene how does a couple are you just 15 million dollars wait but you said you're doing 150 000 a month in revenue so is it some revenue multiple just explain where's this 15 million magic number come from for you yeah so um we have our customers book pretty far out so like our average customer books nine nine months out so through the end of the year we should make about 1.5 1.6 million dollars in revenue and so we just took that top line number and times it by 10 to kind of be safe no there's been crazy stuff happening but we want to be set up for success and fair so we just times it by 10. and then what is the like what's actually happening under the hood so you didn't show like a demo or search engine or how somebody actually does this is there are there apis are you just like calling the airline yourself under the hood like what's what's actually happening yeah so under the hood we are connected with two are you familiar with like travel technology no okay so really high level i know that where time is running out so we're connected to two gds's called saber and amadeus that's how we get the flight content and then we had to build some stuff on top to make sure that groups work because there's limitations of the legacy system but i think our time is up and that could be a whole podcast let me ask one let me ask one more question um this is something that i love asking everyone that i invest in which is like 5 10 15 years down the line how does this how big how much revenue are you gonna be making and how am i gonna get my money back yeah i think that we can be both the store the the store front and the underlying pipes for groups so uh if you were thinking about getting like a ride you would open the uber app if you were thinking about booking flights of 10 or more i think that you come to back right.com but how do i and so how big do you think the business will get and what's gonna happen someone's gonna buy you for a billion dollars someone's gonna buy you 100 million dollars you're going to go public what do you think will happen yeah there's a there's a really uh a really clear path for us that we get to like 50 million dollars in revenue in the next like five to six years um and beyond that i'm not totally sure but i the path to 50 is pretty clear that's a good answer okay yeah that's a great answer uh in general fantastic pitch actually uh the thing i was saying before gotta be clear gotta be compelling in the first minute you were extremely clear extremely compelling i think it's pretty pretty clear you know your stuff uh as you were asked questions about it you had good honest answers you didn't oversell but you um you got to the point on on each one of those questions so i think a really strong really strong pitch as far as i'm concerned yeah i would i i i'd love to learn more cool awesome that was a good one it was very it was very very very very clear one thing that wasn't clear which is like uh how big is this pro i mean i don't know anything about group flights and it turns out so he said it's like it it's a hundred billion dollars worth of tickets booked a year as group flight is that what he said 130 billion of group spend which is five percent of all airline revenues what he said yeah he buried the lead on that one a little bit yeah exactly so like you know that question we asked that's got to go to the front of his presentation which is like um yeah booking group travel sucks and by the way this sounds like it might just be this fringe thing but there's over 130 billion a year going through uh group group travel and today that's all done still on the phone which is crazy because most of all other ticketing 98 other 80 of the other ticketing is just done online now yeah that's going to happen for group travel and we're going to make it happen right i would have been like all right so group travel is defined as 10 or more tickets guess how much revenue is booked per year doing that yeah guess how much revenue is a nice one a confidence b makes the other person insecure c they're almost always going to guess wrong when you have a really high number because they just don't have right the right framework you say 128 billion that's 5 of all tickets are booked that way and guess how they book it they have to call the airline and book it all like manually it's a pain in the butt like that's how i would have done it but he did he did really good and i would put a screenshot of the website be like this is a you know if i go to like whatever delta or i go to expedia like look all the there's a million buttons on the screen there's not one if you want to find the group button go to help go to phone this is where you go for that this is where 130 billion flows through right like i really emphasize that problem and then i'd show my screen which is like a google search engine that's like here's how it works on fly together you just go here you just say how many people where you're going and then we take care of the rest we do a bunch of crazy stuff under the hood to make that automated um and it's working we have you know we've done 4 million in bookings so far that translated into 150 000 a month of revenue for us so we're on a x mil you know 2 million run rate and uh by the end of the year blah blah blah dude i agree everything said one thing that what it bothered there's two things that when startups when i'm talking to them that bothers me one is when they use arr and it's not actually annually recurring revenue and they're like well it means um at annual run rate i'm like dog come on you know like none of us like use that word that way and the second thing is when they say revenue but it's gmv which stands for i don't gross merchandise volume so it's like if you're ebay you sell technically like let's say a hundred billion worth of stuff but ebay only captures five percent of that you know i'm making that up but like i i need it's so confusing to me when they say that i wrote this note during the thing right like i have this little white board here i'm writing on i wrote revenue presented weirdly because he wrote 4.2 million in sales but it was like that's an aggregate over five months then he wrote like uh we take 1.7 per customer it's like dude just say how much revenue you have like make that the first one we do this much per month per year that's our current run rate that's that's not gmv that's what we take home in terms of gmv we've done this much right like that would be a big improvement over uh over the attraction side but very very cool company though you want to do another one mr hancock where yeah hello what's up all good and uh thanks for doing that it's actually really fascinating so my name is oren i'm the co-founder and ceo of munch and i'm accompanied by peter my co-founder and cto and we both have i have too many years of experience in business and tech leadership growers and we've been building much for the past few months getting out of the validation phase and into our mvp and initial attraction so what is munch think about your favorite youtuber apart from results let's say this person has 1 million subscribers on youtube now what if i tell you that chances are that this person has almost all of other content professionals has only one to two successful distribution platforms i mean this is mostly the case in in almost all cases this is because it takes a lot of time money professional know-how to succeed on each and every social platform it's actually pretty different to be successful on tiktok or facebook or instagram or youtube totally different platforms and different audiences due to that most of them don't even try to to put it in that effort and kind of give up even though it can grow their revenue streams and their monetization potential quite quite in quite a reasonable numbers so we are a team of builders dreamers and coding curators on a mission to build the first platform that we serve as a home for content creating professionals there are no other platforms currently serving as a home as a place that the current profession can do everything from creating their their new content based on data driven processes repurposing the content for different types of platforms doing research on what's the next next content that they want to create and actually distribute it on all platforms and monetize the content creation market is currently estimated at around 65 billion dollars with an annual growth rate of 15 this means that it will get to 140 billion dollars by 2026 and combine that with the creator economy we're talking about 200 billion dollars market it's a rather big market and we are currently raising five hundred thousand dollars on top of the nine hundred thousand dollars that we already raised we have 250 000 already committed and we're looking for 250 more the idea is to take this money and use it to boost our dev team and create the first version of the product by this november increase of traction and start and start testing different pricing levels with their initial paying customers so we're looking for some new partners that can actually teach us a bit more about the media business okay first of all let me say the people who are not english speaking and pitch [ __ ] awesome that would i cannot imagine how hard that it's not easy it's not easy i could tell it wasn't easy it you did pretty good but uh golly that seems like a rough thing to have to learn how to do congratulations we can barely speak when it's our native language so you know uh respect for that um okay now i could be mean that was a horrible pitch though uh i respect the attempt but the actual structure of the pitch um was just not great and uh like you know in the chat here on stonks on a scale of one to ten ten being that was super clear and compelling one being i was cloudy and not compelling give it a score one to ten i'm curious what it was for for you guys one being low not clearing compelling ten being very very clear and compelling type it in the chat and they're on like a way they're on like a 15 second delay by the way so i'm saying an eight and then two two three two one three one two one two one one one right okay so your job orin is to get that two into an eight right because like right now i can barely even give you kind of feedback on the business itself like i went to your website so i went to getmunch.com and it looks like basically what you're doing is a creator spends a ton of time let's say making a video or a long form post they're kind of drained by the end of that and um and so they post it on the one platform they post on youtube you take that content you turn it into clips you put it on tiktok you take that content you turn it into tweets you you basically repurpose the conte chop it up and repurpose it so they can get more juice out of the content they made is that right this is the penetration product this is what we currently do we currently have online and we can actually if you want to see an example and i allow myself to take one of do your like to see that can you see that yes okay so um let's take for example this episode okay it was from april 6th i kind of played around with it and what you have here is our system choosing between three to five the most engaging parts of the original video what do you mean by engaging we do analysis both on scenes and visuals and any different types of audio effects as well as analyze with using ai the actual spoken words in the in the video in order to understand what would be the best clips that can fit into let's say a one minute tick tock or a three minute stick talk or one minute instagram reel so the idea is that you as a creator can get your original video chopped up into like you said into a few clips and then turn from landscape to portrait so we can publish it directly to the other uh to the other platform okay so this is go ahead yeah i'm i am human optimization sean have you ever heard of jelly smacked i'm shocked or you didn't talk about them you've heard of jelly smack right i was waiting for you to raise their name yeah we heard about the tickets actually we love jelly smack we love what they're doing and we love the fact that they're doing all the market education for us talking to content creators about content repurposing it and the fact that you can be successful equally on all platforms but genius mac and again we really admire what they're doing oh come on we really admire what they're doing but they've been around for six and a half years and they have 500 customers and 2 000 employees manual labor is not really high-tech new kind of what we're looking for using nlp and computer vision we can do what jlsmeg does fully automatic on a self-service basis and fully scalable this is a whole new level of content management and just to be clear we're starting with content repurposing the idea is that we distribute the content for the content creator on their behalf on all platforms so we can take back the the analytics that we get from the platforms and then create a kind of a cockpit in which the content creator sees everything that is going on and can understand what exactly they need to focus on where is their niche what is the topic they need to talk more about and and kind of you know progress along the lines that every content piece can become 30 to 50 different types of common pieces that create more data that you can then analyze and then create the whole public loop so yeah this is the idea well i have a question really quick but what's stopping this to me maybe there's a world where this kind of becomes like the uh um you know buffer buffer.com started just by like you would schedule like tweets to go out and then like everyone kind of offered that same thing and that feature became somewhat of a commodity is there a world where this this thing that you've built becomes a commodity and you actually have to offer more stuff like for example i don't actually know if this is true because i don't entirely know how they work but it seemed like jelly smack one of the ways they make money is they actually don't charge the creator but they put ads on the creators videos and they take a cut and so it's like the technology that they're offering is just like a feature and the real value is that they are giving the creators more revenue by giving them an ad split and would be the money maker yeah yeah so is there a world where this technology you have really just becomes a commodity and you got to offer other stuff in order to keep people on yeah so the idea is is actually you know like drop shippers have shopify and marketers have spot content creditors will have munch and the idea behind that is that currently there is no platform like that there's a lot of vacuum in this space and currently this vacuum has been filled by hundreds of thousands of freelancers on fiverr uproar and little to uh to medium agencies so this is something that people already consume but either they're paying premium money for their services or they're giving up like between and these are real numbers 30 to 50 percent of the revenue that has been generated by the agencies so yeah the idea is that it's going to be the central platform for content creators the central copy they can use and in terms of the business model if this is what you're asking so we have like two options and we're currently we're still preceded we still you know playing around experimenting with the business models we can do both things we can charge a premium fee for the premium features and there's there's a lot of things that we can charge for like you know creating taking your podcast and creating twitter threads for the next month that we can disable the right time or we can just use this inventory that is being created via munch and integrate brands into it and do brandees and get money from brands and pay the creators so we're still not sure which business model will win right we experiment with both in the next few months but yeah it's like um looks like a huge potential so so i would not be interested in investing in this business uh for a couple reasons but i would say like you know the main the main two is like i feel like it's going to be based on how difficult it was to get us interested in the business i think you're gonna creators are super busy uh a thousand opportunities coming at them at all times and it seems like you're gonna have to really punch through the noise in order to be able to get there and i don't really have confidence you're gonna be able to do that that's kind of the first piece uh second is like any time somebody's using ai i'm like oh okay you know i gotta see it to believe it now what i will say is your pitch with the slides was putting me to sleep but the pitch where you showed my face i'm like oh wait this is me great you know so so i would i would definitely lead with the demo uh but and that's not just for us because we create content a lot of people create content a lot of investors do but even if it wasn't us hey this is a popular podcast blah blah blah so here it is it's the one hour thing not everybody's going to watch it today they pay you know editors and social media people thousands of dollars a month to go find good clips cut them out post them on tick tock post them on whatever because they know they're leaving so much growth on the table if they don't do it but with munch they'd either be able to do it themselves or they can hand this tool to their person so they can make ten times more clips um you know and and not have to hire as many people and so then you're explaining you know the like your demo was the most impressive part of your thing where you're like look long video push a button i get a properly formatted clip option and i have you know 10 of these that i can choose from and we're trying to do this all automatically right so so i think that you can you can make your thing more compelling um if you kind of like work on how you explain it versus like it was all intellectual it was all theory based whereas you want it to be story based right so instead of saying you know content creators fa you know have complexity when it comes to managing multiple platforms that's intellectual uh you want to make it a story which is like here's these guys they do this stuff they record this three-hour thing the last thing they want to do is this or hey for your podcast right now we have a 5 000 clip contest running it's like you're paying five thousand dollars just for somebody to cut clips of your of your video into a tick tock what if i told you that i had a tool that would do that automatically for you and your producer could just go do this you know in 10 minutes after the thing they don't have to re-watch the video they don't have to do blank blank blank they have to resize it they don't have to export it we've done all of that for you um and the best part is you know blank and so i think you can make this a lot more compelling but as it is right now i would not be interested in the business well thanks for the feedback um for that reasoning i'm out do we do the shark tank thing i don't know yeah yeah yeah yeah thanks for the feedback and regarding customer acquisition actually this is exactly what we're doing we we're creating preemptively the videos for them and then we send them uh via an email marketing machine that currently has like a four to five percent conversion rate and a database of eight hundred hundred thousand creators on youtube and we're using influencer marketing because it turns out after talking with more than 100 content creators the way that they learn about new tools and new platforms is by watching bigger influencers so we're using influencers in order to get to more more customers it's kind of neat because we just got to 2 000 users in less than two months so yeah it's it's kind of starting to grow cool sam anything else on your side the same question um that i that i asked the other folks and i don't know why you guys aren't doing it but paint the picture of like uh how's this gonna make me wealthier you know like like i like get down to like my my primal ins my like my primal desire here of like i'm giving you money so how big is this going to get and how do you sell or go public and i get paid more than what i gave you uh you know like paint that picture for me yeah so why once we have 5 000 users paying users we're gonna hit the one million dollar arr it's an actual error because it's a recurring revenue once you uh charge them on the monthly basis uh and there is a serious uh virality um and symptom in the area of content creation it's kind of a plg because once you create content with munch we have our logo and some mention to munch on on the content the idea is that other creators are watching and getting into the game so it's gonna be a very very quick growth in terms of sizes current market is 65 billion dollars it's gonna grow aggressively in the next few years so you know sky is the limit uh it's going to be a unicorn it's going to be a big company and this is what we're aiming for good i appreciate you thank you very much thanks for coming thank you sir bye i uh sean man like what i was saying to him about the the english uh thing dude it is if you don't speaking if you have an accent you are at such a legit like just in terms of logistics and understanding everything you are at such a disadvantage for these things it's a really really hard thing to overcome and it's i mean it's cool that people uh overcome it but holy moly i would not want to be in that position it is tough right it is really hard and um and you know i feel like uh that's why i think that the deck and the story i think need to be kind of like crafted well so that that can be the kind of like universal language that you're working with as you as you go through this i like as an investor and even just like when i'm never trying to assess out anything i have to work extra hard to be like okay this person well like a lot of times we're investing sometimes we're investing just on charm like all right this person is charming enough that i feel as though they're they can convince other customers to buy or they can convince employees to join their company uh you know that's like kind of like that adam wework guy thing and then there's other times where i'm like okay but like what's the idea here is the idea good and i have to kind of challenge myself to be like uh to like look beyond where they currently are because of maybe like a lack of it's just hard to understand man that it makes a difference and and i have to like overcome that a little bit yeah and i would say some of my best investments have come from very charismatic ceos and some of my absolute worst investments have come from charismatic ceos it cuts both ways by the way i can't get into stocks it's like dead for me um i had to refresh it as well and everyone in the chat is saying they had a refresher too yeah when i refreshed them let me know but all right uh either way that's okay i don't need that open we want to do another one i think one more or two more one more there's allison nickel pass all right zaza sorry i don't know who's presenting all right that's me okay guys how are you you guys can see my brain i think they can all right what's going on uh name is zaza ceo and co-founder of nickel pass before this i was the head of international expansion at huffington post after that i was groomed to be the cro where i discovered we were not profitable we were the largest news site in the world outside of china and i didn't know before i took the job that we actually hadn't found a way to monetize the 200 million people coming to our websites globally i'm allison powell ceo and co-founder um part of this i was actually a banker for about 10 years and our way of sharing news and information on the team was to have my ea print out an article leave it on the center conference table and say please read and that's certainly not a way of sharing news and information that scales when you're working on remote teams distributed teams and asynchronous teams so nickel pass really solves for all of that um and awesome i'll just jump in one of the things that we've come up with is the what we call cocktail party pitch uh when we're at a party people are like what does nickle pass do and what we say is you know how you get uh an article from a friend shared with you and you get that pop up that says pay for the full site well we invented a product where you never see that again and the way our business works is we sell it to enterprises which allows them to get up to 70 off of retail and we customize the past based on what each department and team and user needs to be successful so here's the nickel pass i'm in front of a business insider paywall i click the button oops i don't think there we go okay there we go through the paywall so i hit a paywall i go to my nickel pass which is a chrome extension click on business insider and that's it i never see a paywall again so it looks like we're having a little bit of who's sharing what but you guys saw the product um a couple of things about the business so because of our background the chairman of the company is the former head of strategy at cnn uh we've been able to collect a network of over 200 publications including the la times uh crunchbase pro time magazine and we always like to point out that beer business daily is on here for a reason if i'm an enterprise we work with anheuser-busch they don't need just the new york times they also need uh beer business daily which tells them about how the craft beer market is doing in the pacific northwest uh in terms of the business we booked over a million in revenue so that's a million of hard revenue and 1.2 of bookings some of uh the companies we work with include anheuser-busch as mentioned visa and also publicist and havas which are respectively the number one and number two marketing and pr agencies in the world in terms of why people come to us if you wanted to get these subscriptions yourself be our guest it costs you over a thousand dollars a year just for five different sites obviously that's not going to scale if you're an enterprise and some of the other problems in the space and the reason we've been able to get so much traction 18 months uh number two there is no tech enabled way to buy group subscriptions so if you wanted 10 licenses from the new york times today you're essentially filling out a form and then number three uh now three out of every four news sites require a subscription or have a paywall when we started the business now a little over three years ago that number was at uh 30 so about one in three sites so we'll stop there this is awesome this is awesome so we can just recap uh because i think some people are having trouble in the stocks platforms they might have missed the beginning of the pitch but basically what you did is i work at a company i go try to click some article to read some important news story that some my coworker sent me i hit with a pay wall oh hey man what did it say i don't have a business insider subscription and our company which is let's pretend we work at google oh google uses nickel pass so i can just use the chrome extension and bypass the paywall because google has paid for a multi-seat uh license to business insider so business insider is getting this huge bulk subscription buy and they'll give it at a discount google wants its employees to be able to read news and employees don't have to pay for it out of pocket that's what happens that's that's that's exactly i'll add some other things publishers right now convert less than one percent of the people that come to their website to pay for the full subscription so it's a win-win for everyone where they they're basically getting all these people that they would be monetizing at cents on the dollar per year from advertising but do you if if google buys 20 seats do they only get business insider or do they also get all the other publications you had listed there and if they if the second one how do you figure out who which publisher gets paid what money right yeah so we have over 200 publishers in our network we add more every day we create bespoke packages so how we have an initial package that's you pick six out of ten publications it includes business insider and many others and that's 23.95 a user a month for that package after that we'll upsell from there and we work with customers to design custom packages based on the industry you're in and the role you're in in your industry so if you work at a big bank and you're in marketing in pr you're going to need a very different set of publications than someone who's at the coms team at google but you will be able to work with you to customize that and a lot of that you're now able to do on your own on our administrative panel but then how does uh if let's just use round numbers let's say it's thirty dollars a month does this and you have two publications does business insider get ten dollars new york times get ten dollars and you guys get ten dollars so what we do is we work with the publishers to either take rate cards they have or create ones from scratch and so that way in the custom package the publishers always made holes so in your example it all depends on the number of seats that google signs up with so if they sign up with uh 10 people or a thousand people the price may go from 10 a month which is a 20 discount off of retail to two dollars a month which is you know much more off of retail and then we bundle that and then charge an administrative fee on top of that and that's the bespoke package what's the fee percent uh so right now gross margin is anywhere from 44 to 55 um and that's a combination of not only the seat fee but we integrate with uh octa microsoft active directory so it's really single sign-on for news public defense and we basically handle all of the admin uh for both the enterprise and the publisher that's amazing so uh let's talk let's talk about the traction okay so you showed a bunch of publications that you guys have gotten to agree with this how many companies are paying for this i don't know if i i missed that part or uh it wasn't in there yeah yep so we have over 125 companies who we currently work with and we're we're adding more every day both uh smaller companies as well as large enterprises uh and what does that mean for revenue for you guys yep so we're at 1.2 million um arr and we're on track to be 3 million by the end of the year and raising at a 15 million valuation and that's 3 million as in net revenue and you get or is that three million as in you there's three million there's three million for the bundle and you take 45 to 50 of it that's right the second one correct so more like 1.5 million is that in real net revenue is that right in net revenue yes 1.5 and um okay great and so and how do you how do you onboard customers so what do you do to go get the next 25 50 customers what what happens well i think one of the things that we're really excited about is the 120 companies we have they have over 400 000 employees so what we found is that it's much easier to upsell within an organization once you land them so what we're seeing is that our gross trajectory if we go from the one percent to three percent that's how you get to the three and that's why only focusing on two segments right now marketing and pr and then consumer finance that doesn't count telco doesn't count on some of the tech companies you mentioned it doesn't count international which is actually my background post gotcha so you're just going to expand within the companies you're already in to get to to get to three million okay but how do you get more customers uh from here what is the strategy is it outbound is it inbound is it yeah program what do you do yep yeah it's we primarily have a cold outbound marketing strategy um so we do a lot of lead gen and then we do some organic search and organic social and now this is a cost to companies at a time when a lot of companies are cutting costs right so today they're just not paying for this and employees are just not getting the benefit or they're paying you know employees pay out of pocket yeah um if i do this and i have you know one percent of my employees doing this all of a sudden i've added a i don't know what your what your average volume is but let's say 10 grand 10 10 grand uh a year what is the average cost of company so that that's grown when we first started it was roughly the seven to ten grand a year now what we're seeing is uh 50k um and that um having opportunity to grow and here's the thing you know people see it from two lenses so there's the cost savings and they look at our class and they're like well it's better than everyone buying it at retail and expensing it back to the company so that's one thing the second thing is in a time like this if you miss a critical piece of news in your industry the opportunity cost for that is much higher and so you're going to feel some type of way for not paying the 50 bucks per person per seat because you're like oh i was trying to like basically refine the cost we like to say what we're going after is the budget people used to use on soda machines because this is one of those oh oh i think we've lost those out there um but yes this is an expense that people actually already have they just don't realize that frequently it's being put on personal cards and then expensed back to the company so the other thing that we're doing is actually giving finance and procurement a single line on them so they really understand how much they're spending on news and information and data which for the 40 professional the 40 million thousand the 40 million professional services workers in the us is extremely important to know okay great uh i also feel like there's probably some strategy where you go to anheuser-busch and then has a you know once they have their one percent of people on you go to every other beer company out there and you say hey anheuser-busch does this so that their employees can read beer journal daily and this and that uh you know would you guys be interested there's a i think within industries you could sort of play play off each other a little bit exactly and we we've seen that um social proof model work extremely well with marketing and pr firms and with financial services firms allison how big is this going to get you know what are you what you're going to get to 100 million in recurring revenue what's going to happen yeah without a doubt so we are we see ourselves as really the next uh version of cable um and how we access news content and information um digitally is going to change drastically from how it it works today um and nickel pass is going to be the single stop solution for that what um how many employees let me ask that same question a little bit differently uh because sam likes to hear kind of how big is the dream i like to hear a little bit differently which is what would i need to believe for this to be at 100 million in revenue meaning how many companies how many people what how do you work your way to 100 million in revenue yeah so our goal has always been to get everyone access to quality news and information and by everyone we don't just mean professional services workers we also mean individuals and there's a certain price point that individuals can pay for access to quality news and information so we're exploring what that is but i think it's extremely important to note that over the past five years we've understood the general public so actually you're gonna be the math so like this many companies paying this much a month is 100 million in revenue and then i need to know is that a believable number of companies that's like you know out of the total universe so how many companies would you need to be paying you for you to be at that point yeah so we'd need to be at about um ten thousand companies based on on our initial math so 10 000 companies and um you think that those will you know right now you're at whatever 25 you think about the end of the year you can get to maybe 40 or 50 something like that uh oh no we're at 150 right sorry you're 150 great yeah we're you know well beyond the that initial group and what are you guys gonna have to do to go from 150 to 10 000 companies what will actually need to happen yeah so it's it's two-pronged it's that we have to increase our penetration rate on the existing companies from one percent to three percent um and that number is even achievable up to the five or ten percent range and then we have to increase our penetration in this in the specific sectors from currently 0.01 to uh closer to one percent in each sector so financial services marketing and pr um and then universities and associations as well gotcha okay all right thanks i think uh we might be able to add one more did you have you raised any money so far and from who yep yeah so we've raised about 5 million so far that's our last round was led by river park ventures so the seamless food ordering company co-founders because they took the same b to b model to get to a b to c model um and we have a number of uh other institutionals as well 68 capital rate ventures damn you raised 5 million at a 15 million valuation no smaller valuation in the past so this new this new round is uh 15 million free money oh so you gave up a lot of the company yeah what are you how are you gonna stay motivated you gotta yeah so i understood so we are um reworking the cap table as we speak because basically we pivoted the company from a blockchain micropayments and so that's total over the pivot that's uh by the way respect for pivoting away from blockchain that sort of shows me that you're a clear and independent thinker that didn't just like oh here's the trend we are a web three company for micro payments you can create a lightning and it's like what do people do our customers actually want and in this case you found out what they actually wanted which was not not that not something else yeah customers hated it publishers loved it but it wasn't selling to um to anyone as recurring revenue right and we could have raised it a much higher valuation but we chose to fit it i think i think your product is awesome it sounds like your cap table is shitty to be blunt i would love i would love to hear a little bit more about how i don't want to hear about it now but like how you're going to get out of that situation i think it's it's hopefully it's fixable because this product sounds pretty sick um and we gotta ask people are asking why what is nickel pass what is this name why are you named after nickelback uh news used to cost a nickel so that's okay why right great and now it costs 23 per person per month congratulations this is sick this is sick i think your pitch was awesome i said what i thought about the cap table the product's badass um one little thing between your act together though between you and your co-founder you guys should figure out who's going to answer questions and which types of questions so you automatically know when to defer because it's a little bit of a signal when you're doing a pitch and like both are kind of like me and sam does we talk over each other a little bit it's okay in a podcast or realm but as a company you kind of need to know okay technical questions this person's going to answer uh growth questions this person's going to answer uh or this one person's going to answer everything and then they're going to say you know allison why don't you talk about that you're you're you know she knows it's better than anybody and so you'll be able to kind of defer a little bit better um in that sense but good really good job overall with the pitch that's my only kind of pitch feedback for you great thank you guys this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform where everything is fully integrated well i can see the clients hold history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago i totally missed hubspot grow better sick sick company god damn man that cat table really [ __ ] things up for her yeah uh yeah i think that's okay though i think it's recoverable or um you know like some people like you know how are you gonna stay motivated some people are motivated you know the number whether the number whether they're on 50 or 35 percent they they sort of feel the same about it it's their baby and also they can be motivated by the regret that's giving away so much of the company that's crazy to me i i am i am friends with this guy who sold his company for a billion dollars and he 990 million and he walked away with three million dollars because he had it was five of them either or four of them so it was four or five of them and they raised all this money and he walked away with three million dollars on a billion dollar value sale and that crazy i i can't i don't understand how you get motivated when you're not gonna get paid yeah well some people uh some people motivated by the mission some people don't do the math some people are like well [ __ ] i'm stuck now i made that mistake and now uh i guess i gotta live with that i gotta i guess i gotta eat that one um and by the way shout out to her uh we don't do public math but we sure as hell make founders do public math when they pitch us uh because you know you gotta be able to answer that question in fact i don't even care what the like some people think that when i ask that question how do you get to 100 million or how do you get to 10 million arr i'm like judging whether uh i'm judging whether that thing sounds feasible or not and that's part of it but the bigger part of it is does this seem like the first time they've done this math or have they done this before because if they haven't done it if they haven't done it before i'm like oh this person's not actually thinking of plotting how to like take over and like how to build this into something big they're just kind of like buried their head in product and like they may not have if they haven't thought of it up till now they're probably not going to be thinking about that in the future in this case i thought that she she had an answer i haven't done the math to go check if that answer was like you know [ __ ] or real but she had at least thought about we need 10 000 companies at our current you know pricing and scale to be at that um you know that revenue mark well and i and and i think people like think it's a trick question towards like how does this get big or um how are you going to exit and they'll say like this [ __ ] of like well we're not thinking about an exit it's like dude come on just like this like talk real like a good answer is like well the worst case scenario is i think we'll get to 5 million in this many years and someone's going to buy us for 50 million and you'll get a two or three x return i think that's like a likely worst case scenario best case scenario i actually think we have a clear path to 75 million and we're going to figure out as we go and i think these possible doors might open up and then we could either go public which i would love to go public or we could sell for this much money or we just own the company forever and we grow into this i think that answer works on you because you invest your own money for most venture capitalists they're investing in other people's money they don't care about the two to three x uh i know but i'm trying to downside protection it's like to them it's either a zero or it's huge and so you're better off focusing most of the energy on the uh how this ends up huge and you might just say you might say things like um so you don't have to say oh man i can't wait to go sell this for a billion dollars but i think you could say like like we had a buddy ramon who was telling us about this he's like look right now i have you know i don't know what it was like a hundred thousand um you know like pet owners um who have bought from me and i know their name their address their dog's name their dog's breed their dog's age i know everything about them he goes and he's named like the big you know chewy doesn't know any of that because they sell on store shelves but i have the largest databases i think that asset's going to be worth a lot of money to one of these companies and i think that you know that's beyond just the sales that we're already doing and so you can kind of say your downside protection that we're building a valuable app that's kind of what i mean i'm just saying that like just it's okay to show weakness and it's okay to show uncertainty but at the same time you also want to have like a yeah but i think this could happen and here's how what the flight booking guy said is also perfect which is you don't have to say this is going to be a billion dollar company you're just going to autopilot like a you know venture capital robot like you know what he could say is basically um you know he's like he's like you know i don't know what the i don't know where the ceiling of this is because nobody's ever done this before but there's a clear path to 75 million and we're going to get there then we're going to look up and figure out what's next and i think that's a totally honest but also exciting version of that answer which is to say like look we don't know how high this thing can fly but i know there's a clear path to this i'm just laser focused 50 million an hour before i go to bed i kiss my daughter goodnight and i say 50 million in arr and when i wake up and i'm brushing my teeth i say 50 million are because i know that that's what's in front of us and like i can't sleep because it's so obvious that there's a step-by-step path to go get there so you can say some [ __ ] like that and people get like people start to believe that you believe that that's your certainty that there's a clear path to that makes them certain there's a clear path to it badass let's do the last one up colton take it away hi i'm colton woodard founder of little ducky's pool company i'm a pool industry expert with a knack for sourcing companies that may not know they want to sell and creating acquisition plan started out with my own pool maintenance business from zero clients now i make about eighteen thousand monthly recurring revenue all in under three years my father-in-law owns a large pool resurfacing company in orlando florida and found our first private acquisition deal from a friend who was feeling like he was ready to retire instead of just letting his business dissolve we negotiated a purchase at about a multiple of you know four months of the monthly gross revenue currently we've secured two upcoming purchase contracts in the south florida pool construction sector with another in negotiation for quarter four we are projecting 10.3 million and gross for our 2023 sales with a yearly increase of 13 as we streamline the processes and add in modern tech or we're looking to build a portfolio of pool construction companies in south florida and gain a majority of the market share and then add in pool cleaning and maintenance on these accounts for additional monthly reoccurring revenue ideally we like to secure locations in all of south florida within the next five years with four owner operators in place who know the industry know the business how to utilize specific contractors we're looking to take over the industry and build an empire like real estate now is the hottest time to invest in south florida pool construction sick so uh let me bait is this basically like a pe play where you're buying uh baby boomers businesses who put pools in people's backyards in a simple and a simple explanation kind of yeah i mean it's it's a little harder than that because you know sell 40 you dig 54 inches you hit water so if you don't know what you're doing you could really muck it up but yeah so we know the industry we know the pool we know pool construction so we can find people that are ready to retire and instead of letting their business just go to the wind and the other guys pick it all up we can utilize different contractors that specialize in you know form and steel excavation take his company and he sub contracts out to the plumbing guys and the tile guys the screen enclosure guys and he's spending so much money on paying subcontractors whatever they need to charge because he's got to hire because he can't do it himself so we buy these individual companies that can complement each other bring everything in-house and we can get our permits done faster reduce our wait times and increase profits and turn over more projects year over year so that's why we're looking at thirteen percent increase on our product so just exp uh multiple choice answer your company does what do you a sell software b buy existing pool companies uh c uh invest in cool cos or d other which one of those four things do you do b we we buy pool companies mergers and acquisitions yeah so you you're rolling up pool companies and you're rolling them up and you are a good you are not buying them for less or anything like that you buy them at some fair value but you are better operating because you do what a you uh have different expertise in house b you have better software c you uh have economies of scale what is the advantage you have uh a and b so we we know the business we do it well and we implement modern technology so 3d modeling designs for the pools so we can email it to customer we don't got to go to their house with a pen and paper and show them how it's done so we can just email it over and then also since covet hit permitting has been horrible slowed down a lot now we can do digital permitting where we can be on video chat with the with the county that we're working with and they could be right on the phone we could show them step by step and get the phases approved without having to wait for time on their schedule for them to come to the site so the result is you guys build pools for faster and cheaper how much faster and how much cheaper we build them faster we don't build them cheaper it depends on the county you know each county is going to be a little bit different but if you don't have to wait on the subcontractors to get you on their schedule or not show up and and reschedule on you it's it's going to be at least 20 percent faster okay great and you up till now you've bought how many pool companies so right now we've signed we have our own we own two but we bought uh we have two purchase contracts signed an agreement and we have one in negotiation that we're looking to get another round of funding for and then explain when you buy a business like this uh you know it has this much in ebitda typically it's been in business for 10 years or whatever and you're buying it at some multiple um and you're financing it how well the first two we sold our houses okay what do you do for the next two we're looking to raise capital and then we're also going to make a plan using the um signed contracts usually you're two years out you know two years booked out with these with these contracts for the pool companies that we're buying so we're not only we're buying the company we're buying the crew we're having the owner stay on for two years as a consultant while we put a project manager in place for him to train and then we're getting all of those contracts um and they get paid in phases so we use some of the working capital to put aside into another fund to use to purchase more businesses as we as we roll out all the locations we need between like i said form steel excavation shot crete tile marsite plaster guys we're we're going to buy all the specialty contractors and roll them all into one company so sean and i's one of our best investments ever we i think we both invested at the same time into a business johnny is still there yeah we both invest we invested into this business uh that started by our friend sieva called endure ventures and his whole premise was to buy businesses that baby boomers want to retire and their kids don't want to take it over basically that's exactly what's going on and sam zell sam sells the guy who basically created the reit he um owned schwinn bikes he owned the tribune he owned a bunch of stuff rich guy he owned waste management i think um anyway he said recently in a podcast that he is making more money off of buying businesses from baby boomers who don't want to pass their companies onto the kids than he has ever made in real estate and so that's just for the proof that this is actually quite interesting and i think sieva actually bought a pool business didn't he shawn yeah yeah dolphin pools it's in arizona yeah and they're killing it i would argue that that's probably the path you should go and for these pitches you should entirely pitch it that way um another way that you could maybe pitch is the guy who started i was going to bring this up on the podcast sean but the guy who started wework uh we uh upwork have you heard of upwork it's like the outsourcing tech company he um started this new company called i actually don't know how he's air guillon e-r-g-e-o-n and it's a fence contractor and installation and repair business and he just raised like 40 million dollars for it and he bootstrapped it to like 400 employees do you see this sean no i've never seen that that's crazy dude it just got relaunched like or just got released like two days ago on techcrunch he was like they were like i uh we wanted to keep this in the dl but basically we bootstrapped this into a monster business and we just raised financing for it and at a huge valuation because getting someone to build a fence it's a pain in the ass well we just went and just like you so what they did is they used a little bit of technology and they made the process easier and better what sieve is doing is he's just saying no one wants these businesses we're going to buy them for cheap and we're just going to install a manager and let it run so anyway i think if i was you i would go one of those two routes and i would go all in on one of those two routes i imagine seeing that your website i went to it it looks like it's built on wix technology's not gonna be where you're gonna play it's gonna be the pe route but the problem is is you don't actually seem entirely bought in on that route so that's like my fairly critical feedback do you think i hit the nail on the head there sean if i can go ahead called if i can interject i i think that yeah that's that's pretty accurate it's a little it's a little bit more difficult you know these guys they are retiring but they also it's very difficult to get into this industry you have to have four years of experience and then go in front of a board the dppr to even get approved to have the license to do it so it's not like millennials or gen z can just hey i'm going to start a pool construction company today you're going to have to go work for somebody for four years to get that experience to even do it so it's it's really not super turnkey so there's not a lot of competition for the pe um to go out and scoop them up you know we're poised and ready to strike okay yeah um i would say i'm just gonna give you some pitch feedback because i think your pitch was uh confusing and therefore hard to raise money which is what we're here to do right so um number one uh like use a you you had a slide up there that had a bunch of text but then you talked a bunch and you weren't talking exactly you weren't just saying the points on the slide you were telling a story which was good it's good to tell a story but if you're gonna tell story to put like a picture on the screen um so it's like you know this is uh you know this is my pool company we've been doing this this business spits off this much cash and we're you know we're not alone there's 400 of these just in the florida area where i you know where i'm from and i've bought two more of these and these are great businesses to buy in fact i sold my house to buy these because they're such a better investment than my home and you know this first one we bought we bought it for this much it's already paid itself off in two years and blah blah the second one blah blah blah same thing and for each one of these we have a playbook of how to buy it grow it and like improve it from where it was we improved each of these businesses by over 25 percent within the first year okay great so we're going to keep doing this we have a plan that is working um you know but i don't have any more houses to sell so it's time for me to go raise some money and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna raise five million dollars i'm gonna go buy 20 million dollars worth of uh of pool pool companies and we're gonna start rolling these up you've probably seen these roll ups get pretty big this roll up in the dental space got this big this roll up and the pool space got this big in a different state you know sam zell the guy who invented the reit is doing doing these roll up the guy who started upwork is now doing this with fencing companies um this is a strategy that works now the problem is most people don't have what i have they don't have 15 years of pool construction experience so even if they wanted to do this they wouldn't really know where to start they wouldn't know the nuances of permitting and i could say a bunch of words you're not going to understand but that those are kind of 15 years of hard work lessons and so today i'm coming here to i'm going to raise this i'm going to build a billion dollar pool roll up company and like you got to say that category of your company the size the price all of that i think would be like i don't know if you heard that in the chat i know stocks having some problems right now but if you heard that the chat go one to ten uh where was my pitch on a scale of one to ten of clear and compelling um because that's where you need to get this too because i think you actually have a really good idea uh i don't i don't think we need to we need a smart investor like you sean because man you you said it perfectly yeah but he didn't want to do the work he wants you to do the work yeah i want you to be the one who says like you know i i want to invest in people who figure these things out if i'm if you need me for help honestly it's uh usually a bad sign for my investment uh like i want to be helping a rocket that's already going and not like pushing something that's at a standstill and so um well you know you know the investment industry and you know the roll-ups and you know the comparables i'm i'm out here doing the doing the hard work managing crews fair enough fair enough uh and so i think take that and basically say okay the problem was i wasn't clear on what type of investment vehicle this is this is a roll-up second um i gotta weave my story just a bit of my story which is that i'm i've got tons of experience doing this i've already started my roll up this is not just a idea that's pie in the sky i already got the first two under my belt i did those myself bootstrapped and they're working and now i just got to tell you how we're going to go from 2 to 20 doing this and that when we have 20 it's going to be worth this much because i can just do some math say 20 times each one is worth 10 million dollars now i got a 200 million roll up uh if we if we could pull this off right beautifully said the other thing is you didn't say anything about debt are you taking on debt for doing this you said you're kind of raising money to buy the next ones why aren't you using debt we haven't taken any loans we thought about it we thought about doing sba but um i mean it just made more sense to sell our finance so what we we actually did was we negotiated like a 10 down with seller financing over five years of the balloon payment and the it's so cheap we can just dude why didn't you say that that's a that's a great point i'm buying these for 10 percent down i'm like giving you interest i'm giving away my secrets over the internet to thousands of people now millions of your podcast listeners so here you go there's no one's gonna you you it's not a secret see selling friday's secret uh it's in fact you kind of made it sound like you don't know what debt is because you didn't say anything but uh now we've revealed the truth okay great honestly again i think you actually have a very good business idea um presented slightly differently that'd be you know i think it could be very investment worthy especially right now you know you see stocks going down you see crypto going down these private companies are raising huge valuations with like you know software and a dream whereas you're like actually i buy successful profitable companies and i'm just a better operator than the mom and pop and i'm gonna aggregate these because like i just have a playbook that i can just keep rolling out and by the way i buy these for 10 down so that means you know uh you know my cash on cash return after you know 15 months looks like this and so you you have a very very strong pitch um and you just got to like you know put it all together yeah after 30 years of doing something they're going to be real tired you know they don't want to they don't want to push the needle they don't want to make it bigger they have a paycheck coming in salary they're taken care of so right there was a guy so right now for the listeners colton he's sitting in front of a bookshelf that's empty and someone just says uh peter thiel's zero to one is not on his bookshelf and for that reason i'm out this is where all of my trophies are going to go for uh for all the wins we're about to have oh lean startups not on his bookshelf for that reason i'm out yeah dude you seem to be spending too much time actually building your business i need somebody who's way more into reading about business yeah you don't seem like you do yoga i'm out you're on a gamer chair you're not like on a treadmill desk i'm out you eat carbs i'm out yeah that's hilarious uh thanks dude thanks for coming on thank you so much um all right uh i asked i don't know if ollie's gonna pop up the guy starts talks but that was that was fun um some i think some people need some work on their pitch not as much work on their business but work on just like saying what the [ __ ] they do so let's go most interested to least interested uh let's rank the companies based on on that i'll kind of remind you what they were so there was 5x that was the first business that pitched which was doing something that we could barely understand but had a million dollars of ar commitments um you know for his kind of like marketing stack that he was or you know there's like vendor stack that he was putting in a box then we had i think fly together which wasn't their name it was like bukhari or something like that group booking on travel uh third one we had was uh orem who was doing munch i think uh which was taking creators content and letting you chop it up into bits and letting them making it easy for them to repost using ai and some software then we had uh the last guy was duckies and before that we had nickel pass did i miss anyone yeah all right i did miss someone or no no i don't think you missed someone i think my ranking from most to least from the ones i would want to invest into the least i would actually put nickel and fly together maybe nickel first but the fly together bakari i would put that they would trade for one or two in the middle would be 5x and then uh tied for the bottom ones would be uh the jelly smack competitor and duckies okay all right i like it mine would be fly together number one i thought that uh he seemed great and the business seemed you know pretty straightforward and had momentum and you know i need to go look at the competition like is it really as backwards and he's kind of the only real one doing this as it made it sound but i i like the sound of that one um i actually think that duckies is probably the second or first best investment uh but i'm not sure i would want to invest in colton just because you know he seemed like i think i'd want to hang out with him but i'm not sure i'd want to invest in him because i feel like i'd just be frustrated because he speaks a different language than me he speaks like digging holes in the ground and building pools and like i speak like frameworks it's like you know hey colton i like you just change the way you look for me please yeah just like just talked entirely different for me if i invested in it i'd be like look we're allowed to hang out but we'll never be allowed to talk about the business and like in 20 years just mail me a giant check and just in between i need to pretend it's gone uh so that's that'll be mistaken and by the way i'm colton i'm messing with you [Laughter] um also i love the name of that little duckies that's a great cool name uh i do nickel pass three and then the other two i probably wouldn't invest in so those are kind of like four and five um all right ali you're here the crowd is beating you up because stonks was crashing ollie just is it because we're too popular are we just too popular is that what happened or or is it somehow something else and this is ali moyes the founder of stocks yes thanks for having me guys great great show loved the real talk honestly i think it's it's the best real talk we've had on songs uh and and uh you know the comments show it um yeah so you guys crashed once you you this this is one of our biggest events um uh and we were also in the middle of like a code migration so there were more issues at this event than the last like 50 events put together so the stream crashed a few times but a page refresh did fix it but it it will be a lot more stable going forward so thank you for hanging in there and i could attest that so people don't know this me and you we used to compete at our previous startups so you built stream labs we were building bebo we're both trying to build tools for live streamers on twitch and so i've seen you execute from uh you know first of all that we became friends kind of towards the end um but like you're good and uh when you decide to do something uh you guys pull you know you guys are scrappy and you pull it off and uh actually when we were competing against each other i had asked i told uh michael burch who was the founder of the original bebo and he was our investor i said yeah there's this company streamlabs out there he's like who's behind it and i told him your name he goes i know these guys he used to have some company called peanut something and he's like oh these guys these guys are like you know they always just find like the thing that people want and he was basically described just very scrappy entrepreneurs who will just like kind of like you'll never die and you'll like kind of just keep iterating until you find this like hook that people want and then you'll like go for it uh we'll go for it with like full force is that an accurate thank you thank you you are your duke and sean matt have a lot of respect for what you did as well amazing products uh and you guys kick your ass for what it's worth i feel like the uh in the end we were competing with you guys but it really you guys kicked our ass no no it's uh it's great i mean um i have a lot of respect for for for you and uh you know what you what you've done in uh birch as well um but uh amazing amazing event today guys it's just our our team has been loving it the chat's been loving it i think sam asked um everyone should we do it again seems like seems like the chat is uh really into it yes dude so on the podcast yesterday we talked about this company called stake and they're like an online crypto gambling website and they basically give drake a certain amount of money like 10 million dollars a month in order to get 20 million dollars a month in order to gamble on the website and he tweets about it and people come and watch him gamble and they give him free house money to play with in order to attract more users so we'll take two this is a gambling this is a gambling website it's called steak.com yeah it's awesome so it's really effective for that company is this a hint do we need to set up like house money for you guys like exactly okay yes exactly i think that you give us each like 10 or 20 grand to invest in different startups and by the way we will invest random ass influencers and also so we'll go get you know we'll get jake paul in here we'll just go get a bunch of like other famous people to be our friend of the house and just give us a house budget to go invest in startups you know this is this is actually not uh a half joke half idea but this is actually not a terrible idea this is oh so we have a look don't don't don't don't assume smiling means a joke i am not joking i'm being dead serious we should do this so uh so the way we could do it is we we we have a small farm it's called the best of stocks fund and we do write checks into interesting startups particularly high traction or great co-investors similar to what you guys look for so what we could do is for your next event we could each give you um one one check so you pick your one favorite startup out of the five or so that pitch at your next event and and we'll write that yeah but i want uh we we want stakes in it bro ah okay so that's that's a little more work i have to figure it out that's all right let me let me get back to you maybe maybe we could give you some carry on that or yeah that would be for something okay that'd be cool all right so um also people need to know that ali moyes is not the same as boys ali the the other guest on our podcast all the time did i call him i don't know you said it right but people in the chat are like wait is this the deodorant guy it's like no there's there's moyes on league that's the other guy there's ollie moyes that's the stonks guy so i'm not the investing guy not the deodorant guy you to be sick of that i have to assume uh you know it's fine it's it's more followers for both of us people we we confuse all our followers it's great that's amazing okay and also we've been doing this bookshelf meme this whole time get us a book off the shelf there something that has helped you've sold a company for over 100 million dollars i believe uh and uh so so you read books and you've had success go give us a book off that shelf there that you will recommend to the crowd something that you think has helped you um i think bring it over go grab the book okay okay dude uh he's got a nice house does he live in san francisco now it's actually my test to see if he's wearing only underwear uh on a lot on on zooms and no he he passed he's wearing wearing shorts if you ask me to get up right now you might be uh you know this this stream might might be rated you know pg-13 at least are you wearing only underwear right now i'm wearing my jammies which are which are more than underwear okay so this this is what i'm reading right now i have the same one dance read um huge fan so it looks like uh i've actually bought this as well so it's a compilation of uh night from 1964 i think up until 2010 or i forget the year of every single one of warren buffett's annual letters and what you'll notice i actually analyzed this his words per sentence actually gets shorter and shorter each year and i would argue that's because he's becoming a better writer and what's really interesting about that book is he explains like really complicated topics like geico car insurance and incredibly easy to understand ways so i think that's a good book to read that's cool connor in the chat goes you picked the heaviest book he has power move i agree absolute alpha move of you just now to go pull a a you know 36 pound book off the shop i i appreciate that all right well uh ollie thanks for help tell your boy john hancock and the rest of the team thanks for making this happen this was awesome uh sean uh i think i guess we'll do this

[Music] okay i just sent you something hilarious i've been following this twitter called mug shotties and it's like a play on mug shots and we talked about this did we talk about mug shotties it's so funny and the tagline is uh the tagline is uh hope bay gets bail uh and it's mug shouty's and it's all like good-looking girls who have a mug shot it's hilarious it's so funny yeah we've talked about that because there was the guy who his mug shot went viral because he's got like he's just like really stunningly good looking and he became like a model after afterwards or whatever yeah i remember that guy people still talk about him can i tell you crazy story yes uh so have you ever seen i think this is probably outside of your your like kind of orbit of what you pay attention to but have you seen these gambling live streams where drake will go on twitch and he'll gamble like 20 million dollars live on stream no really yeah like a like real 20 million dollars a real 20 million like he lost like i think 17 million dollars on roulette one night last like two weeks ago or something like that it seemed really that rich that i mean like if you're 200 million dollar rich that's ten percent of your net worth in a night no okay that's a substantial amount good question i had the same question which led me to some pretty interesting findings okay so um so i saw drake doing this and i've seen other popular streamers like xqc and these guys they do these gambling streams from time to time people love to see it because they're playing kind of like high stakes online uh you know gambling and they're reacting to the highs and lows or whatever uh ben have you seen this i think it's probably also outside of your you know mormon orbit you don't watch these kinds of sins yeah exactly so this is all on twitch it's happening on tw it was happening on twitch maybe some people do it on youtube as well but it got me curious i was like there's no way this guy's gambling 25 million dollars 20 million dollars of his own money on these things and i was like these streams get so popular i'm like this is actually great marketing for the website that it's on so he's he's gambling on something called stake.com s-t-a-k-e and um so i was like i bet this is house money that they're giving him in order to just promote the site and sure enough that's what it is so get this but is he is he losing it again when you play blackjack you lose against the dealer right house yeah so they're just okay like if i gave you 20 million dollars to come play my rigged game i gave you 20 million you lose it right back to me i get not i don't know you know i'm back whole um they don't even lose the vig because they're the house so they would take that you know four percent edge or whatever that they would have they keep that as well um and if you win maybe they have some deal where like hey if you win you keep the winnings uh i would assume they have some deal like that with him but it's electronic right like it's like the cards are digital it's not like a camera so then they could just be like oh shoot drake has 20 we have to make ourselves have 21. yeah well that's yeah that's a little bit that's illegal for sure but they wouldn't need to do that i guess that's kind of my point is that they'll already have a house edge and uh over time like they will win and so and even if they don't like this is as a marketing campaign like uh this is like kind of genius and so what they're doing is stake.com is this website and it is the largest cryptocurrency based online gambling site in the world and nobody knew who was behind it until recently some guy in australia bought like a 36 million dollar home and they were like who who is this you're in your 20s how did you buy a 36 million home all cash like what was he he was he was in his 20s so these guys they're in their mid-20s i think one guy's 25 or 26 the other guy's 28. and um and so there's this guy ed you can just search ed craven uh ed craven steak and you'll see the secret origins the secret australian origins of the world's biggest crypto casino and so get this so basically they have online there's these guys in um in australia and they've got this office and it's just like and the the office is under this name called easy go gaming it's like we build online uh games and the office is super nice and people would see it on social media they would see like wow these guys got like a chef and they got all these perks and they got like they're always going on these trips and like what's going on with man easy go gaming you guys must be an awesome gaming company so it must just be like a couple people and they're just hanging out at someone's house and so well no no so this is a legit company but basically easy go gaming is the licensed gaming provider like they provide the games to the casino company steak which is based in some place called curacao or something like that which is like some dutch caribbean island uh where the actual casino is based and these guys own both so they were kind of known as only the owners of easy go but they actually own steak and so it all got kind of like revealed when the guy bought this home for whatever you can see even there's like a daily mail article he buys i'm reading it right now dot org yeah 38 and a half million dollar mansion he buys and um they're like who is this kid he's 26 years old or whatever and that's kind of how people figured out like oh he owns steak.com now i i believe these are kind of like my predictions my guesses so steak.com i think is pretty clearly clearing like billions of dollars in revenue i think both of these guys are now self-made billionaires possibly even 10 billion plus is what they've made off of steak.com because this thing is a absolute cash cow and you can kind of back into this by looking at like um they do these like sunday raffle whatever lottery type thing and it's like you pay it's like oh wow you know 250 000 people bought this like ten dollar ticket it's like oh wow they just you know that was just like a two two and a half million dollar sunday for them and then they pay out this much and they keep 26 million or 50 million like that's just a week for them and so um and so you can kind of see you could kind of back into i did some some calculations on it but but i'm pretty sure that these guys are both self-made billionaires if not 10 billion at this point uh in equity value of stake.com and it's just kind of crazy to me like that this exists that these guys are so young able to do this and um and people who are just willing to like live on the edge it's like yeah i'm gonna go set up a company at the dutch caribbean island of curacao which gives out like online gambling licenses like you know my neighborhood gives up candy on halloween and these guys have amassed this absolute fortune kind of anonymously building this isn't this just like isn't this kind of crazy to you yeah this is i'm researching and i know how i recognize this they're a sponsor of the ufc yes and so they're big ufc sponsors they also sponsor watford the like uh the english soccer team so they like pay 10 million a year as their like lead uh lead sponsor for that too so i'm doing research just as as you're talking um on linkedin there's i i don't well here one guy says he's the ceo but that seemed i don't know if that's legit uh this is this is crazy this is one of those amazing companies this just like vpn and a few other things that's completely under the radar and it's totally crushing and i've said this to you before i actually think that people's personal homes the price of it it you know like a rich person can live in a low priced home but if you purchase a high priced home the likelihood that you're rich is like it's indicative of what you have because it's hard it's not impossible but it's hard to give a bank to give you a loan if you don't have a significant amount of income not just assets but income so if he bought a 30 and if he bought a 37 million dollar home in cash is that really what it said so then yeah i don't know if it was all cash uh but it was like three times more the house sold in 2018 for three times less and then the guy renovated it and he this guy bought it for for whatever almost 42. to buy a 40 million home i would think you'd want to be worth like at least 250 million dollars in at least some type of liquid situation as well not just privately held company so here's my notes on this thing so i'm just going to read you my raw notes from last night it says a small company in australia in melbourne called easy go looks like your typical successful startup you got pingtang tables you got a chef you got perks you're going on on on boat trips with the with the team but they're hiding a massive secret they're also the founders of steak which i believe might be the world's largest casino ever it's crypto only which is a massive growth level does that mean that it that it's legal um you mean illegal i don't know the legality of it that's like probably a pretty complicated thing like like full tilt went away in america i used to play tilt yeah you can't go if you're on state.com in the us you can't go to it it's like no this is not available to us citizens um but it but internationally it is and they they based out of curacao which gives out the online gamble so i think they are fully licensed but they use uh crypto which i think lets them do things like no um as they say kyc aml like know your customer so basically i think you could just transfer in bitcoin or whatever and you could just gamble it on the site uh you just put an email and you start gambling and uh so they got like all these games or whatever um i think that they're paying drake like 20 million dollars a month to be the like sponsor of this thing no way that because he's gambling at those stakes and i'm pretty sure that's all house money i don't think drake is promoting this company for by by putting in 20 million dollars of his own money and losing it every month well they're not they're not giving him 20 million dollars they're saying you can win up to 20 or you could know they're giving them house money they're giving them a chip or a credit line that basically says here's 20 million to go play on the site you probably can't just cash that out you have to gamble it here um but but i'm pretty sure that's how it's working that would be crazy i mean i i like okay so the private some of the private equity guys like um steve schwartzman and uh a few other folks who founded carlisle and black rock and blackstone and all that there was there's some years where they'll get paid like 800 million dollars or 500 million dollars because of performance but um 20 million a month is 240 million dollars a year that would they're probably i can't imagine there's more than 100 people in the whole world that earn that much income i mean of course there's a lot of people who earn like paper gains but who earn that much income in a given year that would be absolutely astounding so get this so they so the guy buys this house for 40 million they also own multiple penthouses like the top floor of the eureka tower in melbourne which was the largest skyscraper but here's what's even more interesting when they were 18 um when one of them was 18 the other guy's 20. they started something called primedice.com it's still up if you go to primedice.com it's basically a crypto gambling site or you just bet is it gonna be uh like what what's gonna happen it's like a heads or tails it's like a roll of the dice and uh you could just wager on it and like you know here you go and you can just see people just betting constantly on what the dice is gonna roll out to right and like what they're gonna what they're gonna win for it so they created this when they were back in i don't know uh 2013 it says i think on the site says largest crypto gambling site since 2013. uh so they're pretty early on that um this site is wild do you see all the live users betting money yeah it's crazy and uh it's just look at this one guy shane recovers just betting over and over again this company this is this is such an amazing five fine this company alone this prime dice thing is awesome so then let me tell you some of the the other things that that come into it so uh so basically um i think one of the youtubers that they pay or or maybe a twist shimmery this guy aiden ross i think is getting paid a few million bucks per month to to do it that that i think there's pretty good authority on um three million dollars a month yeah uh i know i think two two million a month um okay now let me go into more okay so all of that was like you know this is all like not confirmed but like these are now like some rumors so uh or i guess this part's not a rumor like if you go to their website you could see that there's a company called medium rare nv which is incorporated in curacao that's the company that holds the gaming license if you google map the address it's just like a shitty warehouse building that you'll find of like where this company is based so i don't know what's going on there it's like you know when you incorporate in delaware and they give you like a p.o box as your address um so okay and then a couple of other you know random rumors are like uh they had they had they added um dogecoin to their site as like a way to deposit back in the day and like when all the elon stuff was happening i think they dumped like hundreds of millions of dollars worth of doge they like sold it all but the elon pump was happening to dogecoin um and uh yeah it's crazy so so anyways this is just like a crazy thing well what like okay let's say you even had the idea for this i googled i googled i'm googling these guys as you're talking there's very very very little information on these folks right there's so there's almost nothing i do you think could i change my browser to australia and maybe get better results because i'm googling their names now and there is like there's one picture on them on the whole on everything yeah i like found their instagrams both their instagrams are private but like uh yeah like i know somebody who who falls over whatever so i like stalked their instagram too just to see like what's going on and it's are they jacked are they jacked bros now or are they still nerds they're uh they're i wouldn't say they're jacked but they're fit uh and they're bros for sure like they're breaking the stereotype you know like here's the like i'm just going to describe to you uh i'll send this photo we can put this in the other ferrari pictures okay so one okay picture number one uh you would have guessed ferrari but here's a close second picture of a range rover with a giant bow and somebody hugging them because they just gave them a range rover uh okay that's a classic you gotta love that one another classic you know the like influencer balloons you get when you cross like a million followers or whatever the yellow giant inflatable balloon of a number they have that uh and it's like some guy uh you know hugging him doing that another one like courtside at the lakers game courtside at the french open like i could seen the doll's calf like you know right behind this guy's head in this picture so they're definitely living it up uh and as they should this is what this is exactly what i want my online casino dealer guys life to be this is who i wanted to be and this is how i want them to live and i'm glad that they are doing exactly what they're doing and one of them's only 26 is what you're saying yeah and this article might be a little out of date but uh yeah that is they definitely they definitely hit this scale when they were in their 20s like the youngest rich the richest young person in the world like uh richer than what's his name the sam bankman freed guy yeah and younger or on par with it and and younger that is outstanding that is crazy what a good find speaking of young billionaires uh i think the world's youngest self-billionaire now is this guy alexander wang do you know this guy i i don't really know him i think i was in a group chat with him um is that from that company uh a startup yeah yeah yeah so what they do is pretty cool um they basically saw the kind of like machine learning um trend you know like this is going to keep growing and they were like well you know what one thing that's really hard is like when you're doing machine learning you need like the data to be labeled right so if you're trying to teach a computer how to recognize a a you know a kitten or something like that it's like you first have to train it in some ways or be able to like um teach it when it's wrong and correct it and um so that labeling process is quite like time-consuming and so what they did was they created like a i think a giant workforce force of overseas people that will label your images for you and so like if you're a self-driving car company if you're uh waymo or or tesla whatever you get like tons and tons of footage and then now those need to be labeled as like yep that was a dog crossing the street yep that's a stop sign even though it's partially obstructed and so how does that happen that's like a human intervention humans go and do that and so scale started off as like a it was labeling as a service i i'm sure they do a lot more stuff now but it's pretty crazy that's like a 10 billion dollar company now and this guy i think he started it when he was 19 or something what um is he cool yeah he was cool uh i i didn't know him for long because as soon as there it's pretty funny it's like i'm in this group chat that's like four founders um yeah four for a bunch of founders it's like oh it's kind of like the underground founders hang out like we chill here and everybody's trying to do big things but then when one guy actually started doing big things he's like i'm busy i need to leave this now and so it's like the ultimate signal it's like oh and it really takes off you don't spat out him you just sort of like go do your billionaire thing now meaning you go do your like i'm actually on a rocket ship i don't have time to socialize anymore um which you know respect to him dude i was gonna show you something that i thought was like a major good find and now it seems like achievable given that you just set the baseline at to 26 year olds who are now worth 10 billion dollars this one's a little this one's much smaller but still oddly interesting uh go to the the mfm or the uh million dollar brainstorm document okay that we have and scroll down and so you can kind of see that like this is truthful the guy sent me a picture of his quickbooks so you see that yeah i'm looking at it all right so this guy named matt paulson so you remember when my twitter got hacked yes so uh there was basically people hacked my twitter and they tweeted out like i'm giving away a ps5 or whatever the number is and just like send me 400 and i'm donating the money to saint jude's and this guy matt i when i got back in my twitter i saw that he sent two times the asked amount he was like he's like i just want to set it went ahead and sent you a thousand dollars just you know so saint jude has a little extra money and i i was like oh my god dude that that sucks i'm so sorry about this and he was like oh no big deal and i was like all right well who who are you that you're this nice and i clicked out and he runs this website called market beat have you heard of market beat only when you uh you you shared this in the trends group so i did a little bit of stalking at that time because i was like what is that you know your tweet was intriguing you because you had said something like i met a guy who runs a company that does 25 million a year in revenue only 13 employees and it was like 17 million of the 25 was profit and i was like yes all right i'm fully aroused tell me more what is this company you know got him uh yeah uh and so he sent me a picture of his quickbooks and he was like here's the profit and keep in mind this doesn't include my huge salary my huge salary is part of the expenses but we actually do 17 million in profit the p l that he sent me it's like i think 13 million in profit so it's called market beat marketbeat.com and uh for the first two years it was just him and you go to the marketplace what it is yeah like what is it yeah you you go to marketbeat.com like i always google like hubspot price targets because i'm curious what hubspot what analysts think the the stock might be in one year and he shows up early in google one two three if you google amazon price targets target price targets whatever like any company and it's he calls it a web portal but if you didn't know better you would look at and just call it a media company so you you see different headlines and different news it's kind of like wall street journal but really even more niche and just for stocks just for dividend stocks and it's just a way to really quickly see headlines of what's coming up so it's kind of like a a portal or a data aggregator where you could just like see like all right this stock has an earnings call on this date so it's basically just a place to get information but it's also part media company because they have they published 250 articles a year or sorry a month and they have contractors who they pay 150 per article to write these but he told me he goes regardless if the articles don't actually add to any of our revenue people come to the website mostly just to see like the stock prices and things like that and so right now the guy has 11 employees and i actually have a list of sorry 13 employees i have a list of what they all do he's got four developers four support people one ad guy one accountant one content manager one marketing assistant and him and uh they make money through subscription and through advertising most of which comes through advertising they've got 15 000 subscribers who pay between 20 and 40 000 20 and 40 a month and uh one ad guy selling all these ads and it's mostly direct marketing and he's got a bunch of different brands like he's got um sorry we're going faster so the just to break down that revenue it sounded like subscriptions is something like four or five million dollars a year out of the 25 is that right uh well he told me 15 000 premium subscribers and they pay either 20 or 40 a month depending on whichever one they get so let's call it 30. so that's five and five and a half million uh from the subscription from the premium and then the rest being ad revenue 20 million of ads okay wow crazy right and there's only one ad sales person he doesn't have a team of ad sales guys and he'll they'll sell directly to large like uh maybe like the motley fool or some other like uh stock picking newsletter or some other financial brand or some company looking to promote their stock or different financial brokers uh financial products like wealth advisors things like that but if an advertiser is too small they just work with an agency and they just say hey agency you know we've got some leftover inventory you want to put your ads in here and it's just one guy doing the whole thing doing all the yeah unbelievable so it seems like the the trick for them and by trick i mean hard work and strategy yes by the way they've been around i think they've been around for 15 years right and it was seo it's seo that drives the bulk of the traffic is that the idea i think early on now it has a little bit of a brand before i even knew the guy i would actually go to it all the time just to look because they're they're interviewing nicely organized like i'm on like the amazon one right now and it's basically like it has just like a bunch of stuff put together it's like oh here's the execs here's the ceo here's their age here's their pay it's like here's the um you know here's the percent shareholding you know amongst these different groups yeah it's like analyst targets etc it's kind of ugly by traditional web you know 2.0 standards like it doesn't meet any of the design requirements that like airbnb would approve of but in my mind it's perfect it actually is designed beautifully like it works wonderfully and so it's like a cluttered website it kind of looks like drudge report or craigslist or something or ebay like it's this messy website but i think it's quite good we need to put together a compilation of what i'm calling sam's ugly ducklings and this is an example of sam's ugly ducklings which is his website that like who the [ __ ] even heard of this it doesn't look super fancy it's kind of been around for a while it's got this like niche passionate audience drug report is one this is another you've showed me like 10 of these in the last year and i think people are i think people really dig these and so we should do an episode that just highlights each one of these and it doesn't have to be like a podcast it's almost like a screen share uh maybe it's just for youtube or like there's this guy reaching out he's trying to turn our podcast into like an e-book or whatever like a really nicely designed pdf um we should have him do it on your ugly ducklings because he's got extensive notes on what you talk about in each episode i really do uh this guy in india i forgot his name but i'm talking to him right now to get one of these made for us because i think it'd be dope right like that'd be sick dude it's embarrassing like i i get some people who are like now there's people who are like i would say kind of like a little more successful in the tech industry that are getting into our podcast whereas i feel like before we were kind of like a different audience for whatever reason like like kids almost like kids it was not not kids it was more like just like entrepreneurial i would say is definitely a big component of it uh which might be chaos but might be like somebody in their 30s that wants to make a change or whatever or it's just like yeah i own this awesome business i'm based out of you know peoria illinois and it's like what the [ __ ] who are you and how did you find us but like that was more of our main target and now i'm getting people that are like kind of the heart of silicon valley that are like dude i kind of got hooked to the podcast and i'm like dude i've been telling you about this for like two years and they're like yeah it's actually good and they're like what are like the best episodes you got like 200 and i was like uh i don't really know he's like well what's like a place to find the most popular ones was like i don't have it he's like is there a place with summaries i was like nah not really he's like well you have all these ideas is there a compilation of all the ideas it's like ah there should be someone i think it's like all the obvious like kind of like growth things that you would do or like onboarding things you would do we've done none of and so i'm like kind of embarrassed about that but i'm not embarrassed who cares it's working yeah i just think you'd help us like i think i think i would want that if i was getting into a podcast let me this is funny let me tell you how i found out about market beat i was reading starter story i like that website starter story and one of the questions is what books and podcasts do you read and he said on the podcast front i really enjoyed listening to my first million which breaks down unique ways that business owners are using uh unique ways business owners are generating massive profits that's how i found out about

need to read it i don't think you're very interested in this subject that's hilarious that is so funny uh god it's so funny you should have seen them walking around just like putting around this conference like saying like oh sammy come look at let's look at this booth and it's just i don't even know what it is like i don't even know what it is you know what i mean it's like procurement i'm like i don't i don't even know what that means dad neither do you you definitely don't know what that means dude that's so funny you said procurement so so romaine who runs like he's my basically my partner in my fund and romaine's got this company that's like a kind of like an old-school footballer company in uh based out of like georgia right yeah so he lives in georgia um so he's like in the tech scene but he kind of lives in georgia and runs kind of like a bit of an old school more more service-based company that like i think his wife's dad or something started he like took it over and like grew it a bunch and it's doing great with it so i think the business does like 50 million a year or something like it's like a sizeable business and so i've asked him i think no less than 15 times like so yo yo so what does your business do again it'd be like yeah we do procurement for uh for smbs and for whatever enterprise companies i'm like like you get office supplies like wrap my head around what procurement is and he's like he's like you know what the word procurement means right and i'm like yeah he's like so it's that and i'm like but this see i guess i don't know what the word means then because i still don't know like like does anybody use staples anymore like i don't yeah and it's like oh he's like he's like it's not office supplies it's like you know you need a vendor for something but i was like so then why wouldn't you just google and get the vendor he's like yeah but like bigger companies they just do it differently they need like this middleman who's going to basically like help them get the things that they need and i'm like [Laughter] is it like someone who just like knows all the people who do blank and they just yeah it's like you need vendors i think i still [ __ ] don't know dude i'm on explanation number 17. in fact i just feel bad now every time i i ask him or i try to tell somebody else what he does because i'm like i clearly don't know it's almost like you know like there's like a spot in my brain where there's just like if you did a scan it would just be like oh there's some dark cloud here it's like yeah that's the part of my brain that's trying to understand procurement and it's just never happening it's just like a fuzzy region so i've got a story related to this so uh two days ago saturday night i went out to dinner at like the fan a fancy place in st louis and we get to dinner and my dad goes all right uh yeah my dad goes hey the the president of nascar i guess nascar like performed or raced whatever you call yesterday sunday in st louis and he was my dad likes nascar he goes that's the president of nascar like jim nance or i don't forget his name and uh the football commentator yeah the football i think it was something that gymnast yeah that should be and uh he uh and i was like oh yeah you know he's sitting with this guy named david stewart he's like the second richest black man in the world and that like and it's like it's pretty funny like i knew exactly who that rich guy was because he's worth like four or five billion dollars and i started researching him and i was like yeah i've seen that guy before i've seen him on articles because he's like the second or third richest black man and he's from st louis he's like the richest guy in st louis and he's got this company called the worldwide systems you've never heard of that have you no so it does uh 14 billion dollars a year uh and it's like the fourth or eighth like in the top 10 largest privately held companies in the world and him and his partner just own own the whole thing outright and what they do is they're a systems integrator and that's one of those words like procurement i heard that and i'm like what does that mean and so i went on this deep dive i'm like i gotta figure out exactly what they do i i don't understand this and then like it it says they're a cisco systems integrator and i went to cisco's website and i'm like what a cisco yeah i'm like they're like networking hardware networking or like networking hardware and i've like read those words and i'm like no like the website would just be like networking redefined and you're like i didn't i didn't know the first definition now it was right yeah i didn't know how to change that definition and then like they talk about like switches and stuff and i'm like i don't know what like a switch is i guess has to do electronics like i just i didn't have i have any idea what this stuff did uh and but i google it and like i know that cisco's like one of the largest companies in the world but i'm just i like i don't know what it is and so i had a research it took me forever to figure out what a systems integrator is do you know what it is dude no i don't know any i don't know what's this i don't know what sap does i've been on a mission also to understand i don't know what that is for a long ass time and they're they're european though they got a different word for everything we'd never be able to figure that i feel like sometimes i'm watching tv and it'll just pop up sap and i think it means like closed captioning or spanish or something like that i'm like oh hey this is different now i'm super confused about sap yeah but i don't even know why they named their company after their stock ticker either it's kind of weird but um they uh so so a systems integrator basically so what my father-in-law does for a living is if you're like chase and you have a hundred employees working on floor 18 and you're like hey we got to move these hundred employees up to 43 in the same building he studies it for a few weeks and then you go to home for work on friday and you come back on the floor at 47 and you sit down at your desk that's already set up and everything just works and there's no down time and i think system integrators kind of do that but like if you're a 20 billion dollar company and you're selling like a three billion dollar division to this other thing like they have to go to work one day and like all their computers are new and like this new setup exists or if you're like a hospital and you're like we need an app it's like well it's not as simple as just like checking into your lobby and saying you're there like you got to like integrate all this crap into it and i think that's what they do but i don't know why they don't just call it like an agency you know what i mean so yeah i don't know either but i do know like you know i guess like jokes aside you know there's basically things that are like uh like you know netsuite network's another one of these where you're like don't know what what is netsuite is that like quickbooks but different it's basically like um i i mean i'll butcher the thing but like i mean people use it for like inventory management for example so it's basically like a database that's like usable for um like it's usable in a couple different ways it tells you what you got it tells you what's like running out it tells you um what you need it'll tell you kind of like it'll help generate a purchase order it'll do things like that by the way if you go to netsuite's website i just went to it it says complete procure to pay purchasing oh no procurement it has to do with this too but basically there's there's entire companies i think this is what uh you know like the key word what deloitte and other other consulting companies do a lot of which is basically they teach your company like these cup these businesses they're these programs are so uh unintuitive that there's entire consulting businesses that generate billions of dollars a year that just to go to a company like oh um like right here on their website lovesack uses them so it's like you go to lovesack you're like great you guys sell giant bean bags huh yeah like you know those things are getting a little out of hand to get a little willy-nilly now that it's growing so much yeah it is sure is don't you wish there was just a way to have everything organized in one place and a system that just all talked to each other and every one of your employees can log in and interface with it they're like that sounds pretty good so i just go set it up on my own i just go to the website and they're like no no we do that for you it takes 12 months and we will we will add netsuite to your thing we will add oracle we'll add these different services to your we will we will integrate them into your current business and we'll train your employees on how to actually use it is that what service revenue in a sas line so if you go to like atlassian and look at their annual report there's a huge amount of services revenue so do they charge i don't know what the service how they what they bucket in services i would have thought like does that mean just the software but i i think it's different for different companies but at the same time this is sort of like if you were like hey sean you know uh what does it mean to blanch a vegetable i'd be like you know i think it uses hot and cold water in some way it's like you know i just don't know right like when you're asking me about like what are these like giant enterprise companies that are like b2b service slash software companies like these are like again i don't know the first thing about the first thing about it dude the craziest thing to me is when i think about these is to understand how someone came up with this idea so for example uh there's octa do you know octa that's what we use for like logging into like websites and [ __ ] like that or there's um what's that one snowflake you know snowflake yeah like a data so like those are all companies that are founded relatively recently like in the 2005-2015 era and i'm like how did a person know that this was a problem and had to get built you know what i mean well you're just working in a big company right like okay so for example um we were talking the other day about uh what was it called the um or like like we have yeah like you you really chimp for companies yeah exactly uh what was the name of it again i can't remember the name of my head i just committed to invest into it but um but basically when we were in a company or like you ran a you know like an email-based company and so if i asked you you know like what does convertkit do you're like very well versed on like what convertkit does because you're like well like here's the scenario you get a bunch of people come to your website but you you know you want to grab their email because you're gonna be able to market to them later so you so convertkit lets you put up a little web page that grabs your email and then once you have it you want to be able to like tag them or segment them based on like if they paid for your thing or if they're free and then like wouldn't be cool instead of like waking up every day and like writing the same email over and over again you could like automate a sequence of emails one that goes out on day one one goes out on day three one goes out on day ten and it's like you saw a problem in your business and therefore you know you kind of understand what the solutions are and you can even create them well there's another one that's like uh like you know that this is basically what happens when you're when you work inside of a large company you're like oh man there needs to be a solution for x you just see a problem and you're like there needs to be a solution for x you understand that context because it's like like we spent basically 15 years just starting companies from scratch you started media companies i started more like software social networking type companies um and we've done content a bunch so we can tell you all about content like we just don't have that that same frame of reference to that like somebody who's been like you know somebody who's used this sales force every single day for like 10 years then they understand why you need this like salesforce add-on which app all the time i'm like damn i wish i knew how to do this stuff that people charge a million dollars a year in subscription revenue i'm like damn i just got to talk to some stupid freaking guy about starting a newsletter give the same spiel constantly i don't want to talk about how to get your first thousand subscribers on sub stack you know i'd rather get paid like a million dollars a year to do x y and z and you know get a hundred thousand customers yeah i mean yeah exactly this is why like when i was at twitch when we got acquired i had like i had wrote down i'm going to walk out of here with like 10 ideas and i i use that import export framework which is like what are five ideas that twitch would import a solution for like we need something like a country needs something they import it you know like the us needs oil we import it from whatever iraq or whatever afghanistan wherever it needs to come from uh saudi arabia and so uh in the same way companies have these pain points and you're like when you're sitting there you're like oh damn if somebody had us if somebody had a magic way to do this we would pay a hundred thousand dollars a month for this you know we would pay x dollars for this like for example when i was there i i talked about this idea way back in the day but like all hands it's like at our company you know if i needed to say something to the whole company as a startup i would just like literally [ __ ] stand up at my desk and be like hey hey yo headphones um we're doing this now the company we've pivoted to this okay good uh or like you know we'd be at lunch and i'd just like stand up and say something um but like at a company like twitch 2000 people you know there was like this organized every thursday there's an all hands it happens at lunch they do it at lunch because that's where they've like a captive audience of people that will actually sit there and pay attention because they're eating and like and they would do the thing and it had like a presentation and there was like a whole there was like a conductor of the whole ceremony and then there's like a q a and they needed like this question-and-answer thing then they needed to stream it to remote employees it was like all these things they had to think about and we were just stitching together like these four different tools like we use this for the q a we use this for streaming we use this for the presentation we use this for new employees whatever and i was like oh if somebody just made like a really good like uh all hands software i'm pretty sure you could get a company like twitch to pay like 25 to 50 000 a year uh for your software and it would need to be secure it would need to be you know easy to stream on your phone they would need to have the q a integrated like et cetera et cetera and um i believe that to be true and like i could go validate them i could have just gone and talked to like you know the head of the all in the all hands thing and be like hey if this existed would you buy this and like i saw that problem because i was there before that i didn't even see that problem yeah and we had talked about it it was like a high school newspaper but for your company yeah by the way workshop is the name of it it came to me now so what's the url use workshop.com so it's pretty sick we talked about this before which is in insight like we all have like mailchimp or you have like sendgrid you have a ton of different services to send mass e marketing emails to customers but like there's actually internal marketing too that happens all the time like a company is like a small like you know tribe and like you constantly need like information and sort of propaganda from the top that needs to get to your employees and whether it's like hey remember this friday we're doing casual friday like you know whatever don't wear underwear this friday but you have to get some message across about like what's going on or it's like hey uh we had these wins in the company like congrats to this team for launching the safety feature that saved us whatever um and so what use workshop does is basically creates like a little mailchimp for inside your company so it lets you do lists did they launch but did they launch this because of our podcast or they already know i think they were already working on it and we just got connected from we got connected when they were um they were doing somebody pointed out to me they're like hey these guys are doing almost exactly what you're talking about i reached out and they're like and the guy was awesome he's like yeah we had this past company that was successful we kind of like you know like this is our second merry-go-round got the team back together to do this and then it's like it's working hey we just signed this client this client this like big name big name big name they showed me the chart of revenue and i was like oh this is like so spot on like i i really think that that a tool like this is going to exist and it's going to work yeah this is sick and like the design is just really good like if you go to the design of the page it's like just like clearly these people are good at like they're good at simple products and that's kind of all you need to do to be able to build something like this is like nice clean simple easy to use and they have the use cases so for employee engagement right a change of management company alignment hybrid work mergers and acquisitions internal marketing it's pretty sick measuring performance yeah this is awesome and like you know you send these emails out normally in your company you don't have the open rate you don't have the open tracking you don't know who's actually engaged who's not in your company emails you don't know how you can't test the subject line difference and be like oh this one got way more people to respond to the engagement survey or whatever we sent out and so it lets the internal comms team like do their job better they didn't really have a tool before this i can't find this client info have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases hubspot grow better are you angel investing actively right now yeah you you stopped right or you like took a break well i've taken a break because a the markets and b because um i'm working on this i got my i could talk about a little bit but i got like 20 customers for already for my new project oh nice okay let's talk about a second let's do the angel investing thing first though so i heard something interesting like my initial reaction was to do what you're doing which was like uh it's just i don't know the world's crazy i lost a bunch of money everywhere i look prices are going down like you know stocks are going down crypto's going down everything's going down um maybe i should just bunker down for the season and just like you know chill out a little bit with investing in these like high-risk illiquid startups but at the same time um then i heard somebody say something i think it was um somebody on all in on the podcast that one of their guests he had said something he was like he's like actually they're like are you slowing down and he was like no this is the time to speed up he goes you know the last few years i was like getting pretty worried and i thought like maybe it's time to slow down because valuations were getting really high there's just everybody was there's too much capital flowing around everybody's throwing money at everything it's really you know when you would do a deal it'd be like you wouldn't be able to get all the information you need it's like hey dude we're closing like you're either in or you're out you don't have time to do like certain level of diligence he's like i actually think that those like uh vintages of companies right like you know like a vintage of wine like the 1985 bordeaux was so good it's like basically that happens in startup investing too where like certain vintages turn out really good certain are kind of dry they don't have any big winners if you look basically after every kind of like market crash or recession is like those next three years are some of the best vintages for startups and so like this happened after the kind of 2000 2001 crash and like the next vintage that came out was like had linkedin had facebook had like a bunch of large companies i agree with that but like the valuations maybe it could have it's like feels like it's changing week by week but like two weeks ago when i was looking at a few deals the valuations were still quite high yeah i i think they are coming down and they're coming down week by week you're absolutely right and i you know you could be disciplined on that where you're just like oh you haven't gotten the memo that like you know what used to be 50 million is now 22 million and what used to be 20 million is now eight like you you need to get that memo and some people just haven't got that memo yet but like a lot right that i'm i'm waiting like that amount like just a few more weeks maybe until so that that's when i say wait that's what i mean because we were talking to people and they weren't budging and i was like well all right well wait and now i'm getting emails from some like portfolio companies and they're like you could see their cash balance and how much money they have left and it's like damn man i think there actually might be like a lot of things going on in business in six months i i think there absolutely will be i mean i'm getting a ton of hey we just raised this extra money like a lot of smart founders basically are like taking the bag while it's available uh just to give themselves buffer because like who knows how much worse it's gonna get and um but the values start coming down so i actually think that like this this year next year the next basically two or two and a half years are going to be like kind of an awesome vintage of startups to be investing in because you're getting all the you know like none of the big trends have changed like the world's just getting more tech enabled tech is just going into more and more industries size of the price is getting bigger there's more and more people coming online machine learning all that stuff's making stuff better like all that's still true it's just that the prices got cut in half so it's like oh good i'm i'm on board i'm just like wait i just think that like there's there's so far been like this two three week period where it's like there's a discrepancy i'll get fixed i think in like two three four five six weeks yeah you know i think that's gonna happen pretty pretty soon should we talk about your uh your thing now or you want to do a devoted uh all right well we could we could yeah i don't want to do a devoted thing because i'm not going to announce what it is entirely yet so but we can kind of talk about it but basically uh like i'm kind of going back to my roots i'm launching this new thing i'm not even saying i'm launching it i'm more so like launching uh enough of it to prove or disapprove if it's a good idea okay and i've gotten [Music] like i forget exactly like tens of thousands in revenue in the first two weeks amazing and um and i didn't tweet about it once so so tell me this tell me uh what are you doing differently this time around that you did so the last time you started this rodeo was maybe six years ago something like that yeah yeah and so now with you did the whole hustle chapter do you get acquired you go to hubspot you see a bunch of things you meet a bunch of people you get smarter wiser all that stuff you got some hair on your chest now and so it's like what's what did you decide like all right this time i'm doing these things differently or was it early on early on i was like against outsourcing or hiring anyone overseas or hiring like cheap labor or hourly labor and i was like no i want to create jobs and i want to like do salary position with benefits and now i'm not doing that eventually maybe we'll add some people like that but now it's like just how do i automate this and how do i like get someone overseas just to do this like a machine and i just don't really care if i don't have any employees and i want to you know i'd prefer being alone so that's the big difference the second difference is well this the same similarities i'm doing it all by hand and this is totally the right move and i stand by that so before i wrote everything i sold the first ads i did it all this time i'm doing the same thing so i'm literally doing the cold emailing i'm getting them on the phone i'm doing the sales i'm listening to them i'm doing that constantly and getting those reps in is actually really impactful and you can actually like see what's happening but i by the way i got that revenue uh zero percent of the revenue has come through our website it's all been from cold emailing people on linkedin and getting them on the phone and then just sending them a stripe account amazing what um what else what else is different about your mindset i bet there's more way more confident for sure um there is still a sense of urgency uh so like wanting to move fast and like i have to get this done i have to do this but more so like um i have to get this done but also remember like i may do this for like 20 years right so like having this longer term this longer horizon what i learned with my business we sold around year five and the truth is most the value created between year five and year six was more probably than the value of zero to five combined right and i was i wasn't impatient because i'm happy i did what i did because it unlocked a lot for my life but had i not i said this a bunch of times if i was already wealthy i would never have sold because real value seems like it comes like now i've only experienced a business from like around year five but it seems like maybe there's something that happens you're five years six where values created and then who knows maybe someone who's owned a company for years is like man 20 and 30 is when like [ __ ] magic really happened so i don't know but i do think like year five if you bootstrap is around the time where you're like all right i recruited some actually good people i've got people doing helping and everything but like i don't know do you agree with like year five year six year seven is where some crazy stuff happens i think it's just i think it's just generally true right like you you plant seeds and they you water them and you water them and you're looking at them you're trying not to just go dig up the dirt be like why the [ __ ] aren't you growing but like at some point those things do start to grow like we're seeing this with our e-commerce business too which was um uh my buddy had told me this he goes he goes there's this magic moment in e-commerce where you've you've brute forced enough of the like building your brand and getting cut getting new people to try you where every month your returning customers just come back because they love your product and you don't have to remarket you don't have to spend money remarketing right and then the business goes from like this giant cash suck to this giant cash cow if you do it right and um and i was and we just started to hit a tipping point like that where you could say and it's not every month but there's some months where i'm like whoa what just happened and it's like oh yeah that's that's what's happening like we actually just last year we brute forced and got a bunch of people to love our product and then they came back and bought and this like a bunch of them came back and bought this month to where it outweighed all of the new investments that we're making like wow that's nice or like at twitch we were always doing these like planning exercises about like you know these profitability targets um i can't say too much but like basically profitability targets and i think emmett had said something he was like yeah we from the like he's like pretty early on we modeled it out and it was like it's gonna take like 10 years probably and this and he said a huge number he's like x billion in revenue for us to you know break even and i was like that's just a crazy idea that it's like we need to get to x billion in revenue for this to be profitable um and like th but it did like that's exactly you know that's the that's what actually how it was playing out yeah and it's like whoa like i hadn't even really like amazon i think had a sort of had a semi similar story amazon i think for 15 years or something like that was like unprofitable on on the whole but the difference in amazon was like the individual divisions were getting very profitable after like a repeat of like a reliable like i don't know what's called four-year cycles like books got super profitable but by the time books was getting profitable they were investing heavily in cds and music and these other things and so then the total always looked unprofitable but they knew internally this is just a clock that goes you know every x it's going to take four years or whatever it is to this unit to get profitable and once they're all profitable this thing's going to be like unbelievable which is where it's at now trusting that process is really hard particularly for first-time entrepreneurs with bezos and emmett or i guess you know after like 10 years it's like well i'm not exactly a first-time founder anymore but you know what i mean well i'll say the way i'm saying the twitch one right now sounds a bit like a master plan like ah i'm i could see this coming and i'll uh whatever it's like no it was more like uh oh [ __ ] we got users oh [ __ ] the costs are really high what if we raise money okay what do we got to tell these guys what are you gonna tell these investors or how they're gonna get their money back uh maybe this business model will work and maybe on this timeline and then like we update that information every two years and like i think you know i think twitch had like a thing where it's like we're gonna be profitable in three years and they've been saying that for the last six you know like that's just like been a thing and that's very common actually for businesses right like yeah like entrepreneurs generally pretty optimistic elon's been saying self-driving cars will come out this year for four years like you know it's like entrepreneurs are usually right about the the actual assessment and they're wrong about the timeline or somebody somebody gave me this great phrase they go uh don't confuse a clear view for a short distance it's like imagine you're driving you see something so clearly but it's like it looks like it's just right there right just right around the corner and like actually that corner is like a 10-year odyssey that felt like oh it's gotta be just two or three years away the last big thing that's different between now and then you know having some experience versus no experience is the ability to say no and be like oh well you're saying you don't want this product therefore i guess i should change it it's like oh okay well that's okay if you don't want it you're actually not who we're going for i i i so you you didn't you didn't my takeaway from this is not you uh that my product is not good and people don't want it it's just that i just i now i know i shouldn't target people like you and said i should only target people like this other person right and that's like the huge thing where it's like the vision is that we are going to be this for this people eventually maybe it can expand beyond that but for a while this is what we are and this is who we are for and if you don't talk to people who you think you are for then it's okay that's just they're not the right target market um and i just targeted that customer poorly but you should only like you know be one thing for one type of person and you go deep on that and oftentimes people will be like but that's not that big but a sometimes it is that big uh and b it's like that's okay you just gotta like get that initial traction and then more opportunity spots itself but you have to be this one thing for this one person and ignore everyone else so my sister has a business i don't know have i told you about her like cloud kids thing well i know she's a babysitter's a little that's not actually accurate but like daycare right it was well so it was i guess it was kind of like an in-home daycare that became like a preschool and became like an outdoor preschool whatever it kind of evolved yeah by the way sorry i didn't mean to call that babysitting she would punch me in the face and i knew that wasn't the right i knew it was a babysitting i was like i called it i meant to say daycare so yeah that's okay that's right so but during covert she pivoted to like an online thing like a lot of businesses went from like oh [ __ ] brick and mortar is really hard right now because they're like you know every month the government is changing the rules on what we can if we can and can't operate our business so she created this thing called cloud kids so if you go to cloud kids with a z uh i think it's preschool.com let me see if that's it um yeah cloudkidswithazpreschool.com so go to that website real quick and just look at this um i actually think she's done a pretty good job with the cloud kids cloud kids what cloud kit i'll just put the link here cloud kids with a z preschool.com so check this out so um this is like helping her with this has been pretty fun because she like she built this in like wicks i'm like oh which oh it looks great who's using wix and then and i was like all right you need to add like change the headline you need to add like a video the video needs to be not like a full-on video like just make it look like a teacher teaching something like oh dude this looks amazing exactly so now it's really good it used to be like um you know get info now it's like free trial right like just optimizing the landing page with her like headline sub headline button hero image you know reasons to it reasons to buy all that stuff like and then she's like working with people in like fiverr and upwork to like do these designs it's like it's actually turned out pretty good and so she created this thing which is basically like um these small group classes so like let's say you have your kid at home uh either because they're just like my like my daughter she's too young to go to school right now we don't want to send her to full-time preschool but like we wanted to like learn something every day and it kind of takes a [ __ ] ton of energy to sit there and be like the engaging patient parent and like keep your kids attention and be like i'll teach you like how to write the letter w today like but like with this i'm like i sit her down in front of the computer i get the materials in front of her with paper and crayon and like the teacher is like so good they'll be like all right you know like hi high five let's sing our welcome song and then they like do all the things so for one hour she gets it's like screen time without the guilt it's like the she gets engaged like it's cartoons but it's not cartoons because she's actually learning stuff and getting better and so she created this service and it's like i was like dude this is actually a pretty good product and she um she's hired these teachers and the teachers like like in florida and different places like that so so then she was she calls me she's like oh i'm just like struggling so much with the growth and so i like i was like all right well like tell me what like she's like i just it's not working what were the numbers and so she gives her the numbers and she's basically like i was like okay so let's draw the funnel and she's like what's a funnel i'm like all right just imagine like at the top you know you're getting leads like people who come to your website and then some of them give you emails some of them sign for free trial some of them actually show up and then some of them become a fully paid customer so we drew that funnel out it's like oh actually this conversion rate is kind of awesome like why do you and then and i was like so what's your cost per lead is that really high it's like no it's like not high at all and this is with like you know this like 50 a day 100 a day ad budget like and she's just like i don't even know how to do facebook ads i just put in like you know 100 and i just wanted to see what would happen and like i was like wow this is actually like this business is kind of amazing so you pay back your customer in less than a month she's like i don't know if you say so i'm like yeah like that's what your numbers say you basically pay back before your ads bill is even due that's like the the ultimate like thing you want with ads driven business is like to to get the revenue from a customer profitably before you even pay your credit card bill and and to give the listener contact so it prices range from forty dollars a week to so you could alright alright i understand so you can get classes one day two day three day four day a week they it all ranges from like 160 a month to 400 a month and you get it's basically it's a the the tagline is actually quite good it uh although the website needs a little work like i clicked on the faqs and it goes to privacy policy but that's all right live online preschool classes the number one live preschool program from home we per this is the beautiful line we provide the curriculum teachers and friends right that's a that's great and then uh there's a video who is this like this woman who works for her you don't have a white sister yeah yes one more time and uh is great i'm all about this this is beautiful by the way the art is actually really good yeah i think it's a group it's pretty good right and so so this and so then the reason i bring this up is is because you were talking about handling a no handling an objection and what i learned when i was like diving in i was like your funnel is not broken your website is good your services your retention is amazing um i was like even your ad like roads your payback period is also amazing so i was like what are you talking about this thing and she's like well i mean like i talked to like you know so many people they all just you know they don't come back for the from the free trial i'm like but you're converting 20 or something like that to from free to paid that's like yeah best on the internet yeah but like i talked to eight moms that were like you know we can't do it for this for this reason and i was like yeah but eight out of ten eight out of ten knows that means two out of ten yeses that's 20 conversion that's again amazing and the numbers back out where this business is like an awesome business and i think the the site what happened was the psychology because i told her i was like hey if you want to close more people call everybody who just did your free trial and see if they'll convert to pay don't be like hey i'm i'm the owner of the school how did you like it uh so glad you know i saw i dropped in on the class i saw she was doing great um like do you think you want to continue and like do you want to do more classes um and like oh payment's a problem like we can help you with the payment plan because a lot of the people who are doing this they're like detroit inner city like there's a lot of people that are basically like hey i can't pay for full-time caretaking i can't pay for even full school uh or like in detroit for example what i learned through this was in detroit the public schools are full so you just can't send your kid can you believe that so people are like six years old and they're like yeah this school's full and i can't afford private school it's like i've never heard public school could be full and like that's what's going on in detroit right now is this is this is your sister's just like move over sean there's a new there's a dude big like a d at the house well the funny thing is she's she's got a better product in business than i have in any of my businesses in terms of all the core metrics are stronger than all of mine the product offering the retention stronger than anything the problem is not a problem actually she doesn't want to like she's not trying to do world domination she's like no this would be great if we got to like 50 students and like well then you'll want 100 right she's like no because that'll be way more work like at 50 i already have these great teachers i can handle 50 i just want to fill up my occupancy and like she truly is like well because when i do that and then i can go work out in the middle of the day and like i just want my lifestyle i can go to my daughter's thing you know sean you know she has something that you'll never know oh no the e word enough yeah i see that she doesn't have enough my uh i i went through i went with my mother-in-law she's like hey sam can i drive you to the airport i was like why do you as well it's two hours to get there i need you to explain to me how online commerce works because i want to start a store this was two or three years ago and i like did the ride and i told how to use the store now she's got a business doing like half a million a year and i was like so why don't you scale this why don't you do this why don't you do this you could be like i'm always like you could be like the black martha stewart like you could crush this and she's like but i like taking tuesdays and thursdays off and i was like oh right well but if you made more then you could take two says a third off she's like i could do that right now right so yeah it's the same exact thing that i'm like but but but but and just to finish the point on the the rejection thing what i learned was when she called people and eight people in a row said no it was like completely demoralizing to her and she started to question everything it's like am i going after the wrong market do i have the wrong product am i have my price too high am i this am i that and i think it's really important to be able to back out numbers i've seen the same mistake on fundraising all the time so it sounds kind of silly when it's like oh my sister's a little preschool oh you know it's just 20 conversion rate obviously that's good um like even if it was 10 it would still be great like it still work um like oh that's so silly you know she got demoralized by by hearing you know eight nos in a row you know on a monday morning and um or not even hearing no's just not hearing back from people i'm like yeah yeah but then i talked to founders and they're like dude raising money so hard i need to change this change that can you help me with my pitch i'm like how many investors did you pitch to and they're like yeah we talked to like you know these four last week i'm like four and i'm like you know this is a numbers game this is a sales funnel and you need you're selling your equity in your business in exchange for money and like like what you're doing is you're getting highly emotional and you're taking it highly personal that somebody doesn't want to fund your business and like in reality yes you should be learning from like how to pitch better and like maybe maybe in the end you will strike out but you don't even know that yet you haven't hit enough people dude what a lot of people realize is that like one to three percent conversion rate is like normal which kind of means that like maybe you'll go over 29 and on the 30th one you get a one and that's like boom you know you're now you're one for three or you're uh you're you're that's a three percent conversion rate you're good yeah or maybe on your 99th one the tenth one boom one percent of 100 that's good that's why i always joke with ben i'm like mormons are probably the best sales people because convincing someone to join a religion has like the lowest conversion rate ever and then you hear that like you could sell salesforce and that has a two percent conversion rate and you're like piece of cake this is this is the easiest thing ever ever versus commission then how many like i i don't know like if that's actually what you did where you tried to get people to like quit whatever religion they were in and join your crew but how many people do you think who were like either atheists or in another team and they just said yeah cool i'll i'll join your thing how many people what what's what was your percentage rate uh so let's see i have did you convert anyone yeah i converted uh low 30s uh i'd have to look like 32 people on my mission so i was two years and um oh man how many doors do i think i knocked on in in that time uh i mean it was a couple hundred or a thousand uh it was hundreds of doors a day across to every every single day for two years right so you knock down a hundred doors a day easily easily a hundred doors a day what country hold on we're doing some public math this deserves it let's say well yeah while you do it let me ask you a question what kind of so i was in el paso texas but i was speaking spanish so if you did 150 doors a day which you're saying easily uh is estimate every single day 365 days two years you knocked on a hundred and nine thousand doors you you did 109. three thousand thirty thirty and you did 32 at 109. uh so that's 0.00 0.02 or 0.002 something like that some something that's like yeah fraction fractions of a percent dude how about the fact that your friends were all going these cool places in africa or south america and they sent you to el paso yeah but i mean you know yeah my brother went to prague my sister went to moscow uh but uh we had um what's his name austin from uh lambda school which is now bloom tech he went to russia he was in russia or something like that he said he converted zero or one he was like oh because we'd ask what would be good he's like one would have been great yeah for where i was that's the trade-off you make is that like yeah my brother and sister were in much cooler places in eastern europe but like eastern europe was hard man like really hard but i thought like so i guess you're dealing with uh mostly mexicans or some type of hispanic yeah they're they're the most hardcore catholics there are they they're they're willing to well so you gotta realize though el paso is like uh very transitory a lot of people just got there from from mexico and so it's like ah well i'm not really going to my church that i used to go to maybe i'm looking for something new like my life is already changing i'm open to something new you know facebook has a similar feature it's called recently moved and those are great people to target it's true dude recently moved is an awesome group of people to target because they're changing their life yeah yeah exactly if you have like a weight loss thing um ben can you give me the like speed version of what is the pitch so you not you literally physically knock on a door i open up what happens yeah so essentially what we're taught to do uh is no just like do it i mean in spanish yeah do it to me do it to me no blowing you got to do it you guys gotta you gotta bear with me it's been uh okay so i'm um thirty-four it's been 13 years you did this a hundred thousand times you know this like yeah abc so uh know i'd say hi how are you my name is elder wilson this is i got my companion with me this is elder lopez uh uh how are you today you know just whatever hi good i'm doing great nice to meet you uh gosh how gosh i'm sorry hold on let me think about this what do you want okay we'll give you a second cook it i can get into it but like how would i first first start that's what i'm trying to think of how many times did people tell you to f off uh i couldn't begin to tell you i mean more often than do they train you or you just sort of figure out how to sell them you go to uh well so you have three weeks of training if you're speaking english if you're learning a language it depends on how difficult the language is i got six weeks of training i think do you carry mace no no weapon no nothing like a whistle you have a whistle no i i think maybe the the women it might be up to their own discretion maybe they do some stuff like that i have a friend who got stabbed he was in honduras uh like a good buddy of mine got stabbed on his mission um lethal and weapon here yeah uh how i i you know um start off with just like um you know we're missionaries from the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints and you you start off by asking them questions like uh do you believe in god uh are you someone who who believes in god yeah oh uh you know like what do you believe about i do go to a church oh yeah i go to a church and so you start with kind of relating to them about their faith and then you say well you know our message is that uh you know you said you believe in jesus christ we also believe in jesus christ from the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints and what we believe is that the same christ the same church that christ established when he was on the earth 2000 years ago was lost for a period of time um and and so no one had the complete truth but that it's been restored again that exact same church and so that's why we're out here trying to to talk to people if you knew that was true that christ church was was back on the earth the same one that he established is that something that would be interesting to you no oh my gosh this is awesome just the sales call the wolf of dude uh that's fascinating man i feel like by the way you know whoever runs the budget at the uh you know the mormon church me and sam are available for consultation if you need some uh some uh you know tips on how to brush up that that opening script i think maybe those first few lines maybe we could give you some other hooks maybe some other some other other ways in because also like have you seen the trends on tic tac where it's like a baby or something like running away and they overlay uh audio that says excuse me ma'am can i talk can i talk to you about the lord you know can i talk to you about the lord ma'am have you been to church lately ma'am where are you going can we can we please talk it's like always like some funny running away uh you guys should pounce on that man would it be valid to do your mission through tick tock like if you were like i'm gonna make amazing tick tock videos that go viral and help spread our mission like could you do that is that like or it has to be door knocking um well no so during covid a lot of um missions kind of went to social media essentially um now you got to realize that like your mission is like a it's a rite of passage really like for two years when i was 19 to 21 years old i didn't have any contact with my family except for i wrote them an email once a week and then i got to call home on christmas and mother's day that was it so like completely separated from my past life um like doing this extremely hard thing and so during covid uh missionaries did like start doing like social media missions because they couldn't go to people's doors and talk to them but my impression was like man that sounds like sucks like you missed out on the rite of passage like i wouldn't want to do that for two years like that doesn't sound fun just exploring yourself losing your virginity going to parties converting people you're saying man that sounds like it sucks i wouldn't want to do that and like when you describe like not seeing your family and like you know having to like whatever you said like you know like if you're going to wash your knees every day or whatever like you want it to be hard you want it to be like this like life-changing difficult crazy thing that you do with your life not like sitting behind a computer for two years that's the difference between mormons and gentiles like us yeah exactly there's a bunch of heathens dude i spent my whole life avoiding hardship like well i would be in the military or like you know the morbid church or whatever like if i really wanted to lean into like difficulty i spent my life running away from difficulty we we are not the same oh yeah we are not the same yeah then it is like a big cultural thing it's hard to explain how excited i was for this again i have two years oh my god well that's why uh you're you know are going to be probably more successful than both of us and happier and um and happier yeah and more emotionally i have a ton of respect for anybody who does that i also have even more respect for whoever was able to convince people to do this i think that is like one of the greatest you know like uh greatest like organizations that that's been created like with such a strong pull that its members would take such a like large you know uh movement and and like to support it like and they're obligated to convince 10 other people to join yeah i'm trying to get somebody to give me their email address for like two seconds and i'm like they have to give you like they have to give you 10 of their income they got to give you 10 of their income and go and recruit about 50 more people it's the greatest thing ever two years your life 10 of your income all of your social capital and uh probably something else that i don't even know about and we can't pay taxes either because we're giving it all away it's the it's the sweetest deal in the world it is it is a great deal 10 is cheap on what you get in return wow oh wow amazing and you have to believe it's the greatest deal in the world even better wow amazing i didn't enjoy this man i've never seen them i'm convinced now you're like do you guys want more so let me i'll tell you this i do i do i pay 10 of of all of my income i donate a ton of time it sucks all my time i donated two i gave two years i paid for two years to be on this mission okay i get i give up a lot but at the same time like if i move anywhere i show up at a new place i call the local congregation a bunch of dudes come help me unpack my boxes and move in i go to church i immediately have like a dozen friends people invite me over to dinner for the first few nights that i'm in this new city um if i need if i need a job there's someone you know dedicated in the congregation who will help me find a job if i'm ever like down on my luck and i need food the church of jesus christ life saints will provide me with food make sure i don't go hungry like um you just described being a famous podcaster also by the way sam just sam went on a road trip last year and was just like hey who wants me to drive their car and people are like here here's the keys and he's like hey um anybody here's wife want to cook me dinner and give me a massage people are like honey honey sam's in town maybe i maybe i am mormon after all exactly uh i mean i i look like it maybe i am mormon maybe i should do a dna test jokes aside and also i don't have the wrath of god if he does exist against me so you know uh i think it is pretty awesome and also like i think people study like what makes people happy in the end i think the biggest always religion that's always part of it well i think the biggest one is is like uh quality time spent with people you care about which like is a combination of like family friends communities the spiritual community all that stuff and so what you're describing is basically like that's awesome meaningful relationships with people who like you know have like kind of an unconditional support of each other which is great and something that everybody would sign up for um you know depending on you know with the situation the cost i do think believer believers in a religion live longer than non-believers and i also think they're happier uh i i was curious about that sean that wasn't are they gonna have a succinct uh pitch for for why it's a great thing we need to send you on a mission i would love to go knock on uh i would love to go knock on 100 i really want to just do door-to-door sales just to see if i could do it and how it would the pitch needs to be excuse me man do you know what the average life expectancy of an atheist is now what if i were to tell you that mormon believers it's this would that interest you right we i don't know if if uh if the church would go for this but if they would we should do a youtube series where like we send sean with a couple missionaries i can hook you up with in the bay area and just go knock on like 100 or 200 doors with them and like see what it's like offer your thoughts and then like give them some observations and tips from uh well i would like to just go sell my own fake religion and just see that like how well i could do um because you know i need i need that kind of fresh slate i'm more of an entrepreneur not an entrepreneur if you know what i mean so i i got to create something from scratch here and keep all those tax benefits to myself as well i've actually considered this many times about creating my own religion um because i do have my own philosophy my own belief system i do share it with others and uh and uh it's a life operation and i don't like taxes and i think that it's fantastic to to own a religion or to go to church of a religion and you're indian so you know you can be a guru like people expect that you know i know i mean when i had the longer hair i was much better suited for this but you know if i like sam what would be your opening line like what where what direction would you take it like he was like hi i'm ben do you have a moment to talk about i would have said exactly i would say excuse me ma'am i know this is so strange but i gotta ask you a quick question what would you say if i told you that the average life expectancy of an atheist was 72 but the average life expectancy of a mormon is 84. would you want to know why and i think they would say yeah i guess well you see it's do you want to see your grandkids someday yeah like well because when you believe in a religion it means this this and this and it just so happens our religion i would tell them well that's why it was good that he he started with do you believe in god right because he could get the losers out of the way well don't you got to separate i say are you talking to an atheist are you talking to somebody of another religion because you can't you got to know which way you're going there the other way is you know you do the thing where you're like um uh you know hey um you know i was just at your neighbor's house and i thought i would pop by um just so you're like i hate when i'm in the neighborhood uh i would say yeah i was at the johnson's across the street and um uh you know i thought i'd stop by because um blah blah blah or like you know i really just wanted to chat with you for a minute do you do you believe in god all right you know maybe go with something that's like um uh i was just wondering have you seen this video just hold up my phone of that tick-tock of the baby uh we chased away like i'm just trying to like you know stun them into not not like automatically rejecting me right like it's like how do i get some curiosity which would be something like um you know i'm going around the neighborhood i'm just asking you know do you go to church uh regularly and they're like oh yeah right awesome uh would you say you believe in god yeah i do believe in god um you know where did that start was that from your parents yeah my mom was super religious my mom too and then i was like you know trying to do something like that that's off the top of my head how i would try to like you know build rapport quickly as i get them to talk you know take the podcast [Laughter] hey give me give me a hundred thousand reps at this i think i'd be pretty good by the end yeah better than ben and having to think about it yeah ben's response made me think he might he might not have uh gone on that mission after all hey sean 32 converts you've got zero so far so you got to get on my level i just don't know how you forgot the script you said a thousand a hundred thousand times that sounds a little suspicious over a decade's a long time sean a decade's a long time all right i gotta go bathroom i'll talk to you all a little bit [Music] you

[Music] this is neil duketa from toronto ontario canada my question for you is what are your first three actionable steps to creating a lead gen business and what are the three industries you would uh go after in small communities okay we could do that it's hard to come up with three but i think we could just talk about it in general well i i got all right i got into this business a little bit i was testing on a legion site what i did was i emailed another legion site and i just said would you buy leads from me how much and they said if your leads were qualified using these parameters we will pay you a hundred dollars per lead is for a trucking website that i was working on and they said if they are uh long commercial driver licensed folks and you are able to verify that by getting a picture of their license we will give you one hundred dollars and so i assumed a hundred dollars was the cheapest that it would cost and then if i i also went on linkedin and i emailed the marketing and growth managers at the actual trucking companies and i said how much do you guys pay and they said 150 and that kind of gave me that range of i can acquire it for 100 to 150 and then what i did was i went and drove ads and traffic to a website that got this information and i was able to get leads for 250 and i thought huh okay if i just if i just fooled around and got it for 250 bucks and they're willing to pay 150 like i think there's something there that i can actually make this profitable that's what i did yeah i think my first step would be because i don't know a ton about legion i'd be like okay well who's killing it with legion and so i would just my first step would be like find a blueprint of success uh so who is who is a newish lead gen site so i wouldn't be looking for one that like started in 1998 and has just been cranking since then i'd be like all right what's a newish lead gen site so something started maybe the last two three years and i would go look at their stuff i could read an article about them and then i would contact them and be like hey um really interested in your business um and i'd either be like i'm interested in buying your business can you tell me a little about it would you be open if you know at the right price would you be open to selling your business and they sell yes or no or i would say hey um i'm really trying to learn about the lead gen business for a different category would you um you know would you be down to you know talk to me for 15 20 minutes whatever and they might say yes they might say no if i wanted to make it juicier i could say hey i'm doing an article on my favorite five you know truck truck driver lead gen businesses or truck driver recruiting businesses uh i want to feature you guys um just need to hop on a call 30 minutes i'll ask you a few questions and i'll use it in the article and then in that you know article i would basically while doing that that call about the article i would ask them how they started how they get it you know how they get the leads um what's the hardest part blah blah blah and i would try to figure out a blueprint to figure out is this even the business i want to be in and is there a common formula that these businesses use like oh they all use facebook ads as their traffic source or they all use google keywords as their traffic source then they take you to a landing page with a quick email capture and then three question qualifier right after that and then their business models that they sell those leads to whoever at certain price and this only works if the leads are like you know 100 worth 100 or more the ones that are below that seem to struggle and i would try to figure out how much money they make and how they do it and that'll be my first first thing is i'd be searching for a blueprint essentially that i can remix it's like all right i'm gonna 80 is going to be the same and 20 is going to be different so the 20 that's different might be i'm in a different category or i do it from a slightly different like you know i put a greater emphasis on copywriting or newsletters or whatever in order to generate those leads that would be my first first step and which industry so we have a couple examples here so you did you did trucking on your own before that you've shown me an apartment one what was it apartment what was the lead gen for well um what leads did they want the company that bought my company years ago was called apartment list originally they were called vertical brands and they just owned lead gen sites for senior living um they owned a legion site for a rent to own housing which was like they bootstrapped i think like six or seven million in revenue then they owned apartment list which eventually became the main company but that was a lead gem for apartments and then they owned it for cars called autolist.com which was acquired by car gurus for like 30 million dollars and so that was really effective uh but i would the math is basically like how valuable of a purchase price is the product multiplied by the frequency that they one person buys the product multiplied by the number of people who have that need so for example if it's a lead gen for ceos of large of like small to medium-sized businesses so it's like a job board for potential ceos a small business would be one to spend like 50 000 on that and but they're only gonna hire once every eight years so like that kind of gives you like help and there's like not that many people who are into that that kind of gives you like the math behind the opportunity do you know what i mean yeah exactly i'd be looking for high ticket price things so i was going to say senior living my father-in-law does senior living and i see that like he wants customers a customer to him is going to pay maybe six grand a month for a room so their customer you know and they'll last on average you know two years at the place right so you're getting 24 months times six thousand dollars their va customers are very valuable they're willing to give you six thousand dollars for a you know for a customer if you can send them one so their leads might be you know a few hundred bucks that they're willing to pay for if you're qualified right if you're in the area and whatever else so senior living was one i was gonna say um and then the other ones are like you know i see this with like moving companies or construction companies or like pool construction companies like oh that's a 50 000 project to build a pool in this area and maybe the pool construction companies are not the best at seo like optimization so i'm going to go after that category because i think that that's that's one where i can i can beat them at their own game and sell them back those those customer leads um so i would look for really high ticket price uh things like moving pool construction senior uh you know senior care um there's one more that i was thinking of that's uh all right slip my mind but yeah things like that i think those are those are great categories to go after i can't find this client info have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases hubspot grow better can i share one that i just heard about that i actually think would be pretty valuable here is um because it's related to what you were saying about senior care facilities there's this new kind of facility that's coming online that's essentially like um mental health triage i think is the way to think of it which is essentially like you walk in and there's a bunch of lazy boys and they've got tvs in front of them and if you're having like an episode a mental breakdown you go in there and they might help medicate you if you need that and they'll set you up with a therapist on this big tv and just like make sure you're okay while people figure out what's going on uh because mental health issues are becoming more prevalent uh okay so this is like actually just coming online uh and this is like a new type of care facility and i feel like there's probably not a lot of competition yet for um finding those types of leads um so there might be some uh some opportunities to to help that's a good question uh i know my buddy dennis is like helping build one so he he told me about it but i don't know what you would call them yeah mental health care treatment or something like that but like i think that you know the general principle is you want a high ticket uh you know buyer of your leads so you need them to be making a ton of money off of the thing you want to have low competition if possible the other thing is can you use content as like your legion so you're not just playing a google keywords bidding game or a facebook ads keyword bidding game but like if you are educating people about something so like i don't know let's call it like um what's that like surgery that a bunch of people getting like brazilian booty lifts or something like that it's like there's some surgery or some new thing that a bunch of people are curious about right and uh the topic itself like kind of lends itself to content or ratings or reviews or like uh you know pros and cons and stuff like that like um can you create youtube or tick tock content that's just talking about you know the pros the cons the the good stories the horror stories the whatever else and then basically if people and then you capture interested parties who are like they were googling to try to learn more about it and you as the educational source become like you know slightly trusted you never need to operate the underlying business you just sell that lead you know farm them to a partner who's basically like you know your vetted partner to do that that procedure or do that or do whatever it is in a given geography [Music] sid did we answer that ben i think it's a good ass answer that's it one question friday all right uh and uh if you want your question read live on uh on the show go to mfmpod.com and click on the microphone ask us questions bye [Music]

what was the original fee and what was the requirements um the original organization 20 years ago started with people who had created net worths of between 10 million and 100 million and very quickly the top end exploded with success uh so it grew to a billion dollars and um more recently we've realized that our focus is on members between 20 million and a billion and what i was going to say is the main difference between vistage and ypo and tiger 21 is the average net worth of vistage and ypo members is probably maybe a tenth of that or fifth of that of tiger r [Music] how long ago uh did you start the company uh about 21 or 22 years ago at this point what was the original idea it's really a simple idea if you're an incredibly successful entrepreneur could be building a business for 10 years 20 years 30 years and then you sell the business you think that it's the magic moment when you sell it but actually what happens is the day after you sell it you have a lot of money but you might be alone you might might have an assistant but you don't have a thousand employees you don't have anybody laughing at your jokes anymore you might even have to get your own coffee and everybody around you thinks that you're wealthy and successful but you've lost the platform that allowed you to feel successful and all of a sudden you're back at a new point and the number one challenge that you have is to be a wealth preserver so you don't lose what you've made except that you don't know anything about preserving wealth what you are is a great entrepreneur or a great leader or a great manager and you're good at inspiring troops but you don't have any troops anymore so you have this dramatic shift and it turns out that what it takes to be a great entrepreneur might qualify you to be a mediocre investor when you're an entrepreneur you focus on a single opportunity you're highly emotional about it you you give it everything you can when you're an investor you have to be more dispassionate you have to have a diversified portfolio and you have to have you have to be unemotional about it so the sum of it all is that there's a little understood transition which a few very lucky very successful people get to go through and we wanted to study that which is what we've done over the last 21 years to help people in that transition uh get through it and on to a better place when you originally started the business what was the uh like what was the product was it like ypo where it was a monthly group meetup what was it sure so you mentioned ypo which is a fantastic organization there's another similar organization called vistage and they both are for ceos and uh if those are the great colleges we're the one great graduate school and so we have a lot of ypo members that graduate into uh tiger 21 and a lot of vistage members that graduate into tiger 21 uh and just to give you an idea the uh the v last time i looked both vistage and uh ypl have about fifty thousand members globally it might be sixty now i've lost time vistage has fifty thousand members and ypo each oh oh okay yeah that's about thirty thousand each i think could be a little more i haven't looked in a company's company oh these are huge businesses sure because vistage charges like 50 grand a year right or what i think i think i think vistage is around 15 000 or 18 i don't have the exact number could be 20. ypo doesn't have a single price because depending on whether you go on the trips and there's different people pay different amounts but the big difference between those two which are great organizations is ypo is self-facilitated by its members whereas vistage and also tiger 21 our groups are led by professionals we we have over 100 groups around the globe now and so we have a cadre of over 40 professional chairs might be 60 excuse me 60 professional chairs that we've trained exquisitely to lead these incredible groups but the bottom line is that those are the two great organizations for ceos and business owners and when you decide as a rule for life that you want to get off of the merry-go-round for whatever reason uh the next decision point is best uh focused on with peers that you'll find in tiger 21. so basically the original premise and you can tell me if that's still the premises you um you have a uh a small group of peers i don't know how big the group is you can tell me it's 12 to 15 people so 12 to 15 people and you meet of some type of cadence like four or some weeks monthly full day and you have a coach or what do you call your coaches facilitators they're the chair you have a chair who leads these discussions and what's the original fee and what was the requirements um the original organization 20 years ago started with people who had created net worths of between 10 million and 100 million and very quickly the top end exploded with success so it grew to a billion dollars and um more recently we've realized that our focus is on members between 20 million and a billion and what i was going to say is the main difference between vistage and ypo and tiger 21 is the average net worth of vistage and ypo members is probably maybe a tenth of that or fifth of that of tiger are if you do the math we have 140 billion dollars under management we don't manage it our members manage it by themselves we're not a money manager but collectively uh we have about uh 12 a little under 1200 members so it's a little over 100 million dollars per member that's crazy and what's the price now the membership is about 33 000 a year that's that's we we try and have a kind of one price so the only thing you pay is a single membership fee uh unless you come to the annual meeting there's lots of other events that are included but because there's hotels and all that kind of stuff if you come to the annual meeting there's an additional charge of a couple grand so i uh i i can't do the math in my head but like that's like over 100 million in revenue so these are like no no so it's about a thousand it's very it's a very simple business model it's about 1200 people that are paying a little more than 30 000 so it's about 35 or 40 million dollars oh i think you said 12 and uh and that's what it costs to run that's crazy and what's crazy is 20 10 million today is a lot it's a significant amount of money 20 years ago 10 million was obviously a significant more than it is now how do you how did you find your first folks so i was in a vistage group uh which had about 15 members and in a dramatically weird coincidence in 1998 uh six of us sold five or six of us sold our businesses we were all in that vistage group because we were business owners trying to be better managers owners ceos and uh we love the group and so after our businesses were sold we didn't want to leave the group but we found over about a six-month period we were going to meetings trying to figure out how to make your cfo and your sales team and your production more efficient but we didn't have that anymore we were just business we had sold our businesses so i frankly uh said wow i'd like to be spending time with peers but what i want to be learning is how they're going through this transition of becoming a wealth manager and how they can help each other be more successful managing through that transition and that was the roots of tiger 21. what was your first business my first business the one sorry the one that you sold the first business that i sold i developed something called the harborside financial center with a partner we were 50 50 partners i was 25. he was 57 it was the largest commercial renovation in the country at the time we bought a rundown warehouse that had been the largest building in the world in 1929 when it was built eclipsed a few years later by the pentagon but it was an industrial warehouse on the waterfront in jersey city directly across from the world trade center and i had the idea literally when i was 17 because i worked there when i was 17 that it was just 3000 feet from wall street and what was happening is that was in the age of large computer centers and so you had all the downtown wall street firms building computer centers and if they didn't want to be in manhattan they would go to a far away campus on a suburban you know somewhere in suburbia and people felt like they weren't in suburbia they felt they were in siberia it was too far from the mother ship and i had the idea that if you could put some of those computer centers into this huge industrial warehouse it would be five minutes from the parent under the hudson through the path train and in three minutes you could get back to whatever the parent company's parent was and that was sort of the original insight that this old industrial building had floor loads and and ceiling heights that would accommodate raised floors for computer centers and the weights that you needed the weight loads the floor loads and uh that was basically the idea and that's the thing that you sold before but yeah i sold that uh when i was 30. then i did another business that was basically a real estate merchant bank that acquired a lot of distressed real estate when the real estate market crashed in the late 80s i don't know if you remember that the stock market crashed in 87 the real estate market followed and so i was able to acquire a couple hundred properties from banks that had gone under and the federal government had taken over and when i sold that business in 1998 i said i don't want to have to go back to work uh i want to know how to preserve money how do people who've sold their business how did they think about what they're going to do so that they don't take stupid risks and find out they've lost it all has uh building tiger 21 you you kind of was tired 21 supposed to be a a business earlier it's actually it's been a labor of love for me but you know oddly was it able to create more wealth than the other things no it's uh it's it's it hasn't at all uh basically for 20 years i put every penny back into tiger of revenue because i wanted to hire some of the best people in the world and the best teams and and get it right but there's a lot of inherent value in it there's no question because uh we have extraordinary members and the value of our franchise has to do with our members and the team we've put together uh was incredible but i i realized that in order to scale the business to fulfill its potential i needed more senior help and in order to attract that senior help i needed people who were interested in equity so having a private equity partner made it easier to to attract world-class talent who would uh own part of the equity you're kind of in an interesting position which is like you know or you work with a significant amount of wealthy people and you have like some interesting insights where what have you seen are kind of like the levels of wealth that someone where like they see changes in their life you know like so many things i could give you one number or another but it's really a state of mind you know you you have people who are retired and they get x dollars and then you have other people who are retired and they get 10x dollars and yet the one who's achieving or receiving the lower amount might be more evolved and emotionally balanced because of meditation or work they've done you know the most interesting thing is there's endless studies that show that up to um um that whether you ask people who earn seventy thousand seven hundred thousand or seven million dollars a year how much more do you have to earn to be happy and the number is something like 20 no matter where you are the average person just needs just a little more to be happy which tells you about the unfilled nature of human ambition i've read a bunch of stuff like that and if well the way that i remembered it and i could be wrong it was like 2x so it was like maybe it was for net worth so like if your net worth is a million you're like well i would feel a lot better if it were two but then they talked to people who was a hundred and most people would say like man if you have a hundred liquid like it's gonna be a little bit hard to screw up but even they were like yeah but if i had 200 i think i would finally feel more comfortable you know the fact is that wherever you are you have the illusion that if you had a little more it would make your life a little easier but sometimes if you have a little more it's a burden because now you have to manage it and when you say it's a burden what i mean is intellectually you have to work harder to make sense of it and in that sense it is a burden it's like a job it's just it's just in the nature of things that the grass always seems greener on the other side and and that's part of why i say a lot of this is just a mindset and there's another part which is really important as well you know it doesn't matter whether we're talking about 3 million or 30 million if you take somebody if you take two people who've worth three or 30 million and one had been worth 50 million and lost 20 and now there were 30 and another had been worth 20 million and made 10 and is now worth 30. those two people are worth 30 million you could use the example with 3 million as well but the person who got to 30 million by losing 20 feels absolutely devastated and the person who got to 30 million by making another 10 feels generally quite positive or proud of themselves it's the same 30 million so it's a lot of things that are specific to the individual that uh generates the psychology there was that one article that came out that's total nonsense it came out years ago it said like you don't get significantly happier after a certain amount and the amount they said was crazy it was seventy thousand dollars a year but of course this was like 15 years ago and i thought that was crazy i'm like i don't think that's true but all right and i was like i do think there is like a number where it's like all right maybe like there's like a threshold here where you could definitely continue to get happy but like there's a baseline and um i always thought i'm like i think you will always want more money but today maybe like if you have if you're in like the 10 or 15 range liquid i'm like maybe there's like all right maybe life won't change significantly more after that because like you know like that's you could screw that up but like you got to kind of screw up majorly and but i don't know that's kind of what i always thought the 70 000 is a number that shows up in literature meaning um below 70 000 every increment that you get closer to it if you're earning 30 000 and you get to 50 50 to 60 anything up to 70 000 increments have dramatic increases because it's just kind of obvious it's basic needs you need to put a roof over your head you need to put square meals on the table you might need a car and it's 70 000 you can pretty much afford most of those things not in the lap of luxury but you can afford those things below it it's really really tough uh so that's kind of it might be 90 000 today with inflation but it's somewhere in then i don't mean to trivialize the difference between 70 and 90. but everything above that um you know for every level that you have you can just spend more and create the same sense of being overextended if you're not disciplined and it's the rare person who generates excess uh capital and doesn't change their lifestyle so no matter how much they have they keep spending more because if you can keep that gap of not needing what you have that gives you a cushion uh that's rare and really uh something remarkable for those who have it have you met people who have done that who have been let's say worth hundreds of millions of dollars but still live like uh don't even live nearly like that well you know the most classic example would be uh warren buffett who still lives in a 30 or 50 or 100 000 home that he bought in the midwest where he lives in omaha and you know it's really hard to have one person comment on another person's health you wonder what's all that money for but now he's given half of it or something to charity and there's tremendous benefit uh gained from the money he's given to charity but you know it's one thing to live within your means that's responsible it's another thing to be so disconnected between your wealth and what you're living that there's something going on inside and you know i'll leave it to the shrinks to figure it out but it's kind of hard to understand why a person who might be working 60 70 80 hours a week as if uh there's no tomorrow and then they might be worth a certain amount of money but they're living on 100th of it as if they had a hundredth less you know they had one percent of the wealth that they do what are they hiding from there's lots of answers they're all dependent on different people most of the people i hang out with so i'm 32 years old i started an internet company my co-host sean is a little older a year or two older than me also started an internet company and the majority of our friends are in like the late 20s early 40s age and like all mostly except for a few in the internet and so like i run in this like very like internet young circle and the vibe that i get from tiger is that it's a little bit older and more like traditional businesses or maybe finance or real estate who have kind of knocked it out the park um is is is tiger 21 mostly am i am i categorizing it correctly or do you guys actually have like a lot of you know only because of only because of how we've grown and when you have uh you know 1150 or 60 members um the answer is the average age has uh fallen over the history from the high 50s to the low 50s but in order for it to do that given that a lot of people stayed most of our new members are in their 30s and 40s so we have a lot of internet folks but the reason they're joining tiger as opposed to something else is when they're sitting around they're not just sitting with internet folks they're sitting with people who have you know real real estate experience and experience running businesses uh you know in the uh in the in the world that isn't just from the internet and the reason we're so excited to have uh folks that are in the crypto space or the internet space is precisely because they're understanding these new technologies that are going to transform the world in a way that many of our members wouldn't otherwise so it's this combination that makes uh some of our meetings so electric have you noticed the difference between like let's just say group a is like these people who are made their money on the internet made their money in only like three or eight years uh all selling just internet stuff so you know like not real stuff that you can touch versus let's say like the small business owner who like scaled something over 20 or 30 years and then eventually sold it or made cash flow along the way versus the tech person who was probably poor for a long time and then suddenly boom they're not have because they sold their business and they weren't ever profitable but have you noticed a difference in those people's attitude or the problems they have well they're probably you know as many differences as there are people but there's some fundamental truths that i think you're pointing at you know um when i went to business school at uh mit 40 some years ago you know if you were doing a marketing exercise they'd say come up with a product that you could sell to a thousand people and today if you go to stamford to a marketing course they say come up with a service you could sell to a billion people literally a billion people that's what facebook does and some of the other major social media so scaling is not just a difference in size we have a dramatically more frictionless economy the nature of internet and technology allows businesses to scale that's why we have unicorns today but we almost never did in the past so when you think about life expectations people who started out 30 or 40 years ago had an expectation that they'd be they'd have to put their nose to the grindstone for 30 years before they'd hit a payday uh not all of them but some of them and of course there are many different types of wealth i distinguish between people who are workers versus people who have some kind of god-given talent a singer a basketball player an actor a rapper these are people not who are building businesses but have god-given talents that of course they have to work hard to hone those talents but it's very different when your wealth is created from your own talent than when you have to scrimp and save you know to make a payroll and and get everything done but then if you compare that to people who are creating wealth today first of all they can do it in three to five years you have unicorns in you know three to five years or uh not much longer and so one of the big differences is that if you were 58 20 years ago and you sold your business you probably were retiring because you spent 30 years doing something and that was your first sale but today if you sell you might be 30 or 35 or 38 you're not retiring you're going on to the next thing so the i think the biggest difference is this kind of expectation of what a life looks like you know a generation ago a really successful entrepreneur had one or maybe two serial successes today a successful entrepreneur could have three four or five or multiples because he or she has figured out how to manage a couple at the same time elon musk is not the only person who has multiple businesses he's certainly the most visible but it's much more creature of today it happened in the past but just much less so when i was selling my business i would talk to some bankers and i would talk to some friends and advisors and a nice amount were like yeah sell it and get paid and like you know you don't have to worry about money anymore and that's wonderful and then the other group of people that were like uh man starting something that works is really really really hard and a lot of people sell a business and want to start it again and they don't realize like you know like there's some luck involved and it's just actually really really challenging and sometimes you get confident you think oh i can just do it again and so if you don't have to sell it never sell it and i've lately fallen in the category of like if you don't have a lot of money sell a company if you if that means that you're like financially secure but then after that oftentimes try not to sell anything ever like to see if you can just like run it or get it to run it on its own or hire people because it's quite hard to get getting something going it's such a pain in the butt do you fall do you tend to uh when you're talking to your members do you what do you think most like which of those categories do you think is actually a little bit more true or more common and uh i think you're on to something really important and it's kind of like all of the above one of the biggest learnings is that most people who sell their first business have no idea that it feels like having the rug pulled out from underneath you because you see a big dollar amount and and you're so focused on the sale that it's the everything else that's kind of the shock and uh the most important one is the momentum or the platform that you don't even realize how valuable it is so you know one of the things we really talk about is before you sell you really have to think about not just the pros but the cons and and particularly in an environment like today forget that the markets are down this year in a low interest rate environment when you sell you know a typical industrial building obviously uh you're talking about um other other types of metrics but it used to be a typical meat and potatoes business would sell for seven or eight times earnings and you know if you take a business that was making i'll use an example three million dollars and you sold it for 20 million dollars and you paid the taxes now you have 16 million but if you buy bonds at 2 percent you're now making 320 000 on that same capital that was generating 3 million dollars before you've lost 90 percent of your earning power and we call that sticker shock and 90 i would say the vast majority of people who sell their first business go through sticker shock because they haven't really thought through that the passive earnings on the profits of the sale will generate dramatically less income than the business itself did now of course the positive is that when you get when you sell that business you don't have all the risks of that business and maybe the business had risks that could put it out of business so a good sale allows you to take chips off the table and that has a lot of benefits but i think you're really you know you're on to the central issue around selling businesses because particularly if you hold on to the business you don't have a tax liability i'm not against taxes in general i'm just saying that it eats into some of the value whereas if you continue to own the business the full value is working to make the business larger and larger so when you're thinking about risk um i think the greatest service that we do is help some of our members think about the things they hadn't thought about when they're thinking about selling like what well just what we're talking about this sticker shock this this sense of do you really want to lose the platform uh that you have and will you have enough capital because we've had many examples of people who think when they sell the business it's going to be easy street but when they don't realize the loss of income that occurs when you're taking dollars from a sale and putting it into passive assets or worse in order to generate income like they had before they take risks they don't understand in investments because investing can be a lot harder you know when you own a business it's kind of like being on a dog track a dog track you have a fence to your left and a fence to your right somebody shoots a gun behind you and you can only go forward you know if you're a paper clip manufacturer or you sell rocks or frankly even an internet service you have one direction you want to be the master of whatever your business is and that's really hard but intellectually when you're an investor how can any one person understand all the markets and if you're starting out with no fundamental understanding of the markets because you've just been running a business one of the real shocks is most people think the hard part is making the money and then once you have the money you're on easy street but from an intellectual challenge point of view many of our members find the challenge of managing the wealth that they've created is actually intellectually more challenging than the business because the business might have come naturally to them they might have had an idea and they just pursued it to its uh good ends when i sold i mean i didn't know it this was only a year a year and a half ago or a year and a couple months ago i didn't know anything like i i mean i knew nothing like i didn't know like when people said that they're going to short a stock i was like i don't know what shorting means and they say they're gonna go log i'm like don't know what that means and so uh like it was and people like you know friends and family were like well what are you gonna do with your money and i'm like i don't i don't know anything like i i i think people are surprised that your ability to earn is not often correlated with your ability to like invest uh just the opposite that's that's what i'm trying to say you can be a great entrepreneur and a really lousy investor and you know just to give an expectation for uh people who might be listening how long do you think it takes to go from being a successful entrepreneur that is a mediocre investor where you were a year ago how long do you think it takes till you have sort of a modicum of confidence that you know what you're doing as an investor i mean years i don't know i mean i've been studying it now for a year and a half and i feel like i don't know much five years five years yeah that's and that's if you're really working at it what i just did was put so i are you familiar with hubspot sure so they're the ones who bought it so i own hubspot stock and then the rest was just mostly a vanguard total index fund and some real estate and real estate funds what uh with your folks what do you what's like the asset allocation of like uh uh what you've seen what's like a fairly successful sure so yeah i want to be really we're not an investment advisor but i do track the asset allocation of our members and can simply report on it which is yeah you guys put out this annual report that's awesome i love that so the the asset allocation very roughly is uh traditionally real estate has been king with about twenty eight percent of the assets maybe twenty seven uh is that a good uh primary residence no generally not um it's it's mostly investment real estate and does that mean they own it or they're in a ring it could be they're in a reit more likely they either own a building or they own a limited partnership in a real estate fund of some sort second would be public equity um about 26 20 anywhere between 24 and 26 that's so much lower than i thought exactly and private equity and this is unique to the tiger community uh our private equity has for the last couple years been more than public equity it's now a little neck and neck but private equity is around 21 to 24 and what's so remarkable is if you take those three numbers the private equity public equity and real estate it adds up to 70 plus percent those are the risk on assets so our members are relatively long-term bullish on investments even when they think we're going into a recession they still are over 70 percent invested in when i say risk on assets that's what the you know the investors say are assets that are risky and have to do with business-like qualities then a fixed income until you know now is at a historic low point about seven seven percent it was as high as 12 or 14 in prior years uh and crypto and gold creeping up one or two percent assets each and cash at uh 12 our members cash has stayed relatively fixed over a long period of time the biggest it typically fluctuates between 11 and 13 but in the um pandemic march of uh 2020 it spiked to 20 which statistically is off the charts that's how concerned our members are but generally in the 12 ranges is uh what our members are looking at in cash what do they love about real estate so much i mean and uh it's the gift it's the gift that keeps on giving and first of all they're terrific tax attributes of real estate because of depreciation but you know when most people think of an investment asset and they buy a company that company is subject to competitive forces every single day it's why most operating businesses don't lend themselves to multi-generational families of course there are exceptions and some very important ones but real estate is a much more tolerant asset for multi-generation or or if you own certain uh natural resources you know if you own uh timberlands those are good to pass from generation to generation because when you own a great piece of real estate you know the joke is your child can be let's say less than brilliant and still know how to collect the rent and even in your own lifestyle if you own a great piece of real estate the tenants have to pay the rent even when you're playing golf but when you're running a complicated technology company or something else you got to be out there and working every day your team has to be really really good and i'm not in any way suggesting real estate it takes a different kind of unique smarts it's not an easy game but it's very different one way to think about it is if you took the whole economy i don't know if you remember the dewey decimal system of libraries but if you broke the economy into all of its sectors and one of those sectors was real estate and nine other sectors medical and education everything else high spec high tech aerospace etc if you took those nine other categories real estate is more different than those other nine than any of the other nine are to each other because of this durability this multi-generational capacity of real estate we always make a joke that people they get offended about this but i'm like it's kind of a compliment we always say that real estate has the highest number of dumb rich people uh and that was kind of like a fox in other words they may not people who have the same intellectual pursuits that you are right but they can go and smell an opportunity and sniff out where there's a problem in a way that most other business owners don't and that's why i say it's very deceptive because they're a breed apart but that's become a little less so in the last generation because as real estate became more securitized with different types of ownership and debt that went to wall street it became more of a wall street game so it's a little more today a wall street game than it was 20 years ago yeah and the the the kind of the strategy that my wife and i had was let's just try to get somewhat wealthy with tech stuff and have that continue to make cash flow and and you know selling companies and pile a lot of it into real estate because that's something because like with my business we had to send an email every day but if gmail changed like it could go out of business a building that i own i could lose a fair amount of money on it but like there's it's still a thing that someone will purchase even if it's at a huge loss but it's not gonna go to zero whereas my company it definitely could like if i owned a conference business and a pandemic hit like which i did uh like it went it literally made zero dollars whereas this land that i own that i'm looking at right now like that's probably not gonna go to zero you know none of these things are as simple as we'd like i think you're making some really excellent points but if you owned retail or movie theaters uh or airports in the pandemic that went to zero too if you had any leverage on it so it's not that realistic being hyperbolic but like you know i understand yeah i totally get it it's not that it's without risk but as an asset category it's a long dated asset i can't find this client info have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out-of-sync spreadsheets are dueling databases hubspot grow better [Music] uh one more thing about the selling and uh selling versus not selling because you have a way bigger sample size a do you regret selling your companies and b the thing about selling like let's say that you sell a business and you make 30 million you pay taxes now you're left with 20. to make 20 million like you could build a business for 5 or 10 years sell it and make that to make 20 million after to make 20 million from cash flow annual cash and that's really freaking hard like you gotta i mean your taxes are higher because it's income versus capital gains but and you i mean it's just like it just seems like selling a business is probably the e the easier of the two and it's still not easier it's still not easy it's the easier the tomb to to accumulate like your first bit would you agree with that or no well it it's it's the problem is that it's better to think of it as a shift in risk because when you made the decision to um sell for 30 million the example you just gave what you've done is you've taken a lot of risk on the table so the chance of losing that 30 million now goes down radically it's much less once you've turned it into cash but the chance of getting to 60 million might have gone down also because you lost the engine of growth so it's you know do you want to sleep well or do you want to eat well are you long-term greedy or short-term greedy but there's no question that when you sell your business in my opinion more often than not it's it's not number dependent it's risk dependent you want to take risk off the table you don't want to you don't want to have the risk just as you said of losing your business anymore so you can take your chips off the table and diversify it over a number of investments but it's going to be much harder if the business was a well-functioning growing business to get to that you've you've increased the hurdle rate before you can get to that next level of 60 or 80 or 100 million dollars do you regret selling your two things um and tiger um or so you didn't sell it first of all i'm still the chairman and majority owner of tiger but it's run as if i'm 50 50 partners and tiger would be a great example um i'm 66 and the when i sold tiger the risk that i was most concerned about because i'm a cancer survivor is longevity and sustainability if something happened to me so our board said i was the number one risk and because i love this business i said well how do i how do i do how do i reduce that risk well the first thing is i bring in a co-owner and the second is we bring in a world-class ceo and in order to bring in that world-class ceo i needed to bring in a co-owner so tiger is immeasurably stronger today from a team point of view and an ownership and a resilience point of view it is still my legacy i'm the founder it was my idea but i never went into it for money and i'm not sure that i would have done any better on my own i think i think the the diversity of ownership and uh the addition of a team that we built into a world-class team is just dramatically different than i could have created on my own so i have no regrets whatsoever uh with tiger and um with the other businesses it was interesting i sold my first project that i mentioned to you when i was 30. um and what did you can you say what you sold it source so we have contacts i mean it was uh it was a project that i was a partner in but the project got sold for over 100 million dollars and the and that was in 1987. that was pretty life-changing i'd imagine uh totally life-changing um but the point is that um what i remember is not so much the dollar amount what i remember is it was heralded as the most successful real estate project in metropolitan history in terms of financial return and um so uh but but it took me a couple years to kind of find myself again because i went from being one of the top hundred developers in the country i also had the advantage i had a partner the project was my idea but selling was his idea and he never would have got into that project if he hadn't been my partner and i never would have sold it if i hadn't been his partner and we sold at the end at that point a hundred percent 99 of what we were worth was tied up in that project and if somebody had got hurt or killed in construction you know it could have it could have wiped us out and so we sold and we closed in january of 87 and in october 87 the market crashed and real estate followed after that and we had been one of the top 100 developers and we might have been one of five developers in the whole country that had lots of capital and no buildings to weigh us down with the problems from the market crash so that gave us an extraordinary opportunity to get back in at the bottom and i did that by creating a company that bought distressed real estate from banks and went on to buy close to a billion dollars of what became a billion dollars of assets wow when when people one of the surprising things when i kind of started when when i sold was i had never heard of this thing called an asset-backed loan which is like basically one example of that is when rich people buy a home you'll hear that they bought like a five or ten million dollar home in cash and oftentimes what that really means is they're using this thing called an asset backed loan so basically if you have a stock portfolio of 10 million dollars and it's like in a vanguard index fund or some basic thing like that you can borrow like 60 or 75 percent of that at a given a very very low interest rate as low as one percent um what was uh what were some some what are some surprising things that people who come into money after selling their company that they that they see and you're like like when i when my banker told me about that i was like are you kidding me this is like this is how people do it this is amazing what are some other things that kind of fit in that category so i'm sorry but i would never do that most tiger members yeah most tiger members wouldn't for two reasons one uh i don't have any debt i wouldn't want any debt it debt can be very corrosive at exactly the wrong time you know the market has just gone down for people who are levered they could have been wiped out if you want to be here for the long term and preserve wealth i would argue you want as little debt as possible i'm not suggesting that's a good idea no no no no no i don't understand it's an interesting option that people have like needs to pay taxes sure but the other the other part of it is that one percent can be illusory because the rate can go up if it's a floating rate and if you have a spike in interest rates and you made assumptions that you were borrowing at that low interest rate and then it goes up you can really wreak havoc with your balance sheet so i uh one of the things that most tiger members enjoy when they reach a level of wealth is the ability not to have debt hanging over them now having said that who are the best managers of debt well private equity firms and real estate is the place where most debt is so people who've spent a career managing debt understand the power of it but they just understand that at some point you want to reduce risk and take chips off the table i think the other thing is something you said before not everybody fully appreciates why they became successful because for every person who had a plan somebody else was lucky let's say doesn't mean that they didn't have a plan but fundamentally they're lucky and it's just a statistical thing the the number of people who've had two successes is dramatically smaller than the number of people it's a bell curve of who's had one success and for people to have three and four successes gets down into the you know one in a thousand entrepreneurs or something and i think that um many people systematically overestimate their own skills when they've been successful and there's a real comeuppance that after they sell their first successful business they assume they'll be successful in the next one and they get their clock handed to them as i did when i was 30. it was a very painful lesson but it was the most valuable lesson well i uh sold this amazing project uh when i was 30 and then i started a business in the real estate information this is before the internet you know pretty much what zillow is today where you can look up any house and get a price on it we created a business that was a precursor to zillow before there was an internet it was so much of your net worth from the previous thing did you invest into this new thing oh i probably risked somewhere between 20 on the order at 25 something like that and so one of the biggest one of the biggest um uh learnings is when you sell a business you know many people think they're great investors because when they own a business if they make an investment they have to talk about it at a cocktail party and if they lose in money on an investment it gets swept under the carpet because the business itself is profitable so it covers up those losses so many people who've been successful entrepreneurs don't realize how poorly they are as investors because they've never been battle tested without the benefit of the company providing you know the fill if you make a mistake so i think i think the one of the biggest mistakes that people who sell business make and it's what you said before is that they're uh that they assume they can do it again and again and only a portion of people who've been successful once are going to be successful twice we're talking about earning money what about spending money uh like something that i ask myself is i'm quite frugal and i say like i don't want to buy this this and this because it costs too much money and i just don't it just it and some stuff like owning um you know a lot of like objects in my home it kind of just stresses me out because i feel like i got to take care of it but then there's other things like flying nicely or staying at fancy hotels where i was like i don't want to spend money on that and then i was like well you know what that actually makes me happier like this is fun for me i should spend because that i feel like you know about the marshmallow test yeah about uh um delayed gratification yeah delayed gratification so should i tell it for your life it's a very famous uh very famous test that was done at stamford uh in the i think 50s or early 60s and you know they put a table of 12 three-year-olds or four-year-olds out and they put one marshmallow in front of each of the kids and they said look i'm going to step out of the room if you don't touch the marshmallow while i'm gone when i come back i'm going to give you another marshmallow and only one or two of the kids could wait for the person 20 minutes to come back they just had to eat the marshmallow in front of them those one or two could handle delayed gratification and it turns out that they tracked many kids who went through this and the very few who could delay gratification were more successful in school more successful in life and more successful in business by various measures over the next 30 to 50 years of their life it's a remarkable study and it has to do with what i was saying before when you're an entrepreneur as apparently you were you had to delay gratification because you were putting money into your business you couldn't you couldn't do all the things others who were making a lot less but didn't have a business we're doing and delayed gratification the discipline of delayed gratification is at the core of uh entrepreneurial success but frankly when you're a movie star or a rock star or a baseball pitcher or a basketball player delayed gratification isn't so much at the core of your success because you don't need to scrimp and save you need to practice and be well so when people sell you know there's a syndrome where somebody's been very successful but they've been delaying gratification so long that they only open up one step at a time they still are driving a chevy they still are wearing a certain kind of suit they're wearing a timex watch but they go on a great vacation or they go on a mediocre vacation but they're wearing a really expensive watch you find when people have sold their business they open up slowly because they want to they want to be smart and they don't want to waste and they have to find that new balance but you know we have a rule at tiger which i think is the most important rule it's called the two percent rule if you've been lucky enough to sell a business one gauge you can think about is if you're solely uh living on the investments in your portfolio if you can live on two percent of your assets or less then you're in a safety zone and obviously some people have the good fortune to earn a lot more than two or three or four percent on their assets so they can live on a little more but once you start living on more than two percent you're actually starting to stress the ability to preserve capital and my guess is if you if you went to a whole bunch of 25 year old kids and said you know if you inherited a million dollars how much could you spend a year and preserve the money you'd be shocked a lot of kids would say i don't know a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand a year it's twenty thousand a year and uh that learning is really fabulous uh there's this um funny cool subreddit subreddit a reddit a forum that i go to and it's called fat fire you know you know what fire is like fires like financially independent retired early fat typically fires like people who want to save like a million dollars and live off like 50 000 a year fat fires people who want to like earn a huge you know a much larger amount and live somewhat lavishly and on that subreddit the number is like three percent so it's a little bit higher than two percent but like three percent i think there was this thing called the trinity study and they said like four percent frankly i think that sometimes is too high but like i i i kind of buy in the three percent range and uh anyway there's this one book have you ever heard this guy named felix dennis no i don't think so he's amazing he's kind of he's dead now but he's kind of like a combination of mick jagger and richard branson so he was this he was this british entrepreneur and he was kind of flamboyant like richard branson and like did a bunch of stuff but he was like mick jagger and that he was like kind of a degenerate like he loved drugs and hookers and he was like he wrote about like his escapades when he got older he was like i had a drug problem and i was never married so i was just like sleeping around and so he's kind of like a fun guy to read about but he's got this book called uh how to get rich it's kind of poorly titled in a way that it's like embarrassing to talk about but it's quite a good book and he was like he he eventually founded um micro warehouse which was a publicly traded company but he also started maxim magazine he was a publisher so he made all of his money in magazines and he was like so i'm going to die soon because i've got cancer and i'll die with like a 600 million net worth but if i could do it all over again my goal would have been to make 20 or 30 million dollars by the age of 35 and not focus on money making ever again and only focus on uh like the people i cared about but like a boxer who's punk uh punch drunk i went back into the ring every time because i was addicted to it even though it it didn't always bring me the most amount of fulfillment and happiness i just want to share three reactions to that the first is there was a band leader from the late 60s or early 70s who was being interviewed a few years ago and the announcer said you know you were the first band to make a million dollars a month no band had ever made that much money what'd you do with all that money you guys must be rich he said well we spent about 70 percent on wine women and drugs and wasted all the rest but the thing is the uh the thing with mick jagger is what you don't see is he like works out six hours a day he uh he he eats a food regimen that's like second to none and here's a guy who's maybe keith was a better example yeah well that's important because even with richard branson with with his whatever your persona is you know he knows how to lever uh from a marketing point of view he puts like nothing into a business and others invest around his name so his risk is very low these are these are people who are real geniuses at what they do but the thing that the thing that you didn't mention is philanthropy like how does people create meaning i i think that people who've created a certain amount of wealth and then say a higher percentage of what i'm going to make i'm going to give back to causes that i believe in and try and make the world a better place i think that's a really important way to get meaning so that guy who made 600 and said i should have just made 30 maybe he should have just been a little more philanthropic and and looked around the world and said i can make an impact in a positive way have you heard of this book called you got a ton of books behind you so maybe you have it looks like you read a lot there's this book called um dying with zero it's by this hedge fund guy named bill perkins and i've just started reading it but it sounds like the premise of the book is basically like uh spend like if you're going to give instead of giving away money when you're dead like give your kids the money now so if they want to buy a home or do something like maybe you can enjoy it together if you want to leave money to a certain cause just give it now because you'll be able to see you'll be able to see it and you can all get a little more joy out of that sure that was the biggest debate you know for many years warren buffett said i'm leaving a big foundation when i die and he said because i'm growing my capital so quickly that by leaving it in my portfolio i'll leave so much more and bill gates made the argument with him yes but what's the value of a life saved today versus a life only saved 30 years from now when you die and some things aren't financial calculations so the point that you're making is there's a lot of value to being philanthropic both with your time and your money earlier on and not just uh later on and i think one of the things that is really important is many entrepreneurs have a lot more than money they have skills and insights and contacts that they can lever philanthropically so i do believe uh in being as active as possible uh to make climate is my number one issue and so i'm involved in climate both politically philanthropically and in the way i invest and that's given me a lot of feeling at least of i'm doing as much as i can well last two questions first um the interesting thing about this your business tiger 21 is from an outside it seems like the it seems like the vast majority of the value is your like eight or ten person or 15 person your group which means i would think that there's a lot of pressure or not pressure but there's a lot of faith that the facilitator like you need that facilitator to be good and if your facilitator stinks and that could potentially ruin the experience so which almost is like your business is almost decentralized or like it you know customers will have drastically different experiences potentially regardless of what's happening at hq how are you how do you make sure your facilitators are good and are providing a valuable experience so i think what you're searching for is kind of a classic example of would you rather own 300 gas stations or one oil refinery if they're both worth the same amount of money well the answer is obvious on that one i think which is what multiple i mean it's like you don't want you don't want you don't want uh all your you don't want one big ass customer you would be nice to have a hundred more that are equal but the fact is if you have 300 gas stations that have all the same label on them the same name you have a brand exposure that if something bad happens in one of them it could affect uh people's demand for the other so our only asset is our people both our team our chairs that facilitate the groups and our members and we spend we have like a private university we spend fortunes of time screening the facilitators and then providing lots of opportunities for the facilitators to learn from one another our facilitators come in from all we call them chairs of the groups they come in from all over the world to learn best practices from each other and we track all of the relevant metrics to see which groups are performing well which groups are not performing well and of course the most important thing is that we have zero tolerance for uh anything less than high integrity and maintenance of confidence if somebody if a member or a chair ever violated that they would be out in a second so i'd say that maybe uh besides the core asset uh being our team and our members the thing we protect the most is our brand by being really true to what what it stands for and i don't think we've ever compromised on trying to put members first that's that's kind of what we're about i'm a member first all most of the value that i've gotten out of being a member of tiger has been being a member uh the fact that i've owned today a little more than half the business is almost irrelevant to the value that i've gotten by being a member and all the opportunities that i share with all the other members that come my way as a member well you're awesome the reason i wanted to talk to you was because i've uh i know of tiger i've thought about joining i've got friends that are part of it and i love the business model my business was was tangentially related but not quite the same thing it was community based and i hadn't read or seen too many interviews with you and so i'm happy that we got to talk because uh i wanted to kind of explore this but you're you're you're uh you're cool as hell i appreciate you taking the time this is awesome thanks so much for having me and if you if people wanna do you use twitter or anything if people wanna find you do you wanna point them anywhere um i'm on linkedin i don't use twitter i don't i i i don't use facebook um but i'm available through linkedin and uh it's kind of easy it's michael.sonnenfield.tiger21.com hell yeah thank you man i appreciate it thank you [Music] you

[Music] so martin shkreli if you just google most hated man in america i think he comes up as number one uh at least he did at the time when i first heard about him he is known for or he's known and hated for uh being a kind of a price gouger with a drug so what he did was he owned a pharmaceutical company that focused on like small like less popular drugs that were like niche and he would and he bought them so he bought this bug this drug called daraprim and he increased the price from like 13 to like 500 something dollars i don't know what it was but the percent was like he increased it by 5 thousand percent and so people and then immediately the news picked this up was like oh man and they started calling him the pharma bro because first he did this they were like how dare you but instead of apologizing and walking it back he was like [ __ ] yeah i did i own this i could charge what i want you know like and and like this is america that's the price of this drug and uh yeah i double down he doubled down and he loves attention and he's amazing at getting attention a lot of the attention is hate but he's amazing at getting it and he was only 33 34 when he did this and this was basically he controlled two pharmaceutical companies that were each public at north of a billion in market cap i think i don't know i don't know i can't i can't confirm those that might that might be right but he also had a hedge fund before that where he invested in biotech stocks yeah just like he had done big things and he was he's a very smart guy uh now people think he's a crook so some people said he was a crook because he raised the price of the drug that's not a crime that's just something you don't like then he actually got indicted and went to jail for doing something that was uh legal which i think was like he basically paid investors from one company with like the stock of his other company and then like didn't wasn't clear or something like that i don't know exactly what he went to jail for because there's anywhere for two minutes back he went back to jail or his like like he didn't get released early or something like that for threatening hillary clinton he didn't really threaten her but he like made like like a stupid joke on twitter yeah uh yeah anyway so he he just got out last week that's kind of the funny part of this so he gets out and uh it's like you know i don't know who's like a famous person like everybody wanted to be freed it's like a free young thug or whoever like martha stewart yeah free martha like whatever there was a group of people that were excited about his his arrival i was excited too because i enjoy reality tv i enjoy you know the drama he's like our version of kim he's he's our exactly so i wanted to see a plow and so he comes back and i just started thinking about shkreli in general so i have a couple ways we can go we can go of things i find very interesting slash borderline admire about the way he does things and then there's what he has been up to in prison and what's interesting there where do you want to go i have both i like both of those so what has he been up up to in prison and the backstory you you actually need to mention this the back story was he was an early user of your product blab and i spoke to him a couple times on blab and when the hustle first launched we were in our first office so this was in the first six months we um one of our reporters was this young woman named brina who was you know like a pretty uh like a good-looking woman and he she dm'd him for a story and he was like hey do you just want to like fly up here and we could like hang out and like he was like asking her out and uh so i had i have a little interaction with them as well so we yeah we had a app called blab that was basically if you've seen clubhouse it was clubhouse before clubhouse and it had video on it um so it wasn't just audio and uh it got sort of popular except you know we tried using it we tried getting podcasters to use it we we got some kind of like marketers to use it for their kind of like promoting their stuff when we started getting some bigger brands the nba started using it ufc started using it oracle but none of them could hold a candle to our number one power user martin shkreli martin shkreli came on the app and basically broke the app from day one first time he came on instantly the room filled up to like 5 000 people and it was more people that we had ever had in one room before that hit our max limit we were like who is this guy that's when i first googled and found he's the most hated man in america and um he was famous enough to draw a ton of people in but he was not famous enough to have other [ __ ] to do which was the perfect sweet spot which as i said he is the most lethal weapon in social media uh he has since been surpassed by donald trump and elon musk as the most lethal weapon in social media but before that it was martin shkreli and the reason i say that is because um he creates a ton of content so he would go on blab every day from about 5 p.m till 2 in the morning he would be on that whole time um and he was the master at creating nightly entertainment like you know jimmy fallon jay leno you guys can't touch this guy in terms of nightly entertainment because he has no producers no script no nothing he would hop on and somehow or another he would cause enough ruckus that this room would have thousands of people in it all night long watching it like we were hooked to it and we would see this in our data like people wanted us to kick him off because again he's a bad guy for raising the price of this drug and like he said this thing that wasn't cool but this guy was driving in hundreds of thousands of new users to us every single month and so i was like i'm not trying to kick this guy off like this guy's like you know he's where the action's at um this was uh 2017 2018 castle culture wasn't a thing yet yeah and i was like dude i'm a startup i'm gonna do what it takes to get off the ground like yeah bitcoin used the silk road to like get off the ground and like you know youtube started as a dating site and facebook you know before this he did face mash comparing like which girl's hotter like okay not everything starts with like the most like clean cut you know i think airbnb started by like faking and scraping you know craigslist sites and you know emailing them as fake people saying i'd love to book your thing can you just list on airbnb like dude people do what they have to do to get your project started started and so we had shirley and i used to watch at first what i noticed was everybody who came in came in to throw stones at this evil man who raised the price of this drug but he did not sit there and apologize or whimper he like fought back and he would give his side of the argument he would invite you up for a debate and that's when you saw how how strongly held opinions could be with no logical backing with no real rationale behind it the argument was so hollow and this was not just like average people people who were like very successful business people come on trying to like kind of um stand on their head you know be on their high horse uh you know telling him what he should do and then he would like dismantle their argument journalists from cnn and other places would come on he would dismantle them um and he's doing a combination of like a making fun of them b hitting on them and c breaking down their logical arguments all at the same time i've never seen anything like it and i just thought wow this guy is very entertaining i don't agree with everything he's saying but i think he's very entertaining and the data doesn't lie he is very entertaining he's and i think later on later on in some of the blabs he would have like these like cute women in the background and they like clearly i just met him on blab and he was just like hey i'll fly you out you want to hang out this is what started happening everybody started off hating him so after about three weeks he developed an army of believers of people who were there's a guy who became creeps yeah the creeps and so this guy he came on his name was young shkreli and he and when martin was tired or had to go eat young shkreli would go hold court and he would just be like an extreme knockoff version of martin and he would just hold court defending him until martin came back to defend himself and then all these women started joining and they loved him and they would just hang out there all the time and they were like when they were not like cam girls or model they were like actual models fashion models cam girls only fans people whoever and they would get on and they would just be like you know martin just like i don't know i would date you and they would just get out and they were so the room was always filled with like his posse it was like you go to like you know where uh a mob lord is that and he's got his goons and he had his goons dude and his army was just growing by within a couple months the number of people who loved him outweighed the number of people who hated him and it was like the most surprising thing it was like watching a cult form in real time it was fascinating and um i remember the cnn journalist came on and she was like martin i you know i know everybody kind of you know attacks you but i don't want to attack you i just want to ask you some questions he's like well you're on my show let's go she's like no no i want you to come on cnn he's like this is better than cnn he's like you're on my show you have questions let's go this these are my terms you can ask any question you want no holds barred right here right now and if you're not prepared come back and prepare but you could do it right here on my show and she's like i'm not going to do that martin i can only do it there he's like and he's like he's like all right fine come with me to my fundraiser gala tonight i'll fly you out he bought he goes he screen shares he buys her a plane ticket and like he's like what's your email address i'm sending this to you and she's like i'm not going on a date with you martin and he's like who said it to date uh and he's like you know he's just playing people perfectly insane didn't they didn't she end up quitting one of the one of the women who hollered at him from washington post ended up quitting the job and so this is part of what's remarkable when he goes to jail this woman from washbow or someplace is assigned to cover him and or cover the story falls in love with him breaks up like she has a family she has a husband kids i think leaves them for martin falls in love with martin while he's in prison and then martin breaks her heart and she's heartbroken now and like you know whatever she gave it all up she gave up her career and her family for martin and fell in love with him this guy's got some cult leader [ __ ] to him so anyways he did some crazy stuff when he was on blab like he would he was so loyal to his army that he'd be like i'm i got a date tonight but don't worry i'm leaving blab on so he would leave it on in the other room and you could eavesdrop and overhear his date which is again oh my god prime time entertainment is it wrong yeah is it entertaining yeah it is and so this guy was phenomenal anyway so i found this guy interesting he would also do things so like from a marketing perspective i was observing how is this guy staying relevant like that drug [ __ ] was years ago like what how is he staying relevant he would just do stuff so like wu-tang clan had an album that they were selling like a one-of-one for their biggest fans he bought it for two million dollars so now this guy that they didn't want so they even got a feud with him he had this thing and then on blab he would play like snippets like 10 seconds of the album and no one's ever heard it before besides him but he would just like tease it dangle it um like the original nft when um there was like some building for sale in times square he tried to buy it for 10 million dollars to like erect a statue of himself in times square and again it gets covered so he was just newsjacking constantly he was just hijacking the news and putting did he have money when he got arrested or like because i i think he was actually like he they he showed a brokerage account that had like 70 million dollars in it yeah i think he had like somewhere between 50 and 75 million dollars if i remember at the time but then he like had to declare bankruptcy yeah and i think at one point ironically his attorney that was defending him raised his price by five thousand percent and started charging him sixty thousand dollars per hour and like i don't know if this is real or not but martin came out the news like this is outrageous and like people were like dude the irony you know pot calling the kettle black i was like of course this is just another article he wanted written about him and like he's just a master of getting attention he did so many things like this i can't even count the number of things he did like this i was like wow this guy just knows how to stay in the cycle and i constantly like reinvent himself because then he would like just when he pushes you away he'd lure you back in so like for example on saturday friday nights he would hold like you know his nightly blab thing where he's at thousands of people and it's like a roast session and he's saying outlandish [ __ ] and like you just feel yucky for being in there and then saturday morning he would wake up at eight in the morning and he would do a live finance like session where he would teach you how to analyze stocks and it was great phenomenal and i watched a bunch of them they're still on youtube you can go watch them he is so he's very smart and he was so thoughtful and patient as a teacher he's a he's a fantastic teacher and so anyway so that's like the backstory so anyways he gets out and he said they're like how was prison right he immediately he gets out he immediately jumps on um on twitter spaces oh by the way actually that's another funny story when he had to go speak in front of congress or i don't know yeah congress i guess he had to go testify um he goes there and he just with a smug look kept saying like i i will take the fifth amendment you know i choose to elect my my fifth amendment well rights to not speak he just said that on loop for an hour but he was smiling he was smugly smiling and just pissing them off and he was drawing the whole time and then he gets as soon as he left the record he jumped on blab from his phone on the train and he goes all right who wants to see my drawings he shows his drawings of like dicks and stuff like that that he was drawing on his piece of paper and he's live the the hearing was still going on and he embedded it in one screen and he was just talking mad [ __ ] about the congress people in the other screen at the same time again it was just like high level social media usage so anyways he got on twitter spaces and they were like how was prison he goes oh it was awesome he's like he's talking about the prison system and like how unjust it is and how you know he's like you know ninety-five percent of the people that were in there um you know had like traumatic childhood issues with parents and stuff like that he's like i hustled out like other people's lockers you know where i so i could store more books and um and he's like he basically was like so what was his like summary stuff so first he's been blogging have you read his blog from prison no but what did he say about prison he was he i mean i bet you he was actually well respected there yeah he's like everyone's like tell me some stories yeah exactly um and so he yeah he was kind of like you know had his his crew there or whatever he said he created um a crypto study group um so he what did he say he goes um he goes when everybody else was working out in prison i would read because brain gains are all that matters not muscle gains because he's like oh my god he's like i created a group called crypto thugs in prison and it was just me teaching crypto to um to the rest of my like my fellow like inmates or whatever and he had a bunch of like interesting stuff so um he had a bunch of predictions about crypto that were in there a bunch of he read he basically spent his whole time studying about crypto and artificial intelligence um and like biohacking and stuff like that so he's got this blog post with a [ __ ] ton of predictions about the future um i'll i'll read you a couple of his i'm on his blog it's just it's martinskewelly.com right uh yeah i think so so um let me read you some predictions on here so 2025 so about three years from now uh self-driving cars are the successor to mobile computing they trend upwards people spend eight hours a day in your car um tesla near's 10 trillion market cap musk becomes the first trillionaire 2026 an ai generated maybe gpt4 song gets created with zero human editing and direct participation and charts on billboard uh 2013 or 2030. um virtual reality slash metaverse is ubiquitous widely used all you needed was a comfortable ergonomic optical interface that's what was the limiting item i think he's uh wrong on that one 2030 vehicles uh self-driving cars reached majority penetration in the u.s car accidents dropped by more than 50 percent and he said he just keeps going he goes out to like 2050 he's making predictions as to things like you know 2050. lifespan for a newborn is now 125. 90 of non-surgical medicine is automated um blah blah blah like most contract law is automated on is automated on chain and so he keeps going now right or wrong you could disagree with all these but he's just a very interesting thinker very interesting guy you follow right and he does these book reviews that are like very hilarious where he's like this book three out of five uh you know first three fourths giant waste of time last fourth interesting about this topic it's like oh good like you saved me much time reading that book like i kind of trust your opinion on these things um and so i don't know his blog is worth a read we uh i i tweeted out asked to get him on the pod but i had no twitter handle to tag i didn't know who he was or you know which it was kind of hidden we maybe found the right one um but we uh we should get them on i feel like we're big enough that we can get them [Music] you

so somebody had tweeted out something which was like hey if you needed a side hustle that was going to generate like 3k to 5k a month um and you could only kind of work like you know let's say like you know a couple hours and during the week and and you know half a day on the weekends or something like that what would you do to do that if you didn't know how to code [Music] are we good i'm a whole different guy sampar i'm you're looking at a man four days in to clean eating and guess what now i'm on time guess what now my kids love me guess what the stocks went up today for the first time in like five months so a lot of things are going well here what are you eating i'm just like i don't know if this is healthy or not but i'm very heavy meat and protein right now and just like nothing bad and not eating late not not doing bad stuff dude listen to this thing that i'm doing it's called um my body tutor have you heard of it i have heard of this is it like a text messaging thing somebody like it's way more primitive than that so basically i pay them either six or seven hundred dollars a month i don't remember if it's 5.99 or 6.99 and this woman named heather she's like my coach she just calls me every single morning and i have to tell her what i ate what i'm gonna eat today and then she tell and i write down on my fitness pal what i've eaten the day before and she'll say yesterday was bad or good here's why tell me what you're gonna eat today that's all it is it's a five minute phone call and it's it's amazing it's it's it's you should try this it's actually i should try this the fact that i don't want to try this tells me that i absolutely should try this so i think i might i think i might do it because uh yeah i don't know it's i've i'm uh i'll i'll tell you what i'll tell you what's i'll tell you what's embarrassing what's embarrassing was that a day and a half into just eating clean is just not not like you know oh my daughter's leftover macaroni and cheese all right let me just eat these three spoons before i put it in the sink or like oh there's a free cookie here at this thing let me just grab that um a day and a half in i felt a difference which tells me how poorly i had been eating if i could feel a difference just from a day and a half of of eating perfectly right uh what do you eat normally that's bad like are you talking about like process just clean meat just like no sugar not processed no sugar not processed um not like late night snacking or whatever like just cutting it off at a certain time um and then not like okay you know i've been like you know what what will happen to me sometimes is i'll be like oh i'm working i got calls i got the pod i got all this stuff going on i'm excited i look up it's 2 p.m i haven't eaten anything and i'm like all right the next edible item in sight is just getting like devoured right it's like a stress at that point yeah it's getting caught oh you thought this party size of doritos was for a party no it's getting got right now and so so you ever heard of uh you ever heard of someone doing a line of oreos it's when you when you get the oreo tray and it's got like three columns and you do a whole line you just take a whole column out in one sitting that's something that would happen before uh you know just on an inconsistent basis i like to do oreo cereal you just get a gallon of milk and a sleeve of oreos and just just go to town so i'm going with you man i like all that stuff too but you just can't do it yeah i can't do it um all right so we got a bunch of stuff let's do uh let's do some of these topics i don't know where you want to start oh actually i just see my topics i don't see yours do you have any i had a few we went through a lot of them the other day but well well one thing that is quick the classic we went through a lot of them the other day the classic no i'm usually really prepared but did you see that oh conan o'brien's thing got acquired team coco yeah you texted this so what is it so he has a podcast network or is just his one podcast it's a podcast network but i think he's the heavy hitter and it's a 160 million or something you said right like a pretty 150 to 200 i forget the number but they have 16 million downloads a month we have two mfm sizes [Laughter] we have two or three million a month so what does that put us worth and ours is a business like it's the people listening you guys are richer than like conan o'brien's audience yeah and we're way better looking and way more funny so you know if you just take his multiple and you say all right divide by eight we don't do public math so that's unfortunately just the problem we're not gonna know how much worth because we go into public math and moving on to the next topic i think that's 20 million dollars who bought it by the way serious serious body okay so he's gonna like go exclusively to them yeah but honestly i'm gonna call our shot a little bit i don't think that it's going to be that crazy that in a year or two we get paid like 10 or 20 million a year to license out to spotify or something like that i would enjoy that that sounds a little crazy 10 or 20 million i think sounds a little crazy but then again like it sounded crazy that you know like um for example the ringer when they got bought by um by spotify so they were a sports network of podcasts led by bill simmons so bill simmons was sort of like the conan o'brien of that network and they got bought i think for 200 million and and what's crazy is it's not even exclusive to spotify which is just like wild to me that that's how favorable these deals are in the same way that joe rogan when he got paid by spotify he had to take it off of youtube but uh he's still on the he's still on apple podcast which is pretty crazy so when the ringer sold to spotify 200 million i think they were doing about 15 million in revenue when they got bought for 200. crazy that is absolutely crazy and was it only one podcast or no they actually it was like yeah 12 maybe or something like that but they've got a few winners it's like three winners and then like it's like one big winner two small winners and a bunch of like long tail stuff that that kind of doesn't matter um in terms of of like how how big it is but also i think for them the other thing is they won't it's not like they were bought for a revenue multiple it's not like spotify was like you know what we're gonna buy this revenue multiple because you know that's going to get priced at a favorable rate in the market here it was just like we need to strategically move into podcasting okay go get rogan go get the ringer go get the one that i got bought that's like a bar rally is that startup one gimlet so they bought kimlit also for a lot of money they bought anchor that podcasting tool that sucked um like not sucked the tool was cool but nobody was using it uh they bought that thing for like 150 million which is crazy to me and uh so they did they splurged and i think you know that splurge that splurge window is now closed well listen if you're a listener and if you work at sirius or spotify or something like this and you want to throw we are motivated by money yeah do things because people pay me money so we can have that conversation i enjoy commas with many zeros around them so anyway if you're listening and you want to make an introduction or you want to help us get paid can we talk about this um okay so i have a few ideas so i have a couple things i want to talk about later i want to talk to you about this new version of plastic surgery that i think is interesting i want to talk to you about a virtual reality project i saw that was actually doing some pretty significant revenue i want to talk to you about um this like bionic reading thing so i have a few things i want to talk about but first can we talk about this meme the drinking a cola meme yeah yeah so sam texts me while we're on vacation and uh i was like dude this is perfect for the pod because you saw a tweet from moyes who came on the podcast the same day or the next day or something like that and moy said something like i don't know can you pull it up what the exact phrasing is but he he was just tweeting about some business thing he's like oh yeah i was drinking a cola with the founders of this blah blah app and and then he said some business thing and sam rightfully pointed out how hilarious that intro is of like i was enjoying a cola with my friends and then we just decided to start talking about you know cash flow i met with the triple whale founders yesterday for a cola they were exhausted from a day of traveling but we all we all left with so much energy genghis khan conquered 30 of the world during his reign we want to do the same except the world is now the digital marketing share but the intro was i met with these founders yesterday that tweet is hilarious on multiple levels first of all the metaphor is founders for cola hilarious who drinks cola i don't know who says first of all that's like who smokes and drinks soda still i don't know second who calls it cola third why is that relevant for the tweet it's funny yeah we have to do a series of tweets where it's like we talk about something profound but the intro is like uh you know so i was getting some caramels with a friend or uh yeah so like it just got to be like the most random stuff snapping off a beef jerky with my buddy timmy and he told me about how self-storage market is really going under right now it's like yeah who says a [Laughter] cola do you think that's what he meant as a cult like you sat down for like pepsi like it's like you know at a board meeting today we poured out of peppermint schnapps and decided if we ever do an event or a conference it's like that's the passcode like how do we know you're real and you're a real listener you're real loyal it's like you need to be able to come up and be like and tell us a story tell us a story that starts with like you know you know so i was eating a dunkaroo and you know just had a question or we gotta like do the most extreme thing ever where it's like so i was uh doing this thing where you suck on a piece of candy and then spit it in your friend's mouth because it changed the taste anyway we were talking about that's not important but we were talking about the economic oh it's so good it's so good that's my new [ __ ] you know my last [ __ ] was i have moved straight to the end because of elon and i haven't moved straight to the end that's done and my new [ __ ] is yeah my buddy we're doing the spaghetti thing where we each take one end of the noodle and suck on it but when we got close to the middle we realized the problem with coven [Music] and then we started talking about the recession that's pretty good drinking a cola wait really quick do you think that he was trying to be funny no that's the best part i think he was just saying like i think he was just saying what happened and that in his mind is what happened even the second part of the tweet alone right take the cola part out just being like i met with the vendors of triple whale and you know genghis khan if you bring genghis khan into whatever sentence you're saying you you are dramatically overestimating whatever you're doing in life it's like the same way where if anyone's like yeah um you know the way that tesla came out with the roadster first so we're also doing like a high end of digital marketing attribution before we go low end it's like no you're equivalent you're making yourself equivalent to tesla and like that's anytime you're like genghis khan conquered 30 of the earth whatever the next sentence is better be [ __ ] lit and instead his was like we're doing the same for digital marketing and so that also was like you know just hilarious to me is cola uh is moi was boys born in america yeah he's he's born no they were i think they were born in pakistan and then they moved when they were like seven or five or something is that like a pakistani thing where they call like soda cola i don't know maybe because actually i have a cousin who came over from india but like when he was like 20 and he would always be like hey can i have a coca-cola light what would you just say and he would like he would always say the full name of things and it was like okay yeah like oh is this covered by nationwide insurance again it is funny you ask [Laughter] this is awesome we could go on this forever yeah it's too much for me all right so i want to talk about a couple ideas did you see this thing about i have this link in here you can see it's this the surgery that guys are getting that costs 75 000 but it'll make you three inches taller do you see this thing they break your face that's a great thing to text to like your friend who like is a little short you're like hey heard the news good news congrats congrats i heard about the break the scientific breakthrough oh what happened you got a vaccine no they break your femur and they'll put a rod in and it'll make you three to five inches taller and this thing is like apparently just popping off and i've just been looking at this like it's like what are the big problems that nobody wants to admit to but are real i just think that that's an interesting prompt for business ideas so it's like our buddy craig clemons does this where like one of his products is like one of his best-selling products right like he's got these d2c companies that do like i don't know over 100 million a year in sales uh as part of his like bootstrap thing and um i think one of their products was like some toenail fungus remover and it's like just like the unsexiest thing but it's like common and it's actually something something that people really want to get rid of right um or they're something that people really want to change and i think height is another one i've seen this now in two places so first i saw this surgery thing and i was like oh that's funny like the article was written almost like can you believe this crazy thing people are doing and in my mind i was like yeah i can totally believe that i think being just [ __ ] awesome yeah exactly like if you're gonna be your best friend or like a fake ass like yeah this is this is i'm on board exactly and i was like you know being taller is like you know just awesome like if you gave me three inches i'd be very happy i'd earn more money and i'd be more liked like that's just a thing like ben how tall are you like six four right yeah yes correct you already know you already know the advantage you're you're so privileged dude you shouldn't even talk to the podcast you're so privileged you're speaking from tall privilege right now check your privilege yeah you need to check your tall privilege at the door right now i had a girlfriend one time not like a girlfriend but like a girl i was familiar with who said uh who told me i can't tell if i think you're actually handsome or if you're just tall yeah by the way sam did you in your course there's a review from me saying like sam's copyrighted course it works i i got three extra inches in two weeks or something like that and uh did you write that because people keep coming to me to be like that's so funny yeah they're like dude that's so funny and either blacked out or someone is just impersonating me because i don't remember writing that but it's hilarious basically if you go to try copy that dot com and you scroll all the way down like on the sales page you'll see like a and it says sean perry and then where the review is loved it so much it gave me three extra inches totally five out of five stars i thought you did that which was funny but the fact that someone else did it and wrote your your name funnier funnier dude i knew a guy yeah so this is an interesting question we i know a guy named nat and he's got an app uh it's called like i forget what exactly what it's called but it helps you with a kegel do you know what a kegel is i don't i think i i think a kegel is the exercise that you do or is it the muscle that needs to be stronger it's the exercise it's sick it's the exercise that you have to do that keeps you from pre-jacking early i guess that's an oxymoron i like how you just shortened it you're like if i just say half the word it's half as bad um the other thing i think i think women do it which is like supposed to be just like good for you in general but also for women it kind of tightens it helps them feel helps helps sex feel better for them i think it's the idea um well this guy and he created an app for men to keep you from just jacking early and i think he kills it i guess let me guess it's doing pretty well yeah it's doing good and so that's like another one i don't know if that's that big of a market but what else is there i think it is a huge market i mean look at what row and hymns did right so they took erectile dysfunction and they wrapped a brand that you won't feel embarrassed you're you know like associated with around it right like the value of hymns is is partially the telemedicine piece which is like you don't have to go to a doctor and talk to somebody face to face about this so it's like reduces shame on one end and on the other end it reduces shame the other way which is you get the package uh there's no label on it it's like completely discreet and secondly like they made their brand cooler so that you don't feel like a schmuck for you you don't feel like something's wrong with you or you're broken in some way for using them right like that's like the value of their brand and that's why they built literally a billion dollar brand doing that yeah here's another one have you ever have you ever like cheese grated your foot to get the callus off you don't kind of like that's the most country thing you've ever said no i have never done that like you know like with parm have you read like oh i know what you're talking about like i've seen i've seen a girl doing this on this like there's like a like the equivalent of like a sweet potato peeler or whatever and they just like use that on their like to get their callus off their foot yeah so i just sent it to you in the uh chat box it's uh it's basically i bought one the other day because i had just like calluses on my foot and it's basically just a cheese grater like a like for parmesan they just call it a foot uh colossal footrest a foot files what they call it it's got almost a hundred thousand reviews oh my god this thing is 82 000 reviews on amazon it's just like one reader that they just have you ever seen a product with more reviews than that like has an instapod or whatever has that many reviews is that crazy it's a ten dollar like made in china cheese grater that they just call a foot file that is insane uh that probably cost them 50 cents right no more than that but like yeah it's still profitable that's crazy because they're just gonna get so many searches right like for something like this um the other one that's like the height one that i saw so somebody's doing this on tick tock and the ad is brilliant so they're selling a shoe like a men's platform shoe so it's an insert into a normal shoe that's kind of like a heel but instead of the heel being on the outside of the shoe it's on the inside so your foot just like your heel gets elevated from the inside like a doctor shoals but like gives you two and a half inches in inside of a shape better than surgery just do that way better right and so how do they sell this how do they sell this the tick tock ad is it looks like um so it's you know this like i don't know if you've heard this thing in common like a man on the street interview where it's basically like if you ever watch those late night shows they'll go to like time square they'll be like uh you know do you support you know whatever this thing and then people don't even know what it is they say stupid stuff but it's basically like dude walking around with a microphone out about like times square outside of a nightclub or like at a bar and they just like ask questions and so the ad is a tick tock is on tick tock and what the guy's doing is or the girl is um oh no the guy's interviewing girls he's like all right be honest this size matter when it comes to height for guys right or like something like that they like immediately get you of like okay first this doesn't look like an ad secondly you kind of want to know what the girl says exactly because it's preying on an insecurity and so then and it just quickly cuts between the girls and they'll be like and it ranges from a girl being like uh like no okay yeah and then like it's just kind of like her admitting it and then it's like the next one is like two girls they'll be like hell yeah she won't even date a guy if he's not six five and she's like no no he's like no tell the truth it's true and like and it's kind of like preying on the guys in security like oh man girls really care about this they won't admit it but they but if you get them to be honest they really do care that that extra hate matters they'll be like what's the perfect height for a guy and then they'll be like um six one in fact you know the average guy is my five nine and they're like yeah and then they're just laughing right and it's like four of those cuts of like that interview and then it's like um and then and then they do an even better version of it they're like i've seen one i think that's like the guy's wearing it and they're like did you know that he's wearing this thing right now and they're like no i had no idea and it's basically like people can't tell that you're wearing these things and so they're addressing the objections that somebody would have so first they create the demand which is that like girls will find you more attractive if you're if you're taller then they address the objections which is you don't look goofy for wearing stilts and like and said they're like oh i have no idea no you can't tell oh my god that's awesome like that's so clever and so they're like and they super cut that together and i saw that i was like man this is a really effective like marketing campaign and it's also an interesting product category that i wouldn't have rather otherwise really thought about that's actually interesting yeah this is pretty cool and every that is a good one that people are embarrassed about they need to do an ad about how like everyone who says they're 511 is really just five nine because no one's actually 511. like you just yeah if you did a man on the street you're like how tall are you they're like yeah five five eleven i'm six i'm six and they're like okay cool we have a thing right here just stand up and they're like five ten six even though it's five eleven are you six foot yeah that's true i've never met a six-footer in your life it's like a leap year sixth foot in my life dawg you five ten just admit it five turns six one no in between god skipped that we went from five eleven to six one but but you ate six even yeah god doesn't make mistakes but he never made a man six foot even that stamp wasn't made so like anybody who says they're succeeding that ain't true that's why women always say you have to be at least 6-1 let me tell you another tick tock marketing thing that i think is pretty clever that i saw um have you ever heard of it's probably probably not it's pretty pretty niche but this thing called far cocktail apartments i have it on here it's f-a-r-k-a-t-k-t-e so basically there's a woman on on tick-tock and she's a real estate broker or a leasing broker and i'll tell you how i arrived at this so somebody had tweeted out something which was like hey if you needed a side hustle that was going to generate like 3k to 5k a month um and you could only kind of work like you know let's say like you know a couple hours and during the week and and you know half a day on the weekends or something like that what would you do to do that if you didn't know how to code and one of the interesting answers was oh i'd be a leasing agent because if you can get an apartment leased up you get i think the first month's rent or something like that as the broker and so the rent is going to be you know in new york or san francisco or these big cities rent's going to be like three grand four grand five grand six grand and so if you just lease one apartment right so if you get one apartment at least you know that's 5k right there that's pure profit essentially and what i saw was that some people what they're doing is they're creating popular tick tock accounts just showing unique spaces or like in this case she shows like hilariously i think hilariously bad apartments like she'll walk into this place she like all right this this apartment this condo is exquisite and like whatever you know queens here and then she'll be like um you know how many bedrooms is it there's no bedrooms there's just this loft actually it's not a loft actually it's just this like area above the kitchen where there's like a pipe above your head but like there's like three inches to go sleep up there if you can climb up and like oh you know do you like the soothing sounds of water well the toilet keeps running so you'll have that zen vibe and so she's like kind of making fun of like how overpriced apartments in new york are and for like how little you get for how much you pay which is just a great viral hook right so instead of just doing the literal thing which is go to find an apartment be like hey guys here's a great apartment she's finds hilariously bad deals makes that her tick tock or really good deals and then she basically says if you want an apartment come to me and so um i don't know if this is exactly her model but because i just looked at it real quick but like i think that would be a model that would work is create content like we've seen this on instagram there's an account called zillow gone wild which is hilarious to watch which is like it's just like crazy ass homes from zillow and so you can kind of make like house porn or like apartment porn where it's like just really interesting stuff like really interesting apartments or really interesting homes really overpriced really underpriced whatever and then use that as your lead gen for like by the way do you actually just want a two bedroom apartment like come through like get it through me like here's my listings uh like you can actually see if you want like something that's not like overpriced here's my listings and like i think just doing something like that you could have have a lot of fun and build a pretty like solid business i mean i'm sure she's doing way more than 5k a month but i just thought that was certainly an interesting little model i looked up i looked up this word i've never heard that word it's a i looked it up it's a yiddish word that means poor quality uh and so yeah but who's this lady what's her handle it's just that it's that word those were she got far far [ __ ] day apartments and that's her tick tock she has 37 000 followers and like you know like here's a huge loft in brunswick it'll have 108 000 views on that video right so she's showing crazy these things but then she has her actual she so she's like comedy actor slash realtor if you want my real rentals you know compass.com go go get them all right like you can email little crushes yeah so i thought this was great and it's like completely differentiated uh from what most people do and so like i'm trying this right now with the milk road which is like i'm really obsessed with this idea of like you if you combine two things that are usually not combined you don't have to be great at either one of the things because you've created a whole new combination right like this happens in food all the time or like you've talked about this formula in food like jumbo donut it's like you don't need to have the best donuts just do a huge donut and then people will come to you for for that right go go for the biggest make a green you know purple ketchup green like you know it's doritos tacos right like uh it's not that it's better it's just so different and so with milk road we're doing this right now where i'm trying to create like basically a it's not funny enough or it'd just be like a straight up like comedy thing but it's like a lot of yeah it's like this part yeah i don't know why i'm trying to go for this like far-fetched example this podcast are we the richest no are we the smartest no are we the best prepared no do we have the best insights and research absolutely not are we the funniest no but do we have the right combination of like we were having a good time we make ourselves laugh and make you laugh just enough we're like it's business and it's just enough business and just enough make you laugh and that's what like i'm trying that with the milk road now i'm trying to do the same thing it's like there's crypto information there's a lot of people trying to be the smartest guy in the room with crypto it's like a big brains contest you go into a room and everybody's just trying to have this like 9000 iq it's like well we want to be smart but we're not going to be the smartest because who the [ __ ] knows who's the smartest it's really hard but like we can also be slightly funny and we would differentiate ourselves from everybody else doing crypto content and so i'm pretty interested in this like this like idea of stacking sk unique skills that are like you don't have to be the best at either you just have to be just dangerous enough at both but if you combine them you're completely differentiated in your market can i ask you about a crypto story really quick that you you would might know about and yeah i need you to explain it to me so do you know anything about sam bankman freed that's his name right bankman of course so how old is he is he under 30 still uh he's like 29 30 31 i know i know he was under 30 at once but is he still i should know they are currently the leading sponsor of the milk road so ftx go get your go get your account so he is 30 years old exactly on the knot on the dot all right that was a bad joke i made by the way i said i knew he was under 30 once but is he still under 30. uh i was good actually i didn't i just didn't pick it up um all right so this like basically when he was 28 he was worth like 20 billion dollars right yeah he's the i think he's probably i think him or the guy from finance they're the richest person from crypto besides whoever satoshi is that's crazy so and this he said in an article the other day he's like i'm thinking about spending a hundred million dollars on the upcoming presidential election but i'll probably cap out at about a billion yeah and just like that statement is just a ridiculous statement to like not that it's wrong it's just like a crazy chain of words added together in one sentence like i didn't think i would hear someone say it let alone a 30 year old how what type of person is this guy to become that rich at like 28 he he also has a unique skill stack which is that so he was like um i think a trader or an analyst at jane street so it's like kind of like smart quant type guy and then uh you know i think i've told the story before you know the story about the uh the kimchi like arbitrage or whatever you know this not exactly i know that like he did some arbitrage but i don't understand why bitcoin would be cheaper in korea than it would in america well it's all about like kind of like access and the liquidity of the market so like uh some markets like for example japan is where the access was the hardest so like i think let's say this for example the government's crack down on exchanges so you can only get it in the black market or on these small niche exchanges of these foreign offshore exchanges there's a lot of friction and so because of that and you can't access coinbase.com yeah like at a given time in japan you couldn't access you couldn't easily buy bitcoin because of that to buy bitcoin in japan you were paying a premium so in theory you could let's say bitcoin is priced at 30 grand you could buy bitcoin for 30 grand in america and if you had a way to sell it in japan you could sell it for 32 000 and you could just infinitely make a 2 000 spread and so it's kind of like great how much capital you got pour it all into bitcoin in the us and then sell it all instantly in japan and you're not really taking much risk because you're just quickly flipping it for that premium and so a lot of people were trying to do this i think there was a spread of about five grand in japan or something like that at the time but nobody knew how like it wasn't easy to go sell the thing in japan again if it was that easy there wouldn't have been the premium in the first place what he found was that i think it was in korea um that he uh there was a smaller premium but it was easier to get around and so like what what they did was they literally flew to korea or whatever and they like talked to like local banks and they were like hey we would like to have an account that will allow us to uh you know wire money in significant size every day in and out like can you support that can you support that action because i'm going to basically be transferring in like you know call it two million dollars in and two million dollars out the same day and it's just to be the same day just calling down action makes it sound cooler can you support that action that's such a better word can you handle that size that's my new shape that also by the way just being like yeah we got to be able to do it in size or like yeah they're moving in size [Laughter] i'm just gonna say action instead of the word amount so like asking my wife how much like beef she wants me to buy at the store how much did you watch how much action are you trying to get on these ribs in terms of in terms of uh oat milk are we trying to move sighs yeah crazy so basically what ended up happening was he had this company like whatever alameda research or whatever uh but like he saw that the um i think it was like the kimchi premium was like the big premium was like if bitcoin was 10k in the us it was 15k in korea and i think in japan there was a smaller one and so he was he he was able to do in japan and he made like something like 20 million dollars doing this arbitrage in like one summer and it took him like flying there finding a network of local banks that would let him wire serious money in and out and make sure that they could just repeat these transactions on the same day close so that they had the money they were recycling a small amount of money so i think it was like take two million dollars they buy bitcoin they sell it in japan they take the money that they're made in japan they need to be able to wire it back so that tomorrow they can go buy again 2.2 million of bitcoin based off of the extra that they made and then they did the same thing next day 2.4 million and they got it up where they they eventually profited like 20 30 million so then he basically was like all right him and his like small team i guess um like this little crew that was doing this arbitrage did he have money ahead of time or was he just like a like a like living with roommates living with roommates even now he lives like he drives like an old beat up honda or some [ __ ] like that he sleeps like in the office on a giant bean bag so there's like tons of pictures of him just like passed out on a bean bag in front of his desk and it's like it's actually like two bean bags like upper body on one feet on the other creates this tiny little spf bridge between them and like that's just the way this guy works and he's like you know he's vegan he he's uh he's like he he practices things called effective uh altruism i think is what you call it and so so that's his thing which is like his goal is like this philosophy and the goal is make as much money as you can so that you can give away as much money as you can like that's the point of making money is to give it away in the most effective manner possible and so it's like earn to give is the like name of the um um is the name of the of the like the the philosophy of what they do is that so one of the things he's trying to do is like yeah that's what he says he's motivated by so he's like you know he's donated like i think he donated like he's donated 200 million already of his like net worth and he's um and he's you know this thing about like i i'm willing to donate up to a billion dollars uh you know in the next one is to like you know another way to make change and it's not all political like it's like where does the dollar have you know the most effect and that sort of thing yeah he uh did i also read an interview or is it you told me where he was like i don't even care about bitcoin like i'm just doing this to make money like he said something to the he's where he's not like yeah so there's a lot of people that are like very missionary like if you listen to brian armstrong from coinbase he's like uh he like lived in buenos aires and saw like you know what happened to the argentinian peso and he was like it's not right like people around the world are you know don't have access to like economic freedom and uh you know they live in a place where their currency gets devalued like crazy and like there's a better way and it's crypto i believe that to my core and i'm gonna like coinbase is gonna help more people like get into crypto because i think crypto is what matters in the world and sam baker freed just sort of like um you know not that his mission is different his mission is like i'm an effective altruist i'm trying to give away as much money as possible so i need to make as much money as possible and in order to do that i'm gonna just oh you know whether you're selling this or that like cool people wanted an effective trading platform for crypto i'll build that uh you know i know this product and this need because i'm a trader so i'll be able to like do it that way that's baller man and there was a meme of him the other piece of the as you say the other piece of the effect of altruism is like they really use like they wanted to be evidence-based that like um you know every dollar going in is like having like you know sort of like the greatest possible impact is like one of their their big things like how measurable is the impact dude this guy's great there's a funny meme of him going around basically this guy his name's stan bankman free google him and he looks like you'd want him to look so he's kind of like a chubby jewish guy who wears like new balance shoes in like high socks and cargo shorts and like an army green t-shirt and like shaggy hair and a huge timex watch like that's like it looks like a [ __ ] look yeah and he uh there's a picture of him on stage and it's like this beautiful interviewer and then on his left is like giselle and on the right is like some other model like how do you clue i i forget like these like you know smart like business women who who are just like the most gorgeous people you've ever seen and he's sitting in the middle and they're all like looking at him and it's like get you get you a person who will look at sam bakeman freed like giselle looks at him or something like that and it's hilarious yeah yeah he's just kind of hunched over oblivious to the whole thing it's great is he is he like uh what makes him special um you know that's hard to say i haven't met him we've met some of the other like kind of people the ftx team like for example their head of strategy is like 25 years old or something like that he might be 24 and he's like the head of strategy there he like started off in customer service and is now the head of strategy and so i think they just like if i could just kind of comment on like what you see as the culture for them is like they go hard what i mean by that is like they're like they're really sharp they're like kind of like quants and then they like work like it just seems like they work very hard and they they move as fast as crypto moves which is very very fast and they didn't like there was no like invisible walls for them like the companies based in the bahamas they grew like crazy when they wanted to do marketing they're like okay go get steph curry and tom brady and like you know larry david and that's who's gonna be our spokesperson or whatever like they pulled no expenses they named they like bought arena like he called somebody i know the guy who we met the guy who did the athlete rights for them um and basically he was like yeah he got on a call and i was like okay so like what are your goals with like you know sports sponsorships to help you know ftx how are you going to measure this he goes um how much does it cost to have the yankee stadium name renamed to ftx stadium it's like uh yeah i don't think that's even like for sale he's like okay what about every ad inside the stadium and he's like uh that's a lot man like maybe we should just like kind of like crawl before we walk in before we run and he's like i think it would be most effective if we go get tom brady and steph curry and yankees like um you go do that and then tell me when you have them you know like that was essentially the call and it was like you know name your price and like that's what they did and guess what they got all of them and it's like a pretty impressive strategy where it's like there's not like any like you know tiptoeing around in anything i love the those people i call them freaks and i love them i love these freaks i love freaks he also is one of my favorite twitter followers like i don't know if you do follow him on twitter he posts awesome threads that are like not like again it's not propaganda for his company but it actually is effectively propaganda for the company so he'll just be like you know here's my thoughts on like raising money here's what actually happens and he'll be like yeah investors they want us to do this and at first i thought that's just self-serving [ __ ] but then i realized actually the game theory is this and then he like just talks he'll just lay out these long threads and like he's like look i'm not saying this is ftx's point of view this is like my late night thoughts about this topic and when you see him think out loud you're like oh wow this guy's just incredibly sharp and he sees both sides of it he's kind of like an independent thinker and so he's one of the best follows on on twitter do you think working with him do you think that he's he's obviously has some intensity but is he like a hustle hustle like let's work like why like alf this alpha type of guy i don't get that vibe i don't get wolf of wall street i don't get the he's not genghis khan took over 30 of the thing it's like it's more like obsession meets like you know we i don't know if this got cut i think it's got cut out of our previous podcast where we were like we kind of admire the like aspergersy personality because it has like uh the ability to like focus really intensely and the ability to like think not like think for yourself and not think just like oh what is the norm what societal norms like let me just go with that so to me it's like when he says that let's go get the yankees and tom brady it's not because like let's go swing our big d around here and let's go show who's boss it's like well it seems like the most effective thing to do if we're trying to build trust would be go to the most trusted athletes and like get them and on a cost you know a cost per you know fan basis they're actually the most effective even though the total gross dollar amount is higher right like to me that's how his brain works not like you know be sweet dude if we go get like let's go get the [ __ ] yankees bro like it's not that and so um he's like uh like who what's that the largest reach okay that makes sense yeah just whatever's number one in that chart just do that right exactly like well if this has the arbitrage then like let's put all of our money into it and like let's hedge it over here like that it's more like that and so and so i think that when they just in the same way like the intensity of the company is high but i don't think it's because it's like bro we got to grind if we want to make it you know like you know uh oh you take weekends off you know you're soft you know like it's not that it's more like oh i haven't eaten in 36 hours because i've just been like really interested in this problem and i'm staring at my screen and i forgot to eat and i forgot to shower and i also i guess i'll just sleep on this bean bag because that way i don't need to commute because commuting wastes at least you know an hour a day and like why would i waste an hour of my day like you know i'm just i sleep on this beanbag in fact it's ergonomic or whatever you know like i think that's more how the brain works where it's like this hyper rationalism is what i would call it do um i wonder what he's like as a ceo like do you think he holds one-on-one meetings and like because he just does not look like we should have him on him and the head of whatever they wanted to come on the pod so uh i think they're protecting him a little bit like he's now super busy with like press applications or whatever like so there i think they were trying to have like their the number two guy in the company come on the pod and so this this guy brett uh so i think he'd be really interesting too uh but you know everybody wants sbf because he looks like he he's the zuckerberg right like cheryl might be the the secret weapon and the one who actually runs the show but like zuck is this like alien character that people are fascinated with and they want to like poke them and be like oh look it moves you know and so well i would love to get sam on i wouldn't mind having a guy who is his boss you know a guy who works for him as long as the guy coming on would be cool we're only gonna ask you about sam is that cool yeah like oh wait no i don't think you understand the assignment we don't care about like you that's not annoying right yeah dude it's like if i meet someone who's like oh man love the podcast i'm like dude great so that's so glad to meet a fan and he's like sam's so awesome what's it like to be around samuel oh [ __ ] you dude i'm busy like i'm not gonna sit here talking about sam we had a couple of guests and they're like cool and they like say like oh yeah i worked with steve jobs um and like wait wait all right let's just let's just only focus scrap your current thing so as long as they're okay like if they understand the assignment that it's strictly a like we're just here to like learn like joe rogan had this guy who worked at spacex and they talked about what it's like to work to elon for elon and i was like oh just let's just only focus on that thing the whole go to space stuff is cool but just tell me what it's like to work with elon and that's what we as long as they understand that's the assignment i'm on board our software is the worst have you heard of hubspot see most crms are a cobble together mess but hubspot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous i think i love our new crm our software is the best hubspot grow better here's another kind of like interesting like intensity teamwork thing that i think is you know close enough transition have you seen this business called a team like uh i think it's because i think it's just a letter a and then dot team is there well you know that's like a mad a famous tv show right you remember uh mr t mr t or whatever yeah yeah all i know is that much i don't i've never seen anything so so it's that same oh like i think they're kind of playing all that branding a little bit in the sense that like uh the idea is basically so they just raised 60 million dollars and they raised it from nfx who i i really res uh nfx was early in them and said good things i i respect that effect so made me pay attention now this is an idea that's been around it's been tried but maybe the time is right now and so that's why this is interesting to me so let me kind of give you my backstory of this idea and i want to hear what you think if you think this is a good idea or a bad idea so i once heard neval on a podcast talk about like the future of work he he was basically like naval was like you know i um i don't buy this whole i don't believe that we're going to live in a world where you work nine to five sitting at a desk in some office for one company you work there for 30 years and already you see that shifting like instead of working at a place for 30 years then getting your pen in when you retire and they like you know have a cake cutting ceremony in the in the lobby for you as they send you off to your death like okay now people started to hop jobs more and then people started to work you know remote and freelance and neval's thing was like he's like i think the future of work is like ocean's 11. he goes you're gonna have your crew the same way that ocean's 11 is this badass team of like you know you got the pickpocket guy you got the ninja you have the like the comms guy you have the planner you have the like um you know the guy who can go gather intel you have the hot girl who's the distraction and you have this you know you got brad pitt george clooney all right so that's the team and it's like you're just gonna get a message which says all right guys round up like we got one we got a mission to go on and everybody meets up and everybody everyone's doing other stuff and it's like what's the mission oh like you know ocean's elevens we're gonna rob this bank or whatever and then for um for work it's gonna be like all right here's this brand that's trying to whatever they're killing the us they're trying to expand into india and so you might be the ocean's 11 team that continuously gets called on to take a brand and expand them into india and like you you wake up you get a page uh you know your pager basically goes off and says we need you the bat signal is up you all congregate you've all worked together so you know you come as a group who's good at accomplishing certain types of missions you do those missions you rate each other you rate the company that hired you they rate you you rate each other on your team you go on your way and you get called in for the next mission and the money hits your bank and so naval kind of describes this thing and he's like you won't just have one team like you'll probably float around with a couple teams like if you're the pickpocket you've got like three teams that can call on you and um and it just works that way so you get reputation that's built not on a resume but through this like verified ratings of like i've actually worked with this person you have um not continuous work you get called on when there's a mission you sprint you crush it then you relax until the next mission you can work as much or as little as you want you may or may not even know the identities of the other people you could be like my name is my nickname is just whatever star wing and i just go in and people don't know me a star wing and i just that's how i work and like that's the future of work so that kind of fascinated me when he he described it and he did it in the naval way which was like you know one tenth of the words i just used but twice is interesting and now i'm starting to see some startups pop up that are doing this and to me a team is an idea of that where they're like oh you want to build um an e-commerce website well we have the designer the front-end developer the back-end developer and the like conversion optim optimizer and like they'll just swoop in and they'll just do it for you in like two weeks you'll get a better product than whatever and here's the big lump sum payment you do for that team this is so amazing i saw a meme the other day where was the guy he goes i so look forward to the day where i'm just sitting at a bar and a stranger walks up and says i'm putting together a team and i look at them and respond i'm in when we leave and it was just like that yeah i live in the duffel bag you know yeah i'm putting together i'm putting the team together you win uh dude this is awesome their site is amazing this is one of the best landing pages i've seen in a long time it's a dot team look at those landing pages it's pretty good the hero image is really good and then um yeah the exactly just succinctly describe what they're doing so you just get on you just log on and you see it it's a relatively strange concept and they describe it in like two sentences wonderfully this is awesome i'm not sure i don't i think it's quite bold to say it's the future of work i don't think that that's what it is but i think it's like a subset of freelancing that's going to be amazing yeah exactly not everybody but in the same way like the gig economy made it so that you know i can like a thing that didn't happen 10 years ago or whatever like was you wake up you like hop in your car you open up your phone this guy wants a ride over here drive over there pick him up drop him off cash hit your bank you know he you made 16 for that ride oh you want to go you want to stop working because you want to go pick up your daughter from school you swipe to log off you're off work now you want to get back on later you know at midnight and take people to the airport all right you can do that again like that whole gig economy thing where your phone just gives you jobs like gives you work that will just pay you small micro like payments off your micro tasks that's pretty cool and that's like a thing that uber and like taskrabbit and doordash all brought to the table so i feel like there might be the next version of that which is like for highly skilled cross discipline like i know i could do this for example like i have three or four people where it's like that's the great developer this is the great designer i'll be the marketing guy and this guy will be the you know whatever the problem is is that they're not available like to do stuff and this is creating an opportunity for them to be available but if like i've gone on i've gone to the shopify marketplace and i've used upwork and oftentimes when i use upwork it's just like a guy in india who's like the face and he's got like a team of like eight guys and like isn't that kind of what's already happening they just packaged this in a far more sophisticated and sexy way yeah they did in a more sexy way and i think it's more for premium like things so like in the same way that like if you don't want the india thing but you want like it's sort of like what an agency does but what typically what agencies do they specify they they specialize in one vertical so it's like we do seo we do facebook ads we do copywriting and what this is saying is like no you're trying to launch a marketplace you're trying to launch a new nft marketplace well you're gonna need somebody who's great at email marketing you're gonna need an engineer who knows smart contracts you're gonna need a designer you're gonna need a social media person so like whatever they give you the six cross-disciplinary people that are good at building marketplaces and that's just like a different cut of the same idea of agencies this is awesome this is one of the cooler companies i think i've seen lately this is amazing yeah how'd you find this uh because the guys i followed at nfx they were like hey this company's grown really fast like fast there i forgot what they said but it was like growing super fast and i was like how fast and uh you know that's why i started looking to it and it reminded me of that like that dreamy idea that neval had brought up and i was like oh maybe now with kovid maybe now the time has changed where like there's enough really talented people that are no longer like locked into jobs um because they're not they've got like all the right people if you go to like their team it says that their their featured advisors are the guy who started fiverr which is crazy the guy who started fiber also started lemonade that's pretty wild the ceo of upwork so like they've got all the right people on board wow yeah this is an amazing company this is a badass find i've never i've never heard of these guys yeah that's cool um all right take another idea off this list and uh another topic of this list let's do that um uh let's do that yeah i literally never read docusign i just sign uh this is more like i just needed to verify with you do you also do this like dude when i get a docusign i'm not reading it i'm not gonna lie you can scan me pretty easily have you seen the south park episode where like it's like what they do is um they create you know what a caterpillar is no so it's like do i want to know they take a chain of six people and and they like i think i know they sell their mouths to the person's butt and you just gotta stay there okay and apple apple does that to people because it says it in the terms and conditions in itunes when you sign up and the whole episode is like whoa stan you didn't read the terms and conditions of apple before you click yes that's crazy of course like you have to go do a caterpillar now because that's what it said i can't believe you didn't read it and it's like this whole thing but um dude i've been getting docusigns lately where they literally just send me the sign page and they don't even send me yeah yes people are like hey here's the document it's just a one underline and it says sign here i'm like signed what what am i saying yeah it's called the signature package and basically i've got in the context of a company that i've invested in they need me to sign paperwork for some reason because they're raising a new add a new valuation at a higher valuation and they literally just send me the signature packet and like i have it's four or six things and i'm just it just says like sam parr and then a lion and the signing and i have no idea what i'm signing and so yeah like a yes i do that because i just don't read the stuff and b sometimes they don't even send me the stuff to read they just send me they just sign i have no idea what it means do you get that yeah i've been getting those and i'm like i'm like all right it's one thing if i'm not gonna read it for you to not even write it it's like a whole level another level of arrogance here and like you know poor form that we're taking what do those guys do he was based in new york yeah why see more butts asking me to sign this stuff they're just messing with me that's crazy it's like you know when people when people really want to get us to respond they'll like venmo us money or they're like pay palace money being like i'm being super creative to like to reach you to get you to read my message or whatever and i'm like it doesn't really doesn't really work i don't really like that and it makes me feel uncomfortable and like you know um generally the people i want to meet never do that so i'm like uh you know generally this is not a good signal for you the other day this these guys were emailing me to try their stuff and they're like what are you soft you're not up for the challenge and i just i was just like i am not up i am not up for the challenge and they just replied with okay [Laughter] i am not up for the challenge i think people they hear us out here and we're joking around and they're like uh what if i take that joke to the next level and i make it weird and they don't know me they somehow think that's going to work it's like this works as me and sam have known each other for like 10 years and the jokes are meant to be jokes they're not serious it's like then you take the you take that same idea you make it serious and you do it from a stranger it's like no no it's not the same thing yeah i i actually don't like the annoying um the other day this guy sent me an email and in the subject line it said like you know like you're a c word sucker and uh he's like made you open and i was like oh i don't i don't like that that i find that to be inappropriate and not cool like i'm not on board with that and that's what he said but i can totally see how somebody would listen to this podcast and think uh they'll love that yeah or like like why are you approaching me it's like we're we're that's what we're doing we're like i love this copywriting and you know just do what you got to do and for the hustle i was super annoying getting people to be conference speakers like yeah but i don't like when it happens to me yeah i didn't even call someone like a little [ __ ] like people will call me that they're like what's up you little [ __ ] like dude i don't know you who's doing that somebody was doing that somebody who worked for us was doing that right yeah yeah yeah i have not called them out but they called us a little [ __ ] and i'm like dude you're an intern don't talk to me like that and like my friends don't even call me a little [ __ ] what are you talking about it was like i think it was an intern that called us that oh i know i think it was a breyo a bray you used to call us a little bit i wasn't gonna call them out you're like i'm not going to call them out oh unless it's you in which case it was you he was our uh producer and he'd be like uh time to work you little [ __ ] or something dude don't talk to me like that i'm gonna talk to you like that it's like why are you calling me that yeah yeah bray you came in really hot uh you gave it really yeah i know i mean i love them and he could talk to me that now that we're friends and not co-workers but when we were co-workers i was like dude i was like offended i was like please don't call me that that i don't like that uh zilinski deep fake what's that that's a longer one i went down this rabbit hole of like the history of the internet like how it came out pretty quick just crazy stuff uh i'm not gonna do that one right now that one's too long but um okay so zelinski deep fake so people know about deep fakes which is like i think i think a lot of people who listen us probably know about deep fakes but if you don't it's basically the way that you can photoshop a picture to kind of like edit and make it look a certain way and it looks real but like oh no that's been photoshopped you can now do that with video which kind of means right now it's not yet there are some but like you know in a small way like the uh snapchat face filter is essentially like a a bit of a deep fake there's this have you seen the baby one or the one where it makes you sad and cry no is that on snapchat yeah or it's on instagram i think they like show someone's face and they're like hey sean why you so sad why are you crying and you're like what i'm not crying at all but like it looks like you're crying and sad it's like that's one version of it then there's like uh this there's this app i forgot to call it some moves or something like that it's like some dance app but like you basically take a picture of yourself standing there and then it'll make it look like your body it'll make you look like a great dancer like you could go post something on twitter i think you might have done this or it's like i think that's how you found it i did it it looked like i was breakdancing yeah you're like breakthrough it's like you're just jamming out on a wednesday it's like whoa sam can break dance but it's like that looks not quite right wait a minute and it's like oh yeah that's like a deep fake basically it's a fake video and so this is but they're getting better and better like you'll see them do this with like oh my god did you hear obama saying the n-word it's like what no and then you watch this video it's like it's a deep fake but they could like mimic his voice and his lips moving uh and talking doing something and then this is happening it's like it's becoming a big problem in the porn industry because people are doing this like oh there's some girl in my college and i'll just take her picture and i'll make it look like she shot this you know sex tape or whatever and people are like dude that's like you know really effed up but like the technology can do that uh it can do that now it can basically makes make it look like somebody was doing something that they never did and so this is becoming a problem and there's one with zilinski the ukrainian whatever president prime minister whatever it is and like there's this video uh going around of him talking and it's a real there's a real video and then there's the deep fake video where it shows like a a trail powder of uh cocaine on his desk and the russian propagandists are saying uh like look at this your president's breaking down he's using drugs that's why he's saying all this crazy stuff and they made it they added some stuff in the background of the video and i'm like oh man this is just gonna get super crazy of like how do you know what you can trust if you can't trust your eyes and ears anymore like how are we gonna like prosecute crimes how are we gonna like prevent people from like just completely slandering your reputation right are we gonna prevent people from like um you know like the this was what people said that the russians were doing with hillary like during the election was like they were showing propaganda like hillary said this about black people they were promoting that in like predominantly black counties where they were trying to sway the vote and get them to not turn out for hillary it's like it was fake right but it was like misinformation and so to me i'm like this deep fake thing is going to be like a real real problem and i think there's opportunity well there's one answer uh that a buddy was trying to work on which was basically a way to like certify the auth like the original mint of the video so it's like you can basically encrypt the original video so that if anybody wants to see like oh this video of this guy saying this crazy thing is this was this the what was originally shot from the phone and so he was trying to do that but really what you need is you need the phone makers to participate because it has to be done at like the hardware level because any anything else it could be tampered with it's like well if it's just a video file i encrypt and i could just like encrypt it later i could edit it first then encrypt it so it has to be done like as it's being shot the i you know apple and google and samsung or whoever these people are they're gonna have to bake it in where like every video comes with a seal of authenticity and then that's gonna be a cat and mouse game of like can that be faked uh because you could put somebody in prison for like a fake murder you know like that's how crazy this is gonna get if we don't have a way to fight against deep fakes by the way um go to the chat of riverside and click the link i just sent you tell me what you think about that deep fake oh that's you you dancing dude that's great yeah he said announcement while you guys have been taking this time to chill your boy's been learning to dance get on my level and it's a video of you okay so it's get get get sway so sway is the name of the app so get swayed dot app is the name of the thing this is hilarious although it made you a little look a little chunky here you look you look a little bit like will ferrell in this video so you know well yeah you could dance but it also looks like you put on like the cove with 30. i i was that that was pre-influencer um well it's like glitching it's like it's like it's like it's not it's not your actual thing it's like because you're moving so fast it's like it has to make it fuzzy it can't have like a really sharp like line it's pretty good obviously it's pretty good click left go to the left one there's another one i mean it's pretty amazing for just like a free app what do you mean click left there's no left there's a video to your left on the next picture to the left uh on your profile okay i mean like they're it's it's a pretty amazing what's the app called get sway yeah yeah i think it's pretty amazing yeah anyway i hope some smart people out there are working on defects i'm curious what people are going to do the only solution i know is doing it at the hardware the operating system level and even that's probably not perfect but if somebody does figure out a perfect way to do this that's going to be very very valuable technology and i saw the obama thing yeah they made them can i say some crazy [ __ ] uh yeah man i i agree it is kind of scary um well ben what do you think how do we do we gotta get it very very eclectic very eclectic but like all very interesting stuff and uh and the cola stuff was uh was all time can't wait to drink a cola with you guys what was your favorite one your favorite non cola doing the cola one which ones you like i i think eating caramel is my favorite it's just simple and amazing so unexpected i think my favorite was actually we were just eating spaghetti kissing in the middle well all of a sudden me and my co-founder were doing the uh kissing the spaghetti thing where you each take one end put in your mouth get me in the middle and what we realized was that the recession yeah and then we realized yeah that's a good one the best part is like but the thing about co-founders is so you don't address the first part and you gotta do this like in a keynote that's like a product like a steve job product advertisement i'd never address it and never look at the office grabbing each other's butts and then it hit us why stop there you know [Laughter] [Music] all right we're out of here this is great [Music] you

[Music] i was in hawaii when it happened i was like on a beach and then uh like luna crashed and i was like which is literally zero and i was like oh man and like for a day or two i just like um like like kind of [ __ ] up my vacation in a way but not because i was like doing something like i didn't even have access to my like my wallets not just like on in the cloud so like i just wasn't home i couldn't even sell if i wanted to i couldn't do anything really um and then i didn't even want to be doing something i was like i want to be enjoying this vacation you know tell me what happened can you tell me like you had told me you're like luna's kind of cool and you're you told me like six or eight weeks ago yeah actually so i did something cool too in the last few days you'll see it come out i i i went really over the top with a piece of content i haven't done this since i did that clubhouse thread that was extremely over the top but i was like i kind of find this entertaining and this might hit and the clubhouse one like really hit hit like i don't know like 20 million people saw that thing i did that again with the luna stuff where i recorded i basically am creating like a um almost like a john oliver style show you know his show last week tonight or whatever where he just kind of like dismantles one topic for like 15 minutes and it's like but it's peppered with jokes i did that on the lunar thing so that's going to come out last day or two but that was a very fun exercise to try to like so tell me well actually try to be funny but the story is i guess for those who don't know okay so um here's the short ver here's the short version of the story short version of the story is you have bitcoin gets big has this like anonymous creator and it's supposed to do like one thing really well which is like basically this like digital gold and then you have ethereum gets really big and it's got this guy vitalik he becomes the next cult hero first it was satoshi for bitcoin then it becomes metallic and metallic solves a major problem with bitcoin which is that he makes it programmable and ethereum takes off and ethereum's more programmable form of money but both bitcoin and ethereum have like one major problem which is that they're not very good as actual currencies right they're called cryptocurrencies but you don't use them as a day-to-day currency you don't use them to go buy stuff and this is for like a variety of reasons right like bitcoin if you try to spend it you'll get taxed as if you just sold a home every time you do a transaction and then the merchant doesn't want it because they're like oh [ __ ] what tomorrow this is going to go down 20 price like dude i'm not trying to invest i just need money to pay for tomorrow's inventory like i don't want to take this in my coffee shop and so it's not really you those aren't really you so basically there's this idea of creating stable coins there's a coin that's always going to be worth one dollar and like this is the spoiler it's like you know you don't want it to not be worth one dollar which is what happened with with the tara project but like um you know it's supposed to be worth one dollar so the way that most people did it the big ones usdc tether those are the two big ones they're like it's basically like um like like a safety deposit box you give them a real dollar they'll give you a digital dollar and if you ever want a real dollar back they're like i promise it's in the bank vault whenever you need it come back and redeem it and um and those kind of have some controversy because crypto people don't like it because it's like well how do i know you're not lying like how do i know you didn't just take all that money in the bank vault and go spend it or invest it in some risky way and that's why people think tether did uh does and uh and also they're like dude what if the government just cracks down this one company like they could just like they have to operate in some country yeah like it's centralized the whole it's yeah it's centralized this decentralization thing isn't real so at that point so okay so that's the pro so the pro argument for this project that came out that's the project's called tarot and one of the currencies called luna so the idea was we need a decentralized stable coin we need to decentralize does that mean that one person invented tara and then another person invented luna using terrorist technology no no terror is like the name of the company terraform labs it's like a group of people who came together said we're going to create a stable coin and then the stable coin one of them like it's called ust so you think about it like the us dollar version of tara ust and so that was their stable coin that's something that's always supposed to be one dollar luna is the tote like luna is the thing that backs it okay so remember i said like the in the other version what backs the digital dollar it's a real dollar in a bank account and the way that the us dollar used to work was what backs the us dollar gold and fort knox right and that was before we got off the gold standard but the idea is like what gives this currency any value is this like backing currency and so they were backing it with luna and luna was meant to be this like it's like two they they basically created two coins the stable coin and then luna which goes which can actually go up and down in price as a stabilizing mechanism for the stable one so whatever these are some details they're not super important to the to what actually happened so but it was one guy right because i saw like he's like the founder but like there's a team right there's a it's a company okay so it's like a startup right mark zuckerberg that's this guy doe quan got it so dokwan who's dokwan he's a pretty interesting character right because he basically it's like stanford computer science uh graduates he starts working on some like mesh networking internet thing like that was his first startup and then he's like oh no crypto is like the future i'm gonna create the stablecoin project so they come out with this idea and there's basically some people are skeptical because they've seen this uh decentralized stable coin this this uncollateralized decentralized algorithmic a bunch of buzzwords but that's how you describe it stablecoin failed before there was a project like this called basis cash maybe five years ago and basis basically raised like i don't know 80 million dollars or something like that from like tier like i don't know andrews horowitz a bunch of other vcs but they didn't even launch they were like they were like oh like that we don't know if this algorithmic thing will will hold so they kind of returned 85 of the money as like a failed project um so that was like the last big version of this that had come out and then tara comes out and so tara the the difference was they were like look this works as long as there's demand for the stable coin and so they were like where's the demand come from and at first this is i guess i said it was a short versus actually the long version story but at first he came out with us with this idea that was like look we'll use it for e-commerce because in e-commerce every time there's a transaction you know there's like a three percent credit card fee basically we can do it at one percent if we use crypto and so it's like for a merchant that's like you know that's real money that you get to save if somebody uses this this at this option and what they did was they're like yo we'll pass the savings to the customer and to the merchant 50 50. and then they like went and talked to all these e-commerce companies in korea where they're from and they got like 27 large e-commerce companies including the second biggest one in in korea to use them so like imagine like the set like not amazon but like let's say ebay yeah yeah they got ebay to use it so everyone's like pretty hyped they're like oh [ __ ] this is crypto with a real real world use case finally like real world use case this is hyped on it i was hyped on it and this guy because he was on stage he's like look crypto's full of a bunch of projects that have no real world use cases and very low user bases we have like a real problem that we're solving and we're gonna and we have real user we have two million people using our payments app to do this in korea and i was like wow awesome i buy it and then things started to get a little bit where you invested can you explain you want to i started i started with 25k and then i had an opportunity to put in another 200k as part of like a bunch of vcs were buying uh luna like they invested in the company and they were they got to buy luna at basically like a 40 discount to the market rate so at the time was trading at like almost a hundred dollars we got to buy in at about just under 40 dollars uh but it was like locked up like it was gonna be released over the number of years so you did that i did that so i was like oh dude i like this project anyways if i get to buy it 50 under market like hell yeah sign me up and also like these are all like tier one like crypto investors like these they raised a billion dollars right from it from from investors so it wasn't like some random project it was like oh well these guys are smart they're doing it all right like that's that validates my my belief okay i'm gonna go ahead and do this and for a while it looked like a genius move because luna was trading at i don't know it hit like 116 dollars it was like one of the best performers last year basically how much were you up by in about a year and a half luna went from under a dollar to 116 dollars i did like 100 x in one year i was in at like the kind of like the 30 35 price point overall uh 40 of 30 or 30. no no my my price point my actual price point was like 35 dollars blended so then you were you went i was up three like 750 yeah exactly my 250 was like 750 grand i was like oh great yeah he's doing well and like this was just the start it was like it was growing really fast like not just the price but like the number of people buying the stable coin was going up like it went like i think the the the stable coin had like i don't know 18 billion dollars of tvl or something like that so it had gotten pretty big but they had i i kind of noticed i was like wait they don't talk about the e-commerce thing ever anymore and that's because kind of like didn't work like they basically it was like working slowly i think like uh merchants like kind of cared but not enough consumers didn't really change their behavior so it wasn't like a sexy growth story i don't think it was working they just stopped talking about it and they started talking about like um so what they did was they were like all right no instead we'll serve the crypto community itself with a savings rate so a savings account so basically there was a savings account on on the network that was like if you deposit your stable coin here you get paid 20 interest on your stable stable coin which is like kind of amazing right because like if i take my dollars i go to bank of america i get yeah but that sounds like some ponzi scheme [ __ ] it sounds like it right but it's not i'll tell you why so it was like bank of america gives you 0.02 percent this is giving you 20 and and so a lot of critics said exactly you said which is oh this is a ponzi and i will argue it is not a ponzi it was even better than a ponzi yes so like one up from a ponzi okay so a ponzi [ __ ] stealing basically so ponzi is customer a gives you money you use that money to pay out customer b then customer b gives you money because they have faith in it you use that money to pay out c and d so you're taking one customer's money you're paying out the other this is even better they just created a currency out of thin air printed like a billion of it then and then they just gave it away right like and like the market believes it high value so have you seen on uh what's that where they have patty just paddy's dollars on yeah paddy's bucks all of a sudden it's always sunny yeah that's exactly what happened they just created their own currency and just collected the dollars in a way that's what all currencies are right the us doll every country does this they create their own currency and you if you believe is valuable then it becomes valuable if you if you cease believing it's valuable then it devalues and we see this in different countries and that's what happened here for a while people believed it was valuable and they kept investing in it um and two things happened one was everybody knew that this 20 savings rate is not sustainable because what they were okay the the reality the joke that was my joke version of description the reality was when they raised a billion dollars from investors they basically were like look this savings rate is really good customer acquisitions it's a marketing budget just like uber subsidizes your rides like why was an uber ride back when we all started using uber like 12 when a taxi would have been 28 it's like because vcs were basically giving money and they were losing money on the rides and that's what that's what terra was doing they were losing money on this savings rate but they were getting a whole bunch of new customers so like they got like four million people almost to create wallets on the network so it was like they were buying user acquisition now you could argue that was either dumb or not done but it was definitely unsustainable and everybody kind of anybody smart knew that that's unsustainable but it's like hey look i get rewarded for being early here i'm gonna get this subsidized earnings savings rate and that'll go away as this gets more popular but like cool that's my benefit for being early that's how almost every crypto project works and um it's almost how many many startups work as well investors subsidize the usage of your free product until it's big enough where they'll start to charge or raise prices to and then to get to the kind of like get to the crash i care i care about your take on like what happened to you but to get to the crash what happened to get to the crash okay so all along the way people are like hey uh algorithm is stable coins they only work when demand keeps going up once demand starts to fall this thing will free fall so yeah you have demand right now that's why everything looks good but once this starts to fall it'll create a death spiral meaning once people stop wanting usc luna's price will go down people will start once luna's price starts going down people start selling luna and uh basically it's this like interplay between if if ust either started to d-peg meaning instead of being worth a dollar it was worth 95 cents people will not want it they'll lose confidence in the in the stable coin and as they lose confidence they'll they'll sell which will create more supply of luna which will cross the price of luna to go down and then that will cause even less confidence in the whole project and it'll just death spiral that was this is the belief and all along this guy dokwan who started off like you know seeming like this smart kind of want to change the world kind of guy he'd become like kind of an egomaniac and it was part of his persona like he was like a donald trump or elon musk style guy where if you were if you disagreed with him he didn't just say you know like i agree let's agree to disagree like he was like i will [ __ ] on you i will call you stupid and poor and like i will make fun of you is that literally what he said yeah he would call everybody stupid poor and he would basically oh my god say you're all they're all fudsters just spreading fud which is fear uncertainty and doubt you know and look they've been wrong all the way so far they're going to keep being wrong and this is exactly what elon did about people who were shorting his stock he was like oh it's going to be the short burn of the century you guys are going to look so stupid and uh and and you know people are betting against them people are betting for him so anyways yeah but he this guy forgot like the thing to make this work is you have to be right exactly and he was right for a while until and and by the way it's really funny there's one twitter account that wasn't just saying hey this ain't gonna work he's like specifically laid out a like 15 step plan of like hey look i did the math if somebody was motivated and had a billion dollars they could destroy tarot which is currently worth 40 billion dollars so they could if you put up if you had a billion dollars of cell pressure i think you could crack the whole tara project uh it would have to be like a smart focused person who would have to time it right so and that's ex and basically he he he retweeted that was like this is like famous last word so he goes man this is the most r word uh thing i've ever read on twitter um well billionaires if you wait he said [ __ ] yeah uh really yeah what a dumb idiot why would he do that would you call him a dumb idiot well like but like why would you dumb idiot would do such name calling how can you how could you speak like that when you're like this like uh like a ceo of like a that's just like donald trump called mexicans rapists and stuff dude this is like crazy like people are crazy they do crazy [ __ ] and then they're basically their fans in his case we call lunatics we're like yeah and then like they thought that was cool well i don't know if they thought that specific wording was cool but in general his character i mean he renamed himself stable quan he became a billionaire he like got a million twitter followers because he became a cult of personality similar to god what an idiot though so anyways he tweets and he's really an idiot because he go he said this is the most awkward thing i've read on on twitter all week um and he goes billionaires who follow me go like um please go ahead and try this um and like sure enough like two weeks later or a week later it's like and try it they did so basically somebody or some group it's not confirmed who it is uh it's not confirmed also that there's a coordinated attack but it does seem like it people started uh somebody started dumping like a billion dollars worth of the stable coin which caused the peg to go down right when you have that much cell pressure it won't stay worth a dollar it still slipped to 92 cents and then it's and then on on top of that they were also dumping bitcoin which was the reserve collateral that these guys are holding so bitcoin's price starts to go down ust starts to break peg people start to panic a little bit and they also started withdrawing from so they did three things they took it out of anchor the savings protocol so you saw a billion dollars worth or whatever like withdrawals then you saw them sell it then you saw bitcoin price tanking and all of a sudden people started getting a little worried about oh [ __ ] is something bad happening to tara let me just go ahead and sell so more people start to sell and so you see like three four five billion dollars of sales happening in a very short period of time and this also coincidentally or very planned happened right when they were doing like a kind of like imagine you're like oh i'm just i'm moving houses right now i was like oh man the doors are open huh because you're the moving trucks outside so the doors are open that's basically what happened they were moving all the liquidity from the liquidity pool from one to another and so there wasn't much there was less shock absorbers than than you would expect when they started to sell it went from 100 over 100 to what what's it at now less than a penny like fractions of what yeah okay so how much value was wiped out 40 something billion dollars 48 billion that is crazy that is the stable coin went from selling so that's luna tara the stable coin the ust was selling at you know it's a dollar supposed to always be a dollar it goes 92 cents 85 cents so i'm i'm on the beach in hawaii and i'm just getting texts from ben yo tara's de-pegging um and it's like and then it goes down to 70 cents then it shoots back up to 90 giving false hope for a second and then it plunges to 65 60 50 and i think it's currently trading i don't know 15 cents to the dollar so you're you're you're out 250. i'm about two yeah 225 something like that how does that feel i mean it feels shitty of course right like you know what did your wife say wait when you're sitting in hold on she doesn't really care to know nor does she like want to know the details i told her well from all of crypto i was like we lost several million million dollars in the last like three months because crypto has just been selling off like crazy and she's like okay so like i shouldn't buy this bag or i should i was like i think it's a shouldn't right now let's go ahead and hold off on that i was like that's the level of conversation we've had uh about the whole thing like she's not she's she stresses about micro stuff like if we have like a late fee or a parking ticket she'll freak out but on the big thing she's like very chill she's like but how do you feel about that now now that you've lost you said something let's just say three million dollars like i guess a couple feelings the first was i'm not surprised like we went in pretty eyes wide open which was this is a risk-reward type bet and you don't just say that you have to like actually know what is the risk and the risk was always nobody's ever made an algorithm stable coin work and by the way the spoil one spoiler uh this guy doe quan turns out he was also the anonymous co-founder of basis that got leaked as well so it's like dude you know fool us all once you know shame on you fools twice what the hell is wrong with you that's my take on it did he did he tweet out like i'm i'm sorry i'm a dick or like he's like look we didn't mean for this to happen obviously like i have no because some people are like dude did you did you benefit from this in some way like because that happens at crypto people like raise much money do much stuff and then like run away with the money his claim is no we didn't like we lost more than anyone on this whole thing uh i feel really bad that this happened and he's kind of just like you know tail between his legs a little bit and he's sulking and he's quieter he's much quieter now while everybody's like dancing on his grave deservedly so because he was cocky as hell right so like that's what's going on with him with me it's sort of like all right lost this money that's not good obviously but like you know it doesn't feel good it's sort of jarring like i've had startup investments go south but it kind of happens over a longer period of time this is like you wake up on tuesday and like one of your best performing investments has gone to zero in 24 hours it's quite jarring to watch the price drop like a knife um and be pretty helpless like there's nothing you could really do about it partially because my lunar tokens were locked up and partially because i was away from my computer uh you know so you know whatever but you're you're not i would like i mean i would lose sleep over that i would be like almost almost not not quite scarred but like a little bit like it would almost be a it would be close to where i would describe it as traumatic yeah it's not that um for me and again i think it's because i i mean i write down whenever i do an investment here's my here's why i think there's a good investment and here's what could go wrong and then what could go wrong was exactly this which is like people think that there could be if if there was a bank run that this would debt spiral i see no reason that this wouldn't despise if there's a bank run i don't know what would cause a bank run but it's possible and it's like oh what would cause a bank run was like either a motivated player created panic at a time when the project was vulnerable because all the all markets stock markets crypto markets are all down and they were moving the liquidity right so it's like well the risk kind of played out like that's okay like it's like you know it's like i've had pocket aces get cracked before and i i wouldn't even call luna pocket aces it's like i had a flush draw that got beat okay you know like to use poker terms i got a flush i got beat like that's what happens even if i was a even if i had a 60 chance of winning okay i got my money in good but like it wasn't my life savings now there's a lot of people who lost a lot more money on this because they put in a lot of money so to me there's also like a post-mortem of like okay there's some rules like you you don't put more than you know 15 in any one project because all of them have these like black swan risks and so you never want to be that vulnerable to any one thing is the majority of your net worth in crypto right now uh it was not until like everything cutting yeah not not including private like not including private businesses no of the liquid stuff no it's a little less than half now it's a little more than half before so you know but like the stock market also hasn't done great i don't know i haven't really dude i've lost so much i don't log into my thing anymore i i just i don't even look at it yeah for me i'm not going to do it i'm not going to go trade right now so you know for mental health purposes i don't go calculate my net worth when it's when it's so far down you know there is a good forcing function i'm like all right great let me make sure i'm earning money i'm working hard right like it's very easy when when like over the last year a year and a half let's say since the kind of covid uh you know money printing system i mean the whole 10 years has been a bull run or whatever but like the last year and a half like [ __ ] just inflated like crazy so it was like uh man do i even need to work like i just look up every day and i made a whole year's salary in a day like you know it's kind of demotivating to work and then this is highly motivating to work when you start losing a year's salary per day you know like that starts to uh you know like add up and so yeah i don't know like that's i guess my full reaction to it me too that's exactly mine as well it's like you just just make more money yeah [Music] you

[Music] the best way i can describe this thing is it's like harlem globetrotters but for baseball and so the story behind this is basically um so there's this guy named jesse cole and he was an amateur baseball player and he got hurt and he was like well what the heck what am i going to do now and there's i actually don't know which league this is but it's a minor league baseball league it's called i think it's called the coastal plains league is that what it is that's right and i i actually don't know entirely what that is i guess is it like a minor minor league or a proper minor league i don't know i don't know so but anyway so it has quote professional baseball players but i don't think they make a lot of money and he bought this team and by bought savannah georgia had a has a minor league team and it wasn't doing so well and they're like jesse do you just want this just like figure out how to make it work and we'll just pay you or you could just you know pay us back when he starts making a little bit of money all right so um anyway uh so they savannah georgia they had a minor league baseball team they gave it to this guy jesse cole he bought it but it was like so little money that he like overdrafted his bank account which for by like a couple thousand dollars so he didn't have any startup money his wife helped him do it and then the team said like you know he's like how many great how many people like come to uh come to the games they're like i don't know like 100 or 200 sometimes it's picking up and he's like oh [ __ ] what did i get myself into yeah and they give him this stadium and it's completely empty and he's like what do i do with the stadium how do i get people to come he didn't know anything and so he goes you know what screw it we're gonna make this one thing we're gonna do one thing which is make baseball fun and he has like this naming ceremony and they're like well what are you gonna name it like the savannah like you know trojans or something and he's like no no no everyone this is i want to introduce you guys to the savannah bananas and it's like a hilarious uh mascot of just a banana and they're like wait what's going on he's like no no so what we're gonna do is we're gonna have fun and so what they do basically is they have normal games in the league where they actually are like trying to win and like doing real stuff but at the league even at those games what they do is like the players will introduce themselves or like the umpire and there's like crazy videos on tick tock the umpire when he goes down to sweep the uh batter's box he like drops down low and they play like get low by little john and it's just like hilarious they have male cheerleaders they do like trick plays they have like choreographed dances that the players do in between innings they have like um instead of like a like a hot like hot dance team they have like a grandmother's dance team so all the the dancers are really old and move really slow and stuff like that and then even other things at the game so he he said he goes but i got this team and he's just a baseball player right he's like he goes i just realized like um i don't know anything about how i'm gonna like make this work but i just put it all on the line like they basically sold their home overdrafted their accounts and like they went all in on this and he's like so i read every walt disney book and pt barnum book for inspiration and i realized it's not about baseball it's about entertainment and he's like so i'm gonna yeah like we're we're not here to be the most winningest minor league baseball team we're here to have the most fun and create the most fun environment that people are going to want to feel like they belong to so he's like you know what are the things i hate about a baseball game i'm gonna do the exact opposite oh i hate that there's just ads everywhere in the stadium okay i'm gonna rip all those down and we're gonna put funny things up instead because i hate um that like you know just buying like a beer is like 14 you just feel like you're getting gouged so they switch their ticket prices to be all-inclusive so you buy ticket unlimited you know food and drink or whatever it is i don't know how they do that with alcohol but like that's what he says all inclusive tickets and then they you know instead of you know a baseball's really slow so they're like it's a two-hour like limit basically to these games and like there's no like we don't walk up to the mound and talk to the pitcher for like five minutes uh there's no bunts there's no and they did all these things to speed up the game and make it more fun and entertaining and then they also have like the normal game so they play in the league and coincidentally in that league you know they won the championship so they went from actually being the worst team to the most winning team ted lasso [ __ ] yeah so it worked but then they do this other thing called banana ball so like in between the normal games they like continue hiring the team throughout the offseason and they travel from city to city and they also host this at their own league or at their own stadium and they have this thing called banana ball which means there's no buns no visits to the mound a two-hour limit if someone in the stands catches a foul ball the batter is still out well there's like a video that's like someone comes to bat they're on stilts yeah and then they throw out the first [ __ ] some kid comes out and throws a banana right like everything is gimmicked and their social media uh by the way they have four thousand people that comes to every game look at the tick tocks that i posted up there did you watch them they're hilarious i've been seeing these over the like last year or so like the the pitcher does like a funny dance basically before he throws the pitch and it's just like it's just so likeable like that's the best way i could describe it is it's so likeable you you see it you're like i wanna i wish i was there i wish i was having as much fun as those guys are having and um and like i love that they don't take this too seriously and boring the way that it's so counter to everything everything else you'll see in sports yeah it doesn't like the bar the discipline bar isn't exactly like really high you know like with wrestling you have to diet and like take it seriously with baseball not really as much and so this team it's hilarious and i think it's a good business i read somewhere it was doing like six or seven million in sales but i could actually see this becoming i don't know if it's never gonna be like huge huge like multi-billion but i think this would be a sick thing to own [Music] you

he said that he was selling a hundred million dollars of liver supplements so basically these pills where it's like instead of like eating liver just swallow this pill right and i looked it up on amazon and i did a bunch of research and i think it's true i think it's 100 true i think that's how much he's selling in in these amazon uh supplements all right so so we're doing something so the the contest is this so you go to our youtube you find our full videos and you chop them up into little like 10 15 20 second clips whatever you want and you post it on social media tic tacs the best one but and you use the hashtag uh mfmclips that's mfmclips with an s and you just use that hashtag and we'll find you but basically the people who make the best videos typically the best video means the ones with the most views but last time we actually gave it to someone who had the most views and then another person who had just cool videos anyway you may turn these episodes into small clips use that hashtag and we'll give you five grand based off of quote the best ones and we're just gonna pick what we think is the best last time i think did we give it to two people or three people last time i think two at least two people won last time and it was a win-win right like their channel blew up they had like hundreds of thousands of views on individual videos i think someone hit a million uh and they won free money so that's good and the guy who won or i don't know he was one of the guys who won he built a business around this that's now doing a million a year in sales or north of a million years like it's doing like 80 000 a month yeah and he came full circle he emailed me the other day being like hey i think i could help drive some growth to your other to milk road um would you like to pay for this service and i was like honestly yeah i would i would like to pay for the service like good on you for turning this i find like this need that we had as a need everybody has which is hey we make a bunch of good content can you chop it up package it up find the good bits and get help them you know see the light of day so that we get more exposure yeah so it's a good idea for everyone to so that's why you guys should do it so there's details on mfmpod.com clips or if you just go to mfmpod.com you'll see the details but it's really simple just chop up our clips or chop up our videos that you see on youtube use the mfm clips on pretty much anything any social media site but honestly just use tic tac it's the easiest one to go viral on but if you use it there we'll find you and then we're going to dm you based if based on if we'd like it and we'll give you five thousand dollars very simple so sean what's up dude long time no see i missed you i know uh dude i feel like i wrote down so many topics while you were gone and two things happen number one i kind of forgot why i was interested in half of them so i'm like i don't even know what this note means at this point like which just shows me that this podcast is not just for the audience it's for me to be able to just get these ideas out of my system and have this constant muscle of uh of seeing opportunity seeing ideas and if i don't have this outlet those just kind of go nowhere and then they just sort of like that muscle starts to die uh so i felt the atrophy the second thing is out of all these topics that i've been saving up i'm like dude when sam comes back i got ammo i got stockpiles of ammo you know like when you came back it was like you know the prepper i was a prepper of ideas and i just had this whole like you know underground bunker full of them and then you sent me this thing about the savannah bananas and i can't think about anything else i only want to talk about this this is the only it is the only topic i'm interested in so please introduce this and let's talk about this i don't want to hear about your trip i don't hear about your family i don't hear nothing only savannah bananas that's a this is a topic that i i did the same thing so i took like a two week vacation you took a one week vacation while i was on vacation i saw this video and i wrote it down i was like i have to talk to sean about this the best way i can describe this thing is it's like harlem globetrotters but for baseball and so the story behind this is basically um so there's this guy named jesse cole and he was an amateur baseball player and he got hurt and he was like well what the heck what am i going to do now and there's i actually don't know which league this is but it's a minor league baseball league it's called i think it's called the coastal plains league is that what it is that's right and i i actually don't know entirely what that is i guess is it like a minor minor league or a proper minor league i don't know i don't know so but anyway so it has quote professional baseball players but i don't think they make a lot of money and he bought this team and by bought savannah georgia had a has a minor league team and it wasn't doing so well and they're like jesse do you just want this just like figure out how to make it work and we'll just pay you or you could just you know pay us back when he starts making a little bit of money all right so um anyway uh so they savannah georgia they had a minor league baseball team they gave it to this guy jesse cole he bought it but it was like so little money that he like overdrafted his bank account which for by like a couple thousand dollars so he didn't have any startup money his wife helped him do it and then the team said like you know how he's like how many great how many people like come to uh come to the games they're like i don't know like 100 200 sometimes it's picking up and he's like oh [ __ ] what did i get myself into yeah and they give him this stadium and it's completely empty and he's like what do i do with the stadium how do i get people to come he didn't know anything and so he goes you know what screw it we're gonna make this one thing we're gonna do one thing which is make baseball fun and he has like this naming ceremony and they're like well what are you gonna name it like the savannah like you know trojans or something and he's like no no no no everyone this is i want to introduce you guys to the savannah bananas and it's like a hilarious uh mascot of just a banana and they're like wait what's going on he's like no no so what we're gonna do is we're gonna have fun and so what they do basically is they have normal games in the league where they actually are like trying to win and like doing real stuff but at the league even at those games what they do is like the players will introduce themselves or like the umpire and there's like crazy videos on tick tock the umpire when he goes down to sweep the uh batter's box he like drops down low and they play like get low by little john and it's just like hilarious they have male cheerleaders they do like trick plays they have like choreographed dances that the players do in between innings they have like um instead of like a like a hot like hot dance team they have like a grandmother's dance team so all the the dancers are really old and move really slow and stuff like that and then even other things at the game so he he said he goes but i got this team and he's just a baseball player right he's like i use it he goes i just realized like um i don't know anything about how i'm gonna like make this work but i just put it all on the line like they basically sold their home overdrafted their accounts and like they went all in on this and he's like so i've read every walt disney book and pt barnum book for inspiration and i realize it's not about baseball it's about entertainment and he's like so i'm gonna yeah like we're not here to be the most winningest minor league baseball team we're here to have the most fun and create the most fun environment that people are going to want to feel like they belong to and so he's like you know what are the things i hate about a baseball game i'm going to do the exact opposite oh i hate that there's just ads everywhere in the stadium okay i'm going to rip all those down and we're going to put funny things up instead because i hate um that like you know just buying like a beer is like 14 you just feel like you're getting gouged so they switch their ticket prices to be all inclusive so you buy ticket unlimited you know food and drink or whatever it is i don't know how they do that alcohol but like that's what he says all inclusive tickets and then they you know instead of you know a baseball's really slow so they're like it's a two-hour like limit basically to these games and like there's no like we don't walk up to the mound and talk to the pitcher for like five minutes uh there's no bunts there's no and they did all these things to speed up the game and make it more fun and entertaining and then they also have like the normal game so they play in the league and coincidentally in that league you know they won the championship so they went from actually being the worst team to the most winning team ted lasso [ __ ] yeah so it worked but then they do this other thing called banana ball so like in between the normal games they like continue hiring the team throughout the off season and they travel from city to city and they also host this at their own league or at their own stadium and they have this thing called banana ball which means there's no bunts no visits to the mound a two-hour limit if someone in the stands catches a foul ball the batter is still out well there's like a video that's like someone comes to bat they're on stilts yeah and then throwing out the first pitch some kid comes out and throws a banana right like everything is gimmicked and their social media uh by the way they have 4 000 people that comes to every game look at the tick tocks that i posted up there did you watch them they're hilarious i've been seeing these over the like the last year or so like the the pitcher does like a funny dance basically before he throws the pitch and it's just like it's just so likeable like this the best way i can describe it is it's so likeable you you see it you're like i wanna i wish i was there i wish i was having as much fun as those guys are having and um and like i love that they don't take this too seriously and boring the way that it's so counter to everything everything else you'll see in sports did you see uh did you ever know any baseball bros in college like they're always like fun-loving like sometimes like hardcore bros like cut off t-shirts and dip all the time and they're kind of like fun to make fun of because they're bros but they're typically like really really nice and very fun-loving they're the real estate guys of of college in the sense that they're they're successful but they're the dumbest group of the jocks like you know i think it's like if you meet i don't know like i don't know who might be dumber but maybe it's like i don't know like the the the wrestling team or something i don't know no way because the reason why is with baseball like you don't have to be in that good of shape to be awesome at it until like standing and so yeah what you get really good at is killing time because baseball's so boring so you're sitting in a dugout with your boys or you're out in the field by yourself trying to amuse yourself while the ball does not come to you so that breeds a very uh self-amusing type of person which is awesome yeah it doesn't like the bar the discipline bar isn't exactly like really high you know like with wrestling you have to diet and like take it seriously with baseball not really as much and so this team it's hilarious and i think it's a good business i read somewhere it was doing like six or seven million in sales but i could actually see this becoming i don't know if it's never gonna be like huge huge like multi-billion but i think this would be a sick thing to own i mean it's like it's like it's probably like what people thought about wcw or uh what's the wrestling thing called wwe wwe where it was like a joke at first and they're like i don't know man this is pretty fun and like we're getting into it so it's kind of like that well i would say this is uh to use the alex hormazi thing he said on the pod which was like this is a level two opportunity but with done with like level 14 execution right like this is the best execution and kind of a pretty crappy capped opportunity as to how big something could be like he's built like if he just did this brand if you put this level of enthusiasm and branding into like a d2c product or a media company or like a casino or like you know there were such bigger opportunities and so you know this if this person ever decided to do something else you know shut up and take my money but like for now it's just like i'm glad that this is successful i'm glad that this exists this is very inspiring i sent this to our team and i was like this is the level this is what level 12 looks like if you want to like kick ass with like uh thinking outside the box and building an epic brand speaking of level 12 and ddc dude your interview with moyes was really good i i listened to it a couple times what does he like he's very open that's the best part he typically isn't that open like and and frankly i don't think he i almost think he was too open but like he kind of like made himself a target i think because he's quite wealthy and he basically you asked him a question that we have to ask people all the time you just said so what do you do with your money and that's what you said and he goes well i've got a 50 million just sitting in short-term bonds i've got 10 million in real estate and i basically sat home during the pandemic because i couldn't travel and i went to my mom and dad's house and just bought real estate online and he just explained all this stuff and i was like oh man that is so sick that you're ex you're telling people that i knew it was good because it's supposed to be an hour and we went like an hour 45 which is like at that point it's not even called like going over slightly over going over time it's like no you you just did a separate second podcast at the same time like i just kept going because i was like i really am interested in what this guy has to say no he was good what was your favorite part um mine was okay so the money part i think was definitely interesting the part that's like i said this on the thing which is he's like i i gave him this nickname of bare metal which is like he does business and entrepreneurship in a way that is like completely to me unnecessary but also awesome like i would not want to do it that way myself but i love how hardcore he is about like he wants to be so close to the action he just wants action and he wants to be not just have action like i like action but i like action i like to sit in the press box and watch the action from the comfort of my seat you know and then you know be able to like you know head out early before the traffic hits whereas he's like i'm going to do this he's like i don't just want to buy real estate i want to buy real estate from a foreclosing auction where there's no pictures on the website and then i want to have to take like you know those whatever those giant scissor player things are called and go snap the lock off the door and then go in and see what i got and then i'm gonna like try to flip this thing and i'm gonna take so much pride in like this being you know an extra five thousand dollars a month of like income and i'm gonna do that 42 times this year because that's where the opportunity is i'm like holy [ __ ] and like i'm not gonna do a broker i'm gonna get my own broker's license and i'm you know he he was just so like unnecessarily hardcore about it that it was awesome to me he also said he said like i did customer service until we were at 25 million dollars in sales and i had the most i answered the most customer support tickets of anyone at the company well yeah yeah he said he goes i did i was the only service person until we were at i think it was a lower number it's like quarter million a month which is like you know whatever uh a few million dollars a year in revenue but then he says even at 25 million even now or something like that he's like before i left i was still probably the number one agent meaning like i don't know if you ever use the gorgeous like help desk system but like yeah everybody's a different agent you could just see the stats on who's closing a bunch of tickets and it's like that to me is insane like i have a d2c business uh you know way smaller than that and i i don't know if i've ever answered customers i think the first like three months i did some customer service from my phone um and then like that was it and even now like i haven't logged into the system i have really no idea what's going on but that's also why he's he him and why i'm me like one time he uh that's why he's successful and i'm happy one time at the beginning of the pandemic he was like hey you want to go buy some credit card debt with me and he'd like i don't know i didn't even like get into it without that answer was just like yeah my answer was like absolutely not i'm no why of course not and he's like yeah but we get a 20 yield and like i already like know how to do it and i'm like dude i just don't even want to like explore that i don't even know anything about that and he was like all right well i'm gonna go buy this you know i forget but like millions of dollars of credit card debt and we're gonna it was just crazy that he was saying that i'm pretty sure they own he owns like a hundred single family homes which if you talk to any a lot of people in real estate they would say like single family homes that's just it's not economical it's not an interesting thing you always should do a bigger so you get bigger apartments you get economies of scale and he totally does like the most hardcore thing there is yeah and i think the way they bought those was like during the 2008 2009 like crash uh when like you know there's the subprime you know mortgage crisis people couldn't afford their homes basically so homes were getting foreclosed on or whatever i think what they did was they just drove into a neighborhood and they just walked like door to door and i think it was like oh this house is for sale we'll buy this one and then the next one hey are you moving out would you sell the yeah and so they bought them all it's almost like a multi-family complex it's like i think they bought like 25 that were in the same neighborhood or something like that and they did it that's like it was like their dad and then the two brothers and they just like just like walked around and bought a bunch of homes in one summer which is like you know the best family bonding that you could think of one time i was like moyes why are you like buying these single family homes and why are you selling deodorant why don't you do software or something that's better like in easier and he goes i'm i'm a merchant that's all i know he goes all i know is he said he's a merchant and i think of like my grandfather's grandfather was a merchant i think of like a guy from like the bible who like brings jesus like murr he's like a merchant you know and he's like i'm a merchant this is what i do so anyway i thought that podcast was really good uh that was that was great yeah he's amazing he's really he's really interesting and he doesn't like hold back which i think is like just makes him very entertaining too right like i told him this echo your brother's one of my best friends i think he's you know he might be smarter and better than you at business but you're a way better podcast guess because you're gonna like he's like he wants to mix it up and he wants to he says his opinions and he doesn't see why he shouldn't be saying his opinions and i love that because like in a world full of kind of like cowardly kind of people where it's like fear-based uh it's really nice to see somebody who's not afraid to just say what they think and what they do and be like yeah you can make fun of me if you think and sure some of the things i do are stupid but like okay and did you um did you talk about luna yet uh no i don't think so i don't think i've done a podcast i was in hawaii when it happened i was like on a beach and then uh like luna crashed and i was like which is like literally zero and i was like oh man and like for a day or two i just like um like like kind of [ __ ] up my vacation in a way but not because i was like doing something like i didn't even have access to my like my wallets not just like on in the cloud so like i just wasn't home i couldn't even sell if i wanted to i couldn't do anything really um and then i didn't even want to be doing something i was like i want to be enjoying this vacation you know you tell me what happened can you tell me like you had told me you're like luna's kind of cool and you're you told me like six or eight weeks ago yeah actually so i did something cool too in the last few days you'll see it come out i i i went really over the top with a piece of content i haven't done this since i did that clubhouse thread that was extremely over the top but i was like i kind of find this entertaining and this might hit and the clubhouse one like really hit hit like i don't know like 20 million people saw that thing i did that again with the luna stuff where i recorded i basically am creating like a um almost like a john oliver style show you know his show last week tonight or whatever where he just kind of like dismantles one topic for like 15 minutes and it's like but it's peppered with jokes i did that on the lunar thing so that's going to come out last day or two but that was a very fun exercise to try to like so tell me well actually try to be funny but the story is i guess for those who don't know okay so um here's the short ver here's the short version of the story short version of the story is you have bitcoin gets big has this like anonymous creator and it's supposed to do like one thing really well which is like basically this like digital gold and then you have ethereum gets really big and it's got this guy vitalik he becomes the next cult hero first it was satoshi for bitcoin then it becomes metallic and metallic solves a major problem with bitcoin which is that he makes it programmable and ethereum takes off and ethereum's more programmable form of money but both bitcoin and ethereum have like one major problem which is that they're not very good as actual currencies right they're called cryptocurrencies but you don't use them as a day-to-day currency you don't use them to go buy stuff and this is for like a variety of reasons right like bitcoin if you try to spend it you'll get taxed as if you just sold a home every time you do a transaction and then the merchant doesn't want it because they're like oh [ __ ] what tomorrow this is going to go down 20 price like dude i'm not trying to invest i just need money to pay for tomorrow's inventory like i don't want to take this in my coffee shop and so it's not really you those aren't really you so basically there's this idea of creating stable coins there's a coin that's always going to be worth one dollar and like this is the spoiler it's like you know you don't want it to not be worth one dollar which is what happened with with the tarot project but like um you know it's supposed to be worth one dollar so the way that most people did it the big ones usdc tether those are the two big ones they're like it's basically like um like a safety deposit box you give them a real dollar they'll give you a digital dollar and if you ever want a real dollar back they're like i promise it's in the bank vault whenever you need it come back and redeem it and um and those kind of have some controversy because crypto people don't like it because it's like well how do i know you're not lying like how do i know you didn't just take all that money in the bank vault and go spend it or invest it in some risky way and that's why people think tether did uh does and um and also they're like dude what if the government just cracks down this one company like they could just like they have to operate in some country yeah like it's centralized the whole it's yeah centralized this decentralization thing isn't real so at that point so okay so that's the pro so the pro argument for this project that came out that's the project's called tarot and one of the currencies called luna so the idea was we need a decentralized stable coin we really decentralized does that mean that one person invented tara and then another person invented luna using terrorist technology no no terror is like the name of the company terraform labs it's like a group of people who came together said we're going to create a stable coin and then the stable coin one of them like it's called ust so you think about it like the us dollar version of tara ust and so that was their stable coin that's the thing that's always supposed to be one dollar luna is the tote like luna's the thing that backs it okay so remember i said like the in the other version what backs the digital dollar it's a real dollar in a bank account and the way that the us dollar used to work was what backs the us dollar gold and fort knox right and that was before we got off the gold standard but the idea is like what gives this currency any value is this like backing currency and so they were backing it with luna and luna was meant to be this like it's like two they basically created two coins the stable coin and then luna which goes which can actually go up and down in price as a stabilizing mechanism for the stable one so whatever these are some details they're not super important to the to what actually happened so but it was one guy right because i saw like the founder but like there's a team right there it's a company okay so it's like a startup right mark zuckerberg that's this guy doe quan got it so dokwan who's do quan he's a pretty interesting character right because he basically it's like stanford computer science uh graduates he starts working on some like mesh networking internet thing like that was his first startup and then he's like oh no crypto is like the future i'm gonna create the stablecoin project so they come out with this idea and there's basically some people are skeptical because they've seen this uh decentralized stablecoin this this uncollateralized decentralized algorithmic a bunch of buzzwords but that's how you describe it stable coin failed before there was a project like this called basis cash maybe five years ago and basis basically raised like i don't know 80 million dollars or something like that from like tier like i don't know andrews and horowitz and a bunch of other vcs but they didn't even launch they were like they were like oh like that we don't know if this algorithmic thing will will hold so they kind of returned 85 of the money as like a failed project um so that was like the last big version of this that had come out and then terror comes out and so tara the the difference was they were like look this works as long as there's demand for the stable coin and so they're like where's the demand come from and at first this i guess i said it was a short versus actually the long version story but at first he came out with us with this idea that was like look we'll use it for e-commerce because in e-commerce every time there's a transaction you know there's like a three percent credit card fee basically we can do it at one percent if we use crypto and so it's like for a merchant that's like you know that's real money that you get to save if somebody uses this this at this option and what they did was they're like yo we'll pass the savings to the customer and to the merchant 50 50. and then they like went and talked to all these ecommerce companies in korea where they're from and they got like 27 large e-commerce companies including the second biggest one in in korea to use them so like imagine like the the like not amazon but like let's say ebay yeah they got ebay to use it so everyone's like pretty hyped they're like oh [ __ ] this is crypto with a real world real world use case finally like real world use case this is hyped on it i was hyped on it and this guy because he was on stage he's like look crypto's full of a bunch of projects that have no real world use cases and very low user bases we have like a real problem that we're solving and we're gonna and we have real users we have two million people using our payments app to do this in korea and i was like wow awesome i buy it and then things started to get a little much invested can you explain yourself i started i started with 25k and then i had an opportunity to put in another 200k as part of like a bunch of vcs were buying uh luna like they invested in the company and they were they got to buy luna at basically like a 40 discount to the market rate so at the time was trading at like almost 100 we got to buy in at about just under 40. uh but it was like locked up like it was going to be released over the number of years so you did that i did that so i was like oh dude i like this project anyways if i get to buy it 50 under market like hell yeah sign me up and also like these are all like tier one like crypto investors like these they raised a billion dollars right from it from from investors so it wasn't like some random project it was like oh well these guys are smart they're doing it all right like that's that validates my my belief okay i'm gonna go ahead and and do this and for a while it looked like a genius move because luna was trading at i don't know it hit like 116 it was like one of the best performers last year basically how much were you up by in about a year and a half luna went from under a dollar to 116 dollars it did like 100 x in one year i was in at like the kind of like the 30 35 price point overall 40 of 30 or 30. no no my my price point my actual price point was like 35 dollars blended so then you were you went i was up through like 750. yeah exactly my 250 was like 750 grand i was like oh great yeah it's doing well and like this was just the start it was like it was growing really fast like not just the price but like the number of people buying the stablecoin was going up like it went like i think the the stablecoin had like 18 billion dollars of tvl or something like that so it had gotten pretty big but they had i i kind of noticed i was like wait they don't talk about the e-commerce thing ever anymore and that's because kind of like didn't work like they basically it was like working slowly i think like uh merchants like kind of cared but not enough consumers didn't really change their behavior so it wasn't like a sexy growth story i don't think it was working they just stopped talking about it and they started talking about like um so what they did was they were like all right now instead we'll serve the crypto community itself with a savings rate so a savings account so basically there was a savings account on on the network that was like if you deposit your stable coin here you get paid 20 interest on your stable stable coin which is like kind of amazing right because like if i take my dollars i go to bank of america i get yeah but that sounds like some ponzi scheme [ __ ] it sounds like it right but it's not i'll tell you why so it was like bank of america gives you 0.02 this is giving you 20 and and so a lot of critics said exactly you said which is oh this is a ponzi and i will argue it is not a ponzi it was even better than a ponzi yes so like what's one up from a ponzi okay so a ponzi [ __ ] stealing basically so ponzi is customer a gives you money you use that money to pay out customer b then customer b gives you money because they have faith in it you use that money you pay out c and d so you're taking one customer's money you're paying out the other this was even better they just created a currency out of thin air printed like a billion of it then and then they just gave it away right like and like the market believes they have value so have you seen on uh what's that where they have patty just paddy's dollars on yeah paddy's bucks and all of a sudden paddy's bucks it's always sunny yeah that's exactly what happened they just created their own currency and just collected the dollars in a way that's what all currencies are right the us doll every country does this they create their own currency and you if you believe is valuable then it becomes valuable if you if you cease believing it's valuable then it devalues and we see this in different countries and that's what happened here for a while people believed it was valuable and they kept investing in it um and two things happened one was everybody knew that this 20 savings rates not sustainable because what they were okay the the reality the joke that was my joke version of description the reality was when they raised the billion dollars from investors they basically were like look this savings rate is really good customer acquisitions it's a marketing budget just like uber subsidizes your rides like why was an uber ride back when we all started using uber like 12 when a taxi would have been 28 it's like because vcs were basically giving money and they were losing money on the rides and that's what that's what era was doing they were losing money on this savings rate but they were getting a whole bunch of new customers so like they got like four million people almost to create wallets on the network so it was like they were buying user acquisition now you could argue that was either dumb or not done but it was definitely unsustainable and everybody kind of anybody smart knew that that's unsustainable but it's like hey look i get rewarded for being early here i'm gonna get this subsidized earnings savings rate and that'll go away as this gets more popular but like cool that's my benefit for being early that's how almost every crypto project works and um it's almost how many many startups work as well investors subsidize the usage of your free product until it's big enough where they'll start to charge or raise prices and then to get to the kind of like get to the crash i care i care about your take on like what happened to you but to get to the crash what happened to get to the crash okay so all along the way people are like hey uh algorithm is stable coins they only work when demand keeps going up once demand starts to fall this thing will free fall so yeah you have demand right now that's why everything looks good but once this starts to fall it'll create a death spiral meaning once people stop wanting usc luna's price will go down people will start once luna's price goes starts going down people start selling luna and uh basically it was this like interplay between if if ust either started to dpeg meaning instead of being worth a dollar it was worth 95 cents people will not want it they'll lose confidence in the in the stable coin and then as they lose confidence they'll they'll sell which will create more supply of luna which will cause the price of luna to go down and then that will cause even less confidence in the whole project and it'll just death spiral this is the belief and all along this guy dokwan who started off like you know seeming like this smart kind of want to change the world kind of guy he'd become like kind of an egomaniac and it was part of his persona like he was like a donald trump or elon musk style guy where if you were if you disagreed with him he didn't just say you know like i agree let's agree to disagree like he was like i will [ __ ] on you i will call you stupid and poor and like i will make fun of you is that literally what he said yeah he would call everybody stupid poor and he would basically oh my god say you're all they're all fudsters just spreading fud which is fear uncertainty and doubt you know and look they've been wrong all all the way so far they're going to keep being wrong and this is exactly what elon did about people who were shorting his stock he was like oh it's going to be the short burn of the century you guys are gonna look so stupid and uh and and you know people are betting against them people betting for them so anyways yeah but this guy forgot like the thing to make this work is you have to be right exactly and he was right for a while until and and by the way it's really funny there's one twitter account that wasn't just saying hey this ain't gonna work he's like specifically laid out a like 15-step plan of like hey look i did the math if somebody was motivated and had a billion dollars they could destroy tara which is currently worth 40 billion so they could if you put up if you had a billion dollars of cell pressure i think you could crack the whole tara project uh it would have to be like a smart focused person who would have to time it right so and that's ex and basically he he retweeted that was like this is like famous last words so he goes man this is the most r word uh thing i've ever read on twitter um well billionaires if you wait he said [ __ ] yeah uh really yeah what a dumb idiot why would he do that would you call him a dumb idiot well like but like why would you kind of a dumb idiot would do such name-calling how can you how can you speak like that when you're like this like uh like a ceo of like donald trump called mexicans rapists and stuff dude this is like crazy like people are crazy they do crazy [ __ ] and then they're basically their fans in his case we're called lunatics we're like yeah and then like they thought that was cool well i don't know if they thought that specific wording was cool but in general his character i mean he renamed himself stable quan he became a billionaire he like got a million twitter followers because he became a cult of personality similarly what an idiot though so anyways he tweets and he's really an idiot because he go he said this is the most word thing i've read on on twitter all week um and he goes billionaires who follow me go like um please go ahead and try this um and like sure enough like two weeks later or a week later it's like and try it they did so basically somebody or some group it's not confirmed who it is uh it's not confirmed also that there's a coordinate attack but it does seem like it people started uh somebody started dumping like a billion dollars worth of the stable coin which caused the peg to go down right when you have that much cell pressure it won't stay worth a dollar it still slipped to 92 cents and then it's and then on on top of that they were also dumping bitcoin which was the reserve collateral that these guys are holding so bitcoin's price starts to go down ust starts to break peg people start to panic a little bit and they also started withdrawing from so they did three things they took it out of anchor the savings protocol so you saw a billion dollars worth of whatever like withdrawals then you saw them sell it then you saw bitcoin price tanking and all of a sudden people started getting a little worried about oh [ __ ] is something bad happening to tara let me just go ahead and sell so more people start to sell and so you see like three four five billion dollars of sales happening in a very short period of time and this also coincidentally or very planned happened right when they were doing like a kind of like imagine you're like oh i'm just i'm moving houses right now i was like oh man the doors are open huh because you're the moving trucks outside so the doors are open that's basically what happened they were moving all the liquidity from the liquidity pool from one to another and so there wasn't much there was less shock absorbers than than you would expect when they started to sell it went from 100 over 100 to what what's it at now less than a penny like fractions of what yeah okay so how much value was wiped out 40 something billion dollars 48 billion that is crazy that is the stable coin went from selling so that's luna tara the stable coin the ust was selling at you know it's a dollar supposed to always be a dollar it goes 92 cents 85 cents so i'm i'm on the beach in hawaii and i'm just getting texts from ben yo tara's depending um and it's like and then it goes down to 70 cents then it shoots back up to 90 giving false hope for a second and then it plunges to 65 60 50 and i think it's currently trading i don't know 15 cents to the dollar so you're you're you're out 250 i'm at two yeah 225 something like that how does that feel uh i mean it feels shitty of course right like you know lose what did your wife say when you're sitting home she doesn't really care to know nor does she like want to know the details i told her i decided well from all of crypto i was like we lost several million million dollars in the last like three months because crypto's just been selling off like crazy and she's like okay so like i shouldn't buy this bag or i should i was like i think it's a shouldn't right now let's go ahead and hold off on that i was like that's the level of conversation we've had uh about the whole thing like she's not she's she stresses about micro stuff like if we have like a late fee or a parking ticket she'll freak out but on the big thing she's like very chill she's like but how do you feel about that now now that you've lost you said let's just say three million dollars like i guess a couple feelings the first was i'm not surprised like we went in pretty eyes wide open which was this is a risk-reward type bet and you don't just say that you have to like actually know what is the risk and the risk was always nobody's ever made algorithm stable coin work and by the way so one spoiler uh this guy doe quan turns out he was also the anonymous co-founder of basis that got leaked as well so it's like dude you know fool us all once you know shame on you fullest twice what the hell is wrong with you that's my take on it did he did he tweet out like i'm i'm sorry i'm a dick or like he's like look we didn't mean for this to happen obviously like i have no because some people are like dude did you did you benefit from this in some way like because that happens at crypto people like raise much money do much stuff and then like run away with the money his claim is no we didn't like we lost more than anyone on this whole thing i feel really bad that this happened and he's kind of just like you know tail between his legs a little bit and he's sulking and he's quieter he's much quieter now while everybody's like dancing on his grave deservedly so because he was cocky as hell right so like that's what's going on with him with me it's sort of like all right lost this money that's not good obviously but like you know doesn't feel good it's sort of jarring like i've had startup investments go south but it kind of happens over a longer period of time this is like you wake up on tuesday and like one of your best performing investments has gone to zero in 24 hours it's quite jarring to watch the price drop like a knife um and be pretty helpless like there's nothing you could really do about it partially because my lunar tokens were locked up and partially because i was away from my computer uh you know so you know whatever but you're you're not i would like i mean i would lose sleep over that i would be like almost almost not not quite scarred but like a little bit like it would almost be a it would be close to where i would describe it as traumatic yeah it's not that um for me and again i think it's because i i mean i write down whenever i do an investment here's my here's why i think this is a good investment and here's what could go wrong and the one could go wrong was exactly this which is like people think that there could be if if there was a bank run that this would death spiral i see no reason that this wouldn't despise if there's a bank run i don't know what would cause a bank run but it's possible and it's like oh what would cause a bank run was like either a motivated player created panic at a time when the project was vulnerable because all the all markets stock markets crypto markets are all down and they were moving the liquidity right so it's like well the risk kind of played out like that's okay like it's like you know it's like i've had pocket aces get cracked before and i i wouldn't even call luna pocket aces it's like i had a flush draw that got beat okay you know i like to use poker terms like i got a flashlight i got beat like that's what happens even if i was a even if i had a 60 chance of winning okay i got my money in good but like it wasn't my life savings now there's a lot of people who lost a lot more money on this because they put in a lot of money so to me there's also like a post-mortem of like okay there's some rules like you you don't put more than you know 15 in any one project because all of them have these like black swan risks and so you never want to be that vulnerable to any one thing is the majority of your net worth in crypto right now uh it was not until like everything cut not not including private like not including private businesses no of the liquid stuff no it's a little less than half now it's a little more than half before so you know but like the stock market also hasn't done great i don't know i haven't really done it i've lost so much i don't log into my thing anymore i i'm just i don't even look at it yeah for my i'm not gonna do it i'm not gonna go trade right now so you know for mental health purposes i don't go calculate my net worth when it's when it's so far down you know there is a good forcing function i'm like all right great let me make sure i'm earning money uh working hard right like it's very easy when when like over the last year year and a half let's say since the kind of covid uh you know money printing system i mean the whole 10 years has been a bull run or whatever but like the last year and a half like [ __ ] just inflated like crazy so it was like oh man do i even need to work like i just look up every day and i made a whole year's salary in a day like you know it's kind of demotivating to work and then this is highly motivating to work when you start losing a year's salary per day you know like that starts to uh you know like add up and so yeah i don't know like that's i guess my full reaction to it me too that's exactly mine as well it's like you just just make more money yeah yeah exactly this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform where everything is fully integrated well i can see the clients whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago i totally missed hubspot grow better uh all right well let me just look let me switch topics a little bit i want to tell you something that's kind of uh i think hilarious dude have you seen the liver king uh yeah the guy on instagram yeah i was doing something he's describing he said he's super jacked and he eats like this is not the same raw food guy right but he does eat like no a different one he's more than jacked he looks like the hulk like yeah he's like comically jacked yeah like it's like a funny like it looks like if you popped him with a pin he would blow up like a balloon like like you know what i mean like he looks swollen and uh uh he basically like his whole like shtick and i like research him a little bit is like um we aren't men anymore we're soy boys and like the best way to overcome that is to get as jacked as possible and live like a like a manly man right and so he's got like he's i think he lives in texas and he's got two kids and he like the whole family sleeps on like they don't use beds they like you basically like sleep on these like wood crates the floor basically they sleep on the floor because it's like it's kind of like where cavemen okay and i think he says that he eats like a pound a day of raw liver and there was a this is crazy [ __ ] the guy's crazy and he also says he doesn't do steroids which is like i i i went and tweeted about it and a lot of like people message me who i know who know him they're like obviously that's not true he definitely is on steroids and if you look at him you could just look at him be like you definitely are doing something anyway in a gq article he said that he was selling a hundred million dollars of liver supplements so basically these pills where it's like instead of like eating liver just swallow this pill right and i looked it up on amazon and i did a bunch of research and i think it's true i think it's 100 true i think that's how much he's selling in in these amazon uh supplements and he has his own store and he's associated with like three or four other different stores so he owns or uh co-owns this thing called heart and soil dot co which is all about like doing just only eating meat and fruit he owns this other thing called the fittest dot com which basically if you click at it's like hardcore propaganda i mean not necessarily negative but like what's interesting propaganda and like a mission statement and a brand but it says we were once the fittest version of ourselves descendants of the sole survivor species of the genius homo and he explains like you know like why we need to go back to things the product is called like honor this product has fundamentally supports for everyone and it it's like bone marrow and liver and then there's another one called fuel and then another one called ignite i mean just look at this picture look at this picture of this guy at the bottom he's just like this super swoll guy who you know those like chain links that are really really heavy that they used to like pull tires and stuff he's just got those around his neck and he's like grunting as he lifts the chain links with his neck right like it's crazy i can't even make fun of it because it's the most make it's it made fun of itself the most already yeah it's like a caricature of like what this lifestyle is about which i'm not like entirely against this lifestyle i just think it's hilarious is your lifestyle by the way what are you talking about no but this guy is kind of i think he's an idiot because he because i mean he's clearly doing something right and i understand he's like going extreme to sell more stuff which i'm not against but he's 100 on gear and he's saying that he's not so i think it's kind of that's kind of like this whole premise is based on kind of a lie uh but anyway he also i even found out someone at the agency that he hired so he hired an agency to get big on social media and he got to like 2 million followers in like 24 months like a very short amount of time and so anyway i thought this guy was interesting and i hadn't i wasn't sure if you had known about him very intriguing how many followers does he have on instagram does it say 1.5 million what do you think of his supplement sites does that look do those numbers see real you're saying that the um you're saying that the amazon no i'm saying all his empire does 100 million selling supplements on different platforms yeah it doesn't look like these are all his like he doesn't own all these maybe he's like an affiliate of some of these or something like in his twitter bio for example he just has his like ebook he doesn't even have like a site and then this heart and soil one like who are these guys uh our store he owns uh a percentage of that he owns a large percentage of that company as well isn't this crazy yeah so paul saladino md is the main guy this is the carnivore diet guy yeah yeah the carnivore md it's all these guys yeah that thing sounds like crazy yeah and and if you i dig some more research this liver king is in all the guy all that guy's photos and in his like on his about page and things like that this um heart and soil is a good it's a good brand they do a good job um i'm i'm gonna steal some of these ideas from my d2c brand they do some nice so this company it's called heart and soil and it's run by this guy named the carnivore md and he's popular on twitter and he's like a doctor who says like basically he only eats meat and fruit and i joined one of his facebook groups because i actually did the all meat thing for like 30 days i wanted to try and he's got like a 30 day challenge it was pretty fun and in the group i would post things like uh you know like is there any like what's a good book or like a seems like a good research that actually goes against this thing that shows that like all meat is actually not great and that you should eat you should be vegetarian yeah and they literally read good questions the premise yes they destroyed me and they were like they just ripped me off you [Laughter] they just ripped me apart and i was like uh okay so anyway this there is a little i've never been called the n word before but then i went to the carnivore group and i asked if meat's good for you dude they did not like me they didn't they they were upset at me so anyway i thought that it was kind of interesting it is a little bit of a cult but uh well okay this is like that this whole episode i think the the thread here is sort of like these extreme like these cult cult leaders um so the banana savannah banana guy he's basically creating like a cult right he's creating a brand with rituals and like members and like a whole thing thinks outside the box um the dokuan from tara luna and the lunatics they you know that was definitely a cult that oh that was their name the lunatics that's what like you know like you know like i like laser eyes for bitcoin luna luna that's a great brand yeah exactly lunatics yeah it was really good again the party was great tell it all okay until the cops showed up and uh and took everybody's money so you know that that was great um but you know my personal experience with that um you have this liver king guy i think he's one can i bring up one more and we'll just make this definitely i i i bet you i know who you're gonna say martin shkreli i am on board a little bit wait i'm i'm part of that cult we're all we're all just what are scrawling addicts or something i don't know what we were going to call ourselves but i think we should they should we should call ourselves the creeps yeah we're all creeps martin shkreli and the creeps he uh okay so i have kind of a backstory with this guy but just in general explain the explain the famous backstory okay so martin shkreli if you just google most hated man in america i think he comes up as number one at least he did at the time when i first heard about him he is known for or he's known and hated for uh being a kind of a price gouger with a drug so what he did was he owned a pharmaceutical company that focused on like small like less popular drugs that were like niche and he would and he bought them so he bought this bug this drug called daraprim and he increased the price from like thirteen dollars to like 500 something dollars i don't know what it was but the percent was like he increased it by five thousand percent and so people and then immediately the news picked this up was like oh man and they started calling him the pharma bro because first he did this they were like how dare you but instead of apologizing and walking it back he was like [ __ ] yeah i did i own this i could charge what i want you know like and and like this is america that's the price of this drug and uh yeah i double down he doubled down and he loves attention and he's amazing at getting attention a lot of the attention is hate but he's amazing at getting it but and he was only 33 34 when he did this and this was basically he controlled two pharmaceutical companies that were each public at north of a billion in market cap i think i don't know i don't know i can't i can't confirm those that might that might be right but he also had a hedge fund before that where he invested in biotech stocks yeah just like he had done big things and he was he's a very smart guy now people think he's a crook so some people said he was a crook because he raised the price of the drug that's not a crime that's just something you don't like then he actually got indicted and went to jail for doing something that was uh legal which i think was like he basically paid investors from one company with like the stock of his other company and then like didn't wasn't clear or something like that i don't know exactly what he went to jail for because there's any way for two he went back to jail or his like like he didn't get released early or something like that for threatening hillary clinton he didn't really threaten her but he like made like a like a stupid joke on twitter yeah uh yeah anyway so he he just got out last week that's kind of the funny part of this so he gets out and uh it's like you know i don't know who's like a famous person that like everybody wanted to be freed it's like a free young thug or whoever like martha stewart yeah free martha like whatever there was a group of people that were excited about his his arrival i was excited too because i enjoy reality tv i enjoy you know the drama he's like our version of kim he's he's our kim k he's that's exactly what he is exactly so i wanted to see a plow and so he comes back and i just started thinking about shkreli in general so i have a couple ways we can go we can go of things i find very interesting slash borderline admire about the way he does things and then there's what he has been up to in prison and what's interesting there where do you want to go i have both i like both of those so what has he been up up to in prison and the back story you you actually need to mention this the back story was he was an early user of your product blab and i spoke to him a couple times on blab and when the hustle first launched we were in our first office so this was in the first six months we um one of our reporters was this young woman named brina who was you know like a pretty uh like a good-looking woman and he she dm'd him for a story and he was like hey do you just want to like fly up here and we could like hang out and like he was like asking her out and uh so i had i have a little interaction with them as well so we yeah we had a app called blab that was basically if you've seen clubhouse it was clubhouse before clubhouse and it had video on it um so it wasn't just audio and uh it got sort of popular except you know we tried using it we tried getting podcasters to use it we we got some kind of like marketers to use it for their kind of like promoting their stuff when we started getting some bigger brands the nba started using it ufc started using it oracle but none of them could hold a candle to our number one power user martin shkreli martin shkreli came on the app and basically broke the app from day one first time he came on instantly the room filled up to like 5 000 people and it was more people that we had ever had in one room before that hit our max limit we were like who is this guy that's when i first googled and found he's the most hated man in america and um he was famous enough to draw a ton of people in but he was not famous enough to have other [ __ ] to do which was the perfect sweet spot which as i said he is the most lethal weapon in social media uh he has since been surpassed by donald trump and elon musk as the most lethal weapon in social media but before that it was martin shkreli and the reason i say that is because um he creates a ton of content so he would go on blab every day from about 5 p.m till 2 in the morning he would be on that whole time um and he was the master at creating nightly entertainment like you know jimmy fallon jay leno you guys can't touch this guy in terms of nightly entertainment because he has no producers no script no nothing he would hop on and somehow or another he would cause enough ruckus that this room would have thousands of people in it all night long watching it they were hooked to it and we would see this in our data like people wanted us to kick him off because again he's a bad guy for raising the price of this drug and like he said this thing that wasn't cool but this guy was driving in hundreds of thousands of new users to us every single month and so i was like i'm not trying to kick this guy off like this guy's like you know he's where the action's at um this was a 2017-2018 canceled culture wasn't a thing yet yeah and i was like dude i'm a startup i'm gonna do what it takes to get off the ground like yeah bitcoin used the silk road to like get off the ground and like you know youtube started as a dating site and facebook you know before this he did face mash comparing like which girl's hotter like okay not everything starts with like the most like clean cut you know i think airbnb started by like faking and scraping you know craigslist sites and you know emailing them as fake people saying i'd love to book your thing can you just list on airbnb like dude people do what they have to do to get your project started started and so we had shkreli and i used to watch at first what i noticed was everybody who came in came in to throw stones at this evil man who raised the price of this drug but he did not sit there and apologize or whimper he like fought back and he would give his side of the argument he would invite you up for a debate and that's when you saw how how strongly held opinions could be with no logical backing with no real rationale behind it the argument was so hollow and this was not just like average people uh people who were like very successful business people come on trying to like kind of um stand on their head you know be on their high horse uh you know telling him what he should do and then he would like dismantle their argument journalists from cnn and other places would come on he would dismantle them um and he's doing a combination of like a making fun of them b hitting on them and c breaking down their logical arguments all at the same time i've never seen anything like it and i just thought wow this guy is very entertaining i don't agree with everything he's saying but i think he's very entertaining and the data doesn't lie he is very entertaining he he's and i think later on later on in some of the blabs he would have like these like cute women in the background and they like clearly i just met him on blab and he was just like hey i'll fly you out you want to hang out this is what started happening everybody started off hating him so after about three weeks he developed an army of believers of people who were there's a guy who became creeps yeah the creeps and so this guy came on his name was young shkreli and he and when martin was tired or had to go eat young shrilly would go hold court and he would just be like an extreme knockoff version of martin and he would just hold court defending him until martin came back to defend himself and then all these women started joining and they loved him and they would just hang out there all the time and they were like when they were not like cam girls or model they were like actual models fashion models cam girls only fans people whoever and they would get on and they would just be like you know martin just like i don't know i would date you and they would just get on and they were so the room was always filled with like his posse and it was like you go to like you know where a mob lord is that and he's got his goons and he had his goons dude and his army was just growing by within a couple months the number of people who loved him outweighed the number of people who hated him and it was like the most surprising thing it was like watching a cult form in real time it was fascinating and i remember the cnn journalist came on and she was like martin i you know i know everybody kind of you know attacks you but i don't want to attack you i just want to ask you some questions he's like well you're on my show let's go she's like no no i want you to come on cnn he's like this is better than cnn he's like you're on my show you have questions let's go these are my terms you can ask any question you want no holds barred right here right now and if you're not prepared come back and prepare but you could do it right here on my show and she's like i'm not gonna do that martin i can only do it there he's like and he's like he's like all right fine come with me to my fundraiser gala tonight i'll fly you out he bought it goes a screen share he buys her a plane ticket and like he's like what's your email address i'm sending this to you and she's like i'm not going on a date with you martin and he's like who said it to date uh he's like you know he's just playing people perfectly didn't didn't they didn't she end up quitting one of the one of the women who hollered at him from washington post ended up quitting the job and so this is part of what's remarkable when he goes to jail this woman from washbow or someplace is assigned to cover him or cover the story falls in love with him breaks up like she has a family she has a husband kids i think leaves them for martin falls in love with martin while he's in prison and then martin breaks her heart and she's heartbroken now and like you know whatever she gave it all up she gave up her career and her family for martin and fell in love with him this guy's got some cult leader [ __ ] to him so anyways he did some crazy stuff when he was on blab like he would he was so loyal to his army that he'd be like i'm i got a date tonight but don't worry i'm leaving blab on so he would leave it on in the other room and you could eavesdrop and overhear his date which is again oh my god prime time entertainment is it wrong yeah is it entertaining yeah it is and so this guy was phenomenal anyway so i found this guy interesting he would also do things so like from a marketing perspective i was observing how is this guy staying relevant like that drug [ __ ] was years ago like what how is he staying relevant he would just do stuff so like wu-tang clan had an album that they were selling like a one-of-one for their biggest fans he bought it for two million dollars so now this guy that they didn't want so they even got a feud with him he had this thing and then on blab he would play like snippets like 10 seconds of the album and no one's ever heard it before besides him but he would just like tease it dangle it um like the original nft when um there was like some building for sale in times square he tried to buy it for 10 million dollars to like erect a statue of himself in times square and again it gets covered so he was just newsjacking constantly he was just hijacking the dudes and putting his own money did he have money when he got arrested or like because i think he was actually like he they he showed a brokerage account that had like 70 million dollars in it yeah i think he had like somewhere between 50 and 75 million dollars if i remember at the time but then he like had to declare bankruptcy yeah and i think at one point ironically his attorney that was defending him raised his price by five thousand percent and started charging him sixty thousand dollars per hour and like i don't know if this is real or not but martin came out the news was like this is outrageous and like people are like dude the irony you know pot calling the kettle black i was like of course this is just another article he wanted written about him and like he's just a master of getting attention he did so many things like this i can't even count the number of things he did like this i was like wow this guy just knows how to stay in the cycle and i constantly like reinvent himself because then he would like just when he pushes you away he'd lure you back in so like for example on saturday friday nights he would hold like you know his nightly blab thing where he's at thousands of people and it's like a roast session and he's saying outlandish [ __ ] and like you just feel yucky for being in there and then saturday morning he would wake up at eight in the morning and he would do a live finance like session where he would teach you how to analyze stocks and it was great phenomenal and i watched a bunch of them they're still on youtube you can go watch them he is so he's very smart and he was so thoughtful and patient as a teacher he's a he's a fantastic teacher and so anyway so that's like the backstory so anyways he gets out and he said they're like how's prison right he immediately he gets out he immediately jumps on um on twitter spaces oh by the way actually that's another funny story when he had to go speak in front of congress or yeah congress i guess he had to go testify um he goes there and he just with a smug look kept saying like i i will take the fifth amendment you know i choose to elect my my fifth amendment well rights to not speak he just said that on loop for an hour but he was smiling he was smugly smiling and just pissing them off and he was drawing the whole time and then he gets as soon as he left the record he jumped on blab from his phone on the train and he goes all right who wants to see my drawings he shows his drawings of like dicks and stuff like that that he was drawing on his piece of paper and he's live the the hearing was still going on and he embedded it in one screen and he was just talking mad [ __ ] about the congress people in the other screen at the same time again it was just like high level social media usage so anyways he got on twitter spaces and they're like how was prison he goes oh it was awesome he's like he's talking about the prison system and like how unjust it is and how you know he's like you know 95 of the people that were in there um you know had like traumatic childhood issues with parents and stuff like that he's like i hustled out like other people's lockers you know where i so i could store more books and um and he's like he basically was like so what was his like summary stuff so first he's been blogging have you read his blog from prison no but what did he say about prison he was he i mean i bet you he was actually well respected there yeah he's like everyone's like tell me some stories yeah exactly um and so he yeah he was kind of like you know had his his crew there or whatever he said he created um a crypto study group um so he what did he say he goes um he goes when everybody else was working out in prison i would read because brain gains are all that matters not muscle gains because he's like oh my god he's like i created a group called crypto thugs in prison and it was just me teaching crypto to um to the rest of my like my fellow like inmates or whatever and he had a bunch of like interesting stuff so um he had a bunch of predictions about crypto that were in there a bunch of he read he basically spent his whole time studying about crypto and artificial intelligence um and like biohacking and stuff like that so he's got this blog post with a [ __ ] ton of predictions about the future um i'll i'll read you a couple of his i'm on his blog it's just it's martinskewelly.com right uh yeah i think so so um let me read you some predictions on here so 2025 so about three years from now self-driving cars are the successor to mobile computing they trend upwards people spend eight hours a day in your car um tesla nears 10 trillion market cap musk becomes the first trillionaire 2026 an ai generated maybe for song gets created with zero human editing and direct participation and charts on billboard uh 2013 or 2030. um virtual reality slash metaverse is ubiquitous widely used all you needed was a comfortable ergonomic optical interface that's what was the limiting item i think he's uh wrong on that one 2030 vehicles uh self-driving cars reached majority penetration in the u.s car accidents dropped by more than 50 percent and he just keeps going he goes out to like 2050 he's making predictions as to things like you know 2050 lifespan for a newborn is now 100 to 125. 90 of non-surgical medicine is automated um blah blah blah like most contract law is automated on as automated on chain and so he keeps going now right or wrong you could disagree with all these but he's just a very interesting thinker a very interesting guy you follow right and he does these book reviews that are like very hilarious where he's like this book three out of five uh you know first three fourths giant waste of time last fourth interesting about this topic it's like oh good like you saved me much time reading that book like i kind of trust your opinion on these things um and so i don't know his blog is worth a read we uh i i tweeted out asked to get him on the pod but i had no twitter handle to tag i didn't know who he was or you know which it was kind of hidden we maybe found the right one um yeah but we uh we should get him on i feel like we're big enough that we can get him and he's an interesting guy enough he's a he's um i don't like giving our audience like our platform to people who i think are full of [ __ ] like for example jordan belfort i wouldn't want i wouldn't want him on dude i would would you yeah it's the same remember people were like oh i can't believe you guys had tai lopez on it's like well well dude there's a scale would i want to talk to this person that's the test if i would want to talk to this person that means they're interesting just because you're on the podcast doesn't mean we say this person is awesome and legit i agree but i don't want to endorse certain things and maybe like well how are we endorsing yeah i don't know but this is like you don't wrestle with this at all no i actually find that stupid they people do this to joe rogan others as well jack why would you give him the platform to say his like stupid stuff it's like dude i'm gonna i'm gonna have a conversation with him or the he or she and because they're interesting to me i'm gonna find out maybe they're you know i'm gonna find out what they have to say if they say something silly or stupid i'm gonna try to push back and give my point of view and the listeners should be smart enough to come to their own opinion about things and in fact you know the right way to like the right way to make somebody the right way to like counteract like speech you disagree with is not to suppress it but to like enable enable bring it to light right like put the sun is the best disinfectant type of thing like bring it to light and then let people make an informed decision off of what they heard and um you know well i i i i i would really forcing at all just to have someone on the podcast i'm on board with that i and admittedly i'm wrestling with how i my opinion on it like do you think they should give a bad wolf of wall street because jordan belfort is a bad guy like no he'll know no but i don't want to and they glorified it dude they put leo dicaprio i actually don't i i like by myself watching that movie i'm like you know i don't want to watch this this guy was a piece of [ __ ] he's robbed a quarter of a billion dollars from people and yeah i'm watching this movie and i'm like oh i want to be like that so i like find myself not wanting to watch it but what i was saying was martin shkreli is the type of guy who i actually don't agree with probably a bunch of the stuff that he's done but i'm not convinced that he's like an evil guy i'm i think that he's just a weirdo and like when he was smiling at congress i was like oh i i actually think you're just weird and you just don't know how to interact with people i don't i don't i i i you know what i mean he knew what he was doing he's a troll i think he's a troll but i don't i think it comes from a place if he's just really awkward not necessarily of like he's a horrible guy yeah i don't know horrible guy people come up with their own conclusion you know i've seen a lot of people say he's a horrible guy you say why oh because he raised the price of the drug why is that bad because then people can't afford it well you actually know that insurance pays for 98 of it and then he gave away the other two percent if you couldn't afford it through insurance he just gave it to you yeah but then insurance costs go up cool well then you should have a problem with like these 15 other things like you know also if these drugs are not like valuable then there's no research for these niche diseases so that's why a lot of these diseases just don't have any r d budget because there's no value in them so which is proof that his biggest crime is having a punchable face exactly exactly you know what i mean like and that's a real thing and uh he was very dislikeable he's dislikeable because he trolls and he's rude to people and he makes fun of things and he like yeah okay cool but that's not a crime you know but i would love to i would love to have him and him on and talk to him because he's the type of guy i don't think he's a liar shrill we want to do an episode this is our open invitation i hope this gets back to you i'm the guy who made blab we spent many many hours together in a way on that platform uh whenever we were getting ddosed it was because of you i put up with that [ __ ] so uh you know give us one give us a solid and come on the pod so we'll uh we'll have to attack him wait is that twitter thing i think that's a speaker yeah but is that a secret no because he was in the twitter spaces under that okay all right so that'd be cool yeah [Music] you

[Music] what's up y'all sean here sam is in europe traveling around with the fam and uh so i'm on my own today and i wanted to do something cool and i think i got a great idea so i believe here's my guess i think this pod is going to be one that people really really like because i know i would have wanted to hear this at some point in time and the reason why is because most of the people who listen to this podcast are some form of leadership right you might have started your own company or your own business uh you might be kind of an exact somewhere or a manager somewhere or you want to be a leader right so most people who don't want to be leaders are not listening to a podcast like this so the problem is me and everybody else sucks you know everybody sucks the first time that they are managing people and um and this isn't like you know how to manage people 101 there's a lot of books that are written about this there's some best practices there's common sense but i wanted to share some of the unorthodox some of the weird things that i do that i have found work for me and they might not work for everybody but they work for me and not all of these people are going to agree with not all of these will work for you but again they all work for me nobody i couldn't find any of this stuff in a book i heard about these either from somebody or i just kind of made it up on my own and so i think i have five maybe six different things that i do that are unorthodox but work okay so let me start with number one and this is called dr house or it's inspired by dr house so if anybody watches the tv show house he always does this thing the show is like there's this genius doctor uh but he's kind of like a curmudgeon and um all the other doctors really respect him because he's amazing but uh he's kind of hard to work with one of the things he does that's amazing but hard to work with is he has these like three junior doctors who are kind of like he's i don't know advising them or whatever they work under him and when a patient comes in and they run a test to try to figure out what's wrong with the person he doesn't just look at it and say here's what's wrong with the person right first of all it's usually not that straightforward second of all even if he kind of has an idea he doesn't spoon feed it to his um to his team instead he will usually slap the the res the the like maybe the scan or the data or the the x-ray or whatever up on a screen and he'll say what do you see here or he'll say what's weird about this or he'll say what's interesting about this and then the team has to start thinking and getting curious and looking at the thing and saying well there must be something there what do i see and this is really effective i do this all the time i will take let's say some data i'm looking at when i'm curious about something i see something that makes me go hmm and what i used to do is i used to just like share that with the team hey guys here's what i found look at this data this data shows that a is b and c right i would like give them a conclusion i'm basically spoon feeding them an answer they'd read it they'd say yeah that makes sense and then they would go on with their day right because they didn't have to struggle to understand it they didn't have to be curious enough to go find it they just got spoon-fed an answer and they say yeah yeah i'm not surprised by that all right i'm gonna move on or oh that's weird okay sounds like you got to answer i'm gonna again move on so i do it the other way which does three things one it trains the team to be curious and clever right because you're not looking for some luck i'm not telling you to go do ten more analyses i'm saying there's something in this what is it it's a little bit of a riddle the second is it's not a gotcha right like i'm genuinely asking because they will see things that you don't see so even if you saw one interesting thing they might find two others that you didn't really appreciate and the last is it trains everybody on how to because you know maybe one person out of the group will see the interesting thing but the other four will say why didn't i see that and that trial and error that like guess and check is how people get better at stuff so you'll train a team of curious clever people who get good at finding insights in data and so that's the dr house technique i recommend you try it rather than spoon feeding your team answers okay the second one i learned from my wife my wife was a consultant and she used to go to these companies and i was like it was always like i'm getting alignment right she would go it would be a board meeting of like you know yahoo's board meeting it's like you have 10 executives at yahoo and they cannot you know they all think they're on the same page and then only when you ask them certain questions do you realize that like everybody has like a different you know game plan vision of what we're trying to do here et cetera et cetera so she got good at sussing that out but people are a little bit um not defensive but they're a little bit limited when you just ask them very literal logical questions that tap into only the analytical part of their brain like if you say what are our three key objectives for the year they sort of feels like they're taking a math test and so she does this thing that was called the holiday party the holiday party tactic is she had me go she had to go to a whiteboard and she goes all right let's fast forward it's christmas eve um of this year and we're at the company holiday party i want you to start drawing what's at the company holiday party i'm like what do you mean she's like just draw things that would make it an awesome company holiday party so i'm like okay so all of a sudden i'm having kind of fun i'm something creative i'm drawing i'm just thinking of cool [ __ ] that could be at a party right so my guard is down and so you know i'll draw like whatever there's a dj and i we kind of laugh because the dj booth is like you know my drawing is bad and then i'll draw the next thing and then she'll say okay what's on the screen what are you celebrating and that question what are we celebrating is like that's kind of like what are we trying to do this year right what's the milestone that we hit and instead of saying what are we trying to do it's assuming it's already done that we're already celebrating we're popping bottles because we hit 1 million users or 10 million downloads or 100 million in revenue whatever it is and so it's you know we'd say our big north star goal because it's like that screen can only have one big thing on it that we're all cheering our glass to so what is that north star metric and then she would say cool let's walk around like you know who's at this party and you know there's a little exercise and as she unfolded this party it kind of rev at first it got me in the mood for winning right because it's like i'm already working backwards from the assumption that we've won then i identify the north star goal and then after we do that little game it only takes two minutes then we would say all right uh so how are we going to get there right what would be the things that we would need to do now so that that party happens and all of a sudden we're we're talking and brainstorming from a place of certainty and confidence rather than fear and doubt about not being able to pull it off and the stress right because when you're in fight fight-or-flight your brain only works in a very limited capacity compared to when you are you know at ease relaxed which is why you know great ideas come to you in the shower because you're you're relaxed you have warm water pouring on top of your head and so your brain kind of melts away and can start to you know put together different data points that uh that are not there when you're tense and so i love this tactic of the holiday party drawing game it really loosens people up it gets them thinking it focuses them on the north star goal and then when you make a plan after that they go into that plan from in a state of mind of we already won okay now here's the opposite this is called the um the misery misery loves company tactic okay so whenever we're making a plan at the beginning of any plan everything seems achievable and um everyone's optimistic and it's hard to say it's one thing to ask somebody what are the key risks in this and then people you know again they get a little defensive they use the logical part of your brain so a better question is you know if i was to um let's say you know we you go do this i go do my thing and we get busy and you know six months from now 12 months from now we we catch back up we're getting a beer here at the local pub in the afternoon it's four in the afternoon we go grab a beer and we say man that idea was so cool let's assume it went wrong right so man that idea was so cool i can't believe it didn't work out now what happened what is the what is the most likely reason we would give that things went south and this is a way to identify the core risk the chief assumption the riskiest proposition in your plan is to sort of work backwards from we're getting a beer we're hanging out it's already failed and we say man that thing had so much potential what went wrong what do you think is the number one reason it might go wrong and then because you're identifying that up front you can now like work against that you can get you can game plan around that okay here's another one i find that people get very defensive about the status quo especially the leaders because as a leader you're sort of responsible for the way that the company works right you're responding like uh you're responsible for how many people work at your company right uh if i said did you hire too many people most people don't want to say yes and the reality is that certainly i don't know 20 30 40 of the time the answer truly is yes you've hired too many people but if you ask ceos they'll rarely ever say yes and in the same way you'll say are you working on a bunch of useless stuff or are you working on a bunch of extraneous things they would say no i mean these are all important they're valuable right so people get defensive about their current plan and so how do you get how do you get people to uh to identify the fat in their their plan right be able to trim the fat without the pressure and the stress of them feeling like they're wrong or they're being blamed or that they're gonna have to make some tough decisions have some hard conversations and because of that they just want to avoid it so here's what i do we play a game it's sort of like that you know that f murder mary game right where you decide you know if out of these three choices who would you who would you murder who would you marry who would you have so um similarly let's just focus on the murder part which is like if i asked you right so i could sit down with with any manager in my company i could say in your team if you i know you love your team and i know they're they're all great they're all great in their own ways but if you had to do it what would be the three who would be the three people that you would cut if you had to cut i'm not saying you will where you're not going to cut anybody but who would those three people be similarly like out of all the projects that initiatives are doing what are the three that you would cut if you had to cut three initiatives off which ones would go um you could do this with anything right customers of all your customers on the roster your clients who are the three that you would cut where they're just a pain in the ass it's not worth the juice is not worth the squeeze and if you can create a safe a safe space basically where somebody can freely identify what they would cut if they were gonna cut but don't worry we're not asking you to cut anything uh and you do it yourself right you're not just asking others to do this but you do it yourself and you think aloud maybe do it as a group like hey what would we what projects would we cut you know which team members are really not you know are at the bottom right there certainly is a top at the bottom who is that right which customers are the top and the bottom and if you can identify those it plants a seed and people once they've said it out loud they've heard a truth it's very hard to unsee a truth and it might be a month later or two months later or three months later but eventually they will decide to trim some of the fat either on their team their projects or their client list that will help the team grow so that's the f murder mary tactic okay i think i've done what is that uh four tactics okay let's do another one this is the superpower one so this is a way to build people up so i did this at my last startup and people really resonated with this which is i made a presentation about each person in the team i did this on a friday afternoon i said hey guys let's go do a little happy hour and i said i got a presentation for you guys i said you know i've learned that in any team you can you can look for two types of people you can look for people who lack weaknesses meaning they're pretty well-rounded they have no fatal flaws but they may not be great at anything right they're they're just good they're at least good at everything or you can have some people that are amazing at some things and kind of weak in other areas and i've learned that the the best performing teams are filled with people who are amazing in at least one area so you're hiring for an extreme strength not a lack of weakness right that's an andreessen horowitz uh framework that i really loved and so i said i'd like to you know i said but the funny thing is for most people they don't they're not even aware of what their extreme strength is and um because you're too close too it's so normal for you to be great at it you don't even really realize you're great at it at some point it's other people who point it out so i'd like to point out for you the superpower that i've seen each of you have and then i would give and so i put each person's uh face on a slide i would say hey this is like for example hey this is derek derek's our designer derek what i've noticed is your superpower i don't know if you're aware of this but most designers that i've worked with they're creative types they're sort of like you know messy desk procrastinator types they pull all-nighters when they get creative inspiration and they do amazing work sometimes and other times you know they get stuck with sort of a creative writer's block of sorts i said derek your superpower is that you're a great designer but you're like the mailman you deliver every day at the same time right like i give you the the brief i scribble a um a scribble a poorly written address of where where i'm trying to get this package and you're able to interpret it like a mailman and say oh i know where this is trying to go and then you deliver it every day at 5 00 pm before you leave and i said i you're like the mailman i said and you know you don't work on the weekends i know that you're not the type of guy that i should be hitting up for that like that crazy project we're gonna do on the weekend so you're like the mailman you deliver every day of the week except for sundays and so i gave them basically a superpower which is you have this amazing ability to consistently take a loose set of instructions and deliver on it and i gave him a nickname that goes with it that's why i call you the mailman and then yeah that's your superpower and i gave it a little symbol and then i like you know then went to the next person i said oh this is fur con vercon is uh you know he's not gonna win any awards for for being the most eloquent speaker or the the most politically um you know polished kind of guy but man when i when you talk to fur khan it's almost like he's allergic to [ __ ] like you know when someone's allergic to peanuts you can't even have a peanut dish you feel uncomfortable taking peanuts around them because you might kill them i said that's what it's like when i bring [ __ ] around you i don't even feel comfortable saying [ __ ] around you because you're so good at seeing through [ __ ] and saying that doesn't make sense or wait i thought you said this other thing so how how could both of those be true right and so i you know you were like um you're allergic to [ __ ] that is your superpower you just can't stand it and that because of that it makes the rest of us up our game and not bring that bring half-baked plans or incongruent illogical plans to you because you'll sniff it out in a second and the beautiful thing is these things are both true and aspirational meaning they are this way but by giving it their superpower they then want to live up to that identity you've given them and so you can kind of architect the type of team you want by calling out areas they're good but they not may not be the best at it or they may not be doing it all the time but by giving them their superpower they will start to do it more often okay so that's the superpower technique um okay i'm gonna give you three quick ones the tesla master plan if you've never read it elon musk wrote a master plan for tesla um you know back when it started so he wrote the master plan v1 like 10 years ago and then he wrote v2 and basically he said master plan v1 basically was like you should go read it i've hand written his many times and then wrote ours wrote my own plan for my own business after writing his and so his plan basically says tesla's job is to accelerate you know the um the society's move off of fossil fuels onto sustainable energy to do that we need to create a car that's high performance and high efficiency and so we're going to start with the roadster the expensive car then we're going to make the next car then we're going to make the the mass market model 3 car blah blah blah and he's like you know so in summary here's the master plan build an expensive car to build the brand build a less expensive car to get more people on it then build the use the economies of scale and the learnings from production to build a mass-market car that will get to everybody right that's the master plan um and then he wrote a mastermind v2 but it is very powerful if you can write the master plan for your company all right it's basically any and it doesn't have to be right right but it's you putting it out there what are we here to do how do we plan to do it and like you know here's the takeaway and if you look at his writing style it's very empowering style and so i like to take his master plan and then write my own all right the next one uh comes from the ceo coach called matt makari or something like that he has this technique called the calendar audit which is very simple imagine you print out your calendar from the last week and you look at every every meeting that was scheduled every kind of block of time that you used and you take three highlighters you take a green highlighter that says that was something that i enjoyed that gave me energy you highlight those in green then you take a red highlighter you say these ones that i highlight in red are the ones that i felt like my soul was being sucked out of my body right like these are the soul crushing energy draining things that i dread parts things of my day that i don't look forward to you put those in red and then you have the yellow that are like neutral and you look at that and then you say okay this is an audit i now need to take these red things and i need to figure out over time how i'm going to get more green than red right how i'm going to phase all the red away and get to only green and that might be hiring somebody who doesn't who likes doing that thing because what's red for you might be green for them or just getting rid of it or minimizing the time you do it and saying do we really need three meetings for this could we not just do it in one could this meeting be an email right or whatever so a calendar audit is a very valuable technique okay so that was so so far we've had number one the doctor house screenshot technique number two my wife's holiday party work backwards question number three the if we got a beer saying you know saying man it's a bummer that thing failed why did it fail right that's number three number four is creating a safe space for the f murder mary game right who who are the three that you would double down on who are the three that you would cut three is just a magic number it might be three thousand for you i don't know whatever it doesn't the number doesn't matter same idea what are the bottom 20 of things what are the top 20 of things is what you're trying to identify and with the promise of we're not taking an action on this right now uh so that's what four yeah that's four number five was tell each person their superpower and give it to your team as a presentation they will live up to that reputation number six is the tesla master plan number seven is the calendar audit okay i'm gonna do two more maybe three um number eight is peer groups so anytime i have an objective like let's say i wanna become uh you know a great poker player or i want to get to 100 000 twitter followers or i want to build a dvc brand that does 50 million dollars a year i will create a text chat group of five other people who have were in the same kind of ballpark as me of where they're at now and have that same ambition as their top ambition uh mentors and advisors overrated peer group underrated and so that's what i would do and i would start by texting them and then i would do like a once a month kind of call where we could spend three hours on the phone or in person hanging out shooting the [ __ ] together sharing tactics and strategies what's working for them and trying to achieve your mutually shared goal okay last one is the kickoff document i think this is number nine a kickoff document is a template that i have and i could share this but uh if you subscribe to my newsletter i think you get it so just go to seanpuri.com and um and i think you can get it uh or if not just email me at sean shampoo.com okay so the kickoff document is basically something i do before i start a project because i believe that clarity is power and i think too often people go into doing something without actually being clear of what are we trying to do here why are we trying to do it how will we measure success and what's the first thing that we should really do and that's what a kickoff document does so the kickoff dock has three sections the first is what are we trying to do it's one liner the next is what's a win look like and i define a win in two ways i say what's the floor of this win meaning what is the minimum that i would consider like a successful good outcome like what's an achievable thing and then what's the f yeah win which is the like the the result that would make me safe f yeah then that really worked and so now i get kind of like a range i have like the bottom goal my floor goal and then i have my my stretch goal and um and then i also do an anti-goal meaning what are some traps that i could fall into along the way that would like make this whole thing even if i hit my goals i would feel bad at the end of it because i like did this other thing right like for example we all have these in life like uh you know i would love to um be successful but i don't want to you know screw over people along the way and carry that guilt with me right so that's a like being successful financially would be your goal i mean you'd put some numbers around it but then your anti goal would be i don't want to do this in a way that makes me feel unethical or ashamed in any way of what i did i'd like to feel proud of it right so those become your anti-goals or like you know i'd like to be successful but i want to be able to make sure i'm home with my kids every day at five because that's really important to me so an anti-goal would be yeah i made it happen but i'm never home right so my anti goal would be you know never getting home before you know next time and so it's important to identify your anti-goals they're very clarifying for you um and the kickoff doc ends with one hour or your power hour basically like what's something i could do in the next hour that would just get like create like momentum uh get me to a win and so this is not like do some research or make a list it's like get momentum towards the actual outcome so if i want to you know increase sales that's like make a sale make one sale or like if i wanted to grow my list my email list it's like i don't know post a thread on twitter in the next hour that will get some subscribers to my list just something to get the ball rolling that's action oriented so you're not just always in planning mode so those are nine different little tips and tricks that uh really work for me that i don't think you'll learn most of those and i don't know business school or you know at your job that peop you know even if people try to do management training it's usually not things like this uh these are my kind of like you know unorthodox pet tricks that i like to do that help me you know with my companies and so i hope that's helpful for you if it is let me know you can tweet it at me at shaun vp if it's not helpful tweeted me saying hey you know wasn't that helpful honest feedback i love honest feedback so either way works for me i'm at seanvp which is s-h-a-a-n-v-p on twitter all right [Music] you
